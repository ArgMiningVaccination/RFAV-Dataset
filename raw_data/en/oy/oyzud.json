CRM No 5\u20142001 2 Katherine H. Stevenson Heritage Under the Ethnographic Lens Our national record of accom\u00ad plishments is impressive in highlighting our tangible cul\u00ad tural heritage\u2014historic and prehistoric sites, structures, objects and land\u00ad scapes. Thanks to concerned stakeholders and legislation, including the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, federal agencies along with states, local communities, and, increasingly, American Indian tribes, have been formally recognizing the culturally mean\u00ad ingful places that configure their landscapes. The complex process of identifying, documenting, and protecting heritage resources requires varied specialists; and cultural anthropologists, or ethnographers, are increasingly among them, joining their colleagues in archeology, architec\u00ad ture, history, landscape architecture, and commu\u00ad nity and tribal members as well. Cultural anthropologists are relative new\u00ad comers to \"historic preservation,\" but not and \"community,\" which are among anthropology's defining concepts. Uniquely qualified by education, experience, and interest, anthropologists focus a fine lens on diverse peoples and concerns. As this issue of CRMdemonstrates, anthropologists working col\u00ad laboratively with local peoples identify culturally meaningful places from the traditional users' per\u00ad spectives. Places vary from once-viable but now nearly \"invisible\" communities and landscapes such as the African-American Fazendeville, to ceremonially important natural features at Canyon de Chelly, or culturally defined resources with traditional subsistence use in the subarctic or arctic. Even minor structures become replete with meaning once ethnography reveals their tra\u00ad ditional value. The intimate links between cul\u00ad tural and natural heritages are made evident in the analysis of heirloom plants and the indige\u00ad nous ethnobotanical knowledge that lends sup\u00ad port to their propagation. Without appropriate documentation, a panoply of cultural knowledge that undergirds communities, like that of Micronesian craftspeople, is at risk. It is hearten\u00ad ing to learn of community-based preservation efforts, for example, by Olympic Peninsula tribes and Palauan elders and traditional historians who are documenting their own heritage. Further benefits of ethnographic scrutiny are insights into the effects of tourism on indigenous cultures, and the multiple meanings assigned to World War II memorials by visitors of different ages, nationali\u00ad ties, and ethnicities. Ethnography also helps us avoid being simplistic about cultural diversity by showing that people who share a common lan\u00ad guage are not culturally interchangeable. Multiplicity also becomes apparent in landscapes that ethnographically resonate with the complex values imposed by culturally different peoples. Preservation groups and institutions, including the National Park Service, have already taken important steps in protecting vernacular rural and urban resources and actively involving people of color in heritage programs. More is needed. Greater inclusiveness would draw atten\u00ad tion to the fuller spectrum of heritage resources that includes natural features as well as the con\u00ad structed, and places of work as well as birthplaces of the famous. Inclusiveness would illuminate the sometimes hidden contributions to nation-build\u00ad ing made by a great array of peoples. The ethno\u00ad graphic task in preservation is to reveal the cul\u00ad tural context of tangible heritage and the evi\u00ad dence of culture's many intangible forms. This is likely to have a positive feedback, especially if we recall that the skills, products, and exchanges of culturally different people are themselves the raw material of a future heritage. We know that bio\u00ad logical diversity and a healthy biosphere depend on interacting healthy and genetically different living materials. The same principle works with cultural heritage; diversity promotes more diver\u00ad sity. The survival of a richly textured national heritage requires the constant production and celebration of cultural differences because they create the complex fabric of ideas, skills, and tra\u00ad ditions that help fashion future cultures as well as contribute to our common nationhood.

CRM No 5\u20142001 3 Muriel (Miki) Crespi Raising Muted Voices and Identifying Invisible Resources The \"Big House\" at Oakland Plantation, Cane River Creole National Historical Park. Occupied until recently by French Creole descendants of the 18th-century owners, and served by African- Americans and Creoles of color. Heritage resource programs are being challenged worldwide to acknowledge the rich contribu\u00ad tions of diverse peoples and cultures. At home, the National Park Service (NPS) is addressing inclusiveness in several ways. Two decades ago, the NPS established the applied ethnography program. Since then, the concepts, data, and strategies of cultural anthro\u00ad pology, or ethnography, as the NPS calls it, have helped the agency hear and see what had been typically unheard and unseen. By giving voices to communities and indigenous peoples, and visibil\u00ad ity to the resources they value, the discipline has enriched our understanding of heritage by illumi\u00ad nating the places and concerns that have been unknown, but knowable. What is Ethnography? Ethnography actually has several meanings. It is part of cultural anthropology, a social science addressing people in social contexts including communities or tribes, the ways they structure their lives and use their resources, and their responses as often-unwitting players in processes such as tourism, development, nationalization, and globalization. Applied ethnography studies add problem-solving suggestions such as consul\u00ad tation strategies, policy formulation, interpreting potentially discrediting and divisive pasts, and bringing traditional knowledge and stakeholders into heritage programs. Perhaps more often, ethnography is consid\u00ad ered a bundle of methods and concepts.1 Quantitative methods are important, but \"ethnography\" implies qualitative methods, including interviewing, observation and commu\u00ad nity participation.2 One uniquely defining fea\u00ad ture is the researchers' continuing engagement with community members. This facilitates the collection of otherwise unavailable data, a result that Fiske^ calls ethnography's \"ground-truthing\" effect. For example, ethnically-mixed public meetings often discourage frank discussions, but participants will raise sensitive issues in small homogeneous groups or person-to-person meet\u00ad ings. Separately interviewing African Americans and Creoles of color, for example, about inter- ethnic relations and resource uses at the planta\u00ad tion park, Cane River Creole National Historical Park, Louisiana, encouraged openness about themselves and each other. \"Ethnographies\" are also research products, and the NPS has numerous analyses of American Indian, African American, and other peoples and heritage resources. These works have multiple beneficiaries, including park planners, managers and interpreters. Communities themselves gain by making their preferences known about infor\u00ad mation to share or withhold from the public. At Cane River Creole, for example, both African Americans and French Creoles resist seeing slav\u00ad ery become an exclusive interpretive theme. Ethnographic data also supports compli\u00ad ance with local and congressional mandates, including the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, National Environmental Policy Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. Indeed, an essential driver for, and outcome of, ethnographic work is culturally informed compliance and decision-making that meets not only the letter of the law, but the spirit too. CRM No 5\u20142001 4 In the back\u00ad ground, site of the now-leveled but legendary AME Church near Cane River Creole National Historical Park. It still serves local residents as a place marker; an ethnographic resource, in NPS parlance. Brick cabin(s) at Magnolia Plantation, Cane River Creole National Historical Park, constructed in the 1800s to house enslaved black people and later occu\u00ad pied by free African- American work\u00ad ers until the 1960s. Sites, struc\u00ad tures, objects, and landscapes can be called \"ethnographic\" if people consider them traditionally and uniquely associ\u00ad ated with their her\u00ad itage. Some ethno\u00ad graphic resources are eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, oth\u00ad ers are not. \"Ethnographic resources\" were con\u00ad ceived because cer\u00ad tain park resources lacked the integrity or other criteria needed for Register listing, but deserved attention because they were vital to tribal or community cultures. Presently, the NPS is computerizing an inventory of these resources. Even no longer extant physical structures or town landscapes can remain pivotal to the iden\u00ad tity of entire communities, whether Japanese- American former internees, relocated American Indians and African Americans, or American Indians linked to the lands of internment camps. Universally, invisible or barely recognizable ves\u00ad tiges of human communities on sunken U.S. warships or at Nazi concentration camps and elsewhere, can elicit powerful responses. Formerly standing churches, for example, pepper Louisiana's Cane River National Heritage Area. Although outsiders might see only \"rubble heaps,\" or no surface clues at all, these seemingly invisible structures still configure the local geog\u00ad raphy perceived by traditional residents. Outsiders seeking directions to some rural locale might be told to drive toward \"the church,\" meaning the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME). It was demolished three decades ago, but remains a place marker, an intrinsic part of the conceptual map and storied landscape. Similarly, riverside baptismal sites without physi\u00ad cal markings are known to local residents as places of spiritual cleansing and community renewal, but, despite their heritage importance, remain invisible to cultural outsiders. Stakeholders, Including Traditionally- Associated Peoples Many people have stakes in the outcomes of decisions about heritage resources. Stakeholders include site neighbors, and community gardeners in certain national parks. Others are government agencies, history re-enactors, or bikers on annual pilgrimages to the Vietnam Memorial. Some rep\u00ad resent preservation or tourism interests, or belong to churches listed on the National Register. Many are indigenous peoples, or others whose former homelands or subsistence resources now are pro\u00ad tected areas. Together, the stakeholder category includes various peoples with at least one common element, interest in resource-related decisions. One major kind of stakeholder is \"tradi\u00ad tionally-associated peoples.\" Unlike casual visi\u00ad tors, they have long-term interests in particular resources, reflecting actual, historic, and leg\u00ad endary ties. For at least two generations, and even before a heritage site might have been established, they perceived the resources as crucial to their cultural genesis and identity. They are indige\u00ad nous people who once used, or might still use, the subsistence and ceremonial areas incorporated into parks. Others are descendants of enslaved people who once served in elegant plantation \"big houses,\" or are French Creole descendants who have owned and maintained the mansions. They know the meanings of resources. Consulting traditionally-associated peoples is essential, especially when individuals or institu\u00ad tions plan to protect resources expressing other peoples' heritages. Contacting peoples might entail interviewing neighbors, or senior citizens and church members, involving tribal officials in government-to-government discussions, and reviewing research and maps, including Indian Land Area maps. CRM No 5\u20142001 5 The more inclusive the search, the likelier the success in identifying associated peoples and other stakeholders. Establishing productive work\u00ad ing relationships with them is imperative, I would argue, if we expect to enhance our knowl\u00ad edge of diverse heritages, incorporate traditional knowledge into management, and raise the visi\u00ad bility of the resources, people, and processes that have contributed to nation-building. Hopefully this CRM issue will illustrate the contribution Ethnography makes to the American people. Notes 1 R.F. Ellen, ed.

The title of this article comes from the symposium I organized in December 2000 for the National Park Service Conference in Santa Fe, Cultural Resources 2000: Managing for The Future. The full title of the symposium was Seeking a More Inclusive System: Raising Muted Voices and Identifying Invisible Resources. The problem of formal preservation programs that, however inadvertently, made certain people and resources invisible players has concerned me for decades. Oral History and Technology Workshop Oral history is a mainstay of ethnographic research. A strategy for understanding the dynamics of communities, events, and resource uses, it helps satisfy compliance, planning, and interpretive needs. History and other programs find it essential, too. Inexpensive and widely available electronic recording technology is increasingly encouraging federal, community, state, and tribal program man\u00ad agers to collect, store, and make public vast amounts of cultural data. Yet, they have had no formal ethnographic, administrative history, or archival experience, or training in confidentiality and copy\u00ad right issues. Effective oral history work requires certain basic training. This includes knowing when and how to conduct culturally-appropriate ethnographic and administrative history interviews in different sit\u00ad uations and with different peoples. In an era of advanced electronic recording, it is important to know current techniques to capture, transcribe, index, store, and preserve new types of media, and salvage old recordings for use with current digital technology. Knowing the best practices for alerting scholars to available oral and video histories and sound recordings; for identifying and transferring materials to repositories; and for managing outdated formats and deteriorating media is essential. Finally, given the often culturally-sensitive information in oral histories, and its potentially wide public distribution through electronic media, it is imperarive to address legal protections for sensitive data, and issues of confidentiality, informed consent, intellectual property rights, copyright, and privacy. These pressing needs have led the National Park Service and Canyonlands Natural History Association to sponsor a three-day oral history workshop, September 18-20, 2001, in Moab, Utah, for community organizations, tribes, and local, state, and federal agencies with cultural and natural resource responsibilities.

CRM No 5\u20142001 6 Mark Schoepfle Ethnographic Resources Inventory and the National Park Service National Park Service ethno\u00ad graphic resources are landscapes, sites, structures, objects, and natural resources important to peoples or park neighbors who have had a long- term, or traditional, association with them. To the public, these resources may symbolize the shared history of our nation. To park neighbors and peo\u00ad ples traditionally associated with them, these resources link people closely to their shared subsis\u00ad tence, religion, identity, or sense of purpose. The Ethnography program within the National Park Service (NPS) developed the con\u00ad cept of the ethnographic resource to integrate the perspective of traditionally-associated peoples into NPS resource management. The concept means that these resources are a window into the cultural knowledge, beliefs, lives, and history of tradition\u00ad ally-associated peoples. The most recent addition to the NPS ethno\u00ad grapher's tool kit is the Ethnographic Resources Inventory, or ERI. The ERI stores ethnographic resource information electronically for parks. As a data management system, it helps reflect in schematic form how the information about ethno\u00ad graphic resources is important to traditionally- associated peoples and to the NPS. Ethnographic Resource Information NPS ethnographers designed the ERI to contain two kinds of information about ethno\u00ad graphic resources. The first reflects the viewpoint of the traditionally-associated peoples, the second the needs of NPS scientists and planners. The Associated Peoples' View To reflect the knowledge of traditional peo\u00ad ples, ethnographers must integrate information for each resource. They must then relate it to information about other resources. Traditionally- associated peoples interweave the meanings of landscapes, places, objects, and natural resources. Among the Navajos, for example, features of a landscape can place a family within the shared history of a whole people. A particular family may have a place, marked by a cairn or a butte, where certain ceremonies take place. During a ceremony the singer, or medicine man, will bless a family's sacred prayer bundle, or dahnidiilyeh. In addition to earth collected from the four major sacred mountains, this bundle may also contain nit'liz, or sacred prayer stones. The bundle also contains chiin, or talismans. These talismans stand for the livestock, the children, and other important ele\u00ad ments that give meaning to the major events and achievements of the family. The ceremony associated with the place will make many references to particular legends. The narratives of these legends contain lessons about how people should act toward the land and each other. Navajos associate these legends to places on the landscape because these places are exactly where these events occurred. The ceremonies thus recapitulate these leg\u00ad ends. They not only cure people of illnesses or made things happen, they reveal to individuals the paths through which they should lead their lives. Thus, the land literally becomes a cognitive map. To the Navajo and other Indian people, the landscapes, places, objects, and natural resources are not simply sentimental reminders about life. They are integral to life, and to transmitting cul\u00ad tural knowledge. Without the protection of ethnographic resources, it becomes difficult for people to recall and teach the cultural knowledge with which these resources are associated. Family members would sometimes show these sites, bundles, and talismans to outsiders enthusiastically. At other times, they are very reti\u00ad cent, talking only in general ways about their importance. They are worried not only about visi\u00ad tors damaging a site, but about witchcraft and other mischief. Thus, confidentiality remains an important issue. It is difficult enough for conventional ethno\u00ad graphic studies to describe this complex cultural interrelationship. It is impossible with a database. A database must be able, however, to point out the interconnectedness, and direct the user to the literature and consultation opportunities that make better understanding possible. CRM No 5\u20142001 7 The ERI lists the name of a resource as it is commonly known. It also lists the different names by which a people may know that resource. The ERI collects and provides a direc\u00ad tory for all the peoples and neighbors associated with that resource. For each associated group, the ERI provides a quick reference to legendary or sacred associa\u00ad tions with that resource. There are quick refer\u00ad ences for a resource's use. An ethnographic resource may have many uses, even for a single group of people. The ERI details how a resource's uses may have changed through time. For exam\u00ad ple, a resource originally used for food or food production may presently be used for educating young people about their past, or for recreation. The ERI records the associated peoples' view of an ethnographic resource's condition, and preferences for how to maintain it. Not only may the resource's condition change through time. The views of a resource's condition may change as well. Peoples' preferences for maintenance may differ sharply from plans the Park Service may have for maintaining or upgrading it. The ERI records the consultations between a park and each traditionally-associated group. An NPS official thus can quickly review the insti\u00ad tutional memory of the relationship between the park and the people traditionally associated with a resource. Finally, the ERI program requires the user to cite documentation showing that there is a tra\u00ad ditional association with a resource. It is true that its association with the cultural knowledge of a traditionally-associated people defines the ethno\u00ad graphic resource. However, those using the ERI must be able to track how the ethnographers con\u00ad clude that the group is traditionally associated, to make informed decisions. By meeting this need for tracking, the ERI also becomes a master bibli\u00ad ography for documentary sources, ranging from books and journal articles to field notes and tape recordings. The NPS Resource Management View As an ethnographic tool, the ERI will help mediate between the view of the traditionally- associated peoples and the needs for NPS plan\u00ad ning. The ERI includes information that links a traditionally-associated peoples' cultural knowl\u00ad edge to the NPS planning process. The ERI thus includes information on the location of the resource, and other databases where information on this resource may be found. It includes infor\u00admation on the physical location of the resource, and records the condition of the resource from the standpoint of NPS management. ERI users can then compare the condition defined by the NPS to that of the traditionally-associated groups. Conclusions Ethnographic resources are a window into the cultural knowledge of traditionally-associated peoples and park neighbors. The concept helps NPS ethnographers mediate between the poten\u00ad tially conflicting values of traditionally-associated peoples and the Park Service resource manage\u00ad ment process. Through such mediation, ethnog\u00ad raphers can involve traditional people better in the way NPS manages, plans, and operates parks. First, it can help serve as the institutional memory for a park by tracking the changing con\u00ad ditions of ethnographic resources, the history of consultation with park associated groups, and the location of resources. Second, the ERI can link ethnographic resources to other cultural and natural resource data records, and help NPS management and plan\u00ad ners come up to speed quickly on this information. At present, the ERI's first customers are the parks. However, NPS plans to integrate it with other databases through Park Service geographic information systems (GIS). This integration will enhance both NPS and traditional user under\u00ad standing of ethnographic resources by revealing patterns of resource distribution. These patterns can then reveal interwoven components of land\u00ad scapes, patterns of natural resource consumption, and other elements of a people's cognitive map not otherwise obvious either to NPS manage\u00ad ment or to the traditionally-associated group. The ERI is not a substitute for consultation with traditionally-associated groups. Nevertheless, the ERI can be integrated with other NPS data systems to make more logical and reasonable NPS planning for the stewardship of our nation's living heritage.

Worldwide, historical sites important for local and national communities are increasingly visited by peo\u00ad ple crossing national and regional boundaries. The World Tourism Organization (WTO) fore\u00ad casts that the tourism sector will surpass a total of one billion international travelers by the year 2010, reaching 1.6 billion by the year 2020 (WTO, May 11, 2000). Globalization, the watch\u00ad word of the present, carries important implica\u00ad tions for history as well as for the economic and trade issues so frequently noted in today's media. Just as increasing movements of people and images across national boundaries impact the world economic order, they also affect the ways we produce and interpret history. This essay discusses the utility of ethno\u00ad graphic research for understanding historical interpretation in contexts that are at once local, national, and international. One such site is the USS Arizona Memorial in Honolulu, Hawai'i, owned by the U.S. Navy and administered by the National Park Service. It memorializes those who died in the bombing attack that initiated America's entry into World War II. It is both a sacred site of national memory and a destination for international tourism visited annually by tens of thousands of foreign travelers. In such places travelers make sense of local histories in terms of their own routes of travel, their own stories and histories. How may we understand the \"polyphony\" of perspectives that converge in such complex spaces? Since the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor in 1991, researchers based at the University of Hawai'i have been studying the production of historical meaning at the memorial, addressing how the stories of Pearl Harbor are told, inter\u00ad preted, and understood there. Significantly, these projects have open-ended and collaborative styles. It has long been a hallmark of ethno\u00ad graphic research that it is, at base, about the dis\u00ad covery of questions and themes that may not be well understood at the outset of the project (even if taken for granted by the \"natives\"\u2014people who live, work, and transit in the settings under con\u00ad sideration). Such research requires close listening and the ability to \"hang out.\" Given the high degree of sensitivity associated with war memori\u00ad als and their themes of death, suffering, and heroism, the participatory style of ethnography affords an opportunity for reading the personal and human dimensions of such sites that cannot be represented easily with survey techniques. Ethnographic research with tourist travelers is made difficult by the fact that they are on the move; they are not accessible in the same way that members of a residential community might be accessible. The mobility of travelers has made it even more important that researchers interested in tourist experience work closely with staff and volunteers who do spend time at these sites. Thus, the involvement of NPS personnel in all phases of research, from conception to publica\u00ad tion, has been an important element of all the University of Hawai'i projects. Sacred Sites/National Histories What is at stake at Pearl Harbor? The USS Arizona Memorial condenses highly charged sto\u00ad ries about events that changed America and the world\u2014a bombing attack that killed over 2,000 CRM No 5\u20142001 9 military personnel and civilians, sunk or damaged an entire battleship fleet, and catapulted the United States into world war. Thus, telling the stories of Pearl Harbor also becomes a way of telling stories about what it means to be American, with all the attendant emotions and politics. Given the diversity of Americans visiting Pearl Harbor, there are innumerable ways for peo\u00ad ple to engage with the place and its stories as Americans. Issues of diversity and multicultural- ism have been a central feature of Pearl Harbor histories from the very beginning when the unify\u00ad ing effects of the bombing were first recognized and incorporated in documentary accounts of the event.^ Beyond the multiplicity of national stories, international travelers at the memorial are reminders that Pearl Harbor is also a Japanese story, an Asian story, and a story relevant to any\u00ad one for whom the advent of world war in 1941 is significant. By 1990, about one-third of the nearly 1.5 million visitors to the memorial were international travelers, mostly from Asia and, specifically, Japan. In the mid-1990s, the park produced a Japanese soundtrack for the film, available through rental of headphones. (Museum signs remain in English only.) The complexity of the site, and the potential for identities and histories to collide there, is indi\u00ad cated by the numerous conflicts that have arisen at the site over the years\u2014conflicts about the ways history is represented and about the ways people interact with those histories. Consider a few examples: As gauged by letters to Congress, the USS Arizona Memorial is the most controversial site in the national park system. During the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor in 1991, complaints expressed concern about the Japanese presence, including the Japanese books and videos for sale. Some visitors have protested references to Hiroshima in occasional talks at the memorial while others have lamented the absence of refer\u00ad ences to Hiroshima. During the anniversary period, criticism of the documentary film shown at the USS Arizona Memorial reached a peak, with a letter writing campaign of veterans groups upset that the film rationalized Japan's \"sneak\" attack/ In 2000, a group of local Japanese Americans protested images in the documentary film that, in their view, implied local Japanese spying for the Japanese, despite the lack of evidence. Native Hawaiians, many of whom are active in movements to reclaim land and political status lost during colonial history, seek to recognize the significance of the Pearl Harbor area as native land once replete with burial sites, walled fish ponds, and ancestral shrines. The arrival of USS Missouri in 1998, moored within eyesight of the USS Arizona Memorial, raised concerns among some Pearl Harbor sur\u00ad vivors and Park Service personnel that it would overshadow and distort the atmosphere of the memorial and its shrine room. Disney's production of the new Hollywood film, Pearl Harbor, raises the specter of the \"Disneyfication\" of Pearl Harbor history.\" These conflicts over the nature of Pearl Harbor memory marks identities that intersect at the memorial. Reviewing the list, it is possible to see that arguments over historical representation are nested in broader social relations of various kinds, especially national, racial, and generational identities. If it was not already obvious, these vignettes show that the meaning and value of Pearl Harbor stories vary across audiences. In other words, national, ethnic, and generational identities are associated with distinctive ways of understanding and feeling Pearl Harbor history. These \"commu\u00ad nities of understanding\" are rooted in specific cultural and historical experiences. Nationality Many American visitors to the USS Arizona Memorial express surprise and curiosity about Japanese visitors there. Studies have documented a diverse array of backgrounds and motives among Japanese who come to the memorial. Younger Japanese often have little prior knowl\u00ad edge of Pearl Harbor and come out of curiosity or as part of pre-programmed holiday packages. In contrast, older Japanese visitors generally already know of Pearl Harbor and come deliber\u00ad ately to see a place that has personal meaning, sometimes with a sense of \"healing\" past wrongs. In the latter case, it is possible to see some com\u00ad monality between older Americans and Japanese, who may have been on different sides of the war, but who share the experience as a formative event in their lives. Indeed, this shared experience has provided the basis for a limited number of contacts 10 CRM No 5\u20142001 Hiroya Sugano pays his respects as part of the \"sister rose\" ceremony at the USS Arizona Memorial, June 1995. Museum exhibit of recruiting poster of African- American war hero Doris Miller, USS Arizona Memorial museum. between American and Japanese veterans of the Pacific War. One of the most remarkable recent developments has been a series of exchanges between Japanese and American war veterans. The memorial has been a catalyst for these exchanges, first bringing Japanese veterans to par\u00ad ticipate in a symposium marking the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, and then facilitating ceremonial events aimed at expressing reconcilia\u00ad tion among former enemies. Twice, in 1995 and 2000, an organization of Japanese navy veterans has visited Honolulu to participate unofficially in December 7th anniver\u00ad sary events.7 Usually ignored or scorned in their own country, Japanese veterans seem to find a degree of dignity and personal significance in a place dedicated to remembering the sacrifices of those who fought for their country. They also find recognition of the value of military service and a sense of identification with the United States as a strong military power and ally of Japan. In doing so, they find satisfaction in the ability to be involved, however marginally, in U.S. celebrations of war history. Ethnicity Throughout its 40-year history, the USS Arizona Memorial has evolved in ways that take account of a widening circle of human stories entangled with the bombing of December 7, 1941. Constructing a history of memory of Pearl Harbor\u2014of the ways Pearl Harbor has been memorialized through time\u2014also provides a his\u00ad tory of race relations in America, up to the pre\u00ad sent. Initially only a memorial to military person\u00ad nel, the memorial brought civilian casualties into the orbit of official commemoration in the 1990s. And, even though the heroic acts of a black sailor, Doris (Dorie) Miller, were widely publicized dur\u00ad ing the war, minority sailors have only recently received attention in memorial activities. For example, as part of last year's December 7th anniversary events, a special commemorative cer\u00ad emony read out the names of all minority service personnel on duty during the Pearl Harbor attack and reflected on their experiences with both war and racism. For Americans of Japanese ancestry, Pearl Harbor not only marked the beginning of the Pacific War, it marked the advent of intensified public suspicions, discrimination, and appropria\u00ad tion of property. While elements of this story do emerge in the course of interpretation (as in pre\u00ad sentations by a Japanese-American veteran volun\u00ad teer, who was himself interned in California), in general the memorial does not address this aspect of war history. The absence contributed to the recent controversy in which local Japanese Americans objected to the depiction of Japanese Americans in the documentary film, leading to modification of offending parts of the film. The newer film, like the one it replaced, only referred to Japanese Americans in the context of the U.S. commanders' mistaken assumption that large numbers of local Japanese were potential spies and saboteurs. It disregards the experiences of local Japanese Americans, many of whom worked on the bases and rallied to the defense of the island during the panicky days after the attack. The relative absence of local stories may be one CRM No 5\u20142001 11 reason that few residents of Honolulu, Japanese American or otherwise, visit the memorial (only about 5% of visitors are \"local\"). Generation The phrase \"remember Pearl Harbor\" takes on new meanings as World War II veterans decline in number, 60 years after the conflict began. For war-era Americans, the words \"Pearl Harbor\" will always have special meaning\u2014a kind of \"flash-bulb memory.\" Indeed, Park Service personnel have noted that war-generation audiences exhibit a higher degree of awareness, attentiveness, and emotional response. We have found support for this impression in research on emotional responses to the documentary film shown there which revealed that war-generation Americans report more intense emotional responses to the film than do younger viewers. This survey also documented a longer historical trend in Americans' memories of Pearl Harbor, with emotions of sadness (and pride) replacing emotions of anger. If Pearl Harbor memory is becoming less emotional with the passing of generations, it is also being transformed by ongoing representa\u00ad tions of Pearl Harbor history in contexts of tourism and popular culture. When USS Missouri was towed into Pearl Harbor in June 1998, it added a spectacular tourist attraction that visually dwarfs the sleek, low-profile memor\u00ad ial nearby. USS Missouri is both a technological wonder and a historic artifact (where MacArthur signed the surrender documents ending the war with Japan). USS Arizona is also a historic arti\u00ad fact. But it is underwater, almost invisible. Although the two ships were conceived of by some as \"bookends\" for the Pacific War, the visu\u00ad ally-dominant USS Missouri has the potential to redefine the cultural space of the memorial with its triumphal narrative of victory in the Pacific, especially as plans take shape for the development of the surrounding area with further amenities and even a Pacific War museum. Conclusion Cultural and historic sites are all about the production of meaning. But whose meaning? Toward what end? As audiences become more diverse and varied (and especially as marginalized or silenced groups find a hearing in today's public spaces), meaning also becomes more complicated and contested. Diverse histories are likely to be particularly acute at sites of war memory that, by definition, memorialize lethal conflicts. Conceptually, war museums and memorials are located along the fault zones of national and international conflicts. How is it possible to produce national stories of war without reproducing the same sentiments that engendered the conflicts in the first place? What kind of national histories will \"make sense\" when they quickly circulate to multicultural and multinational audiences? And, more fundamen\u00ad tally, what histories are not told when dominant stories of such spectacular events rivet our atten\u00ad tion? At Pearl Harbor, for example, the events of December 7th that provide the USS Arizona Memorial with its raison d'etre also further obscure the longer history of Native Hawaiians\u2014 in many instances literally buried in the ground, covered over by the development of the largest naval base in the Pacific. Such questions point to the need for more nuanced readings of the rhetorics and politics of history, especially public histories in today's \"con\u00ad tact zones\" of international travel. In his book on Holocaust memorials, Texture of Memory, James Young writes of the potential for public sites of memory to enable awareness of multiple forms of experience: Public Holocaust memorials in America will increasingly be asked to invite many different occasionally competing groups of Americans into their spaces. African Americans and Korean Americans, Native Americans and Jews will necessarily come to share common spaces of memory, if not common memory itself. In this, the most ideal of American visions, every group in America may eventu\u00ad ally come to recall its past in light of another group's historical memory, each coming to know more about their compatriot's experi\u00ad ences in light of their own remembered past.^ Some of the lessons from the USS Arizona Memorial suggest that the \"coalition of con\u00ad sciousness\" Young foresees may also be extended across national boundaries. It is a hopeful vision.

Gretchen Schafft Displaying Discrediting History in Public Sites Perpetrators and their descendants often do not want public com\u00ad memorations to be built that remind people of the horrors that relate to their personal or family histories. Even victims may be ambivalent about the value of dis\u00ad playing their pasts, believing that they are either too painful or impossible to adequately envision in a less terror-filled time. However, such displays often are built because enough people, or strong enough lobbies, encourage citizens to face the past and learn from it. In general, however, dis\u00ad plays reflecting discrediting histories are scarce and often inaccurate in their representations of the past. There is a kind of civic denial that assists people in avoiding discomforting and disturbing histories by avoiding straightforward, public dis\u00ad plays of times in which terrible events occurred. My experience as a cultural anthropologist has been primarily with concentration camp memorials in Germany and central Europe. These memorials have been erected on the histor\u00ad ical sites where during World War II, hundreds of thousands of prisoners were incarcerated, used as a source of slave labor or for medical experimen\u00ad tation, or merely held until they were extermi\u00ad nated. It is estimated that Germany alone had more than 1,300 concentration camps during the period 1933-1945. At the end of the war, Germany was divided into the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The FRG was restructured based on a western democ\u00ad ratic model and the GDR was restructured upon a communist model, developed and closely sanc\u00ad tioned by the U.S.S.R. Memorials built to com- CRM No 5\u20142001 13 Sachsenhausen monument designed in the Communist era and still stand\u00ad ing. A symbolic chimney meant to show the thousands of deaths that occurred in this camp. memorate concentration camps followed two very different patterns. In the FRG, most concen\u00ad tration camps were emptied, cleaned, sometimes burned to the ground, and abandoned. A few were used to house war criminals awaiting trial, but then were emptied. Only after some time elapsed did surviving inmates of a few of the camps urge that their sites be commemorated. These select localities, with the help of survivor groups, raised money to develop museums and commemorative markers, rebuild some represen\u00ad tative buildings, and develop programs that would teach the population about the history of these disreputable places. In the GDR, the Soviet influence played a major role. Many in the government were German political survivors of the camps and also wanted a commemoration to their own history. A specific law regulated the displays at the com\u00ad memorative sites. The primary focus of the com\u00ad memorative sites was to be the Soviet losses and the role of the Red Army in liberating the camps. German heroism in bringing the downfall of fas\u00ad cism was another theme. The displays implicated \"militaristic capitalism\" as the perpetrator, not the German people or even the Nazi Party. The large number of commemorative sites were heavily supported by the government whose functionar\u00ad ies considered them to be key to citizen political education. Following re-unification of Germany in 1989, these two approaches to the concentration camp memorials had to be meshed. The country as a whole took over some responsibility for the maintenance of the grounds, and the displays were left to commissions appointed in each state. The memorials are located on valuable land and are often the focus of controversy as vested interests fight to gain control of all or some of the grounds for commercial pur\u00ad poses. As survivors' numbers decrease, resistance to this encroachment will sig\u00ad nificantly lessen. An additional problem existed in several of the memorial sites in the former GDR. From 1945-1950, several Nazi concentration camps were converted into prisoner of war camps to house suspected Nazi perpetrators and others who posed a threat to the newly formed Communist state. These converted facilities were referred to as \"Special Camps.\" Prisoners in the Special Camps were held under very inhumane conditions, and thousands died in unmarked graves. Because no trials were held by the Soviet captors, it was unclear in the early 1990s, and remains unclear today, how many prisoners in the Special Camps had been Nazi guards or func\u00ad tionaries and how many had simply been, or were suspected of being, anti-Communists. In the beginning years of German re-unification, these two survivor groups fought for recognition in the same geographic space. At two memorials, Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen, the problem was eventually solved by erecting separate build\u00ad ings with separate entrances for memorial for the Special Camps. It is not only Germany, however, that has had to deal with discrediting history. One can make the case that the United States has its own share of controversial history that has been a challenge to display. This history centers on the treatment of those who do not trace their ances\u00ad try to a European background, beginning with Native Americans, continuing through the enslavement of African Americans, as well as the incarceration of Asian Americans during World War II. Civic denial of discrediting history is as strong in our country as elsewhere. If we believe that we should not shy away from difficult historical periods, but display them with as much accuracy as possible, we must address a series of difficult questions. What lobby will exist to urge the creation of public history to commemorate victims of grave injustice or worse? In some cases the descendants of victims no longer make up a significant population group. Who will want to view history on display that implicates themselves as part of the population identified as perpetrators? How can those inter\u00ad ested in the history gain the acceptance of others who may feel this guilt by association? These are questions that are relevant to the United States and many other countries, not only Germany. Anthropological training and perspectives are useful in resolving some of these issues. We understand that historical presentations must 14 CRM No 5\u20142001 Survivors at Buchenwald in front of statuary representing the victims of the camp. This mon\u00ad ument was built in the Com\u00ad munist era, but remains to this day. mesh with the per\u00ad ceived realities of liv\u00ad ing communities. Anthropology has been called \"the uncomfortable sci\u00ad ence\" because we look beneath the surface of public presentations of self and community to understand such cul\u00ad tural dynamics. Thus, using my observations from several different countries and tradi\u00ad tions in public history, I have come to the conclusion that there are some guidelines to follow in making dis\u00ad crediting history a part of public displays. Those interested in the history must make the case that there is value in remembering. This can be done through the following means: Emphasize the process by which terror was established, not only the persons who perpe\u00ad trated the deeds. Emphasize how times have changed and new institutions have been established that would not allow the past to be repeated. Emphasize the heroism of individuals within many groups, including the groups represent\u00ad ing perpetrators, who took personal risks to \"do the right thing.\" Encourage large numbers of citizens to find meaning in the memorials themselves. Programs sponsored by the memorials should include a variety of themes that resonate with many in the community. Large numbers of school children and others should be asked to perform in musical events, readings, study groups, and other activities at the memorial sites, so that they become accus\u00ad tomed to the locale. Their parents and grand\u00ad parents, who may be closer to the discrediting historical time, thus experience being \"guests\" at the site. Advisory committees should include a wide diversity of citizens in various roles, so that more people in the community assume a stake in the memorial. The memorials must allow both victims and perpetrators to grieve for their losses. Victims often need a place to mark as a burial spot for lost colleagues, and families need a place to lay wreathes and say prayers. Perpetrators need a place to reconsider their pasts, their shame and their guilt, and to feel that they, or at least their families, have a possi\u00ad bility for rehabilitation and re-integration into a better and more just society. It is important for all of us to find the courage to face the past. Public commemorative sites help us to do that when they are thought\u00ad fully constructed. I believe that community men\u00ad tal health can actually be enhanced when people who represent all sides of highly charged histori\u00ad cal controversies are given something to enlighten, enrich, and support their common struggle for meaning and valid memory. Note E. Schafft, \"Civic Denial and the Memory of War,\" Journal of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis 26:2 (1998): 255-272. I first used the term \"civic denial\" in 1996 in a paper presented to the Society for Applied Anthropology. I have found it to be useful in describing the inability or unwillingness to publicly acknowledge discrediting history in a wide range of localities in vatious countries. It is, perhaps, not unlike an individual's inability to face disquieting and disturbing truths. In both cases, carried to extreme, denial can be a detriment to mental health. References Gretchen E.

CRM No 5\u20142001 15 Larry Van Horn American Indian Links to Manzanar This article discusses American Indian links to what is now Manzanar National Historic Site in the Owens Valley of eastern California. Over time, four landscapes were rele\u00ad vant to Manzanar\u2014the Paiute landscape before European contact, the Paiute and European- American landscape that began with the Shepherd Ranch and culminated in the orchard town of Manzanar, the Manzanar War Relocation Center of World War II for Japanese Americans, and the landscape as it is today in the dusty, dry Owens Valley. Indians have been involved in all of these, as my ethnographic report and this arti\u00ad cle show. Yale historian Robin Winks uses the term site ofshamr'* as a place, society recognizes, where human abuses occurred and from which people hope to learn never to repeat them. On March 3, 1992, Congress established Manzanar National Historic Site to recognize the intern\u00ad ment of Japanese Americans in war relocation camps during World War II. Manzanar was the first of 10 camps where the signing of Executive Order 9066 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 19, 1942, led to the removal of all persons of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast. They were rounded up by the United States Army; over 70% were United States citi\u00ad zens. There was no evidence of disloyalty, only unfounded fear. Manzanar covered some 6,000 acres, which included 500 acres for the living area, or camp, enclosed by barbed wire. Adjoining this area was an agricultural-use sec\u00ad tion and several facilities, including two stone guard houses, that survive today. Japanese Americans lived at the camp from the spring of 1942 until late 1945, when it was closed. In full swing, the camp housed about 10,000 people. Robin Winks says Manzanar is both a site of shame and of pride: Manzanar National Historic Site is as much a site of pride as it is a site of shame: all Americans should take pride in what those who lived there endured, for their courage is our courage. Further, it ought to be a distinct source of pride that we have, as a people, reached sufficient maturity to recognize our mistakes, to create a visible symbol of the invisible past to teach future generations of the great fear and irrationality that at times descend upon a people in time of war.' To the Indians, Manzanar is more a site of pride. That is, the American Indian links to the site refer to Indian stories about past ways of life and the pride of involvement that they were once there and still have localized cultural interests. Richard Stewart is featured here as an example of a continuing Indian presence as well as a bridge to the past. He is a Paiute from Big Pine in the Owens Valley who conducts walking tours of the Manzanar site, co-sponsored by the National Park Service (NPS) and the Eastern California Museum (ECM) of Independence. American Indians now live on four Paiute- Shoshone reservations in the Owens Valley. From south to north along U.S. Route 395, each town has a reservation associated with it: Lone Pine, Independence, Big Pine, and Bishop. The Fort Independence Indian Reservation was established in 1915 and enlarged in 1916; the other three were established in 1937. It is interesting to note that from about 1913 to 1935 the City of Los Angles through its Department of Water and Power (DWP) purchased huge tracts of land in the valley for water rights, to carry the water eventually to the city through the Los Angeles Aqueduct. An everyday irritant to Japanese Americans interned at Manzanar was the constant wind that seemed to deposit dust and sand on everything. This was so despite the DWP making water available for crop irrigation. That water appar\u00ad ently was not enough to counteract even tem\u00ad porarily the valley-wide desiccation, hence the Manzanar dust. Ample water used to flow into the Owens River and Owens Lake, at the south\u00ad ern end of the valley, from streams and runoff from the Sierra Nevada to the west and the Inyo Mountains to the east. Owens Lake dried up; its 16 CRM No 5\u20142001 One of two remaining stone guard houses at what was once the main entrance to the Manzanar War Relocation Center, 1942 to 1945.

How green was my valley! \\s a sentiment expressed by several American Indian informants from their memories and from tribal oral tradi\u00ad tion. It applied to Indian villages along streams in or near what is now the Manzanar site. Such vil\u00ad lages were a source of field hands as Anglo ranches and farms came to the Owens Valley. Manzanar is the name of an Anglo-Indian orchard community that flourished on the site from May 6, 1910, (when platting started) to the mid-1930s when the DWP made it impossible to continue. The town was known for its commer\u00ad cial fruit. By way of irrigation, it grew apples, apricots, peaches, and pears for railroad distribu\u00ad tion to the Los Angeles market. I refer to the town as Anglo-Indian because of intermarriage. Paiutes and Shoshones married into the commu\u00ad nity. Several of my informants who are elders today were born and grew up there. Facilities included a school, a small Manzanar railroad depot, and a community hall. Through the encouragement of the music teacher, one Paiute elder regularly played there as a young man on Saturday nights with his all-Indian band from Independence. The Indians I talked to, with fam\u00ad ily and other ties to Manzanar, are proud of their association with the orchard town and of Indian contributions to the irrigation on which the orchards depended. The Owens Valley has a long tradition of irrigation. A form of irrigation before European contact existed among the Paiutes, which anthro\u00ad pologist Julian Steward\"' ' calls irrigation without agriculture. Water would be diverted from streams flowing down out of the mountains to foster the growth of certain wild plants whose seeds would be placed in plots during the spring of the year, watered through the fall, and harvested. The stream diversions would then be returned to their original Owens River channels. Rancher-farmer John Shepherd (1833-1908) used irri\u00ad gation at Manzanar. As early as 1862, he pioneered a cattle ranch on Chief George's Creek south of Manzanar. In 1864, he moved to what became known as Shepherd's Creek on the current Manzanar site. With Indian help, he irrigated his land. The orchard town\u2014known as Manzanar Irrigated Farms\u2014bought out Shepherd in 1905. Irrigation became more sophisticated for the fruit growing. A source of Indian pride, Indian input and labor contributed in both the Shepherd and Manzanar instances. Indian people were involved in the initial construction in 1942 and the dismantling in 1945 of the Manzanar War Relocation Center. Owens Valley Indians were and are generally sympathetic to the suffering and denial of citi\u00ad zens' rights involving the Japanese Americans. This is so because of their own experience being pursued and rounded up by the United States Army in the 1860s; escaping, only to return to a steadily eroding subsistence base from European- American settlement. Ranching and farming, however, provided employment, as mentioned, as did the DWP. Indians served as maintenance managers of local equipment More traditional Indian cultural content is found in legends and creation stories set in the mountains and plains around Manzanar. Richard Stewart as a latter-day Paiute storyteller shares some information with non-Indians. He is known as an accomplished artist, potter, and sto\u00ad ryteller who conducts weekend field retreats in association with the Winnedumah Hotel in Independence and the ECM.

He lives in Big Pine where he and his mother, Dorothy Stewart, operate a pottery shop. His family heritage is impressive. Jack Stewart^ was his great grandfather, an important informant of Julian Steward.10 Richard Stewart shares Coyote stories, known in some North American Indian cultures as Trickster tales. These are like morality plays where Trickster or Coyote, although blessed with supernatural powers, often gets into predicaments from greed. Trickster stories teach with humor by reverse example. Children especially learn not to follow Trickster's ways. They learn to do the right thing and avoid embarrassment. Locations around Manzanar abound with Paiute Coyote stories associated with them. Stewart goes to some length to relate a Paiute creation story about how the earth came to be and how the Paiutes came to be part of it. This story focuses upon a cave and rock setting in the Sierra Nevada foothills west of Big Pine, north of Manzanar. Manzanar is thus close to the origin center of the Owens Valley Paiute world. On field trips, Stewart stresses how local varia\u00ad tions exist in Paiute cosmology and how the sto\u00ad ries often precisely relate to specific locales as part of their cultural geography and ecology. Since 1997, through the NPS and the ECM, free walk\u00ad ing tours of Manzanar have been available to visi\u00ad tors five days a week from Wednesday through Sunday. The Manzanar tours cover Paiute and Shoshone occupation, the orchard town of Manzanar, and of course the Japanese-American war relocation center. Visitors who tour with Richard Stewart are especially fortunate because of the additional Indian dimension that can be gleaned if they are interested. Notes 1 Lawrence F.

Geographically distant from the biblical Garden of Eden, federal land in the Magic Valley near Eden, in south-central Idaho, was selected in early 1942 by the U.S. War Relocation Authority (WRA) as one of several sites for the wartime relocation of Japanese resi\u00ad dents of the United States and their American- born offspring. The creation of the WRA fol\u00ad lowed the bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese military in December 1941, and the U.S. Declaration of War against Japan. The Idaho site was far from military exclusion areas of the West Coast and next to a major man-made irrigation canal that gave the Magic Valley its name and reputation. Home communities for Japanese and Japanese-American residents of Washington included the city of Seattle and nearby rural areas on Bainbridge Island in Puget Sound. Ultimately, the WRA administered Minidoka and nine other \"relocation centers,\" some 15 \"assembly centers,\" and three former Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camps that were primarily in the western U.S. In total, some 120,000 Japanese residents of the U.S. and their American-born family members were confined in centers and other facilities run by the WRA, Department of Justice, U.S. Army, or Federal Bureau of Prisons. The site of the Minidoka Internment National Monument is in Jerome County. It is known as Hunt (based on the name of the local post office and community) and Minidoka (based on the Shoshone language derived name used for both a small community 50 miles east of Hunt and a county of the same name). The mon\u00ad ument was designated by presidential proclama\u00ad tion on January 17, 2001, under the auspices of the Antiquities Act of 1906. This was about 60 years after selection of the area; the construction of over 600 buildings in the summer of 1942 by a private enterprise; and the three-year-long forced occupation of the \"camp\" by resident Japanese nationals and their Japanese-American offspring between 1942 and 1945. The National Park Service (NPS) has recently initiated the pub\u00ad lic involvement, research, and planning to pre\u00ad serve and interpret the site. Anthropologically informed social science and broadly based plan\u00ad ning skills are being utilized by the NPS to engage Japanese-American and Asian-American institutions, communities, and individuals to identify and address issues during the next three years. Community Involvement The NPS has managed the Manzanar National Historic Site at the location of the Manzanar War Relocation Center in the Owens Valley of south-central California since 1992. CRM No 5\u20142001 1') And, the newly designated Minidoka Internment National Monument will both complement and contrast with Manzanar. The management and operation of both sites will enhance the interpre\u00ad tation of a unique period of U.S. history during World War II. In this article the focus is on our initial efforts to collaborate with geographically widespread Japanese-American institutions, Asian- American and Japanese- American com\u00ad munities, scholars, people who were interned at Minidoka, and members of the nearby Idaho communities who interacted with internees. Such collaboration will facilitate planning, resource management and interpretation. The People The exclusion of Japanese-born immigrants (Issei) and their descendants (including second generation, American-born Nisei and subsequent generations) from \"designated military areas\" was authorized by President Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066 of February 19, 1942. The WRA then prepared \"assembly centers\" near cities such as Seattle and San Francisco as way stations for temporary use while contracts were made to con\u00ad struct the more distant \"relocation centers.\" By early August 1942, the first group of \"evacuees\" arrived at Hunt or Minidoka. From mid-August through mid-September, some 500 additional persons arrived per day. At its height, the maxi\u00ad mum population grew to approximately 9,500. The people interned at Minidoka primarily came from Washington, Oregon, and Alaska. Initially sent to Manzanar in California, some former Bainbridge Island residents requested relocation to Minidoka and were moved in early 1943. Minidoka was on the north bank of the North Side Canal, but the site had not previously been irrigated and could not draw on water from the canal without the installation and operation of what would have been a very costly pumping facility. Instead, the WRA and the internees turned to the Milner-Gooding Canal, some five miles to the northeast, to get water for irrigation. An initial task undertaken by internees was the construction of an irrigation canal that ran from the Milner-Gooding Canal to new fields they had cleared. Initially 350 acres were cleared and farmed, but by 1944 the irrigated acreage grew to 740. Information on the life of internees exists in various texts and documents, but much more will undoubtedly be acquired as collaboration with Japanese Americans develops and deepens through the conduct of oral history research dur\u00ad ing the planning process. It is well documented that large numbers of camp residents of various ages provided agricultural labor throughout the region between 1942 and 1945. The beginning of school for children was delayed until November in 1942, for example, because so many students were on \"agricultural leave.\" At the same time, a total of some 2,000 evacuees from Minidoka were working in Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming. Regional labor camps were set up for Minidoka residents at both Rupert and Twin Falls, Idaho. Although the internees were confined to the Minidoka Relocation Center, children and adults were authorized to leave the center for agricul\u00ad tural work and a variety of cultural and recre\u00ad ational activities. Internees supplied labor that helped to compensate for a domestic labor short\u00ad age caused by the large numbers of Americans who were in military service. By 1943, however, the U.S. War Department recruited internees from the various relocation centers for the 100th Battalion and the 442nd Regimental Combat Team for service in Europe and thereby con\u00ad tributed personnel for the war. The number of volunteers from Minidoka for the 442nd was the largest of all. Ultimately, some 1,000 internees from Minidoka served in the military, and 73 ser\u00ad vicemen from Minidoka were killed in action. In January 1945, the ban that excluded the internees from their homes along the Pacific Coast was lifted. They were allowed to leave, and the last family left Minidoka by October. About 150 other internees remained at a labor camp in nearby Twin Falls for a short time. Most internees from Minidoka returned to their previous com\u00ad munities of residence in Seattle, the Puget Sound area, and elsewhere. The Resources Prior to the establishment of the Minidoka Relocation Center, the North Side Canal was a prominent local feature that provided a source of water for elsewhere in the Magic Valley. Ironically, the 33,000 acres of land set aside for the center was a high desert environment domi\u00ad nated by sagebrush. Instead of a river running through it, the North Side Canal did so. As noted above, internees brought water in from the Milner-Gooding Canal. According to maps in the National Archives, roads, buildings, ditches, agricultural fields, and other facilities were cre- 20 CRM No 5\u20142001 Chimney in wait\u00ad ing room of entry building. Photo by Dick Lord. ated in the 950-acre heart of the 33,000- acre reserve. Following the end of the war, much of the acreage of the reserve was divided up into homesteads for veterans. Along with available acreage, the vets could get two buildings. The vets then needed to remove them from the heart of the former relocation center that remained in federal ownership. Dismantling of the community through removal and reloca\u00ad tion of the majority of the 600 or so build\u00ad ings took place, and only two buildings remained when the NPS Western Archeological and Conservation Center did a survey of Minidoka in the 1990s. A remnant stone feature at the guard house and a standing chimney in its waiting room area remain, as do building foundations, other fea\u00ad tures, road alignments, and portions of the irriga\u00ad tion system that are still in use. Oral history interviews and site visits with surviving internees will undoubtedly provide excellent information on the structural organiza\u00ad tion of the community that will increase the knowledge that is currently based on archival documentation, initial archeological survey, and the more detailed mapping and site documenta\u00ad tion that is currently underway. To set the stage for retrieving ethnographic data about life at Minidoka between 1942 and 1945, we will con\u00ad tinue to involve a variety of organizations, insti\u00ad tutions, communities, and individuals through\u00ad out the West. Collaboration and Planning Collaboration with Japanese Americans and other citizens of Idaho took place when the desig\u00ad nation of Minidoka was first considered for the remaining federal acreage at the site. In the period since that designation was made in January 2001, organizations, institutions, com\u00admunities, and individuals throughout the West have been contacted. Organizations include the Japanese American Historical Society in San Francisco and the national Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) and its local offices in Idaho and elsewhere. Institutions include the Wing Luke Asian Museum in Seattle, the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles, the University of Washington, and Boise State University, as well as local individuals and the Jerome County Historical Society. In all cases, certain staff or faculty members have indi\u00ad cated an interesr in the projected three-year plan\u00ad ning process. In the context of making the organizational and institutional contacts, many individuals, including many who were interned at Minidoka have been met or have contacted NPS personnel to find out more about what is going on and to offer assistance. The reception has been enthusi\u00ad astic and there is a keen interest in becoming involved in and being supportive of ethnohistori- cal research efforts that will seek to document life at the relocation center and to present this chap\u00ad ter about ethnic relations in American history.

CRM No 5\u20142001 21 Miguel Vasquez Latinos jViva La Diferencia! Unique and rich heritages mark Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as the United States. And each of the many peoples and their cultures has, and will, con\u00ad tribute to the evolving U.S. in ways that richly deserve celebration and commemoration by Latino groups themselves and by the nation's her\u00ad itage institutions. Indeed, attention to the dis\u00ad tinctive peoples is imperative if the planning of heritage programs, identification of heritage resources, and development of heritage tourism are to reflect the diversity within this demograph- ically and culturally diverse and significant U.S. population. My basic point is that there is no real \"Latino community.\" Instead, there are many. At a time when new census figures show burgeoning \"Latino\" or \"Hispanic\" populations in places like Iowa, Arkansas, and Georgia, and local, formally homogeneous, or unambiguously black or white populations in these places are struggling to come to terms with their newfound diversity, this is worth remembering. Diversity is something I am somewhat familiar with. I was born and grew up in San Francisco\u2014where one becomes accustomed to diversity quickly... or you leave; because that is what it is all about. My family background is Mexican, Spanish, Puerto Rican, and Italian. I have been married to a Mayan woman from Guatemala for 25 years. So I am sort of familiar with \"life in the hyphen,\" as Ilan Stavans calls it. I have sort of assumed, naively, that diversity was normal and, for many years, took it for granted. Hispanics are not a unified ethnic popula\u00ad tion. Within this \"community\" is a tremendous diversity: ethnically, racially, socially, economi\u00ad cally, politically, culturally, and even, linguisti\u00ad cally. The commonality here is obviously the Spanish language and some elements of common history, culture, and religion. But even here there are major differences, since for many newcomers, indigenous people from Mexico, Guatemala, and the Andean countries, Spanish is not even their first language. It is a lingua franca at best. Many, like Mixtec farmworkers around Fresno, forced north by NAFTA, or Kanjobal refugees from the Guatemalan war, now in Phoenix, speak it hesi\u00ad tantly, or not at all. They also are labelled \"Hispanics.\" Where Do They Come From, Where Do They Go, Why Do They Come? Since Mexican Americans (65%), Puerto Ricans (9%), and Cubans 80% of the Hispanic/Latino popula\u00ad tion in the U.S., I will focus on them.2 Depending on the place, Central and South American or Caribbean groups also comprise sig\u00ad nificant portions of local populations. Where once most U.S. Hispanics were rural, today over\u00ad whelmingly these folks live and work in urban areas. Los Angeles, now the second largest Spanish-speaking city in the world, is home to a population that is mostly Mexican and Central American in origin, others are from all over Latin America. New York is principally Puerto Rican and Central and South American. Miami is Cuban and Central and South American. Chicago is Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Central American. San Antonio has a population that is two-thirds Mexican. With San Francisco, San Jose, Albuquerque, and Tucson, this accounts for 50% of all Hispanics in the U.S.^ Some have been here since the conquistadores first came to the Southwest in the 16th century, and some are arriving at this moment. Why? It is not too diffi\u00ad cult to figure out. Social scientists talk in terms of \"push\" and \"pull\" factors. \"Push\" factors include political and eco\u00ad nomic crises and limited opportunities for educa\u00ad tion, jobs, or social mobility in home countries. In the last century, events like the Mexican and Cuban revolutions, or wars in Central America, have pushed hundreds of thousands of people north seeking respite and refuge. Economically, while North Americans ponder a possible reces\u00ad sion, the vast majority of Latin Americans have confronted a very real recession for most of their lives\u2014regardless of stock prices and growth trends\u2014and life is often one long struggle. NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) has provoked an urban and northern exodus in many areas, since family farming is no longer economically viable and the cost of staple foods (and everything else) has risen much faster than wages. 22 CRM No 5\u20142001 \"Pull\" factors induce migration here to the north instead of to the south, including family ties, labor demand, wage differentials, better opportunities for work and education. If none of these work out (and for many they don't \u2014we just never hear of them), there remains the con\u00ad tinuing myth of success\u2014the \"American Dream.\" Immigration is simply a function of the larger picture of what is happening in home countries and what is happening here. It is macro-econom\u00ad ics lived on a personal level: survival, and each immigrant group brings its contributions. Poor Mexico\u2014So Far From God, So Close to the United States Living in the only place in the world where a \"third world\" country shares a border with a \"first world\" nation, Mexican-Americans, unlike most other U.S. immigrant groups, can con\u00ad stantly renew family, cultural, and linguistic ties. Their contributions, however, aside from cheap farm labor, are seldom recognized by the main\u00ad stream. Several years ago, an Anglo student in one of my classes asked \"what have Mexicans ever contributed to this country anyway?\" (Political correctness is not big in Arizona.) As if chocolate, guacamole, tequila, and my grandmother's enchi\u00ad ladas, were not enough of a contribution from Mexicans, how about California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of Nevada, Utah, and Colorado? What my student and many others don't realize is that mining, ranching, and farm\u00ad ing\u2014the three economic activities that built the West, came here with Mexicans. Not just the labor, but also the technology. Mining techniques and know-how came into California and the rest of the region from Mexico, where gold and silver had been mined since the 16th century. Ranching and \"cowboy\" culture did not come west with the pioneers, it came north from Mexico, and Spain before that. (Most of the vocabulary: rodeo, lasso, corral, etc., comes from Spanish.) So even the seemingly most \"American\" of cultures is really Mexican. Likewise, easterners had no need or knowledge of irrigation for agri\u00ad culture when they came west. Mexican, Spanish, and Moorish cultures provided that know-how. Today though, the Mexican population in the Southwest is overwhelmingly urban. With the demise of manufacturing in places like Los Angeles and San Antonio, it provides much of the workforce in service industries, as well as most of the jobs and new businesses. Living \"La Vida Loca\" There can be no question of the major influence of Puerto Rican music on U.S. culture, and not just Ricky Martin or Jennifer Lopez. But, starting with sugar, and later through indus\u00ad trialization, the island has long produced inex\u00ad pensive consumer goods (without balance of trade deficits). Whether we recognize it or not, the Puerto Rican experience, under Spanish or U.S. rule, has for 500 years been a quintessen\u00ad tial^ colonial experience. The island has always belonged to someone else and its value has always been strategic\u2014a gateway to the rest of Latin America. With few resources and little arable land, even with industrialization, the island's economy could not absorb a growing population. This provoked enormous migration to New York City and other urban areas. Once here, factory closings effectively eliminated many of the \"mid\u00ad dle rungs\" of the economic ladder that earlier immigrants had used to build their lives here. While some Puerto Ricans have become visible, \"acceptable,\" and prospered, and as many as 15% have more than a high school education, for most, \"la vida loca\" has never transcended their dreams, or the stereotypes still in place. Easy access from the island, generally substandard edu\u00ad cation, and poverty, and the maintenance of the very survival mechanisms (community and cul\u00ad tural ties, and language) that have made this unfulfillment bearable at all, have led to lingering over representation in lower socio-economic strata and a high degree of identifiability and continuing discrimination. As with other easily- identifiable groups, this discrimination can be overt and direct, as with \"profiling,\" anti-immi\u00ad grant and English-Only initiatives, or attacks on bilingualism; or it can be more subtle \u2014by banks and realtors in housing, by low educational expectations on the part of teachers, and biased hiring on the part of employers. Viva Cuba Libre Cubans are a much different group. In fact they are two groups essentially: one group quite successful and one not. While both are exiles, the earlier group arrived on these shores with eco\u00ad nomic resources, education, entrepreneurial skills, political clout, and white skin. They have come to own and run much of Miami, and other communities, as well as much of the Spanish-lan\u00ad guage media in the U.S. and have achieved rela\u00ad tive prosperity compared to other Latino groups. CRM No 5\u20142001 23 They have maintained enduring family, cultural, and language ties. Their fair complexion and education have somewhat lessened their distinct identifiability and the level of discrimination they experience. The other, more recent group, the Marielitos, came here as ex-convicts from Cuba, with no family ties or resources and a darker skin, to a very different experience. They have tended to stay poor, uneducated, and powerless.\" Miami, the city where both make their home, with its beaches, music, and food is the vibrant crossroads of the United States and Latin America. Its entrepreneurial, shopping, and entertainment scenes help us recapture some of our balance of trade with countries to the south, since thanks to Cubans, many Latin Americans feel they are still in Latin America. iViva La Diferencia! Perhaps what we most need to remember is that neither the U.S. nor Latin America and the Caribbean is monolithic or static. Each is diverse and changing and vary greatly in response to cir\u00ad cumstances. Each culture in the hemisphere is a product of social relations between different groups, and they are constantly changing in response to the requirements of demographics, changing technologies, and economic arrange\u00ad ments. Appreciating this complexity, and associ\u00ad ated diversity, can only benefit our cultural resource programs.

Pena Fazendeville Highlighting Invisible Pasts and Dignifying Present Identities Twenty years after the razing of the community of Fazendeville, the headline of an October 1, 1989, article in The Times- Picayune said: \"Community Lost Its Life on Chalmette Battlefield.\" One of Fazendeville's for\u00ad mer residents, Val Lindsey, Sr., remembered that when he closes eyes and thinks about what hap\u00ad pened on that grassy field, he doesn't see what most people see\u2014he doesn't see Andrew Jackson holding off the British in the Battle of New Orleans. Instead he sees his yesterdays\u2014families, friends, and the remnants of his own personal battle. He sees the clean, quiet village of Fazendeville sacrificed on the altar of historic preservation 25 years ago. Another resident, Evelyn Minor, noted that \"it really was a unique place.. .Everyone knew each other. They were there to help each other \" Henry Cager said, \"it was the most beauti\u00ad ful place to live.. .it was a family affair.\" But per\u00ad haps Mr. Lindsey summed up the feeling of most of the residents, \"I didn't have the money to fight it. There wasn't no yelling with the federal gov\u00ad ernment. They didn't care. I had no choice. If I did, I'd be down there now.\"1 This historic African-American community known to many as Fazendeville or simply \"the village\"2 existed from 1867-1964 on the site of the Chalmette National Battlefield in St. Bernard 24 CRM No 5\u20142001 Fazendeville, showing Battleground Baptist Church and homes, 1960. Courtesy U.S. Marine Corps by George \u00a3 Statham, Jr. GY/SGT, USMC, 8th Marine Corps Reserve and Recruitment District, New Orleans 13, Louisiana. Parish, Louisiana, where the Battle of New Orleans had been fought in 1815. Fazendeville exemplified the early reconstruction period African-American communities that sprang up after the Civil War. The land was listed in 1854 as part of the succession of Jean Pierre Fazende, a free man of color, who passed it on to his son. After the Civil War, c. 1867, the younger Jean Pierre Fazende began to sell lots to former slaves. The residential community of African Americans known as Fazendeville started to grow. 4 In addition to the Battleground Baptist Church, founded in 1868, the community grew to include a one-room school/ three general stores, and two mutual aid societies. The Silver Star Benevolent Association and the Progressive Mutual Aid Benevolent Association served the community by offering insurance and aid, as well as providing opportunities for social intercourse. These structures helped form a cultural landscape that survived well into the 20th century. The community was a viable, close-knit community of \"honest reliable people,\" and was also described as \"country but near the city\" because of its close proximity to New Orleans. When Chalmette National Historical Park was established in 1939, on former War Department lands, to commemorate the 1815 battle, this African-American community remained in the midst of the preserved \"hallowed ground.\" In addition, the Chalmette National Cemetery, established by the War Department in 1864, was located down river or southeast of Fazendeville. National Park Service properties surrounded the private residential area. The most significant change in the commu\u00ad nity would occur in the early 1960s. The plan\u00ad ning, development, and reconstruction of the Chalmette National Historical Park had been on\u00ad going since its establishment in 1939. Both National Park Service officials and local preserva\u00ad tionists spearheaded efforts for land acquisition to reconstruct the established boundaries of the battlefield. The Battle of New Orleans Sesquicentennial Celebration Commission, cre\u00ad ated in 1962 by President Kennedy, was prepar\u00ad ing for the celebration. The National Park Service was responding to the many public demands on its cultural, historical, and natural resources by planning Mission 66. These projects would upgrade the facilities, staffing, and resource man\u00ad agement throughout the system by the 50th anniversary of the Service in 1966. However, two major obstacles hindered the plans of park officials and preservationists: the Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Plant and Fazendeville. The land between the park and the Chalmette National Cemetery totaled 64-112 acres. It was owned by the Henry J. Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation. After much negotiation with the U.S. Department of the Interior, Kaiser agreed to donate the land between the cemetery and the Fazendeville com\u00ad munity to the park\u2014the first donation was 13- 3/4 acres\u2014the remainder to be given in yearly increments. Fred A. Seaton, Secretary of the Interior at the time, called Kaiser's donation a \"generous act,\" and noted that \"When this tract comes under government control, we will be able to preserve a most important part of the field where the historic and significant Battle of New Orleans was fought on January 8, 1815.\" Only the Fazendeville properties remained. Local preservationists pressed forward and wrote their congressmen that they were \"over\u00ad joyed at the news of the donation of this land and we do not think that we should stop until the Fazendeville tract is acquired....[It is] vitally needed to join the separated areas of Chalmette National Historical Park.\"7 Steps to acquire the Fazendeville properties began. But by the 1960s, Fazendeville was home to over 50 families, some 200 persons. It was a \"proud, tight-knit\" settled community that did not want to be \"bought out\" and have to relocate to other surrounding areas. Nevertheless, by 1964, after extended legal nego\u00ad tiations, the National Park Service acquired the numerous properties that belonged to long-time Fazendeville residents. By 1966, the homes were razed. Virtually all evidence of this historic com\u00ad munity was erased\u2014the Fazendeville village and its people became \"an invisible resource.\" There was little knowledge of this commu\u00ad nity among the park staff when I entered the Service in 1989, even though NPS historian Jerry CRM No 5\u20142001 25 Aerial photo\u00ad graph, c. 1960, showing Chalmette Monument in foreground, Fazendeville community in center, Chalmette National Cemetery among the allee of oaks in rear and Kaiser Aluminum Plant, far rear. Photo courtesy Louisiana Air National Guard. Greene had suggested a study of Fazendeville in his 1985 Historic Resource Study. I was so \"green\" (and not \"green blood\" either) and new to the Park Service and caught up with the plan\u00ad ning of the newly legislated Acadian cultural cen\u00ad ters\u2014that this important part of the park's cul\u00ad tural history and significant part of the African- American story in Louisiana by-passed me. Several years later a park ranger asked if I would be interested in talking with one of the former Fazendeville residents who visits the park periodi\u00ad cally. This was the spark which ignited my fire \u2014 to plan an ethnographic project which would include oral histories of the surviving Fazendeville residents, together with an ethnohis- tory of the Fazendeville community. It was obvi\u00ad ous that the former Fazendeville residents main\u00ad tained a connection with the landscape even though \"they may not step onto that landscape for a long time \" The 1998 Cultural Landscape Study of Chalmette noted that the park contains some sig\u00ad nificant features not connected with the battle, such as a trace of Fazendeville Road. Author Kevin Risk adds that \"the interpretation of these non-battle-related features has proven problem\u00ad atic to the park's primary mission of interpreting the battlefield landscape...yet, these features hold historical, cultural, and ethnographical signifi\u00ad cance in their own rights.\"8 In the NPS Management Policies 2001, Park Ethnographic Resources (5.3.5.3) are defined as \"cultural and natural features of a park that are of traditional significance to traditionally-associated peoples. These people are the contemporary park neighbors and ethnic or occupational communi\u00ad ties that have been associated with a park for two or more generations (40 years), and whose inter\u00adests in the park's resources began prior to the park's establishment.\"\" The former residents of Fazendeville are traditionally-associated peoples. They consider the park resources an integral part of their cultural identity, and are a part of the park's history. They are also a necessary National Park Service concern. In 1999, a park intern gathered initial information on the remaining Fazendeville fami\u00ad lies and began archival research. Last November, the NPS Southeast Regional Office awarded the park a small sum to initiate the ethnographic oral history project. With these initial \"starter funds\" we hope to collect oral histories from surviving residents of the Fazendeville community, espe\u00ad cially those elders who are in poor health; contex- tualize the oral history data within the regional culture of the Lower Mississippi Delta region; and identify potential African-American ethno\u00ad graphic resources within the park and commu\u00ad nity consultants interested in working collabora\u00ad tively with the park. And finally, a personal goal is to have a \"homecoming\" at the park for the former Fazendeville residents. It will undoubtedly be bit\u00ad tersweet, as former residents walk along the newly mowed trace that highlights Fazendeville to park visitors\u2014and to see the surviving lillies that once bloomed in their backyards, and blooming still on the battlefield; and a walk down the Fazendeville Road from St. Bernard Highway to the Mississippi River closed by the federal government on November 25, 1964, almost 40 years ago, will most assuredly bring back memories. 10 The history of African Americans has often not been emphasized at Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve. Through this pro\u00ad ject we will have developed a more complete ethnographic and historical account and have a more inclusive history. We will begin to tell the whole story of Chalmette Battlefield, from the 1815 Battle of New Orleans to contemporary times. For to many of those \"muted voices,\" Chalmette represents a place closely linked with their sense of purpose and existence as a people and as a community.

Audrey L. Brown African-American Churches as Ethnographic Resources Churches are perhaps the most common ethnographic resources of African Americans \u2014 signifi\u00ad cant places and spaces in their lives. Even those who no longer attend, often return to church in nostalgic memories or in per\u00ad son for homecoming or home-going celebrations. While schools, mutual aid societies, and other social institutions evolved from churches, there is little research about day-to-day details of that process. Ethnography can be the link that documents and preserves such knowledge and thus illuminate the cultural meaning of the \"church\" in African Americana. This article offers a glimpse of that process rhrough ethnographic description of a \"Singing\" and \"Giving\" cere\u00ad mony commonly held in rural Florida Afro- Baptist churches since the 1930s or earlier. I compare it to a 1998 \"giving\" ceremony at a national Baptist conference and use anthropolog- ical theory to explain its' cultural significance.1 From 1981-1985, I lived in Jerusalem, Florida, a church community established in the post-bellum period. Other church members and I became involved in documenting and preserving community cultural traditions like the Men's Federation of Brothers in Christ \"Singings.\" 2 Excitement was running high in Shady Grove church when I got there for a Federation \"Singing\" held Christmas Sunday, 1983, instead CRM No 5\u20142001 27 of its usual fourth Saturday night. Federation choruses, called by their church names \u2014 Jerusalem, Shady Grove, Welcome Stranger, Progressive Union, New Zion, and Greater Hopewell, performed a \"Singing\" and \"Giving\" monthly. Accompanied by piano, guitar, and sometimes drums, the Federation sang for churchwomen and children, teenage girls, and a few men and boys. If former chorus members \"turned out\" to listen, they were cajoled to sing with their group. Each chorus numbered from five to 10 members, the older the men the fewer their num\u00ad bers. Jerusalem's five members were 45 to 70 years old. Welcome Stranger, the youngest Federation church, had two adult members, the rest were boys. Uncle Armstead, reciting Federation his\u00ad tory, said \"This Federation is not the first Federation in Jerusalem. This Federation is only seven years old. They had a Federation when I was a young man...(1930-1940)....\" The Federation president's wife struck up piano chords and the men began to march in from the back of the church down the center aisle, in a swaying, side-to-side motion, singing as they came. We... Come this far... by Faith... Leaning on the Lord and I'm trusting...his holy word...Ohhhh...I can't...turn around...He never failed sings]... never failed me... Yet! The president spoke first, \"warmin up the peoples\" and \"gettin the Spirit to movin'.\" Throughout, piano chords punctuated the deliv\u00ad ery, men exclaimed \"Well!\" and women shook tambourines. In call and response, people answered \"Amen\" with \"Amen\" and echoed cries for \"Mercy.\" Brother Chaplain, followed, after \"linin\"' a hymn,^ he began singing \"I Love Jesus\" in a strong voice. Onlookers and the choruses sang back, \"Nothing...but...the Righteous,\" call and refrain, ending in unison, \"Shall...see...God....\" \"Let the Church say Amen!\" he called the church to prayer: Let us say Amen again!... You know we here tonight to lift the name of Jesus...Amen? You know we gotta' lots to be thankful for tonight!...AMEN?... The Lord done spared us to see the last third Sunday in nineteen hundred and eighty-three... We don't know if we'll meet on another third Sunday or no... We had one member to decease an that was Brother Joe.... This evening our Heavenly Father... The Father of Abraham,...Isaac and Jacob... We trying to give kind and sincere thanks for you keeping... Us in the world until this present time.... Holy Father I know you heard me pray a long time ago... We believe if we pray and pray right you'll hear me pray again... And for that cause we gonna ask you to have mercy.... Holy Father we wantah pray tonight that you would go with the sick and flicted ones... The lame,...the blind,...the orphans... and widders...Over the land, country and every\u00ad where... We know that you has all power in your Hands... And for that cause we gonna ask you to have mercy. So it went until the piano chords softly ended and people fell silent. Then the men sang mightily. Songs included I'm Climbing Up the Rough Side of the Mountain and There is Power in the Blood. They followed with I'm Pressin On, Holding On to My Faith and Leaning on the Everlasting Arms, and other songs. They closed with \"the Holy Spirit ran from heart to heart and from breast to breast.\" Each pastor spoke briefly after the \"Singing,\" then came the \"Giving.\" The audience marched counter clockwise around the church to give their \"offering.\" Federation men gave out boxes [of food] and \"checks\" to elders with few or no relatives, the disabled, hospitalized or \"burned out\" [of their home], to families without bread\u00ad winners. They gave to the \"widders and orphans,\" the \"downcast and oppressed,\" and 'flicted ones,\" the \"poor and the needy,\" we had prayed for earlier, begging for the Holy Father's mercy, now delivering it through the Federation's grace. The Federation is no more, but a call to cousin Georgie informed me that about four years ago a group of six choirs formed the Heavenly Visions Federated Choirs of Marion and Citrus Counties. The new group includes choirs from Jerusalem, Welcome Stranger, Progressive Union, White Star from Orange Lake and the Dunellon Male Choir of New Second Bethel Church members. They perform each 28 CRM No 5\u20142001 Men's Federation of Brothers In Christ Banner Thanksgiving Singing, 1983, New Jerusalem Baptist Church, Jerusalem, Florida. Photo by the author. fourth Saturday night. Georgie says \"they leave the offering with the host church and the Brothers help out choir members who are in need.\"4 So the cultural form continues in the present. In 1998, at the Progressive National Baptist Convention (PNBC)I heard \"warm up\" speeches and prayers in the Federation genre. A \"Giving\" ceremony by the Revelation Corporation followed in the mutual-aid tradition of the African-American church. The Revelation is a 20 mil\u00ad lion member \"buying pool\" of the PNBC, Christian Methodist Episcopal and African Methodist Episcopal church conferences and the National Baptist Convention, USA Inc. Revelation offers members a consumer credit net\u00ad work for $4.95/month, funneling the proceeds back into the community, 30% each to partici\u00ad pating churches, church-supported schools and the balance into a first-time home buyer's mort\u00ad gage assistance fund. That day, four historically black colleges, selected by the denominations, each received $100,000. The post-bellum records of Freedman's Savings and Trust Company document that church-based mutual aid societies met the social welfare needs of newly freed African Americans. Well into the 1940s, such groups fulfilled these functions, a tradition that continues. In 1983, 42% of Florida church people interviewees reported belonging to mutual aid societies. Contemporary Washington, DC, church pro\u00ad grams care for \"downcast,\" homeless, \"sick,\" AIDS victims, substance abusers, and other \"'flicted ones.\" This ethnography shows that church-based cultural performances and \"Giving\" ceremonies do more than reinforce passive acceptance of an uncertain existence, as anthropologist Clifford Geertz might suggest.^ Like Abner Cohen, I hold that through such everyday acts, subordinated people express resistance and create informal institutions mitigating the effects of socio-eco\u00ad nomic inequities. For many younger African Americans and people of other cultural heritages, our churches are simply buildings, often without the structural integrity for a National Register nomination. For them, appreciation of such structures as ethno\u00ad graphic resources may be of little significance without this kind of insight into their cultural meaning.

CRM No 5\u20142001 29 Donald G. Callaway Methods used in Ethnographic Inquiry in Alaska The state of Alaska comprises about 364 million acres (or about 21 % of the total acreage of the lower 48 states) of which an amazing two thirds are in federal conservation units (e.g., parks and wildlife refuges). In 1994. the Alaska Department of Fish and Game estimated that humans harvested and consumed about 53-1/2 million pounds of wildlife resources within the state of Alaska.1 This poundage does not include the enormous commercial harvest of resources such as fish. Alaska's population is extremely skewed with respect to residence. About 80% of Alaska's 550,000 residents live in the major metropolitan areas of Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau. The remaining 20%, or about 120,000 individuals, live in about 200 small rural communities. The vast majority of these communities have less than 300 people. The 20% of the state's population that is \"rural\" harvests about 44 million pounds (or about 80%) of the total wildlife consumed each year. Although large amounts of resources, espe\u00ad cially fish, are taken from state lands, it is reason\u00ad able to estimate that about 30 million pounds of wildlife resources are extracted from lands man\u00ad aged by federal resource managers.

In the huge areas of the sub-arctic and arctic regions, regulating the harvest of wildlife resources on a day-to-day basis often devolves to the local communities and their customary and traditional practices. Commun\u00ad ities and regional entities often request that their local knowledge of a resource be included in resource management decisions. For their part, most land managers realize that to achieve their conservation objectives and to be effective man\u00ad agers require the incorporation of local percep\u00ad tions and values in their management decisions. It is at this interface that cultural anthropologists can make substantial contributions. Integral to all this discussion is the aware\u00ad ness that management of natural resources is a process framed by social attitudes, cultural beliefs, multiple jurisdictions, and a variety of vested economic and political interests. Ethnography and other social science methodolo\u00ad gies can help us to understand and communicate the importance of these vested interests to resource managers. Intimate knowledge of traditional resource use will allow National Park Service managers to respond to stakeholders in culturally appro\u00ad priate ways.2 Ethnographic Community Studies The 1994 draft report, \"Ecosystem Management in the National Park Service,\" rec\u00ad ommends that the National Park Service: Initiate broader data collection to assess bet\u00ad ter the needs, attitudes, and values of local communities. This should include census data, Department of Commerce data, state and private economic data, intensive stake\u00ad holder surveys, and ethnographic assessments. Data should be coordinated between agencies and other partners to improve quality and access. 30 CRM No 5\u20142001 In Alaska, the National Park Service (NPS) has employed a variety of anthropological methodologies to obtain local and regional infor\u00ad mation critical to resource management decisions. Standard ethnographies have been commissioned by the NPS and other agencies to provide a detailed contextual understanding of individual communities. For example, Nuvendaltin Quht'ana, The People ofNondalton, co-authored by an anthropologist and a former Dena'ina park ranger, provides an in-depth description of numerous top\u00ad ics including Dena'ina environment, population shifts to sedentism, kinship and band organization, and a detailed consideration of \"Living with the Land: The Inland Dena'ina Year.\" There have also been a number of ethnographic overviews and assessments, described by Mason and Cohen in another paper in this anthology that have topi\u00ad cal specialists provide a com\u00ad prehensive overview of the existing anthropological litera ture on a particular group or community affiliated with an Alaskan park or preserve. Survey Research These ethnographic details\u2014when coupled with information collected from anthropological survey research of the harvest, processing, and distribution of wildlife resources\u2014provide invaluable validation of Dena'ina rights to harvest resources on conservation units. They also pro\u00ad vide resource managers with the details of tradi\u00ad tional practices that can be linked to western management practices of setting of seasons (when to harvest resources) and bag limits (amount that can be harvested).

In this case, it illustrates the more formal social science methods of survey research. Oral Histories Other anthropological methodologies include the collection of oral histories. In some cases traditional life histories are recorded and transcribed. Normally in this process an elder or other informant selects incidents, topics, and themes from their life to recount with very little prompting from the anthropologist. Often life histories are followed by more systematic consid\u00ad eration of specific topics, e.g., the location of tra\u00ad ditional use areas. The Oral History Program at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, in collaboration with the NPS, has in a number of instances turned these oral histories into \"project jukeboxes.\" A group of oral histories from a specific community (or on a specific topic) are integrated into a multimedia package that is returned to the community. The oral history tapes are digitized, indexed, and are linked (using HTML) with photos, maps, or video clips. Anyone in the community, but espe\u00ad cially students, can access these files using a com\u00ad puter. The student may listen to the elder's life history from beginning to end, view the tran\u00ad script in English, view photos of the elder or the elder's extended family, search topically through all the oral histories for specific issues or view maps with place names that include hypertext links to a pronunciation of that name or may contain a narrative about that place. Place Name Data The NPS has also supported the collection and digitizing of extensive place name data. James Kari's work among Athabascan groups in Alaska is a premier example of this kind of work. For example, his \"Native Place Names Mapping in Denali National Park and Preserve\"^ invento\u00ad ries and identifies 1,650 features for five Alaska Native groups associated with Denali National Park and Preserve. Index maps show how the Athabaskan language boundaries transect the park area and describe numerous rule-driven fea\u00ad tures of Athabaskan place names, e.g., Athabascans virtually never name places after people. In addition, Kari demonstrates that place names occur in place name networks, where names with similar structural and semantic prop\u00ad erties are inter-linked across huge bio-regions and shows how Athabaskan place names function as signs on a mental map and are vital for orienta\u00ad tion in the band's large land use area. Kari notes: There are numerous rule-driven features of the names that facilitate memorization. There is an economy of naming that emphasizes the mas\u00ad ter stream drainage system and the cluster of a couple of names around prominent features. Some of the place name data has been digi\u00ad tized, is available through GIS, and allows resource managers, for example, to apprehend traditional use areas. Similar place name investi\u00ad gations are being carried out by Tom Thorton with Tlingit informants in southeast Alaska. Special Topics, Traditional Knowledge Several ethnographic inquires have been directed toward specific topics. For example, the documentation of plant use by communities in the Lake Clark area used a variety of methods including surveys, key informant interviews, and mapping.7 The impact of NPS regulations on traditional cabin use in Denali8 and traditional knowledge of brown bears on the Seward Peninsula^ utilized key informants and partici\u00ad pant observation. Other projects, not yet finalized, include: a network analysis of the production and dis\u00ad tribution networks for subsistence resources within communities in northwest Alaska. This project employed harvest surveys, genealogies, historical census data and sophisticated multi\u00ad variate cluster analysis to demonstrate the fun\u00ad damental importance of kin networks in the harvest and sharing of wildlife resources. a comprehensive study of the use of gull eggs by the Tlingit in southeast Alaska is providing wonderful insights into the traditional use, preservation and conservation of glucous winged gull populations by the community of Hoonah. Summary Anthropologists in Alaska employ a multi- method approach to research. This approach combines ethnographic narrative, a solid descrip\u00ad tive cornerstone which often presents the com\u00ad munity point of view with formal survey research designs that provide representative quantitative data.

Rachel Mason and Janet Cohen The Subsistence-Flavored Ethnography of the Alaska Region In Alaska, state and federal laws regu\u00ad late the harvest of wild food for per\u00ad sonal or family consumption. Controversy\" has flared for decades over the proper management of these subsistence harvests. The 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) gave a prior\u00ad ity for subsistence harvests to rural residents. In 1989, a Ninth Circuit Court decision declared that under the Alaska constitution, all state resi\u00ad dents should have equal access to harvests for personal use. Because of the state's failure to com\u00ad ply with federal law, the Federal Subsistence Management Program was established in 1990 to manage wildlife hunting on federal public lands under the terms of ANILCA. The program expanded in 1999 to include fisheries in naviga\u00ad ble waters. As a federal landholder, the National Park Service is, with the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Forest Service, one of the five lead agencies in the interagency Federal Subsistence Management Program. Since its inception, the federal subsistence program has recognized the need for cultural anthropologists and their ethnographic expertise in documenting traditional uses of wild foods. In addition to ethnographic projects for specific park units, Park Service ethnographers are regu\u00ad larly asked to provide technical assistance to the federal program. Frequently this is rapid, policy- directed research that tends to synthesize and review other anthropologists' work. This article describes some of these research projects. Customary and Traditional Uses One such type of research is to collect and analyze data for Customary and Traditional (C&T) Use Determinations. Proposals for these determinations request that a particular com\u00ad munity or group of communities within a CRM No 5\u20142001 33 Fishwheel on the Yukon Charley River, Interior Alaska. geographic area be identified as having C&T subsistence use of an individual resource; for example, brown bear, or resource category, such as all fresh water fish. A positive find\u00ad ing gives residents of the community a sta\u00ad tus as federally-quali\u00ad fied rural subsistence users. Typically, the analysis emphasizes past and present har\u00ad vest levels and use areas, but also includes a range of ethnographic data as part of the factors used to evaluate eligi\u00ad bility as a Customary and Traditional resource user. These factors include, for example, informa\u00ad tion on traditional means of harvesting and pro\u00ad cessing food, handing down knowledge from generation to generation, sharing of subsistence foods, and reliance on a variety offish and wildlife resources which provide substantial nutritional, economic, and cultural elements to the community. Research for C&T determina\u00ad tions depends heavily on the community profiles database and technical report series maintained by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Division of Subsistence. The ethnographer com\u00ad pleting the analysis does not work in isolation, but must coordinate with state and federal biolo\u00ad gists as well as work closely with the proposal's proponents. C&T proposals, along with other regulatory proposals, are submitted by individual subsistence users, local advisory groups, tribal entities, government agencies, and special interest groups. 13.44 Permitting under ANILCA Another type of ethnographic work assist\u00ad ing both park managers and the federal subsis\u00ad tence program identifies park resident zone com\u00ad munities and individuals eligible for 13.44 per\u00ad mits. The intent of Congress in ANILCA was to limit eligibility for subsistence activities in national parks to local rural residents with a per\u00ad sonal or family history of using park resources. Resident zones authorize all permanent residents within these zones to participate in subsistence activities on NPS lands without a subsistence use permit. Section 13.44 of Title VIII, the portion of ANILCA dealing with subsistence, states that individuals who reside outside of the resident zone communities, who can demonstrate a cus\u00ad tomary and traditional use of park subsistence resources, may apply to the superintendent for a \"13.44\" permit allowing subsistence use activities within a park. Ethnographers also document tra\u00ad ditional means of access to parks in order to help inform managers regarding issues of access and associated user conflicts. For example, airplanes are not typically considered a traditional means of access to subsistence resources, but in certain cases, such as the community of Yakutat's use of Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, communities have been able to show that air\u00ad planes are the only practical and safe means of access to their traditional harvest areas. Traditional Ecological Knowledge The Federal Subsistence Management Program oversees a Fisheries Research and Monitoring Program. One category of research that the program supports is the collection of Traditional Ecological Knowledge. Anthro\u00ad pologists work closely with subsistence users (elders and other knowledgeable harvesters) to document their lifelong observations about par\u00ad ticular resources. This information, combined with western biological data, can help address subsistence management and resource conserva\u00ad tion issues. Ethnographic Overview and Assessment As in other park service regions, Ethnographic Overview and Assessments (EOA) are carried out in Alaska parks. The objective here is to synthesize and summarize existing data and identify gaps in the available ethnographic information about groups affiliated with the parks. This study aims to enlighten park staff and others about affiliated groups and ethnographic needs. In recent years, Alaska Native tribes have played a larger role in designing and implement\u00ad ing these studies. For example, in the EOA cur\u00ad rently being completed for Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, two of the commu\u00ad nities associated with the park elected to produce their own community histories as part of the larger report. The remainder was conducted under a three-way contract with the Copper River Native Association, the regional tribal orga\u00ad nization serving Ahtna villages in the Copper 34 CRM No 5\u20142001 Woman pro\u00ad cessing bearded sealhide in northern Alaska. Photos courtesy NPS Alaska Support Office. River Basin. EOAs and other larger ethnographic studies, although not specifically designed to address subsistence management issues, can be and often are utilized to inform the regulatory process. Consultation and Collaboration Similar to anthropologists in other park ser\u00ad vice regions, much of our work does involve con\u00ad sultation and collaboration with the groups that policy decisions affect. Since most of the burning issues in Alaska have to do with subsistence, we are regularly brought into contact with tribes and Native corporations, formally established subsis\u00ad tence advisory groups, and a variety of organiza\u00ad tions representing other groups whose use of wild foods for commercial or recreational purposes directly competes with subsistence uses. Many of our collaborations and consultations have short- term objectives related to management decisions. Of course, longer term relationships, or the potential for them, are also established. Because of contacts formed in the subsistence context, ethnographers are in a particularly good position to develop community partnerships and serve as a liaison between the public and the National Park Service. Because of the need to focus on specific subsistence issues, we tend to concentrate research efforts on levels of harvest and resource use areas, rather than on other aspects of social life. This is not to say that we, or Alaska Natives, think of subsistence as primarily an economic activity. On the contrary, the harvest of wild foods is significant far beyond its nutritional or economic value; it is inseparable from other aspects of culture. The language of Title VIII (e.g., Sections 801 and 802) clearly shows ANILCAs intent to protect the subsistence way of life as a whole. Ethnographic Landscapes The ethnography program has many links to the cultural landscapes program. Currently we are coordinating ethnographic projects with cul\u00ad tural landscape reports at Klondike-Gold Rush National Historical Park and at Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. Additionally, the ethnographers and cultural landscapes staff are presently collaborating on an international study of ethnographic landscapes in the circumpolar north. Conclusion Many still consider Alaska the \"Last Frontier\" because of its vast stretches of remote and seemingly untouched wilderness. Alaska's size and the amount of park land make it a symbolic battleground for issues of preservation versus resource development. Ethnographers can make valuable contributions to wilderness planning efforts by, for example, reminding others that wilderness is itself a cultural construct. The fed\u00ad eral subsistence program is mandated to give rural residents priority in harvesting subsistence foods. This priority can be a bone of contention both to wilderness defenders and to commercial developers. Alaskan ethnographers have an important role in the federal subsistence program. In collab\u00ad oration with scientists, managers, and local com\u00ad munities, we contribute information for short- term management decisions and conduct more conventional ethnographic research projects. Ultimately, all the types of research contribute to the broader and longer term goal of document\u00ad ing, revealing, and preserving Native Alaskan and other subsistence lifeways.

Photo courtesy Palau Division of Cultural Affairs. The ethnography/oral history pro\u00ad gram of the Historic Preservation Office (HPO) of the Republic of Palau is con\u00ad cerned primarily with the documentation and preservation of traditional knowledge about both cultural practices and significant archeological, traditional, and historic sites within Palau. Because the people of Palau recognize that they are subject to the pressures of globalization and culture change, it has become increasingly important to them that they find ways to actively preserve their tangible and intangible cultural properties. The HPO's Historic Preservation Program enjoys a measure of support within the community, and is actively working to expand its community base. The HPO is also concerned with making traditional knowledge available to a larger audience through publications and com\u00ad munity programming to stimulate discussion and motivate action. The next decade will witness massive change in Palau, and the problem of how Palauans respond to acculturative pressures within the global environment is paramount. Prior to the establishment of the Division of Cultural Affairs (which incorporates the HPO), McKnight1 conducted some anthropo\u00ad logical research in Palau for the Trust Territory government. Even earlier, Endo, followed by Kramer,* conducted research in Palau under the auspices of the Japanese and German administra\u00ad tions. While these efforts help to provide a valu\u00ad able background for today's work, they were not carried out guided by local needs. Present work in historic preservation is conceived and directed by Palauans. Local people set priorities based on an indigenous understanding of what is valued and what has the potential to make the greatest contribution to preserving Palau's traditional cul\u00ad ture. The objectives of the oral history/ethnogra\u00ad phy program are in keeping with the broader objectives of the preservation ethic. However, they are first of all objectives developed to benefit the Palauan people. The ethnography/oral history section of the HPO arranges regular sessions of the Society of Historians. The Historians are officially recog\u00ad nized as living national treasures by the Republic of Palau because they are repositories of knowl\u00ad edge about Palau's history and traditions. The Historians are appointed by the HPO, in consul\u00ad tation with the president of the Republic and the state government. A Historian, either male or female, is appointed from each state. The objec\u00ad tive is to select someone who is knowledgeable and respected throughout the community. They are drawn from the ranks of the elders of the community and are appointed for life. They are not actually a part of the Division of Cultural Affairs, but they work closely with the ethnogra\u00ad phy section. Every year, the Historians gather under the auspices of the section to discuss an aspect of tra\u00ad ditional knowledge. This year, for example, they completed a booklet on the topic of medicine and therapy. To date, the subjects chosen have been drawn from the publication, Rechuodel Volume 1. This work was produced by the Society of Historians and the meetings are intended to provide an opportunity for the Historians to expand and improve the chapters. The results of the meetings are published by topic in booklet form, in both Palauan and English. It is problematic to attempt to record an oral tradition in written form, since the informa- 36 CRM No 5\u20142001 tion is disputed, and because the very act of writ\u00ad ing changes the nature of the information. This is a challenging problem and indicative of the changing nature of Palauan society. It is impor\u00ad tant to produce these works for a number of rea\u00ad sons. They stimulate discussion about these tradi\u00ad tions within the community. This helps to ensure that younger people are exposed to these ideas. The documents themselves help to teach younger people about their traditions, and encourage them to ask the elders of the community to explain and clarify. The meetings of the Historians and the publication of the booklets mean that these tradi\u00ad tional methods and ideas are preserved, so that even if they are not passed down orally, they are still available to be studied and perhaps revived by present and future generations of Palauans. The ethnography/oral history section works closely with the survey and inventory section for the preservation of important cultural sites. When a development project submits an application for historic clearance it is often the case that the sur\u00ad vey section must inspect the site. Sometimes, they request the ethnography section to assist the sur\u00ad vey section in determining land ownership and use. This entails tracking down knowledgeable individuals and learning from them the traditions of mythology, use, and history for a site or prop\u00ad erty. Sometimes, slightly different or even com\u00ad peting versions of oral history will emerge. It is the job of the ethnography section to assess and present this information in such a way that the most complete oral history emerges. This work is particularly challenging and important when undocumented burial sites are discovered. Determining the lineage affiliation of the deceased is sensitive and controversial, due to dis\u00ad putes over land tenure. When the oral history has been collected, it is included in the report on site significance issued by the survey section and thus plays a role in the negotiations with the developer to issue a memorandum of agreement (MOA) regarding the site. The MOA usually provides for mitigation measures that allow for archeological investigation of the site, although at times the final outcome is full or partial preservation of the site. The other joint undertaking between the ethnography section and the survey section is the annual state historic and cultural resource survey. The objective of the survey is to document tradi\u00ad tional and historic sites so that they are identified and protected from accidental harm by develop\u00adment projects. The ethnography section's respon\u00ad sibility is to collate and expand documented tradi\u00ad tional knowledge and oral history that relates to historical and cultural resources in the targeted state. This will help to identify sites for nomina\u00ad tion to the Palau Register of Historic Sites, and allow the Division of Cultural Affairs to identify which sites are endangered by proposed develop\u00ad ment. Beyond that, these oral histories are inher\u00ad ently valuable and in danger of being lost. By col\u00ad lecting them, the Division of Cultural Affairs is taking steps to ensure that the traditional knowl\u00ad edge of Palau is preserved and available for future generations. An important goal of the Division is to make the information we collect available to the public. The information collected during the state survey is published internally and is open to pub\u00ad lic inspection. The most prominent undertaking is the distribution of publications on topics of tra\u00ad ditional lifeways, social organization, skills and practices. Initially, the Division published a num\u00ad ber of volumes in English as part of the Micronesian Resources Study, along with Palauan language volumes devoted to culture and history. Subsequently, the Palauan language works have served as the basis for the production of a series of booklets addressing various aspects of Palauan tra\u00ad ditions and social organization. All of these publi\u00ad cations are made available to schools, non-govern\u00ad mental organizations, government offices, and other appropriate agencies. The purpose of dis\u00ad seminating these works is to stimulate discussion and debate about Palauan culture, especially among students. It is accepted that the various publications are not definitive, and it is hoped that the public will respond with constructive criticisms. Clearly, the research undertaken by the Division is of a limited scope. However, it has revealed the degree to which traditional knowl\u00ad edge and values are still preserved in the rural communities of Palau. While Palau is subject to extensive acculturative forces, there is ample evi\u00ad dence that culture change in Palau is not mono\u00ad lithic. In contemporary Palau, the people are aware of the importance of their Palauan identity and of the role that their traditions play in creat\u00ad ing and maintaining that identity. As develop\u00ad ment proceeds here, so does the consciousness of its potential effects on lifeways and values. The completion of the compact road will open up the rural areas of the nation to outlandish ideas, con- CRM No 5\u20142001 37 sumer society, and economic transformation. The response of the people to these events, and the way in which they choose to adapt their society to cope with change, will want close watching.

Ana Dittmar Tourism and Native Cultures Guam and American Samoa, two Western Pacific islands with U.S. national parks, are influenced by toutism in vastly different ways. Both native cultutes pride themselves in their beautiful natural environ\u00ad ments and cultural identities. Both persistently value and desire to continue their native tradi\u00ad tions in the face of change, yet Guam has the influences of a 500-year-long history of colonial\u00ad ism while the physical and cultural environment on American Samoa has been touched more lightly. Both islands and traditional cultures are attractive destinations for tourists because of their tropical marine ecology and Pacific Island lifestyles. Contrasting responses to the tourist industry are apparent between these two Pacific islands whose native cultures both neighbor and interact with the U.S. National Park Service.

Chamorros comprise about 40% of Guam's pop\u00ad ulation, many of whom are employed by the island's most influential industry, tourism. The U.S. National Park Service on Guam also employs Chamorros at all levels, approximately 50% of theit small patk staff. Japanese toutists make up about 75% of the park's visitors to whom War in the Pacific National Historical Park must interpret both the events of Wo fid War II as well as Guam's traditional native her\u00ad itage and marine island ecology. Tourism on Guam is far-reaching, long-term, and historically based in its colonial past. Efforts to preserve the natural environment and traditional Chamorro culture swim against the established tide, but has gained a foothold on Guam. On American Samoa, eco-tourism with its mainstay concepts of sustainability and sensitivity to the cultutal and natural environment has been adopted by the U.S. National Park Service there. Used to adapt visitors to the native Samoan lifestyle, park literature instructs visitors in how to not offend native residents and to have mini\u00ad mal impact on their traditional culture and nat\u00ad ural environment. With their innovative Home Stay Program, the National Park of American Samoa invites tourists to participate in village life while Samoans associated with the park set theit own fees for accommodations and accompanying traditional activities. This is only the beginning of eco-tourism in the Western Pacific but repre\u00ad sents native cultures seeking tourism on their own terms. Perhaps the results will be a better response to the challenge of preserving native integrity and the natutal world.

Stone Changing Views, Cultural Survival Knowledge and Power in the Marshall Islands Traditional outrig\u00ad ger canoe, c.1900. Francis Bacon's insight that \"knowl\u00ad edge is power\" is as meaningful today in the Marshall Islands, and elsewhere, as it was in 16th-century England. For over 2,500 years the Marshallese people accrued an immense body of knowledge that allowed them to survive in an environment containing few natural resources. In the past, when Marshallese people and culture were more isolated, those who controlled this information kept it concealed because knowledge represented power. The position of the traditional chief, known as irooj, was sanctioned and empowered through his knowledge. This belief and practice were reflected linguistically in the He may not have known \"everything\" but he did control the knowledge available and regarded as worthwhile in his com\u00ad munity. Chiefs achieved control by surrounding themselves with those who had specialized knowledge. By controlling them, he displayed his power. Historically, the irooj assembled accom\u00ad plished individuals into a nitijela (pit of knowl\u00ad edge). This group was composed of a diviner, medicine person, navigator, fishing master, genealogist, storyteller, sorcerer, magician, and warrior. It was the chief's abil\u00ad ity to gather these experts around him, and control their use of knowledge that added to his power. Individual partici\u00ad pants in the nitijela, enhanced their own power and their fami\u00ad lies' status. In 1914, August Erdland wrote that knowledge concern\u00ad ing Marshallese astronomy, for example, was a valuable inheri\u00ad tance which no one outside the particular family group could possess.^ Knowledge and the associated navigational skills were considered familial trea\u00adsures that raised the owners' social and political status. The irooj and citizenry alike entrusted themselves to the leadership of the experienced navigators whose knowledge of the stars, clouds, and waves enabled only them to determine the position of the atolls and predict the weather. The navigator enjoyed privileges that were other\u00ad wise reserved only for the irooj and ruler class. Therefore, to ensure a higher social station and a better inheritance for their progeny, the naviga\u00ad tors, as well as other members of the nitijela, con\u00ad cealed the substance of their science. Today, with increased external influences, the shift from traditional rural to urban living, and the availability of new technologies, tradi\u00ad tional knowledge and its control no longer offer the same prestige. As \"western\" values replace or diminish Marshallese traditions and are transmit\u00ad ted to younger generations, both the practice and knowledge of the traditional Marshallese way of life disappear. The available knowledge pool has been fragmented into individual private arenas of practice, with variations among atoll and island groups. Many Marshallese are not aware that tra\u00ad ditions and stories differ among atolls, and that those who \"know\" have little agreement. The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) has much in its favor. It is an independent CRM No 5\u20142001 39 Traditional clothing vs. \"western\" cloth\u00ad ing, c. 1900.

Land tenure is such that it is difficult, if not impossible, for outsiders to own land. Several organizations are collecting and preserving historical information. However, while people elsewhere, say, Hawaii, perceive the adverse effects of external cultural influences, and are joining together to preserve traditional art and customs, the movement is less evident in the RMI. The cultural identity movement on the Hawaiian Islands is currently prompting a revival of traditions. The contemporary phi\u00ad losophy of Hawaiian identity does not base \"Hawaiianness\" on blood quotients, but on the presence of and participation in certain cultural practices. Politically, the revival move\u00ad ment focuses on the repatriation of seized land and reparations for losses, but cul\u00ad turally, beliefs about identity focus on the language, crafts, and performance arts represented by rural Hawaiians.' Native Hawaiians lost much of their land during the last century, and almost lost their language. Nevertheless, the Hawaiian cultural identity remains strong. The Hawaiian Renaissance might hold lessons for the Marshallese. What is evident in the RMI is the gradual \"westernization\" of youth. Children watch \"west\u00ad ern\" television and movies, and play video and computer games. Those living in the urban cen\u00ad ters might be taught more about western ways and ideas than traditional Marshallese culture. Many young people have never been to one of the rural, more traditional, outer islands and have little knowledge of Marshallese history. But, they are exposed to readily available \"western\" ideas and knowledge. On the other hand, much of the traditional Marshallese knowledge is typically held \"secret.\" Ironically, the secrecy that once increased the power and prestige of an irooj and his family is, in many ways, now obsolete. Correspondingly, the transmission of traditional knowledge, the knowledge-based positions of cer\u00ad tain families, and the relationships that once tied youth to knowledgeable elders have weakened. Younger generations are unaware of protected information and its ramifications. Conceivably, under today's conditions, everyone could obtain respect and a sense of con\u00ad trol over cultural information if the learned peo\u00ad ple shared their traditional knowledge and mod\u00ad ern technology made it readily available. Although sharing unique knowledge might not have been characteristically Marshallese, the future might bring schools\u2014modern equivalents of knowledge pits or nitijela\u2014where Marshallese elders can teach younger generations the tradi\u00ad tional methods of navigation, astronomy, fishing, medicine, crafts, dancing, and maanpa, the tradi\u00ad tional Marshallese art of self-defense. At least tra\u00ad ditional arts could be preserved and possibly revived, and knowledgeable elders could be accorded special recognition, if value can be placed on public knowledge and not private knowledge. In this case, \"external\" educational ideals could prove valuable.

NPS photo. Canyon de Chelly National Monument, in Arizona, is on land that belongs to the Navajo Nation, which manages the monument jointly with the Park Service. The monument is the only one on Indian-owned land and was one of the first to have an Indian super\u00ad intendent, Herbert Yazhe, a member of the Navajo Tribe. The monument was created in 1931, but Navajos have occupied it for centuries. Today, more than 60 families still occupy and use their family lands in the canyon and around its rim. They try to live their lives amid the stares of thousands of tourists who crowd the luxury motels and campgrounds of neighboring Chinle by night and tour the canyon by day. The monu\u00ad ment has one concessioner, Thunderbird Lodge, whose huge trucks bring most tourists into the canyon. Other tourists pay Navajo guides to escort them into the canyon on foot, on horse\u00ad back, or in the tourists' own vehicle. Tourists aren't allowed into the canyon without a Navajo guide, and guiding pro\u00ad vides a living for mem\u00ad bers of several canyon families that partly com\u00ad pensates for the disrup\u00ad tion of daily activities by the tourists, who collec\u00ad tively may spend almost as many person-days in the canyons during the year as all the residents combined. In the spring of 1990, as employees of the Navajo Nation's Historic Preservation Department, we interviewed several Navajos for a small ethnographic research project on the monument partly funded by the National Park Service (NPS). The purpose was to identify places of particular cultural significance and concern to Navajos who live in and use the monument. Later, we received more NPS fund\u00ad ing for more interviewing, which we did in the early summer of 1992. Limits on time and money in both phases of this project allowed us to interview a total of 16 people, a group too small to represent a cross section of resident families and others who use the canyon and its rims for Navajo cultural pur\u00ad poses. To get as wide a range of information as possible, we tried to talk to people with as many different interests in the canyon as possible. The group includes residents of different parts of the monument, non-resident users, medicine people, guides, women and men, old and relatively young, people interested mainly in the Navajo occupation in the last few centuries, and others interested mainly in the canyon's role in Navajo ceremonialism. 41 CRM No 5\u20142001 Navajo sheep grazing near Junction ruins, the cliff masonry construction by earlier American Indian people at Canyon de Chelly, Arizona. NPS photo. We learned about people to interview from Mr. Yazhe and his staff, many of whom belong to canyon families. We also knew of people from our previous work around Navajoland and from one of the authors' having grown up in the neighboring community of Chinle. Our interviews were unstructured, the only comfortable way for the people whose help we sought. The Navajo regard for esoteric knowl\u00ad edge as personal power not to be given away for free resembles, but is much older than, the mod\u00ad ern legal notion of \"intellectual property.\" So in requesting help from such people, you must not only offer a fee, but also let the person control the conversation. That way, everyone is more likely to enjoy it. Most of the interviews occurred at people's homes, where we used maps and recorded place names to identify the locations of significant places and events. Some interviews occurred on tours of parts of the two branches of the canyon, Canyon de Chelly and Canyon del Muerto, and around the rims. Two people were interviewed both at homes and later on a tour. Most of the interviewees, both at homes and on tours, were recorded on audio tape, usually in Navajo. We have produced English transcripts of these tapes. These transcripts gave us one of the most important insights to result from this study: that the interview setting affects what people tell, especially how they convey cultural geography. On a tour, the route itself dictates the sequence in which the person identifies particular places. At home, the person is more likely to mention places by telling a story or ceremonial sequence that interconnects a group of places. Actually travelling on the land, then, ironically minimizes the conceptual connections among places that bind them into cultur\u00ad ally-constructed landscapes. Tours are essential, though, to pin down exact locations of many places, to help peo\u00ad ple recall more places than they would at home, and to prompt visualized, and the more detailed, accounts of what happened at cer\u00ad tain places. Talking about places in these two types of settings, it turns out, approximates how the peo\u00ad ple themselves learned about many places: an older person (grandparent, medicine person) at home would tell the learner about the place, often in the context of a story, and would identify it by name, describe its appearance and situation. The learner would actually visit the place some other time, alone or with the older person or someone else who had already been there and perhaps had more to tell about it. We noticed another interesting pattern. The canyon residents we interviewed, not surprisingly, emphasized places within their own customary use areas. More surprisingly, they told different stories about widely-known sacred places in those areas than non-residents told about those same places. The non-residents referred to stories known all over Navajoland about the origin of particular Navajo ceremonies, beliefs, and cus\u00ad toms. They referred specifically to the episodes of these stories that occurred at particular places in the canyon. The residents told about encounters between family members and immortal person\u00ad ages (\"Holy People\") or unusual manifestations of power that go with these places according to the widely known origin stories. The residents' stories linked the family through personal experi- 4: CRM No 5\u20142001 Canyon de Chelly White House Ruins, Navajo jewelry seller, and tourist. Photo by Klara Kelley. ences with the forces of Navajo creation. The cus\u00ad tomary use areas are geographical zones embody\u00ad ing a family's history, and at these places they articulate with larger, more extensive landscapes relating to Navajo origins. The different emphases of residents and nonresidents are neces\u00ad sary to see the various culturally-constructed landscapes and how they overlap and intersect. There seems to be a comparable difference in per\u00ad spectives of residents and nonresidents on the relation of the canyon to more recent Navajo his\u00ad tory, especially that of the 18th and 19th cen\u00ad turies when the canyon was a major Navajo refuge from Spanish, Mexican, and U.S. armies and slave raiders, both non-Indian and Indian. We have also compared the list of the places identified by the eight people we interviewed in 1990 with those in a manuscript inventory of places in Canyon de Chelly (not del Muerto) sent to us by Professor Stephen Jett (University of California, Davis). The manuscript is based on the literature of two decades of intensive work of Professor Jett and Mr. Chauncey Neboyia, a life\u00ad long canyon resident and guide, and William Morgan, a Navajo specialist in linguistics. Our little Phase I study identified 41 places, 32 (80%) of which correspond to 35 (25%) of the 139 places that Jett and Neboyia identify. In view of the great differences in time and effort between the two studies, the overlap is surprisingly high. It is probably best explained by the extensive web of kinship among canyon residents and by every\u00ad one's use of the same routes into and out of the canyon. Most of the people who talked with us emphasized their struggle to keep Navajo cus\u00ad tomary uses of the canyon alive in the face of the escalating tourist onslaught; armed pothunters sneaking into the backcountry; escalating erosion from vehicle traffic in the canyons and timber cutting in the Navajo forest; and dwindling inter\u00ad est in Navajo ways of life among young Navajos. As a canyon resident and medicine man told us, It's good that people are teaching the children tradition again. We've learned what happens when we forget our culture. We have experi\u00ad enced lots of bad things, the rains have gone and stayed away, the plants don't grow as they used to. Our livestock are few and weak. That is our mainstay in life, our livestock and the land...Now there are those of you who have started talking about these things and are try\u00ad ing to do something about it to help us...You are just starting out, beginning the ceremony After a while it will be good...With these pro\u00ad grams, involve the people, us people also, we would like to have input into these things.

In June 1992, representatives from nine tribes of the Olympic Peninsula region formed the Olympic Peninsula Intertribal Cultural Advisory Committee. The tribes are the Elwha Makah. Committee members, delegated by each tribe, meet at different reservations on alternate months, to fulfill their mission and their commit\u00ad ment to enhance the understanding, preserva\u00ad tion, and continuation of cultural knowledge. A major need the committee intends to fill is the creation of a better understanding of their ways of life for those who do not have a clear per\u00ad spective of the peninsula tribes. \"A tribe consists not only of individuals in traditional roles; a storyteller, basketweaver, or fisherman may also be a mill worker, lawyer, teacher, or government representative. Tribes include people living on and off the reservation, who help their kids with homework and teach traditional knowledge, who pull canoes and handle motorized boats, and who speak English, yet strive to preserve their native language.\"* In 1996, the Olympic Peninsula Intertribal Cultural Advisory Committee and the park cul\u00ad tural anthropologist at Olympic National Park, in Washington State, assumed the task of writing a book that would give read\u00ad ers a foundation for learning about the people who form an integral part of the history and commu\u00ad nity of the Olympic Peninsula today. Such a book would serve Olympic National Park visitors because no existing publica\u00ad tion discusses the sev\u00aderal tribes who have occupied this region for hun\u00ad dreds, if not thousands, of years. The great need for such a book is also evident in the local public and private education system and in the commu\u00ad nity as a whole. The Intertribal Committee applied for, and received, a grant to support this project from the non-profit organization, the National Park Foundation. The committee also competed suc\u00ad cessfully for a National Park Service Challenge Cost Share grant, which they matched by con\u00ad tributing their services on the book as payment in kind. Testimony to their fund\u2014raising skills, the committee had previously received a grant from the National Park Service Historic Preservation Fund to support travel to meetings and training in historic preservation. Together, these funding sources were paramount in facilitating the inter\u00ad tribal work group meetings, editing, obtaining photographs, and defraying travel costs. Each of the committee representatives took the lead in writing particular chapters, which include an overview of tribal history, highlights of contemporary issues, and descriptions of current heritage preservation programs. The reader can anticipate gaining a better understanding of the reservation community and the, until now, little- known opportunities to visit each of them. In addition to the main authors, other tribal cultural specialists assisted with writing, locating pho\u00ad tographs, and conducting research. The park anthropologist served as the volume editor. She worked closely with the committee members to make their chapters consistent, while maintaining their individual characters.

Ruppert New Tribe/Park Partnerships The Use of Ethnobotany in the Restoration of Indigenous Landscapes The cocoa-tree supplies the Indians with bread, water, wine, vinegar, brandy, milk, oil, honey, sugar, needles, thread, linen, clothes, caps, spoons, besoms [brooms], baskets, paper, and nails; timber, coverings for their houses; masts, sails, cordage for their vessels; and medicines for their diseases; and what can be desired more? Cotton Mather, 17201 Uses of plants, and lists or plants, are as old as human history itself. Descriptions of plants as sources of medicine are found on Egyptian scrolls, and in the works of Aristotle as reflected in translations of early Arab texts. The 15th-century herbals of Chinese and Europeans reflect a long history of human knowl\u00ad edge about, and reliance upon, plants for medici\u00ad nal uses. To a large extent, the Reverend Cotton Mather's practical interests in natural history and medicine and respect for New World Indian use of plants indicated in the quotation above reflect a long history of plant use and knowledge by a long line of shamans, curers, and physicians, throughout time, and from all parts of the globe. And to a lesser extent, his list reflects a general knowledge of the many uses of plants that is all but lost to us today. Upon second reading, Mather's impressive catalog of practical uses may be even more remarkable for what it only implies. The list does not speak to the volume, scope, and complexity of traditional technical knowledge that had to exist in order for Indian peoples to make use of the cocoa plant as extensively as they did. It does not provide information on the horticultural sys\u00ad tem that fostered or altered the growth of Theobroma. Nor does it define the important role that the plant undoubtedly played in the tribe's Balsamroot (Balsomorhiza sagittataj was used as a food and medicine and for spiritual purposes by the K'tunaxa (Kootenai) and the Piikani (Blackfeet). social, religious, and cosmological views of the world. Below, a Navajo medicine man speaks to the medicinal use of plants\u2014and also to the broader role and complex purpose of plants in human society. He speaks to human cosmology (origins)\u2014to seeing plants from inside a culture that uses them\u2014to typologies of plant uses\u2014and to connections between plants and other plants, plants and animals, and between plants and people. All plants are medicine, put here by the Holy People. They explained the uses of the plants to the Navajo. Sheep, goats, horses, and cat\u00ad tle eat all of these plants. That is why they are so healthy. There are big medicines and little medicines. The little ones help the big ones like children helping parents. You use the lit\u00ad tle ones when you are not very sick. Anyone can use these. The big medicine's use is known only by the medicine people. You have to pay to use a big medicine because the medicine people have to pay the plants with turquoise.-^ However suggestive, these words are only a brief introduction to the delicate weave of CRM No 5\u20142001 4S complex belief systems and practices that centers on the place of plants in the Navajo worldview. It becomes clear that such human-plant relation\u00ad ships are overlooked by simple lists of plant uses like Mather's. Managing \"Pristine\" Landscapes In part, one underlying motivation for establishing many national park areas has been the preservation of ecosystems that have not been affected by the kinds of human-plant or human- environment relationships described above. Noble though this motivation may seem, it may not be based on demonstrable fact. Population estimates for the North American continent before the arrival of European emigrants vary between a modest two million and a more expan\u00ad sive 18 million (lower estimates may be due to observations resulting from the effects of disease introduced by immigrants, while higher estimates may attempt to neutralize these effects by relying on assessments of available resources that could have supported a larger population). Regardless of the range of estimates, there is little doubt that the forests, plains, and mountain valleys of the continent were by no means \"humanless\" land\u00ad scapes. Rather, prior to the 15th century, they were well-populated by a wide diversity of dis\u00ad tinct linguistic and cultural indigenous groups that had been busy for millennia managing and shaping the floral landscape to ensure their own physical and cultural survival. Much of the con\u00ad tinent at the time of \"discovery\" was very far indeed from what early preservationists viewed as \"wild landscape\" or \"pristine wilderness.\" To what extent Indian peoples managed the land and its resources is open to debate, but there is growing evidence that they used a wide variety of tools and techniques to ensure that subsistence resources would be available for thousands of years. One tool\u2014fire\u2014appears to have been widely used to modify forests, brushlands, grass\u00ad lands, and entire landscapes and ecosystems\u2014to clear forest understory, create more productive wildlife habitat, recycle nutrients, reduce plant competition, and generally increase the size and number of plants for the manufacture of utilitar\u00ad ian items. ^ Obviously, then, the National Park Service is not the first landlord of the \"pristine\" and \"untouched\" landscapes we now call national parks. In fact, in large part due to the profound influence American Indians have had on all levels of biological organization within ecosystems, the very concepts of \"pristine area\" and \"wilderness area\" are now being dismantled. By setting aside protected areas, it is recognized that the Park Service has succeeded in halting disturbances by hordes of arriving immigrants\u2014but it is also rec\u00ad ognized that this very same setting aside has put an end to much of the traditional environmental management of lands and plant communities by indigenous populations. Combining Traditional Plant Ecology with Modern Resource Preservation It is perhaps a bit too simplistic to claim that the confluence of the 19th-century preserva\u00ad tion ethic and the ever-increasing immigrant population of the West gave rise to the establish\u00ad ment of the national park system. Undoubtedly, many factors led to political decisions to set aside large tracts of land in the West. Nevertheless, the preservationist ethic was a motivating factor, and, to a large extent, the government was successful in halting all human use of those lands set aside for protection. But these early preservationist efforts had a tendency to generalize the uses of all human populations as negative. As areas were set aside for protection, the Service sought to remove the presence of all human use from parks. Unfortunately, this effort to halt the tide of devel\u00ad opment by removing all humans from the land\u00ad scape became the means by which indigenous resource management techniques were also removed. In essence, this policy of removal threw the baby out with the bath water. At the time, calling a halt to impacts resulting from western expansion was undoubtedly considered an extra\u00ad ordinary and positive step from the view held by preservationists. But, in the long run, the removal of Indian peoples and indigenous resource man\u00ad agement techniques may prove to be far less advantageous for the long-term preservation of the structure of ecosystems as they had been shaped by thousands of years of use. The fact of environmental manipulation related to cultural practice is not the whole story. As the earlier quote from Cotton Mather illus\u00ad trates, there is more to culture and heritage than the corporeal or material culture that results from specific behavior. The traditional technical knowledge necessary to produce these results is equally important to consider from the stand\u00ad point of cultural preservation. Also important to consider are the roles that these practices played in the worldview of Indian peoples on a tribe- by-tribe basis. The cross section of biology, 46 CRM No 5\u20142001 Camas (Camassia qua- mash) was an important root K'tunaxa and Piikani. The bulbs were col\u00ad lected in large quantities and cooked in large, stone-lined ovens. traditional behavior, and cultural value systems provides a more complete picture of the ethno\u00ad graphic reality\u2014that is, how cultural practice and cultural heritage effects, and is affected by, envi\u00ad ronmental factors. The Role of Ethnobotany in the Restoration of Indigenous Landscapes If American Indian traditional cultural practices were in large part responsible for the very shape and character of the landscape before the arrival of emigrant groups, it would seem important to recognize that the heritage of these indigenous groups should be a major focus of any landscape preservation effort. From this stand\u00ad point, it may be worth comparing methods of restoring selected elements of landscapes (in parks and other federal lands) to those that existed when American Indian peoples were managing them. While early visitors to the American West marveled at its landscapes, and were motivated to pre\u00ad serve what they saw and expe\u00ad rienced, we should be again reminded that these land\u00ad scapes were essentially the product of millennia of eco\u00ad logical and environmental manipulation by American Indian peoples. If the very shape and character of \"wild\" lands that so impressed early preservationists were the products of Indian environ\u00ad mental manipulation, it may well be worth look\u00ad ing at indigenous management techniques that may help restore these landscapes to the condi\u00ad tion they were in when they were set aside. Ethnobotany and ethnobiology offer meth\u00ad ods for not only understanding the condition of specific plant species in landscapes before non- Indian settlement, but also for providing experi\u00ad mental methods that point to the potential restoration of these species to indigenous man\u00ad aged conditions. It is apparent that many North American Indians remain a substantially untapped source of knowledge regarding present and former plant uses, management practices, and vegetation change. While using traditional knowledge systems is not without its problems, it may well be possible to work with Indian peoples to gain greater understanding. Additional studies in the aboriginal use of fire, and irrigating, har\u00ad vesting, pruning, coppicing, and collecting plants, along with manipulating wildlife habitat techniques, would provide the information neces\u00ad sary for attempting such a restoration on a lim\u00ad ited basis in carefully selected areas.7 By combin\u00ad ing natural and cultural research methods such as phytolith analysis, palynology, ethnographic interviews, early landscape descriptions, compari\u00ad son photographs, and early herbarium specimen collections, it may be possible to provide an accu\u00ad rate reconstruction of plant species composition and community structure in selected areas. Such restoration would mean working with contempo\u00ad rary American Indian communities and individu\u00ad als to determine if traditional knowledge of plant horticulture, use, collection, and environmental manipula\u00ad tion has survived decades of acculturation pressure. It would also mean that park managers would have to be willing to enter into a new kind of partnership with American Indian peoples to allow them to apply tradi\u00ad tional techniques to attain such a restoration\u2014even on a limited, experimental basis. The benefits of such efforts on an experimental basis would be many, while the risks would seem to be few. A major benefit for the national park system would be a return of some selected areas in a landscape to a condition approximating what they were in at the time some parks were established\u2014at least from the standpoint of selective plant productiv\u00ad ity and condition. This would amount to a his\u00ad torical reconstruction of landscape elements that more closely reflects the condition of the land and resources when non-Indian peoples first arrived. If such limited experiments were success\u00ad ful, the concept of \"cultural landscape\" would be expanded to recognize the resource-managing skills of Indian peoples. For the natural scientist, experiments that reveal the effect of plant horti\u00ad cultural and collection techniques on the range, morphology, and productivity of native plants should also be of great importance. If such exper\u00ad iments are conducted, they can be allowed under a scientific permitting system, thereby avoiding CRM No 5\u20142001 47 Several of the Piikani elders who partici\u00ad pated in the ethnobotanical study for Glacier National Park, from right George and Molly Kicking Woman, Doris Many Guns, Margaret Plain Eagle, and Elsie Crowshoe.

For American Indian peoples, attempts at limited restoration using traditional cultural knowledge could mean the preservation of important aspects of their own heritage. As Indian peoples with the traditional knowledge pass on, there is less likelihood that such knowl\u00ad edge will be transmitted to younger individuals. Partnerships between park managers and tribes focusing on the re-introduction of traditional plant management techniques could allow one means for tribal elders to pass cultural knowledge on to a new generation. Conclusion It is not suggested here that there should be\u2014or could be\u2014any wholesale restoration of national parks to the environmental conditions of centuries past. Ecology is a stern and mysterious master, and it would be arrogant for us to assume that we understand enough to control all possible outcomes. However, there is every indication that park lands are still used by some Indian peoples for plant-collecting. Parks are receiving requests from neighboring tribes to allow them to collect plant materials that have traditional cultural sig\u00ad nificance\u2014and some parks have negotiated memorandums of agreement with neighboring tribes to allow such collection. In one such instance, involved tribes have actually agreed to help parks monitor resulting impacts. And, under the direction of Muriel Crespi, the Ethnography Program of the National Park Service has now designed a computer program for storing data that ethnobotanical research provides, for which Indian tribes have cautiously indi\u00ad cated support, and for which they recognize their own need. All of this points to a healthy climate of park/tribe cooperation, which could lead to additional research and experi\u00ad ments related to indigenous species and landscape restoration. Ethnobotanical and ethnobiologi- cal studies could do much to join natural and cultural resource spe\u00ad cialists in projects with shared goals. Additional work would give a new and important dimension to the concept of heritage man\u00ad agement and cultural landscapes. Best of all, the work would bring American Indian peoples and park managers together for a partnership in which both realize substantial benefits for natural resource and cultural heritage preservation.

Schuchat The Ethnography of Urban Benches Three rustic wooden benches are chained in a line alongside Connecticut Avenue between the sidewalk and a wooded finger of Rock Creek Park in Washington DC, one of the national park systems' largest natural urban units.1 The benches are too far apart for comfort\u00ad able conversation, too short to sleep upon, their backs are to nature, and they face continuous traffic day and night. They are a quarter mile from the nearest fast food center, neither by a bus stop nor in an area obscure enough for lovers. But they are well used. Who uses them? This question about an everyday sight prompted an ethnographic investi\u00ad gation including observation of bench use at dif\u00ad ferent times and seasons, participation as a bench-sitter alone or with others, interviews of various National Park Service staff such as rangers, administrators, historians, and mainte\u00ad nance workers, and a literature search of topics such as urban planning, urban anthropology, and sociology. I concluded, following a year and a half of observation, that the avenue benches function as a community front porch, a bridge between the public and the private. A territorial but also deeply symbolic space, the benches provide an area for diverse urban elements to face each other in peace. At the same time they allow for the fleeting moment of time-out in the middle of errands and on the journey from work. They are also, as are other kinds of city benches, a destina\u00ad tion for those who include involvement with birds and squirrels, the most common or public of city animals, as vital to their functioning. History Connecticut Avenue, considered Washington's most gracious boulevard, is also one of the most intensely used transportation routes through the city. The avenue is flanked by hotels and buildings containing shops, offices, and apartments. The land-use rhythm that helps define the avenue's character, alternating between apartment and commercial buildings, was decreed by zoning from the 1920s. Between the commercial segments in the area called Cleveland Park are dowager apartment buildings and smaller walk-ups, mostly dating from the 1920s. Two large \"modern\" apartments built in the 1950s flank the finger of Rock Creek Park where the benches are chained.2 Behind them, a trail traverses the woods. Rock Creek Park, itself, meandering through the city, consists of 1,754 acres of wooded ravines, sheer creek banks, hik\u00ad ing, biking and equestrian trails, and even an old mill and attendant waterfall. The superintendent of one of the apart\u00ad ment buildings, who has worked in the area since 1950, recalls that the benches were installed in the early 1960s at the same time that the trail was built and at the request of residents of two build\u00ad ings. For many years the benches simply perched in their spots, but about 15 years ago they were chained down because they were subject to van\u00ad dals who turned them over and rolled them down the embankment. The park maintenance chief recalls that they were difficult to roll back up, particularly when wet. Use The trail is used daily by dog walkers and on weekends and holidays by hikers in ones, twos, and families, some of whom park their cars or get off the bus and start from there and others of whom have hiked from further west and often pause to tie shoes and regroup on the benches. Some folks walking from their apartments to the Metro (subway) nearby pass and some\u00ad times rest on the benches, and others, often older, pause at the benches on their often more leisurely errands. Spanish-speaking families who have moved into the garden apartments that also dot the area frequent the seats too. The three benches, under their canopy of beach and oak and maple, welcome these disparate sets of resi\u00ad dents. Local folk stop at the benches to com\u00ad mune with \"nature\" in the form of squirrels and pigeons and sparrows \u2014 mostly unaware of the extent of \"nature\" living just behind them. For example, the Park Service has been tracking deer as they moved from the suburbaniz- ing Montgomery County area of the Potomac River downstream toward downtown via the SO CRM No 5\u20142001 park. They estimate there are about 25 resident deer in the Melvin Hazen area. Occasionally they are spotted in the woods behind apartment buildings. Not far off the trail there is a fox den and there may be otter, too. And of course there are the raccoons which sometimes cross the avenue. All of the above are native species, protected in the park. Closer to the conscious level of the neigh\u00ad borhood residents who use the benches are the homeless humans of whom there are varying numbers and perceptions. Very occasionally they sleep on the benches, including a young man who keeps his possessions in one of the nearby Metro lockers and, scion of a local gardening family, occasionally does yard jobs for residents of the area. Another local homeless person perches sometimes on a bench, like Peter Pan, but with a Walkman at her ear. A police officer walking the trail found a cache of abandoned pocketbooks, presumably left by purse snatching juveniles from across the park who only kept the cash after ducking into the woods. The officer also noticed an area strewn with used syringes and some large wooden bats, probably a minor site of some of the runaway \"punk rockers\" who had for a while been slashing tires and bashing cars along the avenue. Overnighting in Rock Creek Park is forbid\u00ad den and, according to one official, \"no one lives there.\" But park workers find and dismantle \"housing\" made of plastic, discarded wooden boxes, and even \"cabins\" made of fallen trees. A major campsite was dismantled in October 1989. Use of the park as home is not a new phenome\u00ad non. A building superintendent recalls that one of the construction laborers on the 1950s build\u00ad ings was a Korean War veteran who came home to find his wife gone and their apartment rented out to strangers. So he just moved into the woods behind his work. Subsequently he was hired as a gardener at the completed building, while contin\u00ad uing to live in the woods. And sometime later, through the interest of a resident who worked at the Capitol, he got a job there and an opportu\u00ad nity to buy a little house on \"the hill.\" Feeding the Animals The homeless are not the cause of the occa\u00ad sional calls demanding that the Park Service remove the benches as a public nuisance. It is the pigeons, continuously fed by other neighbors, that call out the wrath of some residents. One woman brings peanuts (a handful at a time casu\u00ad ally pocketed on her trips to the supermarket) and places them in the crotch of the double beach tree behind a bench for Fritzie, her favorite black squirrel, an activity she began because she needed to force herself to get out in the fresh air at least once a day. She also likes to sit on the bench and watch nature and the people passing by, and occasionally talk to an acquaintance. One unusually warm winter morning a street person walking along with a disreputable looking bike, asked us for money and after we demurred, he wished us a very nice day. \"Poor soul, he can't understand why we feed the animals and not him,\" the lady mused. \"Fritzie\" is also fed many early mornings by a young lady who comes out in her bathrobe to exchange greetings with everyone's pet squirrel and offer him morning sustenance. Every morn\u00ad ing on the way to the Metro another regular drops left-over bread at the benches. Others anoint the area with birdseed to nourish at least 13 pigeons that roost on a limb above. The news\u00ad paper recently ran a picture of an 88-year-old woman, arms filled with some of the pigeons she has fed and played with for much of the 30 years she has lived in the vicinity. ^ From time to time the benches serve as a place to make other offerings. On several occa\u00ad sions fruit has been laid out as if at a shrine, whole and wholesome-looking fruits Occasionally clothing, a sweater or an old pair of pants, is left neatly folded on or stacked beneath the benches \u2014 safer from the rain\u2014to be col\u00ad lected by one or another of the homeless men\u00ad tioned above. Sometimes items are also accidently left\u2014usually children's mittens and scarves. Human Interactions Generally, passersby and those seated are inclined to make some harmless comment, an acknowledgment of mutual humanity. A distin\u00ad guished looking elderly gentleman wiped down an empty bench with his newspaper and sat down, stating to me on the next bench, and to the world at large, \"intermission.\" In the warmest weather, many people wait for the cooler evenings to sit on the benches and get a breath of fresh air. In the spring and fall they pour out during the days, feeling the sun and exulting in the wonderful Washington weather. Winter and summer, in the current anti- smoking atmosphere, quite a few nearby residents CRM No 5\u20142001 51 enjoy their cigarette or cigar at the benches. And sometimes roommates, family, or others, have to get away from each other, one imagines, when coming upon one of them reading late at night by the light of the street lamp. The benches are not really designed for social interaction, because of the distance between them and their rigid formal line. Most often, strollers will stop and stand to chat with an acquaintance already seated. But sometimes pairs of passersby sit down together on one bench to continue their conversations. A wheelchair- bound neighbor usually sits at right angles to a bench where a friend is sitting, but occasionally faces the woods, with his back to the street. His use of the benches seems to be threefold: as much of nature as he can encompass easily; companion\u00ad ship; and always to feed the pigeons and squirrels. A former sociology teacher at one of the universities was evicted from her apartment in one of the newer buildings by the trail. An evic\u00ad tion is a singular and shocking event in this neighborhood, where alternative arrangements are usually made privately and landlords never proclaim those who fall behind and cannot pay. So the newspapers reported the story with pic\u00ad tures of the woman, enthroned on one of the benches, clutching her electric typewriter in one hand, surrounded by boxes of her books, watched over herself by unknown neighbors, while the Park Police and District Social Services tried to make other arrangements with and for her. The kindness of strangers continued for almost three days. It was a moving story of an alcoholic fall and the rallying proclaimed as community. * The following spring the rustic benches were replaced with new models of slatted, treated wood, armless on a metal frame, and bolted to the cement below rather than chained. Whereas the old benches had been purchased finished, and would be costly now, they also required skilled assembly and maintenance. But anyone can install the new ones, produced more economi\u00ad cally at the park. One user commented shortly after that he hates to sit on benches that don't have that multi\u00ad tude of carved initials to indicate loving, sitting use. But during the summer others said that \"these new benches are so much more comfortable.\" Well, there won't be any more initial carv\u00ad ing. But the one or two neighbors who sit there to whittle (much less messy there than in the apartments) or the ones who while away a bit of time playing the banjo, or taking time for a ciga\u00ad rette, don't appear bothered by the difference. Concluding Comments Apartment dwellers want front porches. Or at a minimum, they want front steps to sit on or near the sidewalk. But architects and planners have responded more frequently with balconies or secret gardens away from the street, neither of which permit eye-level interaction in the course of which residents can come to recognize familiar faces, patterns of activity, and take account of the exceptions to both. The history of the benches indicates that planning, or zoning, may set up initial situations and that the larger public works, like the Metro, have a major influence on their use. But mixed use in-town areas also develop their own priori\u00ad ties. It is not fortuitous that the benches were set on the rim of marvelous Rock Creek Park, rather it was taking neighborly advantage of the manner in which the park meets the city at this point when other improvements were being made. Achieving such small goals is often aided and abetted not by organized groups, but by the very fact that people with particular wants can include in their neighborhood networks access to the goods or services they want from \"City Hall\" or the Park Service. Perhaps that is the sum of what we mean by community, a place to rally round in case of emergency and a shared space to provide something\u2014even pigeons\u2014upon which to bestow our concern for life.

Evans, Alexa Roberts, and Peggy Nelson Ethnographic Landscapes The term \"landscape\" has a wide range of meaning in natural, cul\u00ad tural, and social research, from \"a picture of natural inland scenery\" to \"a composition of man-made or man- modified spaces to serve as infrastructure or back\u00ad ground for our collective existence.\" If we want to discover the meaning of landscapes for people, it is best to think of them not as collections of material objects placed in geographical space, but as social and cultural constructions of the people who use them. In this sense, landscapes are \"sym\u00ad bolic environments\" that people create to give meaning and definition to their physical environ\u00ad ment. ' Cultural groups socially construct land\u00ad scapes as reflections of themselves. In the process, the social, cultural, and natural environments are meshed and become part of the shared symbols and beliefs of members of the groups. Thus, nat\u00ad ural environments and changes in them take on different meaning depending on the social and cultural symbols associated with them. Geographically-defined space that has cul\u00ad tural or social meaning All of these terms encompass \"ethnographic landscapes\"\u2014areas of geographic space that have been given special and specific cultural or social meaning by people asso\u00ad ciated with them. Cultural Landscapes and Ethnographic Landscapes Outside of the National Park Service (NPS), writers and researchers think of these dif\u00ad ferent kinds of landscapes as being \"cultural land\u00ad scapes\" of one kind or another. Within the NPS, however, we recognize two different categories of socially and culturally meaningful landscapes: for one we use the term \"cultural landscape\"; for the other we use the term \"ethnographic landscape.\" Cultural landscapes within the NPS are defined as a category of cultural resource that can be determined eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Ethnographic landscapes within the NPS context are broader, do not depend on NRHP eligibility criteria for their existence, and importantly, are identified and defined by the cultural groups associated with them rather than by historic preservation professionals. We emphasize this distinction because the NPS, as the nation's lead agency for defining cul\u00ad tural resources preservation standards and poli\u00ad cies, has a great deal of influence on the develop\u00ad ment of the cultural landscapes concept, and its application to land management practices. In this role, the NPS uses the nation's central piece of cultural resources legislation, the National Historic Preservation Act. A primary component of the act is that those cultural resources that are preservation worthy (at the national, state, or local levels) must meet certain criteria that make them eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. As a fairly new category of cultural resource recog\u00ad nized by the NPS for their significance and preservation worthiness, cultural landscapes are also defined on the basis of their ability to meet the criteria for National Register eligibility. The NPS cultural landscape program recog\u00ad nizes four overlapping categories of cultural land\u00ad scapes (historic site, historic designed, historic vernacular, and ethnographic) and more specifi\u00ad cally defined the concept as \"geographic area[s], including both natural and cultural resources, associated with a historic event, activity or per\u00ad son.\" Because their significance is based on eligi\u00ad bility for inclusion on the NRHP, cultural land\u00ad scapes in the NPS are defined in terms of the broad patterns of the nation's history and its local manifestations. The cultural landscape research methodology used by the NPS then focuses pri\u00ad marily on historical documentation, including oral histories, but identification of a cultural landscape and determination of its significance at the national, state, or local level relies on the expertise of the cultural landscape professional. While ethnographic landscapes are recog\u00ad nized as a category of cultural landscapes, for purposes of the servicewide Ethnographic Resources Inventory database, the Applied Ethnography Program has specifically defined \"ethnographic landscape\" to be: CRM No 5\u20142001 53 ...a relatively contiguous area of interrelated places that contemporary cultural groups define as meaningful because it is inextrica\u00ad bly and traditionally linked to their own local or regional histories, cultural identities, beliefs and behaviors. Present-day social factors such as a people's class, ethnicity, and gender may result in the assignment of diverse meanings to a landscape and its component places. The important distinction between these definitions lies in the emphasis on what makes the landscapes significant, and who determines the nature of that significance. Ethnographic landscapes are identified and delineated by mem\u00ad bers of the cultural groups who are traditionally associated with them, and whose histories and identities are tied to them. Further, ethnographic landscapes' significance derives from the roles they play in the associated communities' own tra\u00ad ditional histories, not those criteria of national, state, or local significance that make them eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. Thus, a fundamental difference between cultural and ethnographic landscapes as perceived in the NPS is whose history and cultural identity determines the significance of a given geographic space, and with whom the ability and authority to identify and describe it rests. These differences also suggest to us that ethnographic landscapes are not so much a category of cultural landscape as they are distinct types of landscapes that may overlap with or contain historic cultural land\u00ad scapes. In this regard, we also see ethnographic landscapes as fundamentally distinct from Traditional Cultural Properties (TCP) which are also places of cultural significance to American Indian and other ethnic groups but also rooted in the NRHP. Traditional Cultural Properties and Ethnographic Landscapes With the 1989 NPS publication of National Register Bulletin 38, Guidelines for Evaluating and Documenting Traditional Cultural Properties, federal land managers were provided with important guidance on the range of cultur\u00ad ally significant resources and how such resources should be identified, documented, and evaluated in terms of their eligibility for inclusion on the NRHP. These procedures have been slowly but surely incorporated into federal cultural resources management activities for the last decade and have become the primary vehicle through which managers have approached the protection of culturally-significant places. In 1992, amendments to the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) codified the guidance provided in National Register Bulletin 38 and established requirements for identifica\u00ad tion of places of religious and cultural signifi\u00ad cance to American Indians along with other kinds of historic properties. While these require\u00ad ments fostered cultural resources management documentation of culturally-significant places and coincided with a growing body of academic literature on \"sacred the management approach to such places is generally in terms of \"things\" rather than geographic space. The orientation to culturally-significant land and resources as \"things\" is largely a result of the NHPA being the primary vehicle through which such resources are identified. The NHPA requires identification of culturally-significant places as a category of potentially NRHP-eligible properties, along with other conventional kinds of properties such as buildings, archeological sites, and historic districts. Additionally, because the potential NRHP eligibility of historic proper\u00ad ties is generally evaluated by cultural resources or historic preservation professionals, TCPs are often documented in terms of easily identifiable, bounded places that land managers can recognize as a kind of historic property. Whole landscapes often do not easily fit these property-oriented concepts. Large geographic expanses that may include culturally-significant components such as horizons, unmarked spiritual corridors, places of connection between the earth surface and the upper and lower realms, and the interrelation\u00ad ships among all these kinds of places are simply not well understood or easily identifiable by cul\u00ad tural resources managers. They are even less amenable to documentation and management within the NRHP framework. Nonetheless, the TCP model is often still used to try to accommo\u00ad date a wide range of culturally-significant resources, including whole landscapes, because evaluation for the NRHP is an official model for determining significance of resources and thus implementing protection strategies. But difficulties arise as a result of trying to define culturally-important landscapes only in terms of TCPs, which generally focus on bounded places that can be relatively easily docu- 54 CRM No 5\u20142001 mented, not on regional landscapes that can encompass significant amounts of land. Ethnographic landscapes also incorporate multi\u00ad ple components that derive their significance from the interrelationships among other cultural and natural resources such as plants, animals, minerals, landforms, and bodies of water that give the landscape meaning through their associa\u00ad tions with a people's history and cultural identity. Additionally, a landscape that is culturally signifi\u00ad cant to one group may contain elements that are significant to other groups in other ways and are, therefore, within the overlapping boundaries of multiple culturally-significant landscapes. Further, individual components within an ethno\u00ad graphic landscape that are considered culturally significant may vary with periods of time and with sacred and secular contexts. It is difficult for resources managers to grasp the potentially com\u00ad plex and layered nature of ethnographic land\u00ad scapes and even harder to define and document them within the NRHP framework that is gener\u00ad ally used for specific sites, buildings, objects, or districts. Despite these difficulties, we believe that identification, documentation, and culturally- informed management of ethnographic land\u00ad scapes are very possible, beneficial to land man\u00ad agers and the groups of people whose identities derive from the landscapes, and not dependent on NRHP eligibility for implementing. Are Ethnographic Landscapes Realistic? The only way to identify ethnographic landscapes is through the knowledge of the peo\u00ad ple who give them meaning in the first place. To meet this need, the NPS employs a variety of stud\u00ad ies and community consultation efforts to incor\u00ad porate the cultural knowledge of traditionally- associated peoples into its management activities. The Applied Ethnography program assists parks and NPS programs in conducting ethnographic assessments, cultural affiliation studies, tradi\u00ad tional resource use studies, ethnographic resources inventories, and other research efforts designed to provide managers with a baseline of information about cultural values attached to park lands and resources. More than 160 such studies have been completed or are currently in progress Service wide. Once parks and other NPS programs have used these approaches to gain an understanding of which communities maintain traditional connections to park lands and resources, park managers are in a position to develop ongoing relationships with traditionally- associated groups and routinely consult with them in park management planning efforts. Through these efforts, many parks have been able to gain a great deal of understanding about the associations between the lands and resources under their stewardship and the traditionally-associated people to whom the resources hold deep cultural significance. Park managers have learned about ethnographic land\u00ad scapes contained within park boundaries, and sometimes that entire parks are only small ele\u00ad ments of much larger culturally-significant land\u00ad scapes. Many have incorporated this knowledge into their long-range park management and interpretive plans, providing park visitors a qual\u00ad ity experience while managing lands and resources to avoid cultural impacts to the people traditionally associated with them. In a perfect world, there would be time and funding to conduct ethnographic research pro\u00ad jects and community consultations during which cultural and ethnic groups all over the nation could identify the boundaries and elements of the landscapes within which their cultural identities are defined. One goal of such research would be to protect the identified landscapes to the extent necessary for all the associated groups to use the landscapes in ways that are needed to retain the groups' cultural integrity. However, in the bureaucratic world of land management, land\u00ad scapes\u2014whether cultural, ethnographic, or both \u2014are usually identified, documented, and man\u00ad aged in response to some kind of land manage\u00ad ment action or need. That is why the National Historic Preservation Act was enacted in the first place, to ensure that federal agencies recognize their stewardship responsibilities to the historic places that collectively represent the story of the American people. Section 110 of the NHPA directs agencies to proactively and comprehensively identify and inventory the historic properties and places they manage and to nominate them to the National Register of Historic Places. While some of the baseline ethnographic studies help meet this need, full implementation of this requirement is not often undertaken. Most of the time, efforts to consider the effects of agency activities occur at the level of individual projects or undertakings. Section 106 of the NHPA and its implementing regulations outline the process for identifying his- CRM No 5\u20142001 55 toric properties, including TCPs, as part of the planning for a specific project. The identification of TCPs may lead to the recognition of larger ethnographic landscapes of which individual TCPs are components, but the \"Section 106 process\" itself does not readily accommodate identification, documentation, and management planning for whole landscapes in the context of NRHP eligibility. However, recent changes to the regulations implementing Section 106 of the NHPA (36 CFR 800) do provide an avenue for documenting the larger landscapes of which TCPs may be a part. While NHPA is specific to the considera\u00ad tion of effects to historic properties, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 requires federal agencies to consider impacts to the human environment, including historic prop\u00ad erties and all the other kinds of natural and cul\u00ad tural resources that make up the environment within which people exist. Portions of the recent revisions to the Section 106 regulations (36 CFR 800.8) outline the possibilities for agencies to combine their identification efforts under NHPA and NEPA into one process. By using NEPA to also comply with NHPA to identify historic properties, agency land managers have identified NRHP-eligible TCPs and at the same time iden\u00ad tified and documented the larger landscapes of which the TCPs are a part, even though the larger landscapes do not fit the NRHP eligibility crite\u00ad ria. This landscape approach to management of culturally-sensitive lands and resources has allowed managers in many cases to approach resources management needs more comprehen\u00adsively, placing individual sites and resources in culturally meaningful contexts, and giving man\u00ad agers more information about whole land areas rather than isolated places. Several parks have begun taking such approaches in the develop\u00ad ment of their General Management Plans/Environmental Impact Statements. Through the use of these flexible approaches, looking beyond NRHP boundaries, and commu\u00ad nication, the identification, documentation, and management of ethnographic landscapes are becoming increasingly useful tools for the NPS, other land managers, and the cultural groups who give rich cultural meaning to the lands and resources under federal stewardship.
