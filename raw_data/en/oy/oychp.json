(ETP), based in East Hartford, CT, received the Law Enforcement and Corrections Family Support: Solicitation for Research, Evaluation, Development, and Demonstration Project from the National Institute of Justice. Since August 1993, ETP has provided Employee Assistance Program (EM) services to approximately 7,000 Connecticut DOC employees. Many of the calls from Correctional Officers (COS) concerned stress andlor other problems related to work issues. There were numerous complaints involving job stress, conflicts with colleagues, and conflicts with supervisors that impacted all areas of the COS' life. It was rare to ever have a complaint or concern raised about inmate contact. Many described stress as the reason why other parts of their lives had gotten out of control, Le., substance abuse, marital and/or relationship problems, disciplinary actions at work, etc. It seemed that for many of the officers the inability to manage the stress inherent in their work was a significant factor. Although the Department has implemented training and other programs over the years to address stress, there had never been a program integrated into the mandatory annual training for all officers. To its credit, the Department has long recognized that correctional work takes a toll on all employees, and, in 1985, the Department implemented an in-house EAP as a way to offer support for all employees to deal with personal matters and/or concerns.

It became clear to the administration that an external EAP would be able to meet the increasing demands for services in a more efficient and expedient manner. In 1994, the transition from an internal to an external program began. .- The transition was successful. However, the level of distrust COS had towards \"outsiders\" was high, and it took time for them and other staff to develop trust with the program. As that happened, the EAP began to gain an understanding of some of the problems and concerns that exist within a large correctional system. John J. Armstrong, Commissioner of the Department of Correction, began his career as a correctional officer and is very familiar with the demands of the work. He was very supportive of a program that would begin to look at ways to reduce stress for his officers. His support, and our experience, led to the decision for ETP and the Department to partner in designing this program as a joint venture. Originally named the Correctional Officer Maintenance Program (COMP), the program was designed to increase awareness of personal and work stress, and to present ways to manage it, thus reducing the impact on officers' personal, family, and work lives. The name of the program was later changed to FOCUS (Families, Officers, and Corrections Understanding Stress).

This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.There were four facilities originally chosen to participate: . York Correctional Institution-The state's only female facility, housing pre-trial and sentenced women at all security levels, 325 COS Webster Correctional Institution-A low-level security, pre-release facility, 77 COS Cheshire Correctional Institution-A high-level security facility housing long-term sentenced offenders, 335 COS Manson Youth Correctional Institution-A high-level security facility housing offenders ages 14 to 21, 173 COS The method was to present a series of one-hour, introductory workshops at the facilities and at off-site training areas during the day, as well as in the evening with pizza and childcare available during the evening sessions. Proposed topics fur the workshops included \"Active Parenting Skills,\" \"Managing Stress,\" \"Effective Communication Skills,\" and \"The High-Risk Lifestyle.\" Consideration was also given to a program on \"Managing Credit Card Spending\" and/or \"Financial Planning.\" Upon completion of the introductory sessions, there would be more \"in-depth\" sessions, two hours in duration, offered at each facility. In order to have the program accessible to officers, manageable for the Department of Correction, and meet coverage needs, sessions were planned as follows: The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program. 3 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Follow-up sessions with two, two-hour presentations at each facility for a total of 16 hours. There would be a total of 48 hours of presentations. All COS from the participating facilities would be invited to voluntarily attend any and all of the workshops, and to invite family members andor significant others. - __ The Coping and Stress Profile developed by the Carlson Learning Company, or a comparable instrument, would be mailed to the homes of the officers at the four facilities and to the officers at one representative control facility. We anticipated a 30% response rate f?om the surveys. FOCUS also proposed to look at the life cycle of an officer and prepare a series of short, educational brochures describing what we saw to be significant events during the career of an officer: Graduation from the academy into their assigned facility and promotion after the probationary period Leveling off in the 4' to 5' years; looking at career options within the Department Critical incident involvement-an event beyond the officer's control, Le., a riot, an attack, suicide of an inmate Reassignment-circumstances beyond the officer's control Retirement The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 finds this program.

Technical assistance to an in-place family support program that had been established by the wife of an officer. Increased EAP response to critical incidents that occur at the four facilities. This would be coordinated with the in-house Critical Incident Response Team, and at the request of the facility wzrden. Attendance at DOC Health Fairs with FOCUS information, as well as EAP information. Another, more informal goal of the program was to increase awareness of the Department's EAP. Although usage was good, COS were often coming into the program at a point where they were facing serious discipline, usually related to reliability issues. If we could begin to educate officers to reach out for help sooner, we felt absenteeism and discipline could be reduced. This kind of impact would not be seen during the life of this project. However, with ongoing programs and awareness, it is reasonable to expect to see COS address problems before the cycle of work problems, personal problems, and stress affects performance. The majority of EAP participants reported some stress-related concerns when calling the program for help.

Prior to submitting the proposal, we asked the union presidents from several AFSCME locals to write a letter of support for the program, which they did. The plan was to have them be part of the team once the grant was awarded. The team was comprised of union stewards fiom the participating facilities, several union presidents, an EAP liaison, the project manager fiom ETP, and the principal investigator from the Department. Although time was a factor in our moving forward with grant writing, it became clear that this type of project requires union involvement in plan development, as well as program implementation. The union had a great deal of enthusiasm for the project, and, as the team began meeting on a regular basis, their suggestions, comments, and ideas were very helpful in the final shaping of the program. The name of the program was changed to FOCUS (Families, Officers, and Corrections Understanding Stress) almost immediately in response to the union's concern that the name 6 The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.COMP was too closely related to \"Worker's Compensation\" - a system that has a negative connotation for many COS. We added the Hartford Correctional Center, one of the Department's three jails with pre- sentenced and short-term sentenced inmates (1 80 COS), and Northern Correctional Institution, the State's super maximum security facility (236 COS) to the project and removed the youth facility. The total number of COS for-the project was now 1153, up from the original 910. However, including these facilities gave us a much more accurate cross section of the Department. -_ These changes are perfect examples of relatively simple oversights that could have been avoided by having union input earlier on in the process. This also increased the number of participating facilities and added extra training sessions. During our initial meetings, it was recommended that the program consist of five introductory courses for each of the five facilities, offered two times, for a total of 50 one-hour sessions. The advanced workshops would average five per facility, and not exceed 25 two-hour sessions for a maximum total of 100 hours of programs. The topics remained the same. As we began to look at tools to evaluate the effectiveness of the training, as well as the levels and perceptions of stress in the Department, we looked at what Robin Gershon, Ph.D. had used in her NIJ project concerning stress and police officers in Baltimore, MD. Our plan was to add to andor change the context of some of her questions to more aptly fit COS. Dr. Gershon was The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 finds this program. - Y* 7 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

As it was initially written, the program assumed a relatively small number of participants with the hope of learning and then expanding in the future. The union saw this as an opportunity to survey all COS (4,100), thus having a significant amount of data with which to evaluate the stress of COS Department wide. FOCUS would be a way to make some intervention with a selected group, while the richness of the data could be used for future planning. __ The National Institute of Justice Grant award ## 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program. -w.

Searching for an intact survey that would suitably measure the specifics of the setting proved unsuccessful. We brought in Mark Sullivan, Ph.D., and John Rogers, Ph.D., of S&R Associates, researchers with experience in the customized development of surveys measuring matters such as employee morale and work-related stress. In addition, Dr. Sullivan had involvement with the officers' union in the past around this very issue when a departmental joint labodmanagement committee, The Stress Reduction Committee, explored addressing officer stress several years ago. Numerous meetings were held with S&R Associates to look at the feasibility of their working with us. They reviewed the Gershon survey, as well as some of the literature. The final recommendation fiom them was to design a survey specifically for the DOC, with the thinking th2t much, if not all, of it would be applicable to survey any state Department of Correction. The first step in the survey design was to facilitate a series of CO focus groups with Sullivan and Rogers in order to validate the issues identified in the project and in the literature review. Fifteen groups sessions were held, all participants were randomly selected, and each session was representative of a different group, i.e., males, mixed sex, females, first shift, etc. There were eight specific areas targeted in each session, with guiding questions introducing each topic. The areas were: 1) burnout, 2) job satisfaction, 3) personal finance, 4) family life, 5) race, 6) gender, 9 The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program.

The sessions included between nine and 12 participants and lasted approximately 90 minutes. The information fkom the groups overwhelmingly indicated a strong level of suspicion about the process and the guaranteed anonymity of information shared in the groups. There was an overwhelming feeling of distrust for the administration, the union, and the EM, and especially a lack of confidence in mid-level management, i.e., the Lieutenants and Captains at the facilities. There were concerns about favoritism, sexism, racism, and a lack of respect for COS and their work. There was also concern expressed as to what, if any, impact this type of program would really have, and suspiciousness expressed as to the motivation for such a program. The union and the EAP were both mentioned as groups that don't always address the COS' needs, and at times pander to the administration. The issue of confidentiality within the EAP was challenged as well. The inmates were not described as a source of stress for the COS during any of the sessions. The focus groups gave us much more information than we could possibly use in the type of training that we planned to deliver under this grant. . .- The committee met numerous times with Dr. Rogers to review and make suggestions for changes to the survey instrument. The final survey consisted of 352 questions that measured burnout, management environment, organizational ife, job satisfaction, correctional officer life satisfaction, potential outcomes of prison work, and self-evaluation. The first 24 items gathered demographic information.

This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.We had six officers take the survey and give us feedback concerning both the level of difficulty and the time involved to complete it. There were no reported problems understanding or responding to the questions. Their completion time averaged 30 minutes. Because of the expanded survey size, as well as the unanticipated development costs, mailing the survey to 4,100 officers became cost prohibitive. Conventional wisdom predicts low return rates on mailed items, even with pre-paid return postage and we wanted as high a return as possible in order to collect data representative of the Officers view of their work and the Department. The union suggested, and the Department agreed, to allow time on shift for each officer to complete the survey. This entailed a Herculean effort by the wardens and other ranking facility managers to schedule and cover time for this to happen. The union agreed to have reps at each facility hand out the surveys and collect them, hopefully reducing any suspiciousness on the officers' part. The plan was to have only union members handle the surveys. We anticipated a very high rate of return for three reasons: 1) we believed the issue of officer stress is paramount, 2) this is the first time the Department has attempted to capture this information in a legitimate, systematic fashion, and 3) the officers are being paid to fill out the survey. In order to accurately measure any impact the training may have, there had to be some type of identifying code for each survey. Much discussion ensued with the union regarding this matter and there was a great deal of concern expressed right away concerning confidentiality and that an identifier would cause alarm amongst the officers. The researchers spoke in depth with the committee regarding why this was necessary. However, it was an issue that came back to haunt The National Institute of Justice Grant award ## 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program. &, 11 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The code used for ID purposes was the last four digits of the officer's social security number and the last four digits of hisher phone number. The return rate for the initial survey was in the 50% range - disappointing, given the structure that was in place. As one would expect with a project of this size, all things did not go as planned. The survey distribution wasn't as smooth as we had hoped for and some surveys were picked up by lieutenants and stored in warden's offices, causing the level of distrust to rise. Although we had set a time frame of two weeks for the surveys to be completed, they came in for up to almost eight weeks after they were handed out. Many came back unusable, unreadable, or incomplete. There were many angry comments written in the space for feedback about the Department, this project, etc. The first survey results showed a high level of dissatisfaction with all management, especially the lieutenants, who are the first level in the COS chain of command and the group who directly supervise the officers. There was also distrust and dissatisfaction expressed about how officers are treated during an internal investigation and/or inmate attack or accusation. This carried over into all of the training sessions. The department currently is staffed with 356 lieutenants, 133 captains and 44 majors. Simultaneously, we were looking at the actual training program for the targeted facilities -how could we attract the greatest number of officers? Because of facility scheduling, offering the five training sessions two times per facility would not capture a large number of participants. Even with creative scheduling, offering more evening programs for families in centralized locations The National Institute of Justice Grant award ## 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program. 12 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

How many COS would attend any type of programming during their time off and would they want to include family members? The union and the Department both began to see this training as having a much greater impact if it were to be mandatory rather than elective, and of a full day's duration rather than the shorter sessions originally planned. This led to a revamping of the curriculum we had planned in order to present a day of topics that would flow together and address several areas of stress. We designed a program that would cover communication styles and dealing with anger as the basis of understanding and learning to deal with stress at work and at home. -_ With much discussion between the union, the Department liaison, and the Department's training academy management, a plan unfolded to present a mandatory, full day of FOCUS training to every CO in the five targeted facilities. Cornmissioner Armstrong and his staff fully supported this plan and the FOCUS Program took on a new level of importance to the Department and the committee. This was no longer a small, somewhat informal, voluntary program for interested COS at the five facilities. Further discussion led to this program becoming part of the required, in-service training days that officers department-wide must complete annually. The next two challenges were how and where to schedule these sessions, and what the structure would be. We initially looked at multiple locations, with simultaneous sessions; however, that was unmanageable because of the number of trainers needed. We wanted to have the training occur away from the worksite, thus keeping it unique, while at the same time, meeting academy requirements.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.We finally settled on doing the training at one of the centrally located union offices. Although it was not an ideal training site, we felt it was a good choice in that it made a very strong statement about the union's support of the program, as well as a demonstration of labor and management's willingness to work together. More importantly, it was a statement of the union's commitment to addressing the issue of stress within the Department and taking steps to make some changes. -- The design of the training went through several \"metamorphoses\" as we looked at the shift from several one and two-hour presentations to full day of training. Once we ruled out multiple offerings/multiple sites, we settled on a six-hour day of training with one trainer per group. The day would cover conflict, and communication, two major factors in stress, as well as general hints for handling stress, and an action-planning piece at the end. The program was designed to be highly interactive and experiential. We wanted to touch on some of the issues that came up in the focus groups, and felt these topics would give the officers tools to work with as they deal with their day-to-day activities and interactions. To cover the 69 training sessions, we used seven trainers, and three of them provided a majority of the training. Although there was a curriculum provided, it was important that the trainers be flexible enough to \"roll with\" the particular group in fiont of them. Over time they became quite adept at working with the officers and keeping the sessions on track while addressing some of the unique concerns of a certain group or individual.

This program was not designed to be a research project; however, we developed a very comprehensive survey instrument to evaluate the COS' current understanding of handling stress, as well as a modified version to evaluate the effectiveness of our education program. The survey and its' subsequent distribution became a much larger piece of the project than we planned. However, the heart of the FOCUS program remains the actual educational program delivered to approximately 1,150 COS. In looking at the survey results, it is important to remember that our return rate for the pre-program survey was only in the 50% range, and our return rate for the post survey (Exhibit B) was only 13%. Because of the low rate of return, we do not believe the survey results present an accurate, overall view of the COS in the Department. The discussion below focuses on the survey outcomes in the areas of job satisfaction, burnout, management environment, organizational life, life and family satisfaction, and outcomes of prison life for COS in the targeted facilities. The first five tables cover demographic information of the participants. The full survey results, including individual item results and discussion, can be found in Exhibit C.

The Maslach Burnout Inventory - Human Services Survey assesses three dimensions related to burnout. The three dimensions assessed are emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DE), and lack of personal accomplishment (PA). The original instrument was modified to relate to the demands of correctional officers. ._ The concept of burnout is assessed as-a continuous variable. A high degree of burnout is reflected in high scores on the Emotional Exhaustion e28) and Depersonalization ell) subscales and a low score on the Personal Accomplishment (533) subscale. Scores are considered high if they are in the upper third of the normative distribution that included 2,897 legal aid employees, attorney, police officers, probation officers, ministers, librarians, and agency administrators. The officer's scores, Emotional Exhaustion (1 8.19, Depersonalization (1 0.62), and Personal Accomplishment (24.5 1) do not indicate a high degree of burnout. Table 7 shows the condensed results of the Management Environment. Management Environment is a measure of the efficacy of management policy and activity. The indicators are administration, supervision, mission and goals, perceptions of change, communication, and absenteeism.

A high score indicates that the COS perceive that administration supports the officers. Supervision Correction officers' perception of their immediate supervisor, supervisors' evaluations of staff, and satisfaction with their immediate supervisor was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale (e.g., -_ strongly disagree to strongly agree). A high score indicates satisfaction with supervision in general. Mission and goals The measure of how the organizations' missions and goals affect work was assessed by measuring the COS commitment or dedication to department goals and how they affect work. That is, how the department's goals influence the day-to-day work activities. The measure of commitment to the department was measured using a S-point Likert scale (e.g., strongly disagree to strongly agree). A high score on this measure indicates a high commitment and dedication to the department. Perceptions of Change Perceptions of Change is a measure of the correctional officers overall perceptions of change within the department during the proceeding the past six months. They were asked whether things were getting better or worse. The perception of change was assessed using a 4-point Likert scale (e.g., have gotten worse to improved a lot). A high score indicates a positive change in the facility and work environment.

The perception of how well they received infomation at roll call and the accuracy and effectiveness of the dissemination of information through the department's newsletter were measured using a 5-point Likert scale (e.g., strongly disagree to strongly agree). The two measures are reported on two separate tables (Roll Call and Newsletter). A high score indicates a perception that there is good communication within the organization. Absenteeism Absenteeism is the measure of the desire to stay away from worWwork avoidance. Absenteeism has also been labeled as \"employee withdrawal\" where Bluedorn (as cited in Sheridan, 1985) defines withdrawal \"as a reduction in the employee's sociopsychological attraction to or interest in the work organization\" (p.88). Research has also linked absenteeism to a number of variables including: a) depression; b) burnout; c) stress; d) work attitudes; e) leadership style; 9 control policies and procedures; g) role stress; h) attendance motivation; i) job expectations, and j) personal work ethic (Ivancevich, 1985). Absenteeism due to stress/depression and related affective disorders cost an estimated $1 1.7 billion dollars in 1990 (Greenberg et al., 1993). Absenteeism was assessed using a self-report of the reasons and the number of times an employee was absent from work during the 3-month period prior to the current investigation. Research has shown that a shorter reporting period (3-6 months) yielded higher reliability when compared with payroll records (Johns, 1994). The measure of the desire to stay away from work 23 The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program.

A high score on absenteeism indicates a strong avoidance of the work environment. We expected the scores in each of these areas to be much lower, reflecting significant dissatisfaction with administrative and supervisory support, and an overall dissatisfaction with how communication flows. The scores indicate at least a mid-range level of satisfaction in these areas. For example, throughout the FOCUS program, we heard one complaint after another regarding lieutenants; however, based on the range, the scale measuring satisfaction with supervision reflects a score of 26.26, over the midway range. Organizational life Table 8 shows Organizational Life. The indicators of organizational life provide a measure of the mismatch or harmony of the employee and the organization. The scales used to assess organizational life were workload, control, reward, fairness, role conflict and ambiguity, and discrimination. Workload Workload is the amount of time and resources available to get the work done. As the workload becomes an overload, the quality of work diminishes, collegial relationships are disrupted, and innovation is lowered or gone all together. The measure of the COS perception of the extent to which workload demands are manageable was determined using a 5-point Likert scale (e.g., The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program. 24 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.strongly disagree to strongly agree). A high score indicates an overall perception that the workload is manageable. Control Control is the perception that there is an opportunity to make choices and decisions, to think and solve problems, and to have some input in the process of achieving the outcomes for which they are held accountable. For example, the close monitoring of staff can diminish their capacity to adapt or take the initiative resulting in the perception of a lack of control. In general, the staff member doesn't feel trusted that their judgments are respected and they may feel inadequate. A result of this perception is they feel incapable of doing the work without supervision. The perception of the amount of control the CO has in performing their duties was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale (e.g., strongly disagree to strongly agree). A high score indicates that COS perceive that they have control in their jobs. . ._ Fairness Fairness means that workers are shown respect and their self-worth is confirmed. Respect is evident in relationships within the organization (attitude towards work). Fairness is a measure of respect and fairness among people in the organization. Evidence of fairness is found during process of evaluation and promotion. Indicators of the lack of fairness are inequity of workload or pay, the bending of the rules, or cheating in order to get ahead. Perceived fairness was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale (e.g., strongly disagree to strongly agree). A high score indicates that the CO perceived the organization to be fair.

The intent of this specification is to define the role of the individual within the organization. This definition of tasks and responsibilities allows management to hold individuals accountable (e.g., principle of single accountability) for specific performance and to provide guidance and direction (e.g., principle of unity of command and chain of command). The role of the individual is specified as a set of expectations (e.g., what authority they have to make decisions, what they are expected to accomplish, and how they will be judged). If these expectations are inconsistent, the individual will experience stress, become dissatisfied, and perform less effectively resulting in a conflict of roles. Most destructive is chronic and unresolved conflict. Conflict infuses the work place with hstration, anger, fear, anxiety, disrespect, and suspicion. -.__ Role Conflict Role conflict is the result of violation of the principles of single accountability and the unity of command and chain-of-command principles causing a decrease in an individual's satisfaction and a decrease in the effectiveness of the organization. Individuals reporting role conflict stated that their trust in the persons who imposed the pressure was reduced, they liked them less personally, held them in lower esteem, communicated with them less, and that their own effectiveness was reduced. Role conflict can be fkrther defined in terms of the types of conflicts in the requirements of the role that impinge upon role performance. These conflicts are a) between the individual's internal The National Institute of Justice Grant award ## 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program, u _h\" i- 26 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

This coping may take the form of attempts to solve the problem to avoid the source of stress, or to use defensive mechanisms, which can distort the reality of the situation. In the correctional facility, role ambiguity is generally the struggle between helping the inmates and guarding them and the uncertainty between having to go by the book and be flexible. Role ambiguity increases the probability that a person will be dissatisfied with his role, will experience anxiety, distort reality, and perform less effectively. Role conflict in the correctional institution is the struggle that the COS have reconciling their custodial responsibilities with that of rehabilitation. Role ambiguity reflects the CO's perception of the ambiguity of hisher role as a corrections officer. It is a perceived lack of related information, an uncertainty or lack of clarity surrounding expectation about the role of correction officer and an interference with goal accomplishment. Role conflict and ambiguity were measured using a modified version of the scale developed by Rizzo, et al., (1970). Items were selected that 1) had high loadings on Rizzo, et al.'s original The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program. .L _yy - * 7- 1 % 27 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Both measures were assessed using a 5-point Eikert scale (e.g., strongly disagree to strongly agree). A high score on role conflict indicates a perception of little conflict between their requirements of their role that impinge on performance. A high score on ambiguity indicates a perception that there is little ambiguity in their role as a correctional officer. Again, the scores do not indicate the concerns we have heard verbally regarding fairness, ambiguity, and individual control in the work setting. Although the scores do not endorse a setting without problems, there is no stinging indictment indicated. Table 9 shows the levels of job satisfaction. Job satisfaction has been defined in numerous ways. Locke (1 969) stated that it is the \"pleasurable emotional state resulting from the appraisal of one's job as achieving or facilitating the achievement of one's job values. Job satisfaction and dissatisfaction are a function of the perceived relationship between what one wants from one's job and what one perceives it as offering\" Cp. 3 16). The assessment of job satisfaction has been measured using either a single-item or a set of items measuring some facets of the job. Scarpello and Campbell (1983) argue that an of overall global measure of job satisfaction is inappropriate due to the unreliability of the measures and instead proposed the use of a single-item using a 1-5 rating of the overall job satisfaction. Seashore and Taber (1 975) have defined the single-item measure as facet-free data that are obtained when a respondent is asked to indicate hisher global satisfaction with their job and job environment. They also defined a job scale as a facet-specific data that are obtained when the respondent is The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 fimds this program. **--_ Y- =*A 28 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Wanous, Reichers, and Hudy (1 997) concluded that the single-item measure was more robust than a scale measure of overall job satisfaction, but also indicated that there was no good reason for preferring a single-item to a well-constructed scale measure. Overall job satisfaction was assessed as the sum of the evaluations of discriminable elements of the job of correction that according to Locke (1 969) is a \"valid overall index of satisfaction\" (p. 33 1). Job satisfaction was also measured using a single item. I Materson and Ivancevich (1 987) found that job satisfaction can be divided into two sets of task attributes-intrinsic or the characteristics of the job (e.g., variety, autonomy, task identity, task significance) and extrinsic (e.g., pay, promotion, benefits). The items used to measure job satisfaction were a modified set of items from \"The 1977 quality of employment survey\" (Quinn, & Staines, 1979). The modifications were based on the specific aspects of working as a correctional officer. Additionally, the items were reviewed for relevance and content validity. Overall Index of Job Satisfaction The index of job satisfaction was the single item \"indicate your overall level of satisfaction with your job.\" The item response format was a 5-point Likert scale from very unsatisfied to very satisfied.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.Specific Indices of Job Satisfaction The specific indices ofjob satisfaction are 1) intrinsic value of work, 2) extrinsic value of work, and, 3) work convenience. The response format for each of the 25 items was measured using a 5-point Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). A high score indicates satisfaction in the individual indices. Intrinsic Value of Work is a 15-item index to measure the individuals perception about the intrinsic values of work. The extrinsic value of work is a 6-item index that measures the individual's perception about the physical environment including the rewards and benefits of the-position. Work convenience is also an extrinsic measure of job satisfaction that is measured on a 4-item index that measures the individual's perception about how convenient the job is in terms of location, shift, etc. Job Enrichment Toch & Klofas (1982) initially developed the job enrichment or professional orientation inventory. It was intended to measure interest in or sympathy for more-than-custodial work and a preference for distancing from inmates. The more-than-custodial work scale included items such as a) the most satisfying jobs involve inmate contact, b) the CO's only concern is with prison security, and, c) sometimes a guard should be an advocate for an inmate. The need to keep the inmates at a distance included items such as a) the best way to deal with an inmate is to be firm and distant, b) a CO should work hard to earn trust from inmates, c) a good principle is not to get close to convicts, and, d) a personal relationship with an inmate invites corruption. The items from the original study were factor analyzed using a principal axis factor (PAF). The initial factor structure indicated a three-factor solution fit the data. The data were factored using a 30 The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 knds this program. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The three factors were identified as an interest in more than custodial work, a compassion for inmates, and a need for social distance factors. Three separate tables, Interest in rehabilitation, Compassion for the plight of the inmate, and Dealing with inmates are reported. A high score indicates the perception that their job is enriching. Work Safety Work safety is a measure of the CO perception of their personal safety on the job in relation to inmate andor co-worker violence. A high score indicates a perception of high risk at work. Intent to Leave Intent to leave is the desire to change jobs. The Intent to Leave index is composed of 5-items using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The overall job satisfaction scale indicates a level (3.41) that is higher than the mid-range (2.50), and the facet specifics are all in the high range. Job enrichment items are in the mid to high range levels as well. The intent to leave score is also high (15.47 with a range of 23, indicating that some officers are at least exploring the possibilities of pursuing other work. Intent to leave also may stay with an employee throughout a long career in corrections.

Overall Life Satisfaction This is a single-item, facet-free measure of overall life satisfaction. Correctional officers were asked to respond to the following question using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from very unsatisfied to very satisfied: \"How satisfied are you with your life?\" Overall Relationship Satisfaction This is a single-item, facet-free measure of overall satisfaction with the present relationship. Correctional officers were asked to respond to the following question using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from very unsatisfied to very satisfied: \"How satisfied are you with your present relationship with your spouse/significant other?\" Family Safety Family safety is a 5-item index that measures the extent to which correction officers worry about the safety of their family. A high score indicates a perception of being able to provide safety to their family. Interrole Conflict Kahn, Wolfe, Quinn, Snock, & Rosenthal (1 964) define interrole conflict as the simultaneous occurrence of two or more sets of pressures such that compliance of one role makes it more The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program. 32 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

That is, the \"role pressures associated with membership in one organization are in conflict with pressures stemming from membership in other groups\" (Kahn et al., 1964, p. 20). The family-work roles are two separate and distinct roles that create their own set of pressures. The conflict with work is created when the individual experiences incompatible pressures within the work domain. The same is true for the family conflict, except the pressures are within the family domain. The family-work conflict is the incompatibility that stems from multiple role senders, andor a lack of fit between the individual and the two role requirements (e.g., family; work). Netemeyer et al., (1996) indicates that \"this type of conflict reflects the degree to which role responsibilities from family and work are incompatible\" (p. 401). That is, \"the responsibilities, requirements, expectations, duties and commitments of one role make Performance of the other role more difficult\" (Katz & Kahn, 1978; Netemeyer et al., 1996) The types of family and work conflict are either time-based or strain-based. Time-based conflict is defined as the amount of time devoted to one role, which interferes with the performance related responsibilities of the other role. The strain-based conflict is created when one role interferes with the performance of the responsibilities of the other role. Two scales initially developed by Netemeyer et al., (1 996) and modified for the present study were used to assess the extent of the conflict created by either the work-family or the family- work continuum. The modifications consisted of using a 5-point Likert scale versus a 7-point scale.

A high score indicates the presence of a work- family conflict. That is, the demands of the family may be interfering with the responsibilities of the job. The Family-Work Conflict Scale The Family-Work Conflict Scale (FWC) is also a 5-item scale. It measures a form of interrole conflict where the general demands of, time devoted to, and strain created by the family interfere with performing job-related responsibilities. A high score indicates the presence of a family- work conflict. That is, the demands of work may be interfering with the responsibilities of the family. Relationship Conflict Scale The relationship conflict scale is an 8-item index that is intended to measure family relationships using a 5-point Likert scale (e.g., strongly disagree to strongly agree). A high score indicates more relationship conflict. Finances The assessment of the correctional officers perception of their finances employed a Stem index using a Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. A high score indicates a perception of more money problems.

The index used a 5- point Likert scale ranging from never to daily. A higher score indicates the more activities you engage in for relaxation. The scores here follow a pattern similar to the other results in that they tend to fall into the mid andor higher ranges. In the areas of individual and family safety, scores may indicate areas of concern, but they are not remarkable. .- Table 11 looks at Outcomes of Prison Work. Depression and Stress In 1990, approximately 1 1 million people reportedly suffered from depression and related affective disorders including bipolar disorder and dysthymia. During a depressive period, other symptoms are usually present to varying degrees. Such symptoms may include a change in zippetite (overeating or poor appetite), sleep disturbances (insomnia or hypersomnia), low energy cr fatigue, low self-esteem, and interruptions in concentration and an inability to make decisions and feelings of hopelessness. Stress and anxiety disorders are characterized by symptoms that may include restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbances, detachment or absence of emotional responsiveness. In acute cases such as when a person has experienced, The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program. 35 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Physical symptoms often accompany stress, anxiety, and depression. A person may experience pains or pounding in their chest, faintness or dizziness, loss of sexual interest, headaches or migraines, shortness of breath, and nausea (or other gastrointestinal distress). More serious medical disorders have also been linked with anxiety and depressive symptoms. Specifically, cardiac diseases include angina, arrhythmia, mitral valve prolapse, and embolus, asthma; metabolic and endocrine disorders including hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia, Cushing's disease, and pheochromocythoma, and miscellaneous disorders such as migraines, epilepsy (complex partial) and unspecified pain. The estimated cost of treating depression (and related affective disorders) reached $44 billion per year in 1990. Direct and indirect costs to employers included $12.1 billion in lost productivity, $1 1.7 billion due to absenteeism, $12.4 for treatment expense (out and in patient services and pharmaceutical cost), and $7.5 billion dollars in mortality costs. A study completed by the New York Business Group on Heath (1 990) identified consequences of employee stress, anxiety andor depression that included reduced productivity, morale problems, absenteeism, alcohoVsubstance abuse, poor work quality, high turnover, and job related accidents. Additionally, major complaints reported by workers with depression included The National Institute of Justice Grant award ## 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program. 36 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Research has also identified job performance and behavior changes that may be present in an employee experiencing stress, anxiety, and/or depression. These may include: a) marked decrease in ability to get the job done; b) working more slowly than usual; c) frequently missed deadlines; d) making excuses for inability to complete work; e) frequently calling in sick; f) appearing listless, unable to concentrate on work; g) frequently looking distracted or \"far away\"; h) showing decreased interest or involvement in work, and; i) withdrawal from interaction with co-workers. .- Physiological Stress Index Physiological Stress Index (PDI; Items 86 - 1 13) measure symptoms of physiological distress that include physical and emotional indicators of stress, anxiety, andor depression. The employees are asked if they have ever experienced any of the items, and if so, how often. The items are measured on a 6-point Likert scale (Never to Daily). The lower the score on this factor, the higher the intensity and severity of symptoms of physiological distress. Depression Depression is a disturbance in mood characterized by varying degrees of feelings of sadness, disappointment, loneness, hopelessness, self-doubt, or guilt. Correctional officers were asked to indicate how frequently they experienced a number of behaviors like items 292 - 295 using a 6- point Likert scale \"never to daily.\" Additionally, they were asked how often they agreed with a number of statements like items 121, 140, 159, 164, 183, 202, and 221 using a 5-point Likert The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program. 37 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Stressful Events/Situations Many of the stressful events that occur in the correctional officer's life are beyond their control. Some of these events are the death of a family member, close friend, or co-worker; being diagnosed with a life threatening illness; having to take care of an elderly relative; a period of prolonged sickness of a family member; or having an inmate threaten harm to their family. -._. Research has shown that even a positive event such as a marriage, birth of child, promotion, or a pay raise can cause stress. Stressful events were divided into the following two categories: work related (Items 308-3 15) and family related (items 337-348) stressful events. The items used to measure these two types of stressful events were modified from the Life Event Scale (Holmes, & Raahe, 1984). The indices were used as an indicator of overall life stress. A score of six (1 point for each event) is at the 50th percentile in the overall population. As the scores become higher, there is an increase in overall stressful events. T&Tork-related stressful events is a measure of the COS exposure to work related stressful events. A high score indicates a higher exposure to work related stressful events. The COS exposure to family related stressful events were also measured. A high score on this measure indicates that the CO has been exposed to more family related stressful events. In addition to the measure of the stressful events the CO has been exposed, the COS were also asked to describe how they responded to stressful events. The high score on the responding to stress measure indicates that the CO tends to respond more negatively to stressful situations.

A high score on the coping with stressful events measure indicates that an officer tends to have strategies to help cope with stressful situations. The scores here indicate that officers have identified symptoms of physiological and emotional depression and a low score on the coping strategies for stress. This is an area that warrants further investigation. It may be wise to look at educating officers about the signs and symptoms of depression along with a stress program to raise awareness of the connection between them. - The National Institute of Justice Grant award ## 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program. - - -% I -a 39 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

We all viewed this as an opportunity to gain new skills in the areas of conflict and communication that would help to reduce stress. This program was strictly focused on behaviors that could be controlled, -and thus changed, by the officer. It was also a day out of the facility, and we arranged to have the officers approved to wear civilian clothes rather than their uniforms. -. In order to promote open discussion, there was no DOC management at any of the training sessions. The initial sessions were met with anger and misunderstanding about why the officers had to attend, and what it was about, along with a high level of sarcasm as we began the training. Some were angry about having to travel further than their normal drive, that the directions were not always clear, and/or that the parking was confusing. Some officers went to work, in uniform, only to learn they were assigned to the training, where they found their co-workers dressed casually. Some COS even felt that they had been \"hand-picked\" to attend the program due to their responses to the survey. This fed into their concerns about confidentiality and was addressed up front in each session during orientation. There also was a sense that the training was some sort of punishment and many officers' felt they shouldn't have to participate. The trainers were able to balance allowing time to vent with The National Institute of Justice Grant award -# 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program. ?-I wx% a, - 31 3- ~ .- 46 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Often with stress educatiodmanagement training, participants find it easier to complain about that which they can't change (the administration, the boss or supervisor), rather than what they can (how one responds to criticism, how much one smokes, drinks, eats junk foods, one's attitude, etc.). This was certainly the case, and at times the oEcers' frustration with the system led to disruptive behavior. Although at times this was a serious problem, no one was asked to leave the sessions. After the first week of training, part of the space we were using in the union office became unavailable, and, between a Wednesday and the following Monday, we had to find another space for the training. This was a major challenge since we had already begun, we had a schedule that the Department and our trainers were committed to, and people were getting familiar with where we were because the word was getting out. This seemed like the last straw. How would we find centrally located space for two groups of 25, meeting daily, at times until 1 1 :00 p.m. that would have adequate parking, training space, and be affordable. We were fortunate enough to find a local restaurant owner who had two large rooms and the flexibility to meet our scheduling demands. FOCUS was now being offered from a deli/pizzeria about two blocks from the union office. Logistically, it was not the best training facility; however, it was larger, lunch and dinner were very convenient, and most importantly, it was immediately available, The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 finds this program. mjj 47 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.After the first day, we began each session with a very detailed explanation of the program, the survey, the confidentiality of what is said in the sessions, etc. We also had a union spokesman address the groups to talk about the union's role in, and support of, the project. This was helpful in setting the tone for the training. We also used this time to address questions and encourage participants to give us feedback through the evaluation sheets provided. We felt these would be a significant source of information about the program. Because the officers were often focused on the Department as the cause of their problems, it was difficult to introduce the connection between work-related stress and their marital/family and other relationships. Many stated they keep their work and personal life totally separate and were unwilling to look at those areas at all. There were also strong feelings about involving spouses and significant others in anytlung connected to work. The overwhelming majority saw no value to including family. However, some believed it would be a way to have family understand the stress of their job more fully. Because of the perceived uniqueness of their jobs, attempts to separate work and family made it difficult for officers to see what impact their behavior had on their relationships outside of work. It was difficult to make the connection between changing individual behavior, regardless of politics within the Department, and less stress at home. At the training site, there was information and handouts available on topics such as domestic violence, kids and violence, talking to kids about violence, stress, communication, finances, drugs and alcohol, PTSD, anger management, etc. Each participant received a packet with information and handouts about some of the above topics, as well as the training slides and the basic handouts for the training (Exhibit D). We also included brief bios of the trainers, EAP The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program. 48 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Officers were encouraged to then \"personalize\" their packets with information they were interested in and to share that information with their families (Exhibit E). We also encouraged discussion about the training with family members and suggested they try some of the exercises at home. The accommodations and the effort made by administration and the three Union locals to have - this program succeed were numerous. We felt it important for the officers to see both their unions' buy-in to this, as well as administration's willingness to make it happen. From a cost perspective, the Department's buy in was tremendous in straight and overtime hours for officers, as well as for Warden's and other administrative time. We talked about this during the program introduction initially, however, it seemed to stir up anger for many of the officers who felt there might have been better ways to spend the money. Instead, we emphasized the commitment that the Department has to help officers deal with the very real issue of the inherent stress of their jobs, including incorporating this program into the annual, mandatory in-service training for all officers in 2000-200 1.

There were 69 sessions and this discussion represents some of the themes that arose consistently throughout the program. Each group (and trainer) had its own personality and the trainers adapted each module as necessary to work most effectively with each group. The training curriculum had five modules (SEE Exhibit F). Module One, \"Introductions and Overview,'' provided an overview of the day's program, the course objectives and working agreements, as well as individual introductions. The objectives were ambitious: e Describe the characteristics of effective communication Describe at least three methods for reducing stress Demonstrate an understanding of conflict resolution in multiple settings Outline a personal action plan for change that builds on individual resiliency factors and reduces individual risk factors ~ As noted earlier, each session began with a historical overview of the program presented by one of two representatives from ETP and a union representative who was part of the FOCUS committee. The union representative's involvement was helpful because it illustrated their involvement in all aspects of the program from development to delivery. It was also an The National Institute of Justice Grant award ## 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program. 50 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

There was emphasis on how their unions and administration worked together to provide a program that would lead to a better understanding of, and ability to, handle the stress that impacts their daily lives. Ideally, the working agreements during a training session would come from each group and include confidentiality, mutual respect, speaking only for one's self, etc. In almost all groups, there was little interest in this beyond what was suggested by the trainer. ~ -- In terms of confidentiality, it was explained that general, anonymous feedback from the training would be shared with the Department via the evaluation forms. It was expected that participants would respect each other's confidentiality; however, all were reminded that once the sessions ended, the trainers had no control over what participants shared with others. Participants had the option to sign their names to the evaluation form that was included in their packet or to leave them anonymous. Early in the planning process we discussed the possibility of having interested COS learn to deliver this program. Although the Department's training facility has a staff of trainers, we felt the more involved officers became with this program, the more buy in we would have from them. To that end, those officers who were interested in learning to train others with the FOCUS curriculum were asked to include their name and number on the evaluation so they could be contacted by the department as the program expanded.

At the outset of each session, the trainer provided an in-depth introduction of himherself and their background, as well as answering any participant questions. As the training progressed, and the trainers felt more comfortable, there were fewer challenges. Every session began with a participant introduction exercise. The officers were broken into pairs, assigned to gather specific information about their partner, and then introduce himher to the larger group by name, position, areas of responsibilities and the first live musical concert or performance they remembered attending. This last part turned out to be a good tension breaker, leading to jokes about ages and musical tastes. After several sessions, the trainers added another category to the exercise, asking where the officers would rather be than in the training session. This also worked well since it acknowledged their feelings, yet was light in tone. Officers were responsive to that particular question - some even said they would rather be at their facility than at the training. However, by the end of each session, many officers admitted they had learned something beneficial. After getting through the general introduction to the FOCUS program, the ground rules, and the participant introductions, Module One moved into a discussion about communication with two exercises that demonstrate the importance of accurate listening, as well as speaking. Although there was some initial resistance, both The Sentence and The Story exercises generated lively discussion in the groups.

This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.It is important to note that officer training typically focuses on more concrete matters related to inmate handling, safety and security matters, andor policy and procedure protocol. Our goal for this training was to have it be more personal, looking at home and work, and focused on taking personal responsibility for handling the stress that comes from the job. It was a stretch for the officers to focus on and talk about more personal matters. - .- In Module Two, \"The Fundamentals of Effective Communication,\" the emphasis was on active listening rather than talking. It included exercises that looked at how easy is it is to hear what pu expect rather than what is being said. There was lecture and discussion about cultural and gender biases and how they impact active listening and communication. Both gender and culture are issues within the department, and although this was not diversity training, it allowed for some discussion and illustration of how easy it is to allow perceptions to be forefront in the officers' view of their co-workers. One of the things we discovered during the training was that just the word \"lieutenant\" could easily lead to a negative reaction from the officers. The trainers attempted to point out that like the ClintodGore exercise, their reaction was based on an automatic response rather than a thoughthl evaluation. The trainers contended that every lieutenant couldn't possibly be bad and the use of sweeping generalizations kept that belief alive, fostered negativity, and played a part in keeping the stress levels high within the facilities. Officers were able to relate to this when they were reminded of how they feel when there are sweeping generalizations made of them as a group. There was a similar, but less intense response to discussions about wardens, majors, and The National Institute of Justice Grant award ## 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program. 53 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The ClintodGore slide led to some lively discussion of how easy it is to assume that you see what you think you're seeing. The trainers worked to tie all of this in with the officers' perceptions of their lieutenants and other administration stafT. There were also discussions about the communication patterns that exist outside of the prisons and jails. The challenge for many of the officers is to be able to leave the \"CO persona\" at work and communicate with friends and family in a way that allows for an open sharing of ideas, acceptance, disagreement, and compromise. The officers are in a difficult position; their training reinforces the need to be strict disciplinarians and to keep their emotions in check. During their academy time, the structure is rigid and militaristic. The goal is to prepare officers to handle the inmates and work within a paramilitary system. Once they graduate, there is another adjustment to the \"real world\" of a facility. New recruits are especially vulnerable; their stress and anxiety levels are high as they try to balance what they have learned in training against \"how it really happens.\" At the same time, they are meeting their colleagues, men and women who they will come to depend on for their own safety, while adjusting to a difficult and dangerous environment. Over time, the newness wears off and they become accustomed to the routine of their particular facility. On the inside, they are in charge, yet they are expected to leave that mindset behind when they go home to friends and family. It is not surprising to learn that many have difficulty with that The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program. 54 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

This was addressed with the officers throughout the program. However, resistance came up as officers stated that the problems are at work and not at home andor that work-based training should stay out officers' personal lives. Module Three, \"Conflict Reduction,\" continued the discussion from Module Two. The goal of this section was to help officers see conflict as a natural part of any relationship, and when handled well, may lead to personal growth, understanding, and an improved relationship. The trainers emphasized both the pitfalls and benefits of conflict, encouraging participant discussion about their experiences with conflict. The bottom line message was that without discussion and some compromise, conflict is likely to escalate andor go underground. A non-scientific Conflict Resolution Questionnaire was used during the training. Officers completed and scored the survey and then discussed their results in small groups, and then in the larger group session. There was on-going discussion about how to manage conflict in ways that do not lead to escalation yet allow for the parties involved to present their views and work towards a solution. Within the Connecticut correctional setting, there are significant limitations on how this process might work between officers and their supervisors. Because the correctional system is a paramilitary structure, there are strict parameters around the chain of command that are reinforced by union contractual guidelines. The setting does not easily lend itself to creative problem solving and conflict resolution. There is not a lot of opportunity to \"negotiate\" perceived injustices and disagreements. Most often, matters are settled through a process that allows a third party to decide who is \"right' and who is \"wrong\" rather than settling on a The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program. *B q 55 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

This certainly can add to the \"us and them\" feelings expressed by the officers. However, many of the conflicts that arise at home andor outside of work can be resolved though the steps proposed in the training. As noted earlier, making the transition from CO to spouse, significant other, family, friend, etc., is not easy for some of the officers, therefore, the emphasis - was on the personal impact of unresolved conflict. There was significant discussion in the groups concerning the high rate of divorce for correctional and police officers and how the roles of the job, along with the inherent stress, make it crucial for matters of personal disagreement to be dealt with quickly. Module Four, \"Handling Stress So It Doesn't Handle You,\" focused on concrete ways to understand and manage stress. We used a combination of lecture and discussion to help the officers understand what stress is and more importantly what stress is not. The officers engaged openly in discussions of what causes stress for them and shared the kinds of things they currently do to relieve stress. We used several handouts to help participants evaluate their own reactions to their perceived stresses. The importance of this process was emphasized as a way to feel some control over daily events in the officers' lives. The focus remained on learning to control what you can, and let go of those things that are out of your control. We continuously reminded the officers that much of the stress inherent in their work is not going to change, but their reactions to that stress is in their control. We also spent time helping the officers to see that the stress that leads to upset The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 fhds this program. w- a_ ~ ~ -I 56 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

After awhile, there is a cycle of stress that is constant and an intervention at any point will offer some relief. In order to keep the potential impact of the FOCUS Program in perspective, we continued to emphasize that any changes that may occur within the \"system\" of the Department will be very slow to come. This is a beginning in terms of looking at the impact of stress and offering a program that provides some education and tools to understand stress. Training for all officers, lieutenants, captains and majors is the next step, with a long-range goal to train staff in all positions annually on various aspects of stress reduction, communication, and conflict. FOCUS is not a program designed to lead to systemic change; rather, it is geared towards individuals taking responsibility to change their own behavior in response to some parts of the system. -- Module Five, \"Making it Real - Action Planning,\" was the wrap up segment. The emphasis here was to wrap up the program with some concrete planning. There was discussion focused on 'risk' and \"risk-taking\" behavior, as well as the importance of \"resiliency.\" Officers were encouraged to look closely at where they are in terms of their risk-taking behavior. This led to several lively discussions about what really constitutes risk taking, what is dangerous, etc. This segment also focused on planning a process for change and encouraged the development of support networks to reinforce any changes. Small steps were encouraged. The goal was for small successes rather than large, unrealistic plans that will most likely fail.

The Department suggested we present one day-long session for the second part of the training that would be open to 75 officers from the targeted facilities and their spouses or significant others. Unlike our spartan accommodations in the deli, this was held in a hotel ballroom with lunch and snacks included, as _- well as a drawing for a \"stress-free,\" overnight stay for two at the hotel, including brunch and use of all amenities. We also had drawings \u20acor FOCUS polo shirts. This was a voluntary session, and participants attended on their own time. Although originally planned to be more in depth, this session focused on specific stress relieving techniques because of the size of the group. We were not able to schedule any of the original FOCUS trainers for the date, and used a trainer who has criminal justice experience, as well as working with large, challenging groups. There is no doubt we would have had more continuity had we been able to schedule one of the other trainers; however, this trainer handled herself and the group very well. The group was open to the training as well since they were self-selected as opposed to being mandated to attend the session. Advanced FOCUS training: \"Handling Stress\" (SEE Exhibit G), included numerous exercises geared to help individuals relax, feel more grounded, and try new problem-solving methods. As in the initial program, the emphasis was on individual responsibility for responding to, and The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program. 115 - -. \"a i_ - , 58 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Participants worked in groups for all of the exercises except the guided journey silent writing exercise. The day ended with each participant writing some thoughts about several particular stressful situations, and what they plan to do differently. These letters were then picked up by the trainer and mailed back to the participants two weeks after the training. ~ .- The second survey (See Exhibit B) w2s distributed to all the officers from the targeted facilities, as well as 300 randomly selected officers. The format was the same, however we did not repeat all of the questions and reduced it to 145 items. The union again was responsible for the distribution and collection. The response for the second survey was extremely disappointing. We anticipated a high response because of the familiarity with the training and the first survey, however we had only 200 usable returns out of approximately 1500 distributed. Unfortunately, we are not able to discern any significant impact from the program based on survey results.

Because of the changes to the program design, there were four brochures designed that were primarily educational about the program and issues around stress management, communication and conflict. (See Exhibit F) Due to technical and system difficulties, we were unable to get a website up and running in time for the FOCUS project. We were unable to contact anyone involved with the Connections Program, a \"self-help\" style support group of spouses of officers. EAP involvement with the Critical Incident Response Team remained at the same level as prior to the project. ZAP utilization remained about the same. There were some calls that came in as a direct response to the FOCUS training, but there was no perceptible drop in calls related to serious disciplinary actions where earlier intervention would have been beneficial. Training for Trainers (T4T) (See Exhibit F) was held to assist DOC training staff with a modified FOCUS Curriculum delivery. The department plans to include a four-hour \"FOCUS type\" program into the training for all officers in the year 2000. The Department has a team of professionals who deliver in-service training. Our goal in the brief (3.5 hours) time we had for The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 fhds this program. 60 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.the T4T was to discuss the dynamics of FOCUS and the issues that arose during our sessions. The challenge for the trainers is that they are themselves lieutenants, and often perceived to be the cause of the stress. The setting and structure of the in-service training will be different from the original FOCUS sessions in that they will be held on location, and in uniform, with DOC training staff. The training will be a half-day, with another topic in the second half. The structure sets up a totally different set of dynamics, and we anticipate much less of the overt -- resistance than we received. We presented a thorough history of the project so that they understood it and could in turn, discuss it with the officers during the training. We emphasized the history of FOCUS as an important piece of the process because it speaks to the commitment of the Department to acknowledge the stress that impacts officers on a daily basis. In discussing the history, we also talked about the survey, its distribution, and some preliminary findings. Because the lieutenants had not seen the survey, we spent time discussing how it was developed and the process of dissemination. We also discussed curriculum development and why we chose to focus on the areas of conflict and communication. We spent time talking about the perception that lieutenants are a significant source of stress for officers in order to help them prepare for any anger or frustration that may be directed towards them. We also emphasized the facilitative nature of this program versus the more didactic nature of much of the training they deliver. The content in this program is less important than the process that occurs as the participants work together in groups andor pairs.

Although the scope changed considerably from what was initially proposed, the committee and the Department would say that, overall, the program was successful. Even with all of the grumbling and anger that was evident during the FOCUS training, much of the feedback was positive, and many officers were able to see personal benefit. There were 68 1 usable training evaluations returned, and of those, 8 1.8% rated the training as favorable. The expanded survey instrument and training program was larger than what we set out to accomplish, and the time and expense the project demanded from all involved was considerably higher than our initial projections. What began as a program to educate self-selected groups in the area of stress became a program with much more impact. Another \"lesson learned\" from this project, was the absolute need to research and budget the feasibility of implementing proposed items prior to formally committing to delivery. We were not prepared for the difficulties we encountered with the survey delivery and the poor returns we received. Perhaps we were ndive in our thinking when we agreed to have the Union handle the distribution and collection, rather than using the two outside researchers to manage this. It was disappointing to receive only 50% back with the pre-training survey; however, we were hopeful that once the training was complete, we would see a better return rate for the The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program. _Y . 62 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Due to the poor response from the second survey, we were not able to gather any tangible information to compare pre and post results. Although many officers expressed dissatisfaction with their supervisors and the administration, many suggested that similar sessions with COS and lieutenants together would be helpful in learning to understand each other. This kind of innovative idea may not have surfaced without this training, and although it may not occur immediately, it is a great idea to test with several small groups of volunteers. Based on the FOCUS experience, we would recommend that any blended groups be of a voluntary nature. The union and the administration worked together on a project in an extremely amicable fashion. The Department showed a tremendous willingness to work with the committee to have the training delivered. Both sides made concessions and entered into an agreement stating they would not use any survey results information during the collective bargaining process. Did we accomplish everything we set out to? No, we didn't. But, at the same time, we accomplished more than we planned when the scope of the program changed. We learned more than we anticipated and much of that information will be used by the Department to augment training provided to all staff, as well as to look closely at the areas of concern raised in the survey results. The tnodijied FOCUS training began Department wide in September 2000. The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program.

There were four facilities originally chosen to participate: 0 0 0 York CI-The state's only female facility, housing pre-trial and sentenced women at all security levels, 325 COS Webster CI-A low-level security, pre-release facility, 77 COS Cheshire CJ-A high-level security facility, housing long-term sentenced offenders, 33 5 COS Manson Youth CI-A high-level security facility, housing offenders ages 14 to 2 1 , 173 COS - The method was to present a series of one-hour, introductory workshops at the facilities and at off-site training areas, during the day as well as in the evening, with pizza and childcare available during the evening sessions. Proposed topics for the workshops included \"Active Parenting Skills\", \"Managing Stress,\" Effective Communication Skills,\" and \"The High-Risk Lifestyle.\" Consideration was also given to some type of program on \"Managing Credit Card Spending\" and \"Financial Planning.\" Upon completion of the introductory sessions, there would be more \"in-depth\" sessions, two hours in duration, offered at each facility. In order to have the program accessible to officers, manageable for the Department of Correction (DOC), and meet coverage needs, sessions were planned as follows: 0 Four topics presented twice at each facility, for a total of 32 one-hour presentations. Follow-up sessions with two, two-hour Presentations at each facility, for a total of 16 hours. There would be a total of 48 hours of presentations. All COS fiom the participating facilities would be invited to voluntarily attend any and all of the workshops, and to invite their family members andor significant others. A short, pre/post, self-report survey instrument would be mailed to the homes of the officers at the four facilities, and to the officers at one representative control facility. We anticipated a 30 percent response rate from the surveys. FOCUS also proposed to look at the life cycle of an officer, and prepare a series of short, educational brochures describing what we saw to be significant events during the career of an officer: Graduation from the academy into their assigned facility and promotion after the probationary period The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Attendance.at DOC Health Fairs, with FOCUS information, as well as EAP information. Another, more informal goal of the program was to increase awareness of the Department's Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Although usage was good, often COS were coming into the program at a point where they were facing serious discipline, usually related to reliability issues. If we could educate officers to reach out for help sooner, we felt absenteeism and discipline could be reduced. The majority of EAP participants reported some stress related concerns when calling the program for help. 0 0 Process The original proposal was written by the vendor of the Department's EAP, ETP Inc, and a DOC personnel representative, with input from other DOC administrators. Once the Grant was awarded, a multi-disciplinary team was put in place to implement the project. In looking at the many \"lessons learned\" from this process, the first was not including the officer's union from the start of the program design. Prior to submitting the proposal, we asked the officer's union presidents from several AFSCME Locals to write a letter of support for the program, which they did. The plan was to have them be part of the team once the grant was awarded. The team was comprised of union stewards from the participating facilities, several union presidents, an EAP liaison, the project manager from ETP, and the Principal Investigator from the Department. Although time was a factor in our moving forward with grant writing as quickly as possible, it became clear that this type of project needs union support from the very beginning. As the team began meeting on a regular basis to flesh out and implement the program, numerous suggestions were made from the union concerning the structure of the program. These initial changes are reflective of what happens when a plan is designed for a group without their input. The name of the program, was changed to FOCUS (Families, Officers, and Corrections Understanding Stress) almost immediately, in response to the union's concern that the name COMP is too close to \"Worker's Comp\" - a system that for many COS has a negative connotation. The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program 2 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.We added the Hartford Correctional Center, one of the Department's three jails, with pre- sentenced and short-term sentenced inmates, 180 COS; and Northern CI, the State's super maximum security facility, 236 COS, to the project, and removed the youth facility. The total number of COS for the project now was 1153, up fiom the original 910, however, including these facilities gave us a much more accurate cross section of the Department. This also increased the number of participating facilities and added extra training sessions. During our initial meetings, it was recommended that the program consist of five introductory courses for each of the five facilities, offered two times, for a total of 50 one-hour sessions. The advanced workshops would average five per facility, and not exceed 25, two-hour sessions, for a maximum total of 100 hours of programs. The topics remained the same. As we began to look at tools to evaluate the effectiveness of the training as well as the levels and perceptions of stress in the Department, we ]looked at what Robin Gershon, Ph.D. had used in her NIJ project concerning stress and State Police Officers in Maryland. Our plan was to add to andor change the context of some of her questions to more aptly fit COS. Dr. Gershon was willing to assist in this process, offering to search for and validate items more appropriate for a correctional setting. - As it was initially written, the program assumed a relatively small number of participants, with the hope of learning and then expanding in the future. The union began to look at this as an opportunity to survey all COS (4,100), thus having a significant amount of data with which to evaluate stress in the Department for officers. The FOCUS Program would be a way to make some intervention with a selected group, while the richness of the data could be used for future planning. Training and Survey Design Once this idea was accepted, seeking the survey instrument took on a different level of importance. Searching for an intact survey that would suitably measure the specifics of the setting proved unsuccessful. We brought in Mark Sullivan and John Rogers, of S&R Associates, researchers with experience in the customized development of surveys measuring issues such as employee morale and work related stress. In addition, one of the researchers had involvement with the union in the past around this very issue when AFSCME had explored doing something similar several years ago. Numerous meetings were held with S&R Associates to look at the feasibility of their working with us; they reviewed the Gershon survey as well as reviewing some of the literature. The final recommendation from them was to design a survey specifically for the DOC, with the thinking that much, if not all, would be applicable to any state department of correction. The first step in the survey design was to facilitate series of CO focus groups to meet with Sullivan and Rogers in order to validate the issues identified in the project and in the literature review. Fifteen groups were interviewed, and all participants were randomly selected for each 3 The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The areas were: 1) burnout; 2) job satisfaction; 3) personal finance; 40 family life; 5) race; 6) gender; 7) employment issues; 8) other matters. The sessions included between 9 and 12 participants and lasted approximately 90 minutes. The information from the groups overwhelmingly indicated a strong level of suspicion about the process, and the anonymity of information shared in the groups. There was an overwhelming feeling of distrust for the administration, and especially a lack of confidence in mid level management, i.e., the Lieutenants at the facilities, There were concerns about favoritism, sexism, racism, and a lack of respect for COS and their work. There was also concern expressed as to what, if any, impact this type of program could have, and suspiciousness expressed as to the motivation for such a program. The union and the EAP were both mentioned as groups that don't always address the COS needs, and at times pander to the administration. The issue of confidentiality within the EAP was challenged as well. The inmates were not described as a source of stress for the COS. Simultaneously, we were looking at the actual training program for the targeted facilities - how could we attract the greatest number of officers? Because of facility scheduling, offering the five training sessions two times per facility would not capture a large number of participants. Even with creative scheduling, offering more evening programs for families in centralized locations presented challenges: How many COS would attend any type of programming on their time off! The union and the Department both began to see this training as having a much greater impact if it were to be mandatory rather than elective, and a full day's duration rather than the shorter sessions originally planned. Further discussion led to this becoming part of the required, in- service training days that all officers must complete annually. With much discussion between the union, the Department liaison, and the training academy management, a plan began to unfold to present a mandatory, full day of FOCUS training to every CO in the five targeted facilities. The next two challenges were how and where to schedule these sessions, and what the structure would be. We initially looked at multiple locations, with simultaneous sessions, however, that was unmanageable because of the number of trainers we would need. We wanted to have the training occur away from the worksite, keeping it unique, while at the same time, meeting academy requirements. We finally settled on doing the training at one of the union offices that was centrally located in the state. Although not an ideal training site, we felt it was a good choice in that it made a very strong statement about the union's support of the program. More importantly, it was a statement of the union's commitment to addressing the issue of stress within the Department, and taking steps to make some changes. The design of the training went through several \"metamorphoses\" as we looked at the shift from several one and two-hour presentations to full day of training. Once we ruled out multiple offerings/multiple sites, we settled on a six-hour day of training, with one trainer per group. The day would cover conflict, and communication, two major factors in stress, as well as general The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program 4 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.hints for handling stress, and an action-planning piece at the end. The program was highly interactive and experiential. To cover the 69 training sessions, we used seven trainers, with three of them providing a majority of the training. Although there was a curriculum provided, it was important that the trainers be flexible enough to \"roll with\" the particular group in front of them. Over time they became quite adept at working with the officers and keeping the sessions on track, while addressing some of the unique needs of a certain group or individual. In order to have the training be meaningful, we set a maximum of 25 participants per group, and averaged 22. We ran two groups daily for 34 days and one group on the last day for a total of 69, six-hour training sessions, 414 direct training hours. Programs ran from 8:OO AM to 3:30 PM or 3:30 PM to 11 :00 PM. Attendance was very high at over 95%, with only officers on extended leave missing the program. Once the survey instrument was completed, the committee met numerous times to review and make suggestions for changes. When it was finished, we had a 352 item questionnaire that we felt covered both personal and work related stresses as well as current coping mechanisms. We had six officers take the survey and give us feedback concerning both the level of difficulty and the time involved in responding to it. There were no reported problems understanding or responding to the questions, and the time averaged 30 minutes. Because of the expanded survey size, as well as the unanticipated development costs, mailing the survey to 4 100 officers became cost prohibitive. Conventional wisdom predicts low return rates on mailed items, even with pre-paid return postage; we wanted as high a return as possible in order to produce worth while results. The union suggested, and the Department agreed to allow time on shift for each officer to complete the survey. This entailed a Herculean effort by the Wardens and other ranking facility managers to schedule and cover time for this to happen. The union agreed to have reps at each facility hand out the surveys and collect them, hopefully reducing any suspiciousness on the officers' part. Only union members would handle the surveys. We anticipated a very high rate of return for three reasons: 1) the issue of officer stress is paramount, 2) this is the first opportunity to capture this information in a legitimate, systematic fashion, and 3) the officers are being paid to fill out the survey. In order to accurately measure any impact the training may have, there had to be some type of identifying code for each survey. Much discussion ensued with the union regarding this matter, and there was a great deal of concern expressed right away concerning confidentiality and how an identifier would cause some alarm amongst the officers. The researchers spoke in depth with the union regarding why this was necessary, however, it was an issue that came back to haunt us once the surveys were distributed. The code used for ID purpose was the last four digits of the officer's social security number, and the last four digits of their phone number. The return rate for the initial survey was in the 50% range - disappointing, given the structure that was in place. As one would expect with a project of this size, all things did not go as planned - the survey distribution wasn't as smooth as we had hoped for; some surveys were picked up by Lieutenants and stored in Warden's offices causing the level of distrust to rise. The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 hds this program 5 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.Although we had set a time frame of two weeks for the surveys to be completed, they came in for up to almost eight weeks after they were handed out. Many came back unusable, unreadable, or incomplete. There were many angry comments written in the space for feedback about the Department, this project, etc. The survey results showed a high level of dissatisfaction with management, namely the Lieutenants, the next largest group of Department employees after the officers, and the group who directly supervise the officers. There also distrust and dissatisfaction expressed about how officers are treated during an internal investigation and/or inmate attack or accusation. This carried over into all of the training sessions. ' The Training Although we knew there was a level of anger and frustration with the administration, as well as a high level of distrust in the administration, the union and the EAP, we were not prepared for the anger that was present during the survey distribution and the subsequent training. We all viewed this as a great opportunity to gain new skills in the areas of conflict and communication that would help to reduce stress. This program was strictly focused on behaviors that could be controlled, and thus changed, by the officer. It was also a day out of the facility, and we arranged to have the officers approved to wear civilian clothes rather than their uniforms. In order to promote open discussion, there was no DOC management staff at the training. The beginning sessions were met with anger and misunderstanding about why the officers were there, what it was about, along with a high level of sarcasm as we attempted to begin the training. Some were angry about having to travel further than their normal drive, that the directions were not always clear, and/or the parking was conhsing. Some officers went to work, in uniform, only to find out they were assigned to the training, where they found their co-workers dressed casually. There was a sense that this was a punishment, and many felt they didn't need it, but that their Lieutenants did. The trainers soon learned how to balance allowing time to vent with covering the content, however, we never were able to get away from the pervasive tone of anger at the administration and especially the Lieutenants. Often with training around stress, participants find it easier to complain about that which they can't change (the administration, the boss or supervisor), rather than those they can (how one responds to criticism, how much one smokes, drinks, eats junk foods, one's attitude, etc.). At times disruptive behavior was a serious problem, although no one was asked to leave the sessions. After the first week of training, part of the space we were using in the union office became unavailable to us - with almost no notice, we had to find another space for the training. This was a major challenge since we had begun, we had a schedule, and people were getting familiar with where we were because the word was getting out. This seemed like the last straw - where to find a space for two groups of 25, daily, including evenings, that would be centrally located. Amazingly enough, the project manager went out for a coffee during a break one morning and in talking about our plight to the owner of the deli, was offered space in his building. FOCUS was The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program 6 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Again, not the best training site, but it was more spacious and lunch or dinner was very convenient! After the first day, we began each session with a detailed explanation of the program, the survey, the confidentiality of what is said in the sessions, etc. We also had a union spokesman address the groups to talk about their role in, and support of, the project. This was helpful in setting the tone for the training. We also used this time to encourage participants to give us feedback through the evaluation sheets provided. We felt these would be a significant source of information about the program. Because the officers were often focused on the Department as the cause of their problems, it was difficult to introduce the issue of how they handle work stress directly influences their marital/family and other relationships. - Many stated they keep their work and personal life totally separate, and were unwilling to look at those areas at all. There were also strong feelings about involving spouses and significant others in anything connected to work. The overwhelming majority saw no value to including family except to have family understand the stress of their job more fully. It appeared that a result trying to separate work and family, with the perceived uniqueness of their work often made it difficult for the officers to see the impact of their own behavior on their relationships. It was hard to make the connection between changing individual behavior, regardless of the politics in the Department, and less stress at home. At the training site, there was information and handouts available on topics such as domestic violence, kids and violence, talking to kids about violence, stress, communication, finances, drugs and alcohol, PTSD, anger management, etc. Each participant received a packet with information and handouts about some of the above topics as well as the training slides and the basic handouts for the training. We also included brief bios of the trainers, EAP information and an evaluation sheet. Officers were encouraged to \"personalize\" their packets with information they were interested in, and to share the info with their families. We also encouraged discussion about the training with family members, and even trying some of the exercises at home. FOCUS ll and The Survey, Part ll Obviously, the format of the program had changed from the original plan, with training hours exceeding four times the total proposed by the time we completed phase one. It was determined that for the second part of the training, we would present one day long session that would be open to seventy-five officers from the targeted facilities, and their spouses or significant others. Unlike our spartan accommodations in the deli, this was held in a hotel ballroom, with lunch included. This was a voluntary session, and participants attended on their own time. planned to be more in depth, because of the size of the group, this session focused on specific stress relieving techniques. We were not able to schedule any of the original FOCUS trainers for the date, and used a trainer who has had criminal justice experience and had worked with large, challenging groups. There is no doubt that we would have had more continuity had we been able to schedule one of the other trainers, however, this trainer handled herself and the group very Although originally The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program 7 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The group was open to the training as well since they were self-selected as opposed to being mandated to attend the session. The second survey was distributed to all the officers from the targeted facilities as well as 300 randomly selected officers. The format was the same, however, we did not repeat all of the questions, and reduced it to 145 items. The union again was responsible for the distribution and collection. The response for the second survey was also disappointing; we anticipated a high response because of the familiarity with the training, however we ended up with only 200 usable returns. Unfortunately we are not able to discern any impact from the program based on survey results. Other Items The proposed Officer Life Cycle Brochures: Because of the changes to the program design, there were four brochures designed that were primarily educational about the program and issues around stress management, communication and conflict. Due to technical and system difficulties, we were unable to get a web page up and running in time for the FOCUS project. We were unable to contact anyone involved with the Connections Program, a \"self-help\" style support group of spouses of officers. EAP involvement with the Critical Incident Response Team remained at the same level as prior to the project. EAP utilization remained about the same; there were some calls that came in as a direct response to something they learned in the FOCUS training, but there was no perceptible drop in calls related to serious disciplinary actions where earlier intervention would have been beneficial. Training for Trainers was held to assist DOC training staff with a modified FOCUS Curriculum delivery. The department will include a four-hour \"FOCUS type\" program into the training for all officers in the year 2000. Original FOCUS materials were distributed, and an overview of the program was presented. Wrap Up A question that had come up frequently during this project as well as once the training was complete was \"Was this SUCC~SS~~~?'~ It depends on what \"successfhl\" means, however, the committee would say overall, the program was successful. Even with all of the grumbling and anger that was evident with the FOCUS training, much of the feedback was positive, and many officers were able to see personal benefit, even though the Department and the politics have not changed. Although many officers expressed anger towards their Lieutenants, and the administration, many suggested that similar sessions with COS and Lieutenants together would be helpful in learning 8 The National Institute of Justice Grant award # 98-FS-VS-003 funds this program This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

We are the first and only correctional department in the country to be included in the project, thus giving us the opportunity to become a national leader in the area of Correction Officer stress. What makes this opportunity particularly important is the inclusion of family members in the program. To ensure the success of the program, the Department, AFSCME Council 4, and our Employee Assistance Program (EAP) will work together to deliver the services under the FOCUS program (Families, Officers & Corrections Understanding Stress). This unique partnership brings together those people with both a first-hand knowledge of the department and the stress involved in the work of a Correction Officer. The Department, the union, and the EAP recognize that stress impacts all areas of the lives of our Correction Officers and their families. The goal of FOCUS is to reduce Correction Officer and family stress through education and training in the areas of communication, personal stress management, conflict mediation, parenting skills, and prudent money and debt management. The program will be implemented in five facilities: Cheshire CI, Webster CI, York CI, Northern CI and Hartford orrectional Center. It is our hope that this pilot program will lead to more funding for a departmental-wide program in the year 2000 and beyond. In order to be successful, the program depends on the participation and support of Correction Officers at all facilities. In March, a questionnaire will be randomly distributed; please take the time afforded you to answer the questions and return the questionnaire to your FOCUS designee. The questionnaire is confidential, and there is nothing on it that will identify you individually. Participation is voluntary. Once the program is completed, the same questionnaire will be distributed again so that we can evaluate the impact of the education components on Officers. We hope to prove that Officers' participation in FOCUS show a positive change in their ability to manage stress at home and at work. Your participation could lead to changes and improvements in the departmental training programs. For those Officers in the five participating facilities, please encourage your family member(s)/significant other to participate in the educational programs as they are developed in response to the questionnaire. Watch for further for your support of this important program. David LaPointe, President Donald Sevas, Staff Representative David Moffa, President AFSCME. Council 4 !

Arm- mg remembers coming up as a Tectional officer more than 20 irs ago, when prison guards were igh all the time. \"Everybody had a facade,\" said mstrong, now the state's commis- mer of correction. \"It was your me face for the game inside that u also kept on when you went ewhere in your life.\" In some ways, things haven't anged. \"Certainly you do have to be her tough in this business,\" Arm- ong said. \"It's not for the meek.\" But being impenetrable has its price. According to Education and Training Programs Inc. (ETP) of Hartford, which administers the De- partment of Correction's Employee Assistance Program, clinical evi- dence suggests that correctional of- ficers have higher-than-normal rates of ulcers, heart attacks, hyperten- sion, that they live shorter lives and have more marital and family prob- lems than the general public. Much of it, say the officers, comes from stress. \"Personally, one of the best ways to do it is to leave your spess at the gym,\" said Dave Moffa, president of union local 387 in the Cheshire Complex. Moffa said being around his family helps him get rid of stress - \"but some people just can't release it like that.\" The department, while still ex- pecting its correctional officers to be cool and strong in the face of a crisis that could come at any time, now wants them to be human, tQo. \"Outside of here there's a lot less necessity for some of the things in- side,\" Armstrong said \"We need to have people able to make those transi- tions. And it should be a transition you make every day - as you come in, you recognize where you are, as you leave, you know where you're going.\" Together with the American Feder- ation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the department last week celebrated at the Maloney Center for Training and Staff Development after receiving a $lOO.OOO renewable grant from the National Institute of Justice to implement a program called FO- CUS - Families, Officers and Cor- rections Understanding Stress. Armstrong said the department is one of eight law enforcement orga- nizations to receive the grant, and the only department of correction to do so. The program will be conduct- ed in Connecticut with personnel from the Cheshire, Hartford, North- ern, Webster and York correctional institutions. Curriculum is to be de- veloped by a committee of union members, administrators and the Employee Assistance Program. \"What's in this grant is money to do a survey and baseline studies (lo dis- cover) what are the issues:: said Larry W.

He wasn't directing traffic. It was 12:25 a.m. on Nov. 27. The trooper was dazed. He had hit a deer, and his cruiser, its flashing lights shimmering off trees in the woods beside the road, was severely damaged, its wind- shield shattered. The first person on the scene was Correction Officer William Tracey of the Gates Correctional Institu- tion, who was returning home after the 4- 12 shift. Tracey safely escorted state trooper to the side of the road and tended to him until members of Troop E responded to the trooper's call for assistance. High court to review federal 4 ntervention The U.S. Supreme Court on Dec. 6 announced that it will look at a federal law aimed at limiting the oversight of state prisons by federal courts. The justices will review a statutory provision that automat- ically would end a judge's supervision ofa correctional facility if the judge failed to respond to such a request within 90 days. As the result of inmate lawsuits over prison conditions, some courts have or- dered state officials to relieve those condi- tions that violate a constitutional right. Congress enacted the PrisonLitigation Re- form Act (PLRA) because it felt that fed- eral courts were intruding too far into state prison management. Under thePLRA, rem- edies must be the \"least intrusive means necessary\" to correct any violation. Jail$ raise 15 big ones for CSEC charities The Bridgeport Correctional Center this year raised $9,300 for the State Em- ployee Campaign, Warden John Tarascio announced.

Several months after his death, a stress program was formed for correctional and law enforcement officers in the area From that initiative, the Rhode Island Doc's Stress Unit evolved. Correctional officers, much like police officers, operate in a work environment that is characterize by unusually high levels of stress. Although a great deal of research has been conducted concerning the causes and consequences of stress for law enforcement officers, there have been few examinations of the correctional environment. The existing studies of correctional officer wellness identify a number of factors, both environmental and organizational, that are potential stressors. These include, but are not limited to: inmate demands and manipulation Low pay Overtime Poor public image Problems with co-workers Role ambiguity Role conflict Rotating shift work Threat of inmate violence 70 - December 1999 Corrections Today Understaffing Unrealistic supervisor demands The consequences of stress are varied and can include both physical and emotional symptoms. Correctional offi- cers may become vulnerable to a variety of stress-related illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and gastroenterological problems. Emotional problems also can surface, such as increased irritability, feelings of tension and depression. Addictive behaviors such as substance abuse, gambling and overeat- ing may emerge as well. These problems can cause or exac. erbate existing family problems. According to Francis E Cheek's 1984 book, Stress Management for Correctional Ofi cers and Their Families (American Correctional Associa tion), the average divorce rate among correctional officers is higher than that of law enforcement officers and is mor\u20ac than the national average as well. Carr's father spent his entire career in law enforcemen and corrections. He died at the age of 54. \"I feel that is to( young, since 1 am 57 years old,\" says Cam. According to Cheek's book, the average life span of correctional officer is 59 years. If this holds true today, thl life expectancy rate for correctional officers is significantl, less than that of the general public and also is less thai that of law enforcement officers. Beyond the toll on the individual, occupational stres also is costly for correctional institutions. Officers sufferin from stress-related medical or mental illnesses can great1 impact budgets. The financial losses incurred may includ high staff turnover and the resultant loss of huma resource recruitment and training investment, overtimc sick leave, early retirement due to jobrelated stress, an workers' compensation claims arising from avoidabl injuries suffered or caused by a distracted employee.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice., In 1994, the US.

Lrs and their families. The National Institute of Justice (Na, the research, evaluation and development arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, was designated to award grants to state and local agencies and organizations to support research, demonstration and evaluation projects on stress intervention methods. A year later, NU published Developing a Law Enforce- ment Stress Program for Officers and Their Families, which explored state-of-the-art practices for preventing and reducing the effects of police and family stress. Since the publication of this report four years ago, No has solicited grant proposals from law enforcement and correctional agencies and the organizations representing these officers @e., unions or membership associations) to develop or examine a variety of subjects related to the causes, effects and solutions for jobrelated stress for officers as well as their families. To date, 24 grants have been awarded to cor- rectional and law enforcement agencies and affiliated orga- nizations. The demonstration and training grants have included work in the following areas: Critical incident stress debriefing and management Peer support services Development of police psychological services referral (CISD/CISM) techniques networks 'revision of police chaplaincy services Provision of rookie stress inoculation counseling Police organizational change and well-being Development of stress management training methods - Development of train-the-trainer stress education pro- Grantees are now developing and demonstrating innov- ative stress treatment and training programs for officers and their families. Some also are researching the nature and causes of officer stress, as well as effective methods for its early detection. Through the NU-funded work of the grantees, knowledge is advancing in several key and previ- ously understudied areas: The development, implementation and coordination of services. We will have a greater understanding of the feasi- bility and impact of expanding services to families, includ- ing services traditionally offered only to officers. The feasibility and efficacy of various program elernents/strategies. We are developing knowledge on vari- ous program elements, such as mandatory vs. voluntary approaches; peer support vs. professional referrals; rates of use of various kinds of services (e.g., hotlines); the tim- ing of interventions (e.g., during recruit training, in-service or following crisis); and the target of interventions (e.g., recruits, family members, supervisors). \"be eficacy of specific approaches.

Funds from this grant are being used to support the DOC'S \"Families, Officers and Correc- tions\" (FOCUS) initiative. Five correctional facilities in Connecticut, including the state's maximum security insti- tution. were chosen to field-test FOCUS.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.The interventions provided depend, in part, on the offi- cer's progression through the career/life cycle. For example, an officer who recently has become eligible for promotion may receive brochures from FOCUS notifying him or her of available educational and training opportuni- ties. Another officer who has been passed over for promo- tion may receive many of the same brochures in addition to a list of available support groups or information on how to obtain EAP assistance. Thus far, the Connecticut DOC has administered a presurvey to all correctional officers to determine current stress levels and to identify potential stressors. This infor- mation has been used to focus curriculum development for the workshops in order to better meet the needs of the offi- cers. Officer and family workshop training began in August. FOCUS aims to help officers and their families learn how to better manage stress improve family communication skills, enhance coping skills and improve parenting skills. The following components were built into the program to help achieve these objectives: Introductory FOCUS and conflict resolution training during academy attendance with conflict resolution training provided on an annual basis thereafter; Workshops for both officers and their family members to cover a variety of topics related to stress, family relationships and parenting; Replicating a support group called Connections that already existed elsewhere in the state and was specif- ically designed to deal with the unique stressors of spouses and family members living with correctional officers; Provision of technical assistance to personnel officers to help them maximize employee and family partici- pation in the existing Employee Assistance Program (EAP); Enhancement and expansion of EAP to permit a better response to critical incidents for both officers and their families, provide services for a greater range of incidents and include verbal harassment; and Dissemination of topical information on a variety of issues through upcoming workshops, available ser- vices, Connection group meetings and other venues. Interventions provided by FOCUS are tailored to coin- cide with certain stages in the officer \"career/life cycles.\" The premise is that officers generally follow a specific career path that requires them to negotiate several critical phases, all of which can be stressful. These critical junc- tures generally include graduation from the academy, eligi- bility to begin the promotional process, reaching a \"career plateau,\" post-critical incidents, reassignment and retire- ment. . Much attention has been given to the nature, causes and consequences of police officer stress, but few efforts have as yet been targeted toward corrections. We now are catching up and will be for some time. NIJ remains commit- ted to the field of corrections and to developing the knowl- edge for evidencebased practice. NIJ is completing a complementary, companion docu- ment to Developing a Law Enforcement Family Stress PrD. gmm for Officers and Families. The publication, Addressing Correctional Officer Stress: Programs and Strategies, exam- ines methods to mitigate correctional officer stress. It is scheduled for release at the end of the year. To encourage corrections professionals to submit appli- cations for funding (and thereby increase the number of correctional officer stress programs), NIJ sponsored a grant writing workshop in May. Forty-seven participants from 27 jurisdictions attended. The participants included administrators, researchers, counselors, EAP managers, and community and institutional correctional officers. As a result of this workshop, 25 of the 27 jurisdictions submit- ted proposals for CLEFS funding. In addition, NIJ has invited researcher Dr. Robert Delpri- no to its staff as a visiting fellow. Delprino is examining the similarities and differences between police and correction- al stress, expanding NIJ's current research portfolio and assessing the transferability of technology between the two professional groups. Delprino also will help conduct a national survey to assess the nature and extent of stress- related services available to correctional officers and their families. NIJ recognizes the extraordinary demands of the corrections profession and the potential consequences to correctional officers and their families. It is hoped that this collective effort, supported by the CLEFS program, will not only expand the existing body of knowledge, but also will serve as a catalyst to heighten discussion about correction- al oflicer stress and its effects.

Recently, you should have received a brochure that provided an overview of the Families, Officers, and Corrections Understanding Stress (FOCUS) Project. In that brochure, we indicated that the goal of the project was to reduce Correction Officer and family stress through education and training. The FOCUS project is the collaborative effort of AFSCME Council 4 and the Connecticut Department of Correction, in conjunction with ETP Inc. and Drs. M. E. Sullivan and J. B. Rogers (S & R Associates). The following survey was developed through that collaboration. In order to insure that the results of this survey accurately represent the perceptions of the Correction Officers, we want to urge you to answer each question as honestly as possible. To insure your confidentiality, the completed survey will only be handled by the AFSCME liaison and returned directly to S & R Associates for analysis. I a i The Connecticut Department of Correction, AFSCME (Locals 387, 391, and 1565), ETP Inc., and S & R Associates hope that we can begin to effect a significant change in the lives of all Correction Officers and their families with your help. We want to thank you for providing us with vour effort and time.

The easiest way to do this is to repeat back to the person what you hear them say-for exam- ple: 'what I hear you saying is\", or, \"are you saying,\" or something similar. Although this may seem uncomfortable and awkward at times, it is the best way to practice really listening, and getting away from your own agenda. If you have concerns regarding your communi- cation with a specific person, talk with them about it and \"invite\" them to try this exercise with you. communication and conflict and how they relate to stress.

We had an excellent turnout, with 99% of avail- able COS attendingthe training. This program was different from most DOC trainings in that it at- tempted to begin to bridge the gap between home and work. The training focused on three main areas: Communication, Conflict, and Stress Identification/Stress Management. During the training, participants often questioned why we focused on personal/family relationships rather than work. As we put this program together, we realize the areas we could impact most are those where the CO has some control. We also believe that it is difficult, if not impossible, to separate the feelings that are related to stress, . regardless of where they come from. Stress from wo w mpdcts home and family, stress from home and family impacts work. Stress can be defined as the body and mind's response to outside demands- it is neither good nor bad. HOWEVER, STRESS ACCUMULATES1 And if it isn't handled, the build up can become toxic to the individual, as well as those around him/her. Response to Stress The way we respond to stressful events/demands is the key to our health and well-being and the quality of our relationships. Unresolved conflicts and poor commu- nication lead to anger, resentment, misunderstandings and stress. Once this cycle begins, the origin of the issue becomes irrelevant. Communication The hardest part of communication is listen- ing not talking-we can all talk, but how many of us actually listen to what is beingsaid? It is often easier to focus on what we think the person means, or is going to say next-we may even finish their sentences for them! This style of communication can easily lead to anger and frustration for both parties. We often will hold on to this anger, allowing it to grow and fester-the other person becomes the problem. That impacts how we relate to that individual, and others, both at work and at home. It is easy to see how a simple misunderstand- ing over a relatively small matter can grow to a point where all communications with that person becomes tainted. Left unresolved, this can ultimately impact the way you feel about this person in all areas of your relationship. It is why at times, very close friends and/or family members go for long periods of time without speaking to each other. Often the cause was a simple misunderstanding.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.In Connecticut, many correction officers talk about the stress they experience on the job - stress that, too often, gets taken home. Nationally, there is research that documents the impact of that stress: There is overwhelming evidence that stress is an important contributor to the abnormally high incidence of health and relationship prob- lems among correction personnel. Research sug- gests that occupational stress may be the most important cause of this typically shorter life span and abnormally high marital and family-related problems. (ACA, 1984) Correctional officers have a high likelihood of heart attacks, ulcers, hypertension, and other serious illnesses (ACA 1984) There are strong indications that correctional officers are susceptible to a wide range of be- havior health problems, including alcoholism, substance abuse, and depression (Cornelius 1994) There are few statistical data concerning cor- rectional officer suicide rates due to the taboos against reporting the problem; however, the consensus among DOCS nationwide is that correctional officer suicide is a significant prob- lem (Kamerman 1998) The FOCUS program will help Connecticut cor- rection officers avoid these problems.

Families, Officers and Corrections Understand- ing Stress is a joint project of: *the Connecticut Department of Correction; *the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees Council 4; and WorkMax, a division of ETP Inc. WorkMax has provided the employee assistance pro- gram for the DOC for the past five years. mat is the Goal? The goal of this project is to reduce correction officer and family stress through education and training in the areas of communications, stress management, conflict mediation, parenting skills, prudent money and debt management, and related issues. How Will it be Done? Funded by the National Institute of Justice and the collaborating partners, this project has sev- eral components: *Collaborative development of the demon- stration project Use of focus groups of randomly selected Connecticut correction officers to develop a survey instrument to collect key data to aid in the development of program services. mat is FOC~ ~ *Analysis of a comprehensive survey of all Connecticut correction officers, conducted by Dr. Mark Sullivan, to determine issues that create work and family stress for correc- tion officers *Provision of educational materials on stress-related topics at health fairs *A da y-long in-service training on critical topics for all correction officers of York Cor- rectional Institution, meshire Correctional Institution, Webster Correctional Institution, Northern Correctional Institution, and Hart- ford Correctional Center *Periodic distribution of educational re- source materials *A follow-up survey with randomly se- lected correction officers to determine what impact the training have had. The Survey - June 1999 Dr. Sullivan has been hired by the FOCUS com- mittee because of his extensive experience in the area of statistical studies and survey de- velopment. Dr. Sullivan has developed surveys for several area corporations, including Sikorsky Aircraft and Pratt & Whitney. The confidential survey will be distributed by union members at each correctional facility dur- ing the month of June. An envelope will be provided for the return of the survey to Dr. Sullivan. The Training - September through December 1999 During these four months, ETP lnc. will work with the Wardens and the Training Officers of York Cl, Cheshire U, Webster Cl, Northern CI, and Hartford CC to determine the best times to hold all day training sessions on issues that create stress for correction officers. The survey will be used to determine the key areas of concern that officers would like ad- dressed during these training. During each 8-hour day of training, 1-112 to 2-hour workshops will be held addressing the three or four subjects found most stressful. These might include stress coping and manage- ment skills, communication, conflict resolution, and parenting information. Family members of correction officers will also be invited to these trainings. Additionally, educational resource material that will list local resources to address the issues cre- ating stress will be created and distributed to correction officer via their pay envelopes or mailing to their homes. It is hoped by the Department of Correction. AFSCME, and ETP that, if significant change can be documented through this effort, additional IST time will be allocated by the Department in future years for trainings on stress manage- ment and reduction.

I'd like to take a break, step away, cool off, and try this discussion again.\" (put in some timeframe, in an hour, in 10 minutes, at the end of our shift, etc ...). What's impor- tant here is that you stop before words are said that damage a friendship/ relationship. Next Step If possible, try to get outside for even five minutes - if that can't happen due to your post, then spend a minute taking some deep \"belly breaths\" to clear your head. Belly breathing is deep, and inflates your belly on the intake. If you can, quickly scan your body and for those areas that are tense, quickly tighten the area even more, hold for 5 sec- onds and release. Take several more deep breaths, and you will feel better. Seem silly? Maybe, but it works, and what do you have to loose? When you re- turn to your discussion, this break may help provide a different perspective of the problem, and/or give you more patience. a Call your EAP (800-277-9048) for re- sources and help with repairing the stress cracks.

As this occurs, and stress accumulates, you will find your regular coping mechanisms become less effective, and you may start to break down. Think of a well-traveled bridge - the continual flow of cars and trucks puts an incredible amount of stress on the entire structure. Without proper maintenance, the small cracks and fissures that normally form will grow, leading to collapse of all or part of the structure. The human body is no different - all life activities, Le., breathing, eating, standing, sitting,, etc., cause stress on our bodies. Rest and good nutrition are examples of how the body \"maintains and repairs\" itself. Unre- ~ solved anger, and communication break- down lead to high levels of stress that rest and good nutrition cannot repair. Much of the stress inherent in correc- tional work is not going to change, Le., shift work, mandated overtime, the possibility of inmate disturbances and/ or attacks. Other stressors that come from departmental administration, supervision, and/or your co-workers are possible to change, however, any sys- tem-wide, cultural change takes time. What was emphasized in the FOCUS training is to look at that which you can control and take charge! This doesn't mean that things like overtime, adminis- trative and/or supervisor attitudes aren't important - however, unless you have your reactions and responses under control, it is unlikely that you will impact the larger system. START SMALL! Our last brochure discussed some of the problems that arise from a failure to listen and communicate clearly and directly, and included a tip around communication methods. Time Out If you find yourself continuing to have communication prob- lems with specific individuals, and you find your anger level rising, try taking \"TIME OUT.\" The Situation You are locked in \"going no where\" argument/conversation with a colleague, and you feel yourself getting hot under the collar. You have three options: continue and end up in a full blown argument (no resolution), walk away, angry (no resolution), or make a statement: \"We're getting no where right now and I'm getting angry and I This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Recently, you should have received a brochure that provided an overview of the Families, Officers, and Corrections Understanding Stress (FOCUS) Project. In that brochure, we indicated that the goal of the project was to reduce Correction Officer and family stress through education and training. The FOCUS project is the collaborative effort of AFSCME Council 4 and the Connecticut Department of Correction, in conjunction with ETP Inc. and S & R Associates. -_ The following survey was also developed through that collaboration and will be used to measure the ects of the educational information and training provided to date. In order to insure that the results of this survey accurately represent the perceptions of the Correction Officers, we want to urge you to answer each question as honestly as possible. To insure your confidentiality, the completed survey will only be handled by the AFSCME liaison and returned directly to S & R Associates for analysis. The Connecticut Department of Correction, AFSCME Locals 387, 391, & 1565, ETP Inc., and S & R Associates hope with your help, that we can begin to effect a significant change in the lives of all Correction Officers and their families. We want to thank you for your time and effort in providing us with your responses. John J.

The following exercises illustrate this. ACTIVITY Ask participants \"What types of things can influence communication?' Instructor will lead a discussion soliciting input from participants. List responses on newsprint. Instructor will conduct the following exercises: EXERCISE 1 Ask for six volunteers. Give each volunteer a copy of \"The Sentence.\" Each volunteer will read the sentence putting emphasis or infection on a different word. Start with the instructor - \"Ididn't say she stole the money\" ISt volunteer \"I didn 't say she stole the money.\" 2nd volunteer \"I didn't say she stole the money.\" volunteer she money.\" 6' volunteer \"I didn't say she stole the money. \" Process with the group what the differences were like.

People tend to fill in or embellish when they are not sure of details. People do not want to appear to have missed information. People tend to make assumptions to \"connect the dots.\" To ASSUME is to make an ASS of U and ME.

Often when people talk to each other, they don't listen attentively. They are often distracted, half listening, or half thinking about something else. When people are engaged in a conflict, they are often busy formulating a response to what is being said. They assume that they have heard what their opponent is saying many times before, so rather than paying attention, they focus on how they can respond to win the argument. Active listening is a structured forrn of listening and responding that focuses the attention on the speaker. The listener must take care to attend to the speaker fully, and then repeat, in the listener's own words, what he or she thinks the speaker said. The listener does not have to agree with the speaker. S/He must simply state what they think the speaker said. This enables the speaker to find out whether the listener really understood. If the listener did not, the speaker can explain some more. Often, the listener is encouraged to interpret the speaker's words in terms of feelings. Thus, instead of just repeating what happened, the active listener might add, \"I gather that you felt angry or frustrated or confused when\". . .[a particular event happened]. Then the speaker can go beyond confirming that the listener understood what happened, and can indicate that he or she also understood the speaker's psychological response to it.

First, it forces people to listen attentively to others. Second, it avoids misunderstandings, as people have to confirm that they do really understand what another person has said. Third, it tends to open people up, to get them to say more. P When people are in conflict, they often contradict each other, denying the opponent's description of a situation. This tends to make people defensive, and they will either lash out, or withdraw and say nothing more. However, if they feel that their opponent is really attuned to their concerns and wants to listen, they are likely to explain in detail what they feel and why. If both parties to a conflict do this, the chances of being able to develop a solution to their mutual problem becomes much greater. It is important that you listen to the views and opinions of inmates and/or your colleagues and that they feel you are really hearing what they are saying. For this to be achieved you will need to know how to listen actively so here are some useful tips. TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE AND ACTIVE LISTENING 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Stop speaking yourself - you cannot listen and speak Put the speaker at ease - make the speaker feel that shehe is free to speaker - give them the opportunity to speak. Demonstrate to the speaker that you want to listen. Listening is an active not passive activity. Look and act interested. Lean forward slightly, face the speaker squarely, keep your arms and legs uncrossed and keep an appropriate distance. Remove distractions; do not doodle, tap your pen or shuffle papers. Empathize with the speaker. Try to put yourself in the speaker's place so that you can see her/his point of view. Be patient - allow time - do not interrupt. Hold your temper. Avoid argument and criticism - this tends to put the speaker on the defensive. Do not argue - even if you 'win', you 'lose'.

Ask questions to encourage the speaker and demonstrate that you are listening. Reflect and summarize from time to time. Use non-verbal behavior - e.g. nod head, eye contact, gaze. Use verbal behavior - e.g. \"Aha,\" \"I see,\" \"Go on tell me.'' Reflective listening is a way of checking, rather than assuming that you know what is meant. Reflective listening involves offering a response that reflects what the other person has stated. The subject pronoun is usually \"you.\" As an example, ask a volunteer to read the following script with the instructor as an active example of reflective listening. Listen to the statement, consider what it might mean, repeat back to person making statement. Example : CO = Correction Officer SP = Spouse SO = Significant Other you don't want to go to the party. I've been looking forward to it all week. I didn't realize you were so excited about it. I didn't know you wanted to go so badly. It seems that lately you've been backing out of everything. You don't want to do anything. You think I don't want to do things, that I'm avoiding things? Yes, and I'm beginning to think you just don't want to be with me anymore. You feel like I don't want to be with you, to go out with you? What else should I think? It makes me mad that we don't do things together anymore. You're angry because you think I don't want to be with you? Notes @ Page 3 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

I don't know what you want anymore. Are you afraid I don't want to be with you? Sort of. You seem so wrapped up in the department, and all the overtime you've been doing. You're upset with all the time I spend at work? What about the money I'm making? I know the money's nice, but what's the price we're paying? We spend almost no time together, we're like ships in the night. I didn't realize you felt this way. Actually, I thought you kind of liked having extra time for yourself. co: In this exchange the CO continues to repeat information back and in turn elicits more information. Other Matters That Can Effect Listening While Communicating Communication is not a benign activity, it is a living extension of the parties involved. Because each of us has adapted and adopted filters and screens during our lives, it is necessary we develop awareness of what elements have impact on our communications. PERSONAL BIASES Each of us has bias. It is part of our composition. Some are more apparent than others and some can be considered more harmful than others. What are personal biases that may impact professional judgment? VERBAL LANGUAGE Reflecting on the exercises used earlier, know what is appropriate Language is a fluid matter and does not always mean the same thing for each of us. m-c! ~cept&le to SEI^ to YOU SPOUS~SO, itrl in~~~te OT cn-worker.

GENDER DIFFERENCE Gender issues continue to be shown as having significant impact on others. Women's treatment in the workplace and at home is the most obvious reference in this domain. Issues of sexual orientation are also applicable. Awareness of cross-gender relationships between male and female CO's is important to look at. Typically, women in the correctional system are in the minority. The correctional system is a male dominated, paramilitary structure. The role of women has been evolving, and there are women in all levels of the organization. However, many women feel they have to \"be like a man\" to fit in, or that male co-workers don't feel comfortable with them in certain situations. Issues of sexual harassment become complicated. Women often don't want to make waves, don't want to seem like they can't take it, and so they put up with uncomfortable situations, increasing their personal stress. CULTURAL CONSIDERATION Woven through the fabric of all the skills in the communications process, this element can help develop a trust building relationship in a subtle way. Knowledge and understanding of another's ethnic culture should be paramount in the CO's awareness of the inmate or co-worker. BODY LANGUAGE Awareness of how you present yourself to the inmate physically is important. Unspoken cues are critical to be picked up by the CO and CO should monitor any unspoken cues. What are some unspoken cues you may telegraph? i.e. power, authority, rigidity, threatening The exercise using visual perception allows us to see how we are effected by predisposition. Do you leave these traits at work when you leave? Is this Notes: (gender issues) Elicit discussion around male/female co-worker issues and communication.

The ways we filter information impact what we say to people about our experience. One area of concern that was raised n the focus groups was communication with supervisors. What kinds of filters, barriers get in the way when you're talking with or disagreeing with, your lieutenant? Remember, we are looking at your filters and preconceived ideas, as well as, what we imagine they have about us. I EXERCISE Show slide 6. Distribute handout of same. Leave on screen and ask participants Who are these two men? At first glance it appears to be President Bill Clinton and Vice-president A1 Gore, look again! Is it really Clinton and Clinton. Examine the faces on both men - they are absolutely identical, only the hairline and clothing is different. So What's Going On? In this particular image you were most likely fooled. When your visual system looks at an image it is not so much concerned with specific details as determining the overall meaning of the image. In this particular, you are most likely used to such a pose with the Vice-president in the rear. Al's familiar suit and hairline also contributed to the effect.

Because differing ideas are put together, individuals experience anxiety and stress. Quite often the parties involved choose one of two reactions to facing the conflict: 1. Placate the other party and avoid the conflict, therefore failing to take a risk and engage in compromise. 2. Engage the other party, experience the discomfort as a threat and maneuver to \"win\" by dominating. Some ingredients in either situation will take place because of what conflict is: Tension or stress experienced by an organism when satisfaction of a need, drive, or motive is thwarted by the presence of other attractive or unattractive needs, drives, and motives. Stedman's Medical Dictionary, 1990, p. 341 Dealing with Conflict What do you think makes an inmate, a co-worker, a supervisor, or a family memberleiend \"difficult\" or seem \"difficult\"? What is really happening in these situations? Is there a different way of looking at it or not? We have addressed perspective in this course, is perspective important? A person may seem difficult for multiple reasons: They may present a bottleneck in the decision-making process. They may be so insecure (as individuals or in their job self- definition) that they feel compelled to act 'feisty' because they confuse aggression with assertiveness. They may genuinely feel disinclined to treat you proper1 y/politel y .

Could this perception within the system contribute to a level of tension with inmates that may cause conflict to be right at surface level? Does this bureaucratic manner impact the way the CO interacts with co-workers? What about outside the correctional setting and in the everyday life of the CO? What is the perception of family and friends relative to this notion of a bureaucrat? Do family and friends perceive the CO to be a bureaucrat? ACTMTY Break into groups of five.

Be careful with thinking that there are certain steps you must follow. ACTIVITY - Ask participants Are there any rules you presently follow while communicating with a person as conflict builds? 0 Anything one should do before, during, and after communications? > or instead of sequential steps, any questions to ask, patterns to follow etc.? Measuring how one would act or react in a build-up situation is easy when we think of work - consequences can be real and immediate. How about at home or with friends? Is it different in settings outside of work? Is there more room for error and a greater capacity to let things slip by? Lead a brief discussion to determine what the group members are presently using as a model for resolution. Following a brief discussion deliver the following information. ~ Eight Steps for Managing Conflict As this piece is presented the instructor should facilitate the presentation with emphasis flowing back and forth between the professional setting at work and the personal setting at home and with family andfiiends. Step 1 - Create an Effective Atmosphere Creating an effective atmosphere is a very important step in the conflict resolution process. It is more likely for mutual agreements Notes 8 m Page 3 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.Connecticut Department of Correction Course: Focus on You Module 3: Conflict Reduction instructor's Outline to be reached when atmosphere is given careful consideration. When thinking about atmosphere, remember these ideas: 0 Personal preparation - doing all you can to ready yourself in positive ways to approach issues honestly and openly. Timing - choosing a time that is best for all parties involved. A time in which no one is feeling pressed to move on or pressured in other ways. -. 0 Location - where you meet is as important as when you meet. It is best to pick a place where all parties can feel comfortable and at ease. 0 Opening statements - try to start out on a good note. Good openings are ones that let others know you are ready and willing to approach conflict with a team-like attitude that focuses on positive ends. They should also ensure the trust and confidentiality of the parties involved. Step 2 - Clarify Perceptions Clarify individual perceptions involved in the conflict. You can't solve a problem if you don't know what it is about. 1. Sort the parts of the conflict - ask what it is about. 2. Avoid ghost conflicts; get to the heart of the matter and avoid side issues. There are times when old issues or concerns do not get discussed or resolved, and they are \"held on to.\" 0 Can anyone offer a situation where someone may not resolve a situation and then use it at another time as a \"weapon\" in another argument or situation? Atwork? Athome? 3. Clarify what, if any, values are involved. 4. Recognize that the parties involved need each other to be most effective. Additionally, clarify you perceptions of the other party. 1. Avoid stereotyping. 2. Listen carefully. 3. Recognize the other's needs and values. Notes @ Page 4 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.Connecticut Department of Correction Course: Focus on You Module 3: Conflict Reduction Instructor's Outline 4. Empathize - ask why they feel the way they do. 5. Clear up misconceptions you may have of them. Step 3 - Focus on Individual and Shared Needs Expand on shared needs. Realize that you need one another in order to successhlly resolve conflicts. Be concerned about meeting others needs as well as your own. When you take the time to look, you will recognize that individuals often share needs in __ common. Step 4 - Build Shared Positive Power Power is made up of people's outlooks, ideas, convictions, and actions. A positive view of power enables people to be most effective. A negative outlook on power proves dis-empowering. Instead of ''power with,\" it encourages \"power over.\" Positive power promotes building together and strengthening partnerships. When parties in conflict have this outlook, they can encourage each other to use shared positive power. This gives an ultimate advantage to all involved because each person's positive energy is being drawn upon for a worthwhile solution. Step 5 - Look to the Future, then Learn from the Past Don't dwell on negative past conflicts, or you won't be able to deal positively in the present or the future. Try to understand what happened in the past, and avoid repeating the same mistakes over. Don't get stuck in a rut; learn from past conflicts and be forgiving. Let others know, \"I'm not mad at you, I'm mad at what you did.'' Step 6 - Generate Options 1. Beware of preconceived answers. 2. Look for common threads. 3. Make sure options are workable for all parties involved. 4. Set aside disagreements and focus on options that seem most workable. 5. Avoid spin-off conflicts by bypassing options that won't work for all involved. In Generating Options: 1. Ask first for the conflict partner's options -- listen and learn. @ Page 5 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Try free-flowing options: 0 Make new suggestions Writethemdown 0 Group similar options together Narrow down the list 0 Predict possible outcomes Imagine 3. Identify Key Options; these are ones that will: Meet one or more of the shared needs Meet individual needs and are compatible with other's needs Use mutual positive power Improve the relationship Be at least acceptable, but preferably satisfying, to all involved. 4. When looking at options, don't let past experiences cloud present perceptions and decisions. Wait to discuss them until they're all out on the table Look at all ideas, no matter how silly they may seem Step 7 - Develop \"Do-ables\" -- Stepping-stones to Action Do-ables are specific actions that have a good chance at being successful. Do-abies are: The ideas that have the best chance at success Steps that never promote unfair advantages on any sides Found on shared input and information from all parties Trust builders - they add confidence in working together Actions that meet shared needs Step 8 - Make Mutual Benefit Agreements Mutual-Benefit Agreements should give you lasting solutions to specific conflicts. Instead of demands, focus on developing agreements and find shared goals and needs. Build on \"Do-able\" things by working on the smaller stepping-stone solutions. Pay attention to the needs of the other person in addition to your own interests. 0 Notes m Page 6 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Clarify exactly what is expected of you in the agreement - your individual responsibilities. Keep the conflict partnership process going by using and sharing these skills with others. This model is presented in an idealistic context. Once assured that the participants understand the process conduct the following small group exercise. CASE STUDY Instructor will provide four case studies. Break into triads Each scenario should be between two people. Two involved in conflict, one observer. Round-robin-style, allowing everyone to participate. Observer will provide feedback to person trying to de- escalate situation. Process and provide feedback in large group. It serves as a practical, effective model for conflict management in a somewhat controlled and predictable environment. Practicing this model is the best way to learn shorthand methods to use in more volatile situations. It is important to note that it is best to practice the model as recommended. If it feels awkward and cumbersome at first, just be aware that you are working with something new. Remember how many things you do in your everyday routine that at one time may have seemed awkward. Do not pick a couple of pieces and forget the rest. The entire process is necessary for maximum impact.

Stress is another fact of life that can be, and is, both good and bad. We are being told almost on a daily basis, how bad stress is for us. It is true that excessive stress is bad for us, but we all need stress in our lives in order to function. If we experienced a complete absence of stress we would not put in the extra effort needed to attain our own personal goals, whatever they may be. In fact we would probably not get out of bed in the morning. We experience many different types and levels of stress in our lives. There is \"good' stress, the type of stress we may experience if we were fortunate enough to win the lottery for example, and \"bad\" stress, the type of stress we may experience when we lose something or someone important to us, our jobs on which we rely for our income, or someone we love and care for. If we tried to eliminate stress from our lives we may not be able to function effectively because we would lose the driving force in our lives. It is not possible or advisable to attempt to eliminate all stress, but it is sensible to attempt to control or master the stress we experience. If we constantly experience levels of stress which are too high for us to cope with, then both physical and mental symptoms will become apparent. What is Stress Stress is the body's reaction to various abnormal states that tend to disturb its noma1 physiologic equilibrium. (Stedman's Medical Dictionary, 1990) Stress is when you are worried about losing your job, wokied about having enough money to pay your bills, or worried about your mother when the doctor says she may need an operation. Or stress is the worry you feel right before a cell extraction or when there's a feeling that something is gonna go down. In fact, to most of us, stress is synonymous with worry. If it is something that makes you worry, then it is stress. Notes Page 1 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Instructor can record on newsprint if it will add impact. Your body, however, has a much broader definition of stress. To your body, stress is synonymous with change. Anythmg that causes a change in your life causes stress. It doesn't matter if it is a \"good\" change, or a \"bad'l change, they are both stress. When you find your dream apartment and get ready to move, that is stress. If you break your leg, that is stress. Good or bad, if it is a change in your life, it is stress as far as your body is concerned. -.__ Even imagined change is stress. Imagining changes are what we call \"worrying.\" If you fear that you will not have enough money to pay your rent, that is stress. If you worry that you may get fired, that is stress. If you think a new co-worker is upset about being partnered with you and you don't know why, that is stress. If you think that you may receive a promotion at work, that is also stress (even though this would be a good change). Whether the event is good or bad, imagining changes in your life is stressful. Four Main Causes of Stress Time Pressures. The days never seem long enough to get everything done. I plan the day as best I can to submit reports and my supervisor wants me to help out another CO. More inmates, more work, less co-workers. Inadequate Feedback on Performance. We continually worry about how we are doing. At work? Does my supervisor understand that I am doing as well as I can? Do my co-workers like me? Am I a target for retribution? At home? Is my spouse/significant other happy with me? Am I attentive enough? Do my parents think I'm successful? Unrealistic Expectations. Facilities are crowded, workload is full and CO is expected to take on more. More mentally ill inmates, short staffing, no room for error on the job. At home I'm expected to be ready to go to dinner, take the kids to the park for a ball game, pick up groceries, cook dinner, clean the yard, paint the house, be on time.. .

Without a specific direction at work we often waste valuable energy, and sometimes find ourselves at a dead- end. Things are getting so cumbersome. New political personnel means changes, but who knows what for sure. Communications are getting less specific and I am feeling unsure of the fbture, what my job will look like. Ambiguity leads to negative thinking. What does your career path look like? What are short-term goals? What are long-term goals? -_ Which of these is stress? You receive a promotion at work. Your car has a flat tire and you're late for work. You go to a party that lasts till 2:OO a.m. Your significant other/child gets sick. You find your dream home and begin the mortgage process. Your best friend and his wife come to stay at your house for a week. You get a bad case of hay fever. Answer is - All of the above. If you are used to thinking that stress is something that makes you wony, you have the wrong idea of stress. Stress is many different kinds of things: happy things, sad things, allergic things, and physical things. Many people carry enormous stress loads and they do not even realize it!

It is an eflort to make participants aware of the resources they use in a situation and to get them to re-allocate their resources in order to better manage and possibly reduce stress. Tell participants they are going to be able to budget their energy against their problems. To start, they are to create a list of what they consider to be their major and minor problems that they encounter each day. When the participants have completed their lists distribute a dollars worth of change to each participant. Tell the participants the dollars worth of change represents 100% of their energy for the day to devote to problems. Tell the participants they are to allocate an amount of money to the problems they have identified. The amount should be proportional to the amount of time/energy they devote to each particular problem during the day. When they have completed the allocation have them record the amount on the paper. Next, have them allocate the change in what they think would be a more logical investment of their time and energy to each problem. Have them record the new amounts. Options: Discuss the following points: Discuss in large or small groups. > How much did the two amounts differ? P Was anyone not surprised at the difference?

Managing activities that help in stress management are simple activities of everyday life that alter one's focus at any given time. Thousands of pages have been witten about \"lightness of being.'' - Developing lightness will allow a person to \"let go\" of the responsibility of any situation. Holding on to resentment for example, takes a lot of energy and focus. Being able to accept an event as a part of life and something one cannot change by resenting another person facilitates the process of letting go. Many people develop a spiritual element to their life. Whether it is found in a church, in a walk at the seashore, or by participating in a support group for people with similar experiences, finding something outside of us to channel negative feelings towards is a helpful part in dealing with stress. A simple exercise that can take you out of a negative place is a candle meditation. 0 Simply light a candle in a stand, place it on the table, and stare at the flame. Whenever you find yourself thinking of anything other than the flame, acknowledge that as interesting how your thoughts travel, and re-focus on the flame. Continue this meditation for about 20-30 minutes. It almost always helps reduce stress. m Page 6 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Set aside some time for laughter, your body's natural stress-release mechanism. Rent your favorite comedy. Tape a TV show that you know makes you laugh, keep it on hand for stress emergencies. Go to the library and borrow a book by an author who can make you laugh. Read the daily comics in the newspaper. Or, phone the funniest person you know! One of the best ways to fight stress is to get pleasure out of life. So find time for the things that are really important to you. ACTIVITY Ask participants to recommend a book or videotape that they would recommend helping at a time when stress may be an issue. Record on newsprint and post for Participants to refer to and copy information. Many of us get so caught up in our work and our routine duties that we end up feeling isolated, depressed, or trapped. We forget the big picture. We all need to take time out to experience the good things in life, the things that give us genuine pleasure. Here are some suggestions: HOBBIES - Whether you enjoy photography, crafts, sports, or any other hobby - DO IT! Bui.ld time into your schedule to enjoy these activities on a regular basis. Consider it \"nourishment for the soul.\" VACATIONS - Taking a break, for a weekend or a month, can be refreshing, but be careful. Vacations can be stressful if they are poorly planned, too expensive for your budget, or if you are under constant pressure to make decisions about where to travel, eat and stay. Plan ahead and don't try to pack too much into the time available. Notes leTpi Page 7 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Balancing intake of carbohydrate, fats, and proteins allows the body to function without overtaxing any one element. SPENDING TIME WITH THE FAMILY/\"RIEM)S - Companionship allows a person to defocus and relax. Interpersonal contact offers the opportunity for touch, which is a great method for reducing stress. Human touch is a method for healing the feeling of isolation that often accompanies stress build ~ -. UP. EXERCISING REGULARLY - Aerobic activities such as walking, jogging, swimming, biking, etc. for 20 minutes 3 times per week is minimum. Recommend is 30 minutes or more, 4-6 times per week. But do not hurt yourself! Walking is a great opportunity to both get exercise and spend time with a friend spouse, or significant other. REDUCING CAFFEINE, NICOTINE AND ALCOHOL ITAKE - Do not cope with stress by using alcohol or drugs. Avoiddecrease your intake of caffeine. If you are stressed out, caffeine is like throwing gasoline on a fire to put it out! These suggestions help when we are out of the workplace. Although there is a residual benefit to this type of self-care we need to construct a couple of activities that can be used in the workplace. ACTIVITY Have the participants pair up. Present the following three options for stress reduction. Have participants alternate and practice these stress-reducing exercises Notes m Page 8 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Deep breathing provides extra oxygen to the blood and causes the body to release endorphins, which are naturally occurring hormones that re- energize and promote relaxation. 1. Slowly inhale through your nose, expanding your abdomen before allowing air to fill your lungs. 2. Reverse the process as you exhale. Do this exercise for three to five minutes whenever you feel tense. STRETCHING EXERCISES If done correctly, stretching can promote relaxation and reduce stress. Never bounce when you stretch - you could injure your muscles. Do these exercises for five or ten minutes. Stretch I: Decide what muscles to stretch. 1. As you stretch, think about one area being stretched; imagine the tension leaving as you gently take these areas to their comfortable limit. 2. Exhale into the stretch; inhale on the release. Breathe deeply and slowly. Do not hold your breath. 3. Close your eyes for better awareness of your body's responses. Stretch 2: Here's a stretch to relieve stirmuscles. 1. Sit up straight and inhale. 2. Exhale as you let your head move down to your chest. You'll feel a gentle stretch on the back of your neck and your shoulders. 3. Roll your right ear toward your right shoulder while inhaling. Drop your chin to your chest again while exhaling. Repeat to the left. 4. Drop your arms to your sides and push both shoulders forward. Slowly raise them towards your ears and circle them back and downward to the starting point. After two or three rotations, change directions. 13 @ Page 9 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

Introduce next module Our association with stress is most commonly the negative experience that comes with an unhealthy build up of stress. Signs of negative stress include: Decreased ability to perform tasks An inability to relax after stressll event 0 Feeling out of control Feeling immobilized Following the recommendations for better nutritional habits, time with family and friends, exercise and so on will help YOU take charge of the stress factor. Simply making the decision that YOU can reduce and manage stress will empower you and reduce the feeling of helplessness that accompanies increased levels of stress. High levels of stress are accompanied by increased fiction. Friction is most noticeable in our interactions with others and is a factor in conflict. Conflict is a real and regular element in interpersonal relationships and a necessary ingredient in building relationships, Stress will impact how we deal with conflict and the level of the conflict will impact how much stress we have in our life!

Have participants think of an area of concern or type of situation that constantly provides conflict or stress. Ask for a volunteer to go first. Hand that person several pre-cut pieces of red paper and ask the person to state, in general terms, the type of situation that is of concern. Have people whom identifl with a similar concern raise their hands. The initial volunteer will then pass pieces of paper to those who raised their hands. A maximum of three to four people should be included in the group. The instructor will then give a different color of paper to the person on the left of the last person in the first group. That person will state a situation or concern and repeat the process. The participants holding the same colors of paper wilI then get together in a small group and exchange contact information. If there comes a point where there are people left that have not identified with a particular issue, they should join in a group that includes a member or members that they have felt comfortable with.

Look and act interested. Lean forward slightly, face the speaker squarely, keep your arms and legs uncrossed and keep an appropriate distance. 9 Remove distractions: do not doodle, tap your pen or shuffle papers. > Empathize with the speaker. P Try to put yourself in the speaker's place so that you can see their point of view. 3 Be patient - allow time - do not interrupt. 3 Hold your temper. Avoid argument and criticism - this tends to put the speaker on the defensive. 3 Do not argue - even if you 'win', you 'lose'. 3 Ask questions to encourage the speaker and to demonstrate that you are listening. 3 Reflect and summarize from time to time. 3 Use non-verbal behavior - e.g. nod head, eye contact, gaze. 3 Use verbal behavior - e.g. \"Aha,\" \"I see,\" \"Go on tell me.\" This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Reverse the scores for the 12 questions that give high scores for unrecommended responses. Dudley Weeks says some responses to conflict lead to resolutions which build a relationship, and some do not. All 40 questions need to be on the same scale, giving a high number for desirable or effective responses and a low score for ineffective ones. But 12 of the questions are worded so that ineffective answers get a ''5'' instead of a \"I\". For example, question #1 reads \"I feel that conflict is a negative experience.\" Weeks would say that someone who answers \"Almost always'', a \"5\", Will probably have difficulty ' ' approaching a conflict and that this will reduce the person's effectiveness. Therefore that response deserves a low score, and the \"5\" needs to be reversed to a \"1\". Doing this for the 12 questions will assure that all scores will be consistent, with higher scores going to If better\" 2. 3. 4. responses. Please reverse the scores for the following questions: 1,3,13,18,22,24,26,27,31,32,33, and 35. Reverse those questions by looking at the response given in the left hand column and writing in a reversed score in the right hand column as follows: Sbecomesl 4becomes2 3rernains 3 2becomes4 IbecomesS Answer: Score: For the questions that do not need to be reversed. For the questions that do not need to be reversed, write the same number given in the left-hand answer column in the right-hand score column. Compute sub-totals and the total. The 40 questions are in groups of 4, based on topics in Week's book. Add the scores for each group of 4 and put the result in the blank. (The letter is just an abbreviation for the topic of that group .) Then add the sub-totals and enter the result in the \"Total\" blank. Interpret the results, and learn from them. The higher your scores, the more effective you are likely to be at fmding resolutions that meet everyone's real needs and that build your long-term relationship. Of the 10 sub-totals, which were the highest? These are probably areas where you are effective, Which sub-totals were the lowest? These are probably areas where you might try a different approach. Use the sheet ''Leaminu from the Survey\" to understand where you might improve.

Low scores may indicate areas where you codd increase your effectiveness. For each question on the survey, some advice is given below. The advice was compiled by the Conflict Resolution class and is based primarily on Dudley Weeks' The Eight Essential SteRs to Conflict Resolzition, but also includes ideas from other sources, including Geflina to Yes by Roger Fisher and WilIiam Ury. The guidelines are given in groups of four, corresponding to the ten lettered groups in the survey, which are in turn based on the topics or steps in Weeks. For the questions or sectioizs on which you got the lowest scores, read flze guidelines and consider iying fk em. They may help you be more effective. - .- V. 1. 2. 3. 4. A. 5. 6. - 7. 3. VIEW CONPLICT AS NATURAL AND POSITTVE. View conflict as a natural outgrowth of diversity among people, which can be addressed in a win-win way that strengthens your relationships. Remember the vdue of building yo9 long-term relationship. View the resolution of the conflict and the building of the relationship as inter-related parts. Prevention works best. View conflicts as opportunities for growth - for you and the other person, and for your relationship. Handle the differences in a way that strengthens your relationship - together you will find more satisfying resolutions for this and future conflicts. Address differences directly, realizing you are more likely to meet both your concerns and the other's if you discuss issues openly. Separate the people from the problem, so you can protect the relationship while addressing the problem. ATMOSPEIERE. Start by establishing an effective atmosphere that promotes partnership and problem-solving. Meet with the other at a mutually satisfactory time, when you both have plenty of time and are free from disbactions. Meet in an equally acceptable place that is tranquil and gives you equal power. Help the other feel comfortable and safe, affirming the importance of the rdationship. Start by saying you know the two of you can invent some solutions together that are mutually acceptable. C. CLARDFY PERCEPTIONS. Work with the other so both are very clear about what the conflict is really zbout. Eliminate ghost issues that arise from misperceptions. Separate the people from the problem. Acknowledge emotions as legitamate. Then face the problem together. Be clear with yourself and with the other how you feel and how you perceive the problem Use \"I - Statements\" to tell the other how you feel, rather than \"You - Statements\" that blame. Assert you needs without attacking the other. 10. Ask questions to clarify your perception of the other's perceptions. Listen actively. Acknowledge what the other says. 11. Look at yourselfhonestly, clarifying needs and rnisperceptions. 12. Clear up misperceptions and stereotypes. Avoid pushing \"buttons.\" 9.

Keep reaching for the other's positive power and potential for constructive action.

Avoid negative \"power over,\" which wastes energy in seesaw battle, and which may bacldre, not achieving your lasting goals. Treat others as you want to be treated. Don't stereotype the other only by their negative power; keep options open for the other's constivctive power. Don't ask who is more powerful; be optimistic about outcomes.

Open up OPTIONS for Mutual Gain. Listen with an open mind to alternative options. Ask for the other's options first; learn from them. Prepare \u20acor discussions by inventing several specific new options that meet shared needs. Don't view these as final goals, but as starting points. Together, brainstom new possibilities.

II lness Catching a cold, breaking an m, a skin infection, a sore back, are all CHANGES in your body condition. Pushing Your Body Too Hard A major source of stress is overdriving yourself. If you are working (or partying) 16 hours a day, you will have reduced your available time for rest. Sooner or later, the energy drain on your system will cause the body to fall behind in its repair work. There will not be enough time or energy for the body to fix broken cells, or replace used up brain neurotransmitters. Changes will occur in your body's internal environment. You will \"hit the wall,\" or \"run out of gas.\" If you continue, permanent damage may be done. The body's fight to stay healthy in the face of the increased energy that your are expending is major stress. Environmental Factors Very hot or very cold climates can be stressful. Very high altitude may be a stress. Toxins or poisons are a stress. Each of these factors threatens to cause CHANGES in your body's internal environment. Tobacco Use Tobacco is a powerful toxin! Smoking destroys cells that clean your trachea, bronchi, and lungs. Smoking causes emphysema and chronic bronchitis, which progress to slow suffocation. The carbon monoxide from cigarette smoking causes chronic carbon monoxide poisoning. Tobacco use damages the arteries in your body, causing insufficient blood supply to the brain, heart, and vital organs. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of cancer 50 fold. Chewing tobacco or snuff is no safe haven. It also damages your arteries, and it carries the same cancer risk. (Cancers of the head and neck are particularly vicious, disfiguring, and deadly). Poisoning the body with carbon monoxide, and causing the physical illnesses of emphysema, chronic bronchitis, cancer, and arterial damage, tobacco is a powerful source of added stress to one's life. 1 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Look and act interested. Lean forward slightly, face the speaker squarely, keep your arms and legs uncrossed and keep an appropriate distance. > Remove distractions: do not doodle, tap your pen or shuffle papers. k Empathize with the speaker. k Try to put yourself in the speaker's place so that you can see their point of view 9 Be patient - allow time - do not interrupt. > Hold your temper. Avoid argument and criticism - this tends to put the speaker on the defensive. 9 Do not argue - even if you 'win', you 'lose'. > Ask questions to encourage the speaker and to demonstrate that you are listening. > Reflect and summarize from time to time. P Use non-verbal behavior - e.g. nod head, eye contact, gaze. > Use verbal behavior - e.g. \"Aha,\" \"I see,'' \"Go on tell me.''

Reverse the scores for the 12 questions that give high scores for unreco rnmended responses. Dudley Weeks says some responses to conflict lead to resolutions which buiId a relationship, and some do not. AI1 40 questions need to be on the same scale, giving a high number for desirable or effective responses and a low score for ineffective ones. But 12 of the questions are worded so that ineffective answers get a \"5\" instead of a \"I\". For example, question #1 reads \"I feel that conflict is a negative experience.\" Weeks would say that someone who answers \"Almost always\", a \"5\", will probably have difficulty approaching a conflict and that this will reduce the person's effectiveness. Therefore that response deserves a low score, and the \"5\" needs to be reversed to a \"1\". Doing this for the 12 questions will assure that all scores will be consistent, with higher scores going to \"better\" responses. Please reverse the scores for the following questions: 1,3,13, 18,22,24,26,27, 31,32,33, and 35. Reverse those questions by looking at the response given in the left hand column and writing in a reversed score in the right hand column as follows: Sbecomesl 4becomes2 3remains 3 2becomes4 IbecomesS Answer: Score: 2. For the questions that do not need to be reversed, For the questions that do not need to be reversed, write the same number given in the left-hand answer column in the right-hand score column. 3. Compute sub-totals and the total. The 40 questions are in groups of 4, based on topics in Week's book. Add the scores for each group of 4 and put the result in the blank. (The letter is just an abbreviation for the topic of that group .) Then add the sub-totals and enter the result in the \"Total\" blank. Interpret the results, and learn from them. The higher your scores, the more effective you are likely to be at frnding resolutions that meet everyone's real needs and that build your long-term relationship. Of the 10 sub-totals, which were the highest? These are probably areas where you are effective. Which sub-totals were the lowest? These are probably areas where you might try a different approach. Use the sheet \"Leaminu fiom the SurveYl' to understand where you might improve. Pick 2 or 3 of the questions with the lowest scores, and try out behaviors which might make you more effective at resolving conflicts productively.

If you are working (or partying) 16 hours a day, you will have reduced your available time for rest. Sooner or later, the energy drain on your system will cause the body to fall behind in its repair work. There will not be enough time or energy for the body to fix broken cells, or replace used up brain neurotransmitters. Changes will occur in your body's internal environment. You will \"hit the wall,\" or \"run out of gas.\" If you continue, permanent damage may be done. The body's fight to stay healthy in the face of the increased energy that your are expending is major stress, + Environmental Factors Very hot or very cold climates can be stressful. Very high altitude may be a stress. Toxins or poisons are a stress. Each of these factors threatens to cause CHANGES in your body's internal environment. + TobaccoUse Tobacco is a powerful toxin! Smoking destroys cells that clean your trachea, bronchi, and lungs. Smoking causes emphysema and chronic bronchitis, which progress to slow suffocation. The carbon monoxide from cigarette smoking causes chronic carbon monoxide poisoning. Tobacco use damages the arteries in your body, causing insufficient blood supply to the brain, heart, and vital organs. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of cancer 50 fold. Chewing tobacco or snuff is no safe haven. It also damages your arteries, and it carries the same cancer risk. (Cancers of the head and neck are particularly vicious, disfiguring, and deadly). Poisoning the body with carbon monoxide, and causing the physical illnesses of emphysema, chronic bronchitis, cancer, and arterial damage, tobacco is a powerful source of added stress to one's life. 1 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Changing seE-U kom negative to positive is an excellent way to manage that response and stress. Naming We all name our experiences. \"Crisis,\" \"bad as usual,\" 'a great challenge\" are names you might give to' things that happen. Pick a recent upsetting experience. Describe it in a few words. Is there a positive name you could give it? (learning experience, chance to change, etc.) List the names you gave to 5 recent experiences, good or bad. zf they happened to someone else, what other positive names could you give them? Letting Go You often must let go of dreams, people, or parts of your fife. Letting go aliows you to get on with your life when somethiig is over. Write down two things you need to let go of. Lmagine that each one is really going out of your lie. How do you feel? (sad, angry, relieved, etc) Who can you tell about your feeling? What advice would you give to someone who is in your situation? Belief And Faith Self-talk re5ect.s our belief in who we are or in the universe. A positive faith can help you during stressful times. Name 10 positive things you believe in about yourself, people, or the universe. If you can't think of 10 beliefs, ask other people for theirs. Describe a recent experience and how you used one of these beliefs to help you. Silent Support Weall have 2 constvlt stream of silent talk in our minds. This (sari be a ceat support, or a weight on our shoulders. Close you eyes. What is your silent tdk saying right now? Write tkee negative messages you often hear. Write their opposites as positive messages. OIW PWY mRu= This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

Is there a positive name you could give it? (learning experience, chance to change, etc.) List the names you gave to 5 recent experiences, good or bad. If they happened to someone else, what other positive names could you give them? Letting Go You often must let go of dreams, people, or parts of your life. Letting: go allows you to get on with your life when somethiig is over. Write down two things you need to let go of. Imagine that each one is really going out of your lie. How do you feel? (sad, angry, relieved, etc) Who can you tell about your feeling? What advice would you give to someone who is in your situation? Belief And Faith Self-talk reflects our belief in who we are or in the universe. A positive faih can help you during skessful times. Name 10 positive things you beIieve in about yourself, people, or the universe. Lf you can't think of 10 beliefs, ask other peopIe for theirs. Describe a recent experience and how you used one of these beliefs to help you. Silent Support Wed have a constat stream of silent talk in OUT minds.

We all have used all of these styles, but we may have one style that has become a reflexive response. E we adhere to the myth that there is only one righf way to handie conflict then we may overuse or inappropriately use a particular style. We all have the capacity to use each style effectively. We have learned our predominate style. We may use different styles for different roles. We can learn to appropriately use other conflict styles. Appropriate use of conflict styles is sltuatiunaily inatched and dependent on the importance of the relationship and the desired outcome. We may need to consider the consequences and responses to different conflict styles in order to determine when and when not to use a paicicular style. I DIRECTWE - COMPEmTVE 'MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY' Pursues personal needs and goals (win / lose) Effective Uses: When action is called for, when there is little time to consider other options, when safety is a concern; when you believe you most stand up for your rights.

Reverse the scores for the 12 questions that give high scores for unrecommended responses, Dudley Weeks says some responses to conflict lead to resolutions which build a relationship, and some do not. All 40 questions need to be on the same scale, giving a high number for desirable or effective responses and a low score for ineffective ones. But 12 of the questions are worded so that ineffective answers get a \"5\" instead of a 'rlfr, 2. 3. 4. For example, question #1 reads \"1 feel that conflict is a negative experience.\" Weeks would say that someone who answers \"Almost always\", a \"S', will probably have difficulty approaching a conflict and that this will reduce the person's effectiveness. Therefore that response deserves a low score, and the+\"5\" needs to be reversed to a l'llr. Doing this for the 12 questions will assure that all scores will be consistent, with higher scores going to \"better\" responses. Please reverse the scores for the following questions: 1,3,13,18,22,24,26,27,31,32,33, and 35. ' Reverse those questions by looking at the response given in the left hand column and writing in a reversed score in the right hand column as follows: Sbecomesl 4becomes2 3remains 3 2becomes4 lbecomes5 Answer: Score: For the questions that do not need to be reversed, For the questions that do not need to be reversed, write the same number given in the left-hand mswer colmn In the right-hand score column. Compute sub-totals and the total. The 40 questions are in groups of 4, based on topics in Week's book. Add the scores for each group of 4 and put the result in the blank. (The letter is just an abbreviation for the topic of that group .) Then add the sub-totals and enter the result in the \"Total\" blank, Interpret the results, and learn from them. The higher your scores, the more effective you are likely to be at finding resolutions that meet everyoEe's real needs and that build your long-term relationship. Of the 10 sub-totals, which were the highest? These are probably areas where you are effective. Which sub-totals were the iowest? These are probably zreas where you might try a different approach. Use the sheet \"Lezming from the Survey\" to understand where you might improve. Pick 2 or 3 of the questions with the lowest scores, and try out behaviors which might make you more effective at resolving conflicts productively. 0 Learning from the Survey * C oalict Res o lution Oues ti o nnaire Conflict Resolution - Main Page This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

VIEW CONFLICT AS NATURAL AND POSITIVE. View conflict as a natural outgrowth of diversity among people, which can be addressed in a win-win way that strengthens your relationships. Remember the value of building your long-term relationship. View the resolution of the conflict and the building of the relationship as inter-related parts. Prevention works best. View conflicts as opportunities for growth - for you and the other person, and for your relationship. Handle the differences in a way that strengthens your relationship - together you will find more satisfying resolutions for this and future conflicts. Address differences directly, realizing you are more likely to meet both your concerns and the other's if you discuss issues openly. Separate the people from the problem, so you can protect the relationship while addressing the problem. A, ATMOSPHERX Start by establishing an effective atmosphere that promotes partnership and problem-solving. Meet with the other at a mutually satisfactory be, when you both have plenty of time and are free from distractions. Help the other feel comfortable and safe, affirming the importance of the relationship. Start by saying you know the two of you can invent some solutions together that are mutually acceptable. 5. 6. .. Meet in an equally acceptable place that is tranquil and gives you equal power. 7. 8. C. CLARIFY PERCEPTIONS. Work with the other so both are very clear about what the conflict is really 2bout. Eliminate ghost issues that arise from misperceptions. Separate the people from the problem. Acknowledge emotions as legitamate. Then face the problem together. Be clear with yourself and with the other how you feel and how you perceive the problem Use \"I - Statements\" to tell the other how you feel, rather than \"You - Statements\" that blame. Assert your needs without attacking the other. Acknowledge what the other says. 9. 10. Ask questions to clarify your perception of the other's perceptions. Listen zctively. 11.

The following assumptions dour conflicts are based on Western perceptions of conflicts. However, many of the listed assumptions can be applicable to non- Western cultures or contexts. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. Conflict is not necessarily evil or a failure of an existing system. On the contrary, conflict often is a creative force that generates new options, alternatives, and solutions for existing problems. Conflict is a natural process that can have constructive or destructive outcomes. Conflict is an intrinsic part of all important relationships. Conflict is caused by many different kinds of specific events. People are not problems. Having clear and explicit expectations is a very crucial and essential pari of any resolution process, for reaching an agreement or understanding the issues involved.

Conflict can be managedsettled constructively through communication. However, not ail conflict can be resolved by improving communication. Not all conflicts lend themselves to joint or negotiated endings. But when mutually satisfactory outcomes can be found, they tend to be more self-enforcing, efficient, and durable. Joint processes can be creative. They can lead to new or improved relationships and help identify new criteria, resources, and outcomes. Joint processes can usually be structured to help everyone work together effectively. Although there are many types of conflicts and many types of processes to resolve them, Kat pple tend t~ zpprzach z conflict with s=me expectztim ifi mind, often based on previous experience. It is always imporiaiit, valuable, aiid useful to raise the question of whether ii particular and specific approach to resolving a conflict is the most effective and appropriate method. Conflict resolution skills include analyzing the conflict situation; bringing parties together; assisting parties to shift focus from win/Iose competition to joint problem solving; building cooperation and trust; and communication skills of observing, listening, and speaking. The basis of conflict resolution is problem solving, which attempts to move parties with genuine substantive differences toward a productive resolution.

Differences make life interesting. Lmagine if all people preferred the same food, dress, profession, etc. Difference in &elf is not a cause of conflict, but difference can be a source for conflict. Disagreement begins when people express their preferences and priorities in comparison with other people's preferences and priorities. Disagreement can be harmless and have no consequences, with no need to resolve the disagreement. Problem ?roblems occur when disagreements or differences cause some consequences for at least one party. Problems could be avoided, but they are disturbing, costly, or both. Peopie's daily lives aie a series of s~!vcd p:cb!~,ms. Unresolved problems are potential for escalation and crisis or resolution, Dispute Disputes occur when more than one party acknowledges the differences and the problem. In a dispute, at least one party expresses its desire to solve the problem. Confllct Resolution This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

LEVELS OF CONTROVERSY (con timed) Conflict In a conflict, all parties are willing to invest in the escalation of the dispute in order to \"win\" or not lose. In a conflict, all parties feel that their goals are incompatible. Violence At this stage, the parties act to damage, hurt, or exploit resources in order to \"win\" or not Iose the conflict. Violence is not onIy physical; it can be emotional or psychoIogica1. War Parties are so engaged in their violence that they use violence to damage the other side's source of power. In this stage, parties often forget or ignore their basic differences and the developments that led them to war.

I don't have to waste time worrying. The sky won't fall in. 1 am capable. * ABSOLUTISM: There is no reason why other people should be the way 1 want them to be. There is no one and only best way. Everybody has ideas that are worthwhile. * DENIAL: It is okay to be wrong and if your actions hurt someone else, I can help that person by accepting responsibility for 'my behavior and making restitution to those hurt. * FAIRNESS: Life is not always fair and I can accept that. * BLAME/PUNlSHMENT: It is better for me to focus on solving the probiem than casting blame or retaliating. * POWER AND CONTROL: There is no reason to get upset if 1 can't change things to fit my idea of how they ought to be. t can not control other people or change them. We all deserve that basic respect. I can accept people the way they are. Others are not responsible for your happiness. * PERFECTIONISM: Making mistakes is something we'all do, and there is RO reason to get upset when I make one or someone else makes one. I am trying, and if I make a mistake, I am going to mtinue trying.

I am the one who is in charge of my life. * MIND READING: I can't read a persons mind, so I can't be sure why (or if) someone is behaving a certain way unless I communicate with that person. * AVOIDANCE: Better to confront a problem when it is smaII, then to be confronted by it when it is large. \"OVER GENERALIZATION: It is not logical to believe that just because something happened once it will always happen. * UNIQUE: I am no better than the next person, and will try to live by the same rules or laws others are expected to live by. * IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION(P1G): Before I act I will think about the consequences.

All 40 questions need to be on the sane scale, giving a high number for desirable or effective responses and a low score for ineffective ones. But 12 of the questions are worded so that ineffective answers get a \"5\" instead of a rllrr, For example, question #1 reads \"I feel that conflict is a negative experience.\" Weeks would 2. 3. 4. - -- say that someone who answers \"Almost always\", a \"5\", $11 probably have difficulty approaching a conflict and that this will reduce the person's effectiveness, Therefore that response deserves a low score, and the-\"5\" needs to be reversed to a fll'l. Doing this for the 12 questions will assure that all scores will be consistent, with higher scores going to \"better\" responses. ' Please reverse the scores for the following questions: 1,3,13,18,22,24,26, 27,31,32,33, and 35. Reverse those questions by looking at the response given in the left hand column and writing in a reversed score in the right hand column as follows: Sbecomesl 4becomes2 3remains 3 2becomes4 lbecomes5 Answer: Score: For the questions that do not need to be reversed. For the questions that do not need to be reversed, write the same number given in the left-hand mswer col~r~lll in the right-hand score column. Compute sub-totals and the total. The 40 questions are in groups of 4, based on topics in Week's book. Add the scores for each group of 4 and put the result in the blank. (The letter is just an abbreviation for the topic of that group.) Then add the sub-totals and enter the result in the \"Total\" blank, Interpret the results, and learn from them, The higher your scores, the more effective you are likely to be at finding resolutions that meet everyoce's real needs and that build your long-term relationship. Of the 3.0 sub-totals, which weie the highest? These are probably areas where you are effective. Which sub-totals were the lowest? These are probably areas where you might try a different approach.

Address differences directly, reali&g you are mare likely to meet both your concerns and the other's if you discuss issues openly. Separate the people from the problem, so you can protect the relationship while addressing the problem. ATMOSPEEm. Start by establishing an effective atmosphere that promotes partnership and problem-solving. Meet with the other at a mutually satisfactory he, when you both have plenty of time and are free from distractions. Meet in an equally acceptable place that is tranquil and gives you equal power. Help the other feel comfortable and safe, affirming the importance of the relationship. Start by saying you know the two of you can invent some solutions together that are mutually acceptable. m- CLARl\u20aci'Y PERCEPTIONS. Work with the other so both are very clear about what the conflict is really about. Eliminate ghost issues that arise from misperceptions. Separate the people from the problem. Achowledge emotions as legitamate. Then face the problem together. Be clear with yourself and with the other how you feel and how you perceive the problem Use \"I - Statements\" to tell the other how you feel, rather than \"You - Statements\" that blame. Assert your needs without attacking the other. 10. Ask questions to claify your perception of the other's perceptions. Listen zctively. Acknowledge what the other says. 11.

However, many of rhe listed assumptions can be applicable to non-Western cultures or contexts. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. Conflict is not necessarily evil or a failure of an existing system. On the contrary, conflict often is a creative force that generates new options, alternatives, and solutions for existing problems. Conflict is a natural process that can have constructive or destructive outcomes. Conflict is an intrinsic part of all important relationships. Conflict is caused by many different kinds of specific events. People are not problems. Having clear and explicit expectations is a very crucial and essential part of any resolution process, for reaching an agreement or understanding the issues involved. Conflict can be positive when: a. b. c. d. e. It increases communication and trust We can solve the problem It results in development and growth It releases feelings that were stored It improves our work and performance. Conflict can be negative when it: a. b. c. d. Develops to war or violence Prevents and blocks personal and group development Prevents people from addressing the real issues Motivates people to become uncooperative. Conflicts can end in many ways. Often conflicts end with some kind of decision defining what will hamen in the future. These can be classified by studvinR: Conflict Resolution, This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

'I Avoidance, denial, flight Force, threats, influence Rights and standards Joint processes 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. Conflict can be managedlsettled constructively through communication. However, not all conff ict can be resolved by improving communication. Not all conflicts lend themselves to joint or negotiated endings. But when mutually satisfactory outcomes can be found, they tend to be more self-enforcing, efficient, and durable, Joint processes can be creative. They can lead to new or improved relationships and help identify new criteria, resources, and outcomes. Joint processes can usually be structured to help everyone work together effectively. Although there are many types of conflicts and many types of processes to resolve them, most people tend to approach a conflict with some expectation in mind, often based on previous experience. It is always irnporiaiit, valuable, aiid useful to raise the question of whether a particular and specific approach to resolving a conflict is the most effective and appropriate method. Conflict resolution skills include analyzing the conflict situation; bringing parties together; assisting parties to shift focus from widlose competition to joint problem solving; building cooperation and trust; and communication skills of observing, listening, and speaking. The basis of conflict resolution is problem solving, which attempts to move parties with genuine substantive differences toward a productive resolution.

Differences make life interesting. Imagine if all people preferred the same food, dress, profession, etc. Difference in itself is not a cause of conflict, but difference can be a source \u20acor conflict. Disagreement Disagreement begins when people express their preferences and priorities in comparison with other people's preferences and priorities. Disagreement can k harmless and have no consequences, with no need to resolve the disagreement. Problem Problems occur when disagreements or differences cause some consequences for at least one party. Problems could be avoided, but they are disturbing, costly, or both. People's daily lives are a series of solved problems. Unresolved problems are potential for escalation and crisis or resolution. Dispute Disputes occur when more than one party acknowledges the differences and the problem. In a dispute, at least one party expresses its desire to solve the problem. Conflict Resolution.

In a conflict, all parties are willing to invest in the escalation of the dispute in order to \"win\" or not lose. In a conflict, all parties feel that their goals are incompatible. Violence - -. At this stage, the parties act to damage, hurt, or exploit resources in order to \"win\" or not lose the conflict. Violence is not only physical; it can be emotional or psychological. War Parties are so engaged in their violence that they use violence to damage the other side's source of power. In this stage, parties often forget or ignore their basic differences and the developments that led them to war.

They can induce back problems, skin disorders, respiratory infections, and circulatory problems. Stress lowers resistance to illness and weakens the immune system.

This reduces oxygen to the brain and can result in feelings of anxiety, anger, panic and a general sense of loss of control. Yet, even in non-stressful moments most of us breathe inefficiently and unhealthily. We engage in shallow, upper chest breathing. Such inefficient breathing results in fatigue, diminished brain power, and weakened health. With a minimal amount of practice, you can significantly and permanently improve the way you breathe. .. '.

Sleepino In A Stress Free Way Researchers report that many of us are suffering from chronic sleep deprivation. We either don't get enough sleep, or we sleep poorly. The stress of even one sub-par night of sleep reduces mental and physical performance by as much as 30 percent. Poor sleep causes irritability, anger, job errors, slower healing and lowered immunity. The number of hours slept is not as important as the qzinlity of your sleep. 4 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

There are bvo basic views or ways of explaining stressors or bad events: pessimism and optimism. Pessimist blame themselves for negative stressors, believing the negative will last a long time and affect many aspects of their lives. Optimists tend not to blame consequences. Individuals with hishly pessimist views have increased susceptibility for depression, illness and premature death, while optimistic individuals appear to be more protected or stress proofed against these susceptibilities. There is two general ways to undo pessimistic beliefs once you are aware of them. The first is to distract yourself when they occur, and the second is to dispute themselves or if they do, see negative stressors as having only short term impact and limited them.

This is largely due to the increasing influence work has in hour lives today. We usually identify ourselves with what we do. We are likely to spend more hours in our work than any other activity, including sleep. Job strain is a term used to describe the particular stressors of a given job. The. most job strain occurs in jobs which have high demand and low control such as assembly workers, telephone operators and key punchers. The least job strain occurs in top executives and architects who have considerable controi over their jobs. 10 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

During the first hour or so of each cycle 'we experienced heightened physical and mental 'alertness and energy in which our skills, memory and learning abilities are heightened (\"peaks\"). For the next 15- 20 minutes our performance drops to low levels \"troughs\" during which we may yawn, become easily distracted and feel like napping. During this period the body and mind revitalize, if we allow it. Unfortunately, most of us override this signal setting the stage fro stress ranging from fatigue to psychosomatic problems. 11 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The fact that in corrections work things like riots, inmate on inmate attacks, inmate on officer attacks, suicides and exposure to diseases such as AIDS and Hepatitis is often part of the job doesn't make them less critical. In fact, a danger in this work is to believe you can just handle all of this - that to get help means you're weak. Certainly you do learn to deal with things the general public would find distressing, however, you are not immune from the impact of these events. There is also a higher than average death rate among correctional and other law enforcement personnel, and that also takes a toll. The longer you try to ignore your feelings, the bigger the pile gets! Read below to see if you see yourself. If you do, reach out, call your EAP, or another professional of your choice for assistance. SIGNALS THAT AN OFFICER IS STUCK AND NEEDS FURTl3ER HELP **The following is adapted from Roger Soloman, Ph.D.: 'Ym Stuck and Befter Do Sometlzing About It!\" 1. Intrusive Images. Distressing memories, thoughts, nightmares and flashbacks. Flashbacks can be both auditory, as well as visual. 2. Diskess at expoxire to e-vents that rese=lblle or symbolize the event. Officer avoids thoughts and emotions connected with the incident, or activities or situations that arouse memories of the trauma. This may sound like a good thing to do. After all, why talk about a highly distressing situation. While this attitude is understandable, if a person cannot talk about the situation without undue and uncomfortable emotions, then they have not properly processed the incident. Typically this patter of avoidance intensifies and spreads, as other symptoms appear and worsen. 3. Numbing or restricted range of emotional responsiveness. To defend against the painful emotions surrounding the incident, a person may shut off all emotions. This of course is not a practical solution! We need to experience emotions emotions, feelings and relationships. Life in general sours if we disconnect ourselves from our feelings. 4. Excessive stress reactions. The physical symptoms of stress are powerll. They result from the \"fight-flight response\" which is designed to prepare our bodies for danger. However, if get our bodies stuck in this overdrive mode, we can wear ourselves down physically and emotionally. At a certain point, by reliving the 1 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

In fact, we can develop a \"hair trigger\" to stress thus putting a tremendous bwden on our physical health. Hypewigilance. It is common and noma1 for police officers to be more alert to danger than the average citizen. However, after a criticd incident, the officer may find himself in high gear and unable to downshift. This constant state of hypervigilance can become intrusive, uncomfortable, and physically exhausting. Overreactiodunder-reaction/risk taking. Surviving a Critical Incident can put a dent in your spirit. This can result in some behavioral changes on the job as one tries to adjust to the situation. Officers may find themselves under-reacting with a \"who gives a shit\" attitude. The opposite may occur with the officer \"not letting anyone get something over on me\"! Finally, we see some officers start to take excessive risks. This behavior may serve the purpose of distracting them from painful thoughts of the incident. In addition it may afford them with an adrenaline high that can become addictive. Increased irritability, anger, or rage. This symptom can be very disruptive to an officer's life. It can push away his friends, destroy his family life, and gain him a reputation that hurts him on the job, Obsession with the Incident. It is both normal and healthy to talk about the incident for a time after it has occurred. However thoughts and images of the incident can take over! Images become easily triggered and one seems to be stuck in the past with difficulty looking toward the future. 10. 11 The incident triggers feelings associated with past events. An incident may cause thoughts/feelings/images of the past negative events to resurface. This can_ be true even though it was thought that the past incident was dealt and gone. What can really be problematic is that images of past incidents with apparently little relationship to the current incident can be triggered. For example, seeing a dead child in an auto accident can cause a childhood memory of a friend moving away to resurface. Self-doubt, guilt, second guessing oneself. An officer may become obsessed with hisker mistakes be they real or imagined. The \"what ifs\" start to take over. Feelings of inadequacy will then follow. Life no longer goes forward, but stays stuck in the past. A growing sense of isolation deveiops. The officer may have been involved in a uniquely bad situation. Even with support, however, he/she starts to think, 'Wo one understands what I'm experiencing\". To some extent, this may be true. However, there is a trap in this way of thinking. You may push your friends and family away and hlfill your own prophecy that you are alone. At that point the officer may feel lost, abandoned, and different than others. 2 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

A critical incident by its very nature can make us feel out of control of our lives. It puts us real close with the reality that the world is a dangerous place to live. Officers need to feel that they have control. It is fundamental to their ability to cope. A critical incident can take this coping device away fiom us. Depression and grief follow. This creates a cycle of intense emotion geared to allow us to feel in control but serving only to take us farther from it. Menta1 confusion. Increased distractibility, difficulty concentrating or making decisions, poor judgement. 14. Development of suspiciousness in dealing with others. Since the critical incident was probably unexpected and pdinful, we try to gear ourselves to not being hurt in the future. We start to distrust all that is around us. We hope that by assuming the worst, we will not be surprised and hurt. Unfortunately, when this defense runs arnok, it prevents us from seeing the good in people. It keeps us from making friends. It puts us on the path to cynicism. 15. Relationship problems. An officer may withdraw from his friends and family. He may in fact actively push them away. He may experience problems dealing with supervisors and peers were previously he had none. 16. Decline in work performance. Increased absenteeism, burn out, decline in productivity and quality of work. 17. One may have little or no noticezble initial reaction to the incident, but reactions occur months later. This can be a problem if the officer does not see the connection between the incident and hisker current emotional troubles.

If you are unable to avoid or alter your response to stress source, in some cases, accepting the stress may be all that<is left. In this event, incorporating the following recommended practices will reduce the negative effects of stress: relaxation techniques, therapeutic activities, visualization, faith practices / self reflection, schedule of physical exercises, laughter / humor, well balanced diet / nutritious foods, plenty of rest and cultivate support relationships (professional or otherwise). If you can neither alleviate the source of stress nor alter your response, then compromising on these healthy practices puts you at higher risks for the negative physical and mental symptoms of stress. Steps to help cope with stress: 1. Identify source (event) and feeling associated with it (anxiety, fear, confusion, etc). 2. What is your present response? Can your response to the stress be changed? 3. Identify management strategy: alter, avoid, accept. Consider: * Which of these stress events are beyond your control? Which of these can you have some impact on? * Which of these will respond to some intervention? Which of these are likely to continue? Which of these will resolve on their own? 1 Which of these can be avoided?

There are two basic views or ways of explaining stressors or bad events: pessimism and optimism. Pessimist blame. themselves for negative stressors, believing the negative will last a long time and affect many aspects of their lives. Optimists tend not to blame themselves or if they do, see negative stressors as having only short term impact and limited consequences. Individuals with highly pessimist views have increased susceptibility for depression, illness and premature death, while optimistic individuals appear to be more protected or stress proofed against these susceptibilities. There is hvo general ways to undo pessimistic beliefs once you are aware of them. The first is to distract yourself when they occur, and the second is to dispute. them.

This is largely due to the increasing influence work has in hour lives today. We usually identify ourselves with what we do. We are likely to spend more hours in our work than any other activity, including sleep. Job strain is a term used to describe the particular stressors of a given job. The. most job strain occurs in jobs which have high demand and low control such as assembly workers, telephone operators and key punchers. The least job strain occurs in top executives and architects who have considerable control over their jobs. 10 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The fact that in corrections work things like riots, inmate on inmate attacks, inmate on officer attacks, suicides and exposure to diseases such as AIDS and Hepatitis is often part of the job doesn't make them less critical. In fact, a danger in this work is to believe you can just handle all of this - that to get help means you're weak. Certainly you do learn to deal with things the general public would find distressing, however, you are not immune from the impact of these events, There is also a higher than average death rate among correctional and other law enforcement personnel, and that also takes a toll. The longer you try to ignore your feelings, the bigger the pile gets! Read below to see if you see yourself. If you do, reach out, call your EAP, or another professional of your choice for assistance. SIGNALS THAT AN OFFICER IS STUCK AND NEEDS FURTHER HELP **The following is adapted from Roger Soloman, Ph.D.: 'T'm Stuck and Better Do Something About It!\" 1. 2. 3. 4. Intrusive Images. Distressing memories, thoughts, nightmares and flashbacks. Flashbacks can be both auditory, as well as visual. Distress at expcisure to eyents that resembk cr symbolize the event. Officer avoids thoughts and emotions connected with the incident, or activities or situations that arouse memories of the trauma. This may sound like a good thing to do. After all, why talk about a highly distressing situation. While this attitude is understandable, if a person cannot talk about the situation without undue and uncomfortable emotions, then they have not properly processed the incident. Typically this patter of avoidance intensifies and spreads, as other symptoms appear and worsen. Numbing or restricted range of emotional responsiveness. To defend against the painful emotions surrounding the incident, a person may shut off all emotions. This of course is not a practical solution! We need to experience emotions emotions, feelings and relationships. Life in general sours if we disconnect ourselves from our feelings. Excessive stress reactions. The physical symptoms of stress are powerful. They result from the \"fight-flight response\" which is designed to prepare OUT bodies for danger. However, if get our bodies stuck in this overdrive mode, we can wear ourselves down physically and emotionally. At a certain point, by reliving the 1 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

In fact, we can develop a \"hair trigger\" to stress thus putting a tremendous burden on OUT physical health.. Hypervigilance. It is common and normal for police officers to be more alert to danger than the average citizen. However, after a critical incident, the officer may find himself in high gear and unable to downshift. This constant state of hypervigilance can become intrusive, uncomfortable, and physically exhausting. Overreaction/under-reactiodrisk taking. Surviving a Critical Tncident can put a dent in your spirit. This can result in some behavioral changes on the job as one tries to adjust to the situation. Officers may find themselves under-reacting with a \"who gives a shit\" attitude. The opposite may occur with the officer \"not letting anyone get something over on me\"! Finally, we see some officers start to take excessive risks. This behavior may serve the purpose of distracting them from painful thoughts of the incident. In addition it may afford them with an adrenaline high that can become addictive. Increased irritability, anger, or rage. This symptom can be very disruptive to an officer's life. It can push away his friends, destroy his family life, and gain him a reputation that hurts him on the job. Obsession with the Incident. It is both normal and healthy to talk about the incident for a time after it has occurred. However thoughts and images of the incident can take over! Images become easily triggered and one seems to be stuck in the past with difficulty looking toward the future. The incident triggers feelings associated with past events, An incident may cause thoughts/feelings/images of the past negatiw events to resurface. This can be true even though it was thought that the past incident was dealt and gone. What can really be problematic is that images of past incidents with apparently little relationship to the current incident can be triggered. For example, seeing a dead child in an auto accident can cause a childhood memory of a friend moving away to resurface. 10. Self-doubt, guilt, second guessing oneself. An officer may become obsessed with hisher mistakes be they real or imagined, The \"what 3s\" start to take over. Feelings of inadequacy will then follow. Life no longer goes forward, but stays stuck in the past. 11. A growing sense of isolation deveiops. The officer may have been involved in a uniquely bad situation. Even with support, however, he/she starts to think, \"No one understands what I'm experiencing\". To some extent, this may be true. However, there is a trap in this wzy of thinking. You may push your friends and family away and fulfill your own prophecy that you are alone. At that point the officer may feel lost, abandoned, and different than others. 2 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Intense or sustained feelings of depression, grief, Ioss of control. A critical incident by its very nature can make us feel out of control of our lives. It puts us real close with the r-eality that the world is a dangerous place to live. Officers need to feel that they have control. It is fundamental to their ability to cope. A critical incident can take this coping device away from us. Depression and grief follow. This creates a cycle of intense emotion geared to allow us to feel in control but serving only to take us farther from it. 13. Mental confusion, Increased distractibility, difficulty concentrating or making decisions, poor judgement. 14. Development of suspiciousness in dealing with others. Since the critical incident was probably unexpectedand painfd, we by to gear ourselves to not being hurt in the future. We start to distrust all that is around us. We hope that by assuming the worst, we will not be surprised and hurt. Unfortunately, when this defense runs amok, it prevents us fiom seeing the good in people. It keeps us fiom making friends. It puts us on the path to cynicism. 15. Relationship problems. An officer may withdraw from his friends and family. He may in fact actively push them away. He may experience problems dealing with supervisors and peers were previously he had none. 16. Decline in work performance. Increased absenteeism, burn out, decline in productivity and quality of work. 17. One may have little or no noticezble initial reaction to the incident, but reactions occur months later. This can be a problem if the officer does not see the connection between the incident and hisher current emotional troubles. The emotions may be triggered by some similar event, the relaxing of defenses such as denial, or occur for no known reason as if \"out of the blue\". 18. Self-destructive behavior. Substance abuse, poor judgement, and inappropriate decision making may result. These decisions may or may not have to do with the job. For example an officer may decide at this point to have an affair or divorce. Decisions that will complicate hisher life and often result in regrets later on. 19.

COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND AVOIDANCE STRATEGIES Activities that may reduce stress in the short run but create new problems (and new stress) in the long run. Counterproductive actions fail to address the environment, and the personal causes and effects of stress. Ex: If you cope with task conflicts by ignoring the problem and drinking to relieve the tension, you could end up with two problems: the unchanged job conflict andthe effects of a drinking problem. I I 1 1. ELIMINATE THE PROBLEM AT THE SOURCE Strategies that eliminate the stressor or demand by direct action. The action has an impact on people, situations or the environment. Example: If your job tasks conflict with each other, attempt to negotiate a permanent solution with your supervisor or co-workers. CHANGE YOUR APPRAISAL OF THE PROBLEM Approaches that change the way you perceive the stressor, without directly affecting it or avoiding the problem. In other words, you think about the situation differently. If your job tasks conflict cannot be eliminated, determine the proper overall job priorities and resign yourself to the fact that the situation cannot be perfect. ._. - -- - _- - -- 3. MANAGE THE STRESS RESPONSES Techniques for coping with the q~mptoms of the stress, without directly changing the stressful characteristics of the situation, or the way you think about the problem. Ex: When conflicts between job tasks produce stress, control stress symptoms through stress-reducing breathing techniques. Improving your diet, schedule, exercise program, and other aspects of your lifestyle are other methods for reducing stress symptoms. __ - __ - - . -- -.---...------ !- MPA, CPP-F?, Work and Family Stress Manaaement.

MANAGE THE STRESS RESPONSES Techniques for coping with the symptoms of the stress, without directly changing the stressful characteristics of the situation, or the way you think about the problem. Ex: When conflicts between job tasks produce stress, control stress symptoms through stress-reduci ng breathing techniques. Improving your diet, schedule, exercise program, and other aspects of your lifestyle are other methods for reducing stress symptoms. . . - --__ 4. COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND AVOIDANCE STRATEGIES Activities that may reduce stress in the short run but create new problems (and new stress) in the long run. Counterproductive actions fail to address the environment, and the personal causes and effects of stress. Ex: If you cope with task conflicts by ignoring the problem and drinking to relieve the tension, you could end up with two problems: the unchanged job conflict andthe effects of a drinking problem, ' SDMcLaughlin.

The Employee Assistance Program is a pre-paid benefit that allows all DOC employees and their dependents, as well as domestic partners, access to confidental help with any number of personal problems. You can call the program 24 hours a day/7 days a week. You will see an EAP counselor in their private office, thus allowing the maximum degree of privacy. The EAP may help you resolve your issue in the up to three sessions that are covered, or may refer you to another therapist for more in-depth counseling - it really depends on the nature and duration of the problem. The EAP sessions are at no cost to you, and any ongoing care referrals will be made under your healthcare plan so that your out of pocket costs are kept to a minimum. What kinds of problems does the EAP see? Q Marital, relationship issues Q Drug and alcohol problems 4 Gam b I ing problems *3 Depression, and other mood disorders *:+ Family/child problems Q Death or illness in the family Q Stress and anxiety problems *3 Job/career concerns I undersfand how this program can benefit my spouse/partner, but why would I need it? Work in Corrections is unique: it is challenging, risky, and often dangerous. Sometimes family members of Correctional employees feel \"shut-out\" because the employee doesn't want to talk about work after leaving their facility, or they may be trying to \"protect\" family members. The stress that accompanies the work may impact the ways in which the employee communicates at home, their level of energy, and/or at times, their level of patience. If you begin to feel isolated, frustrated, upset, and/or angry, it is likely that some friction will develop. Once that happens, things can quickly spiral downward, and stress levels rise. This is when speaking to someone can be helpful. You also may have a problem that is unrelated to your spouse or partner - the EAP is there for you. One of the benefits of the program is that it is truly neutral: the EAP is not your friend or family member, and it is not the Department. We are professionally trained people who will listen to your concerns and give you some honest feedback concerning your situation. Call the EAP at 1-800-277-9048 It's confidenfia/, it's convenient, and it's at no cost to you. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

FOCUS Dear FOCUS Training Participant: Welcome to today's traiiziizgprogram, \"Focus On You\", which is one component of the FOCUS program that has been designed to reduce correction officer and family stress through education and training. The training that you will be attending today was developed using information that was collected from the surveys that you completed recently, and has two primary objectives: 1. To assist you in improving the clarity and style of communications at work, especially with peers and superiors, and 2. To help you to learn how to decompress and relate to your families and friends, outside of work, in a manner that acknowledges that there is a difference between how you interact with people in your personal life and how you need to function at work. We realize that this transition is not always an easy one to make. The FOCUS program is funded by the National Institute of Justice, and jointly operated by the Connecticut State Department of Correction, A.F.S.C.M.E. Council 4, and WorkMax (your EM). This project acknowledges that there are some unique stresses that are a part of working as a correctional officer, which can impact your relationships both within and outside of work. We believe that by providing you with some tools in the areas of stress management, communication, and handling conflict, you will be better prepared to negotiate those relationships and improve your overall quality of life. We hope you participate actively in this training, and we welcome your feedback on ways in which we can improve this for future participants. Brief though it is, this could be the beginning of something very significant to your personal and professional futures. 24 Wolcott Hill Road Wethersfield, CT 06109 Phone (860) 692-6808 The National Institute of Justice Grant Award #98-FS-VS-O03 funds this program This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

You don't want to do anything. You think I don't want to do things, that I'm avoiding things? Yes, and I'm beginning to think you just don't want to be with me anymore. You feel like I don't want to be with you, to go out with you? What else should I think? It makes me mad that we don't do things together anymore. You're angry because you think I don't want to be with you? I'm mad, but I'm scared too. I don't know what you want anymore. Are you afraid I don't want to be with you?

Demonstrate to the speaker that you want to listen. Listening is an active not passive activity. Look and act interested. Lean forward slightly, face the speaker squarely, keep your arrns and legs uncrossed and keep an appropriate distance. Remove distractions: do not doodle, tap your pen or shuffle papers. Empathize with the speaker. Try to put yourself in the speaker's place so that you can see their point of view. Be patient - allow time - do not interrupt. Hold your temper. Avoid argument and criticism - this tends to put the speaker on the defensive. Do not argue - even if you 'win', you 'lose'. Ask questions to encourage the speaker and to demonstrate that you are listening. Reflect and summarize fiom time to time. Use non-verbal behavior - e.g. nod head, eye contact, gaze. Use verbal behavior - e.g. \"Aha,\" \"I see,\" \"GO on tell me.\" This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

Illness Catching a cold, breaking an ann, a skin infection, a sore back, are all CHANGES in your body condition. Pushing Your Body Too Hard A major source of stress is overdriving yourself. If you are working (or partying) 16 hours a day, you will have reduced your available time for rest. Sooner or later, the energy -drain on your system will cause the body to fall behind in its repair work. There will not be enough time or energy for the body to fix broken cells, or replace used up brain neurotransmitters. Changes will occur in your body's internal environment. You will \"hit the wall,\" or \"run out of gas.'' If you continue, permanent damage may be done. The body's fight to stay healthy in the face of the increased energy that your are expending is major stress. Environmental Factors Very hot or very cold climates can be stresshl. Very high altitude may be a stress. Toxins or poisons are a stress. Each of these factors threatens to cause CHANGES in your body's internal environment. Tobacco Use Tobacco is a powerful toxin! Smoking destroys cells that clean your trachea, bronchi, and lungs. Smoking causes emphysema and chronic bronchitis, which progress to slow suffocation. The carbon monoxide from cigarette smoking causes chronic carbon monoxide poisoning. Tobacco use damages the arteries in your body, causing insufficient blood supply to the brain, heart, and vital organs. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of cancer 50 fold. Chewing tobacco or snuff is no safe haven. It also damages your arteries, and it carries the same cancer risk. (Cancers of the head and neck are particularly vicious, disfiguring, and deadly). Poisoning the body with carbon monoxide, and causing the physical illnesses of emphysema, chronic bronchitis, cancer, and arterial damage, tobacco is a powerful source of added stress to one's life.

Reverse the scores for the 12 questions that give high scores for unrecomrnended responses, Dudley Weeks says some responses to conflict lead to resolutions which build a relationship, and some do not. All 40 questions need to be on the same scale, giving a high number for desirable or effective responses and a low score for ineffective ones. But 12 of the questions are worded so that ineffective answers get a \"5\" instead of a lllrf. 2, 3. 4. For example, question #I reads \"I feel that conflict is a negative experience.\" Weeks would say that someone who answers \"Almost akays\", a \"S', will probably have difficulty approaching a conflict and that this will reduce the person's effectiveness. Therefore that response deserves a low score, and the \"5\" needs to be reversed to a ''1\". Doing this for the 12 questions will assure that all scores MU be consistent, with higher scores going to \"beffer\" responses. Please reverse the scores for the following questions: 1,3,13,18,22,24, 26, 27, 31,32,33, and 35. Reverse those questions by looking at the response given in the left hand column and writing in a reversed score in the right hand column as follows: 5 be comes 1 4becomes2 3rernains 3 2becomes4 lbecomes5 Answer: Score: For the questions that do not need to be reversed. For the questions that do not need to be reversed, write the same number given in the left-hand answer column in the right-hand score column. Compute sub-totals and the total. The 40 questions are in groups of 4, based on topics in Week's book. Addthe scores for each 0 moup of 4 and put the result in the blank. (The letter is just an abbreviation for the topic of that group.) Then add the sub-totals and enter the result In the \"Total\" blank, Interpret the results, and learn from them. The higher your scores, the more effective you are likely to be at finding resolutions that meet everyone's real needs and that build your long-term relationship. Of the 10 sub-totals, which were the highest? These are probably areas where you are effective. Which sub-totals were the lowest? Tnese are probably areas where you might try a different approach, Use the sheet \"LearninE from the Survey\" to understand where you might improve. Pick 2 or 3 of the questions with the lowest scores, and try out behaviors which might make you more effective at resolving conflicts productively.

For each question on the survey, some advice is given below. The advice was compiled by the Conflict Resolution class and is based primarily on Dudley Weeks' The Eight Essential Steps to Conf7.ict Resolution, but also includes ideas from other souces, including Gettinn to Yes by Roger Fisher and William Ury.

View conflict as a natural outgrowth of diversity aniong people, which can be addressed in a win-win way that strengthens your relationships. Remember the value of building your long-term relationship. View the resolution of the conflict and the building of the relationship as inter-related parts. Prevention works best. View conflicts as opportunities for growth - for you and the other person, and for your 1. 3 2. 3. 4. A. 5. 6, 7. 8. C. 9, 10. 11. 12. :elationship. Kandle the differences in a way that strengthens your relationship - together you will find more satisfying resolutions for this and future conflicts. Address differences directly, realizing you are more likely to meet both your concerns and the other's if you discuss issues opedy. Separate the people from the problem, so you can protect the relationship while addressing the problem. ATMOSPHERX. Start by establishing an effective atmosphere that promotes partnership and problem-solving. Meet with the other at a mutually satisfactory time, when you both have plenty of time and are free from distractions. Meet in an equally acceptable place that is tranquil and gives you equal power. Help the ofher feel comfortable and safe, affirming the importance of the relationship. Start by saying you know the two of you can invent some solutions together that are mutually acceptable. CLARIFY PERCEPTIONS. Work with the other so both are very clear about what the conflict is really about. Eliminate ghost issues that arise from rnisperceptions. Separate the people from the problem. Acknowledge emotions as legitamate. Then face the problem together. Be clea with yourself and with the other how you feel and how you perceive the problem Use \"I - Statements\" to tell the other how you feel, rather than \"You - Statements\" that blame. Assert your needs without attacking the other. Ask questions to clarify your perception of the other's perceptions. Listen actively. Acknowledge what the other says. Look at yourself honestly, clarifying needs and misperceptions. Clear up rnisperceptions and stereotypes.

However; as our lives become more integrated with technology keeping our private information confidential becomes more difficult. Electronic transactions can leave you vulnerable to fraud and other crimes. Following a few simple tips can help keep your code from being cracked. A Word on Passwords Whether you are on the Internet or an online bank- ing program, you are often required to use a pass- word. The worst passwords to use are the ones that come to mind first-name, spouse's name, maiden name, pets, children's name, even street addresses, etc. The best passwords mix numbers with upper and lowercase letters. A password that is not found in the dictionary is even better. There are programs that will try every word in the dictionary in an effort to crack your security. Don't be a '~oe\"--someone who uses their name as their password. The weakest link in a security system is the hu- man element. The fewer people who have access to your codes and passwords the better. Avoid breaks in your security by Changing your password regularly. Memorizing your password. If you have several, set up a system for remembering them. If you do write down the password, keep it at home or hidden at work. Don't write your password on a post-it note and stick it on your monitor or hard drive.

Whether it's an argu- ment with a friend, irritation because a driver cuts in front of you, a disagree- ment about the best way to do a job - conflict is a part of everyday life. Conflict produces stress, hurts fiiend- ships, and causes injury and death. We can't always avoid conflict, but we can learn to manage it. That way, we use conflict to improve our lives and to learn from past mistakes. WHAT SKILLS ARE NEEDED TO WAGE PERSONAL CONFLICT? d Understanding your own feelings about conflict. This means recognizing your \"triggers,\" words or actions that immediately provoke an emotional response, like anger. It could be a facial expression, a tone of voice, a pointing finger, a certain phrase. Once YOU know your \"triggers,\" you can better control your emotions. Active listening. Go beyond hearing just words and try to understand what the other person is saying. Listen carefully, instead of thinking about what you're going to say next. Active listening requires concentration and body language that says you are pay- ing attention. I flict.

Mediation relieves the backlog in overburdened courts, and people often are more satis- fied with the results. Mediators do not make decisions for people - they help people make their own decisions. In mediation sessions, a neutral third person (or persons) helps the parties in conflict resolve their problem. Mediators should be detached and unbiased. They may be professionals or volunteers who have undergone intensive training. Mediators do not dictate a settlement; they encourage dialog, provide guidance, and help the parties define areas of agree- ment and disagreement.

One thing that makes law enforcement work different from other jobs is the constant exposure to the bad side of life, to people who have gone wrong, committed heinous crimes, people capable of incredible cruelty to their fellow human beings. It's easy to become jaded, to see only one side of life. Have you noticed: *:* You call in sick to work more. Even when you're not sick, just to take a ''mental health'' day. *:* When you are working, you just don't care. Productivity seems like a waste, and you can't get motivated no matter what the consequences. You seem to spend more and more time avoiding calls and doing nothing. You are starting to get negative comments on you work performance. *:* You are starting to become accident-prone. You fmd yourself doing reckless things. You don't care and you tell yourself \"what does it matter?'' *:* You can't concentrate. The paperwork is overwhelming. You never seem to have enough time. You are leaving things undone. *:* You often feel confused. It is hard to recall instructions, details, or directions. You not only start to make mistakes, but also can't remember making them! *:* You don't look good. The \"attitude\" has actually affected your appearance! You don't care about your clothes. Your grooming is not up to your normal standards. Your hygiene may even be suffering. *3 You're not getting along well with other people. You find yourself arguing a lot. You don't feel understood.

Isolating from the public, from famiIy, at times even from eo-workers. . It's lonely. . It's boring, execpt for the moments of unexpected terror. An officer who is well liked and respected by his peers comes back to his post from a meal break. It's 0100 hours on what seems to be a routine 2300 - 0700 shift. But for him it's a restless night and he knows the time will drag. He remembers the day an administrator told him he was going to go places in the department. As quickly as the promise of his big chance came it vanished. Politics, idle talk, not going along with certain protocol, and not knowing who the players are. In the green lined darkness of a midnight shift that leads to nowhere, he contemplates his situation, his future. It's then the tiredness overwhelms him and he begins to sweat and shake without understanding why. Tonight time is his enemy as he ponders his future, wondering why he 's no longer excited about the job or the people he works side by side with. He's second guessing his motives for taking this as his chosen career. Counting the years to his retirement, he wonders if he's become as cold a person as he now feels. He's at the point where he feels he too old to play the game anymore. He feels the promises of labor and management are just empty hype. It's somebody else's pipe dream or power play that he can no longer bring himself to be part of. Sitting back in his chair he leans back so his head touches the cold steel wall and he stares over the bodies of inmates who seem to have a peace of mind he envies. His feelings seem very clear to him, but with a flaw, he fmly believes that there is no one he has that he can confide in, that no one would understand, not even his wife. She might even criticize him or worse ignore him. He has to be careful around her, on his guard, after all she could have married someone with a 9 to 5 job who could have given her a better life. Frustration sets in. Maybe something will happen tonight so that the adrenaline will kick in. But instead the stress starts taking it's toll. Shiftwork is not normal. It disrupts the body. Shiftwork disrupts the home. It effects the entire family. What and who we work with can change US. We can bring that change home. After seeing so much that is bad in people, can we still see the good? This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Turning, fluffing up the pillows, and rearranging the covers doesn't help. She has never really adjusted to hs night shift. She also knows that she'll be tired tomorrow and wonders how she'll deal with the kids and hold up at work. Exhaustion and loneliness are the only feelings she has right now. She worries about him. He's not the same. He doesn't seem to be talking to anyone, not even the kids. He'll sleep most of the day only to get up to eat dher in silence, then watch TV all night in the bedroom alone and probably fall asleep again. He'll drag himself out of bed to get ready for work again as his family get ready for bed. She feels he is being robbed from her by this job. When she asks him about what's going on, he becomes even more distant. On top of all this there's the kids to worry about. They don't know why Daddy is acting the way he does. Why is he always alone in his room with no time for them. Did they do some- thing wrong? Doesn't he want to live with them anymore? Their friends tell them how they've heard how mean C/Os are to people. She wonders if they are beginning to believe them. The room is closing in on her. What's happening to her marriage, the excitement's not there anymore. What about the future? Is there any? She feels scared, helpless, useless, and more than a little unloved. She too is counting the years to his retirement so their world can return to normal. Can she wait? Too many questions without answers. She loves him so much it hurts more than she can ever explain to anyone. They just wouldn't understand. Frustration sets in. Stress is taking it's toll. . Corrections work IS stressfull . It effects all aspects of our lives. But we so often deny emotional realities. Admitting to a problem and seeking help for that problem is viewed as weakness. We often suffer needlessly in silence. We take our family with us. This is a scenario that's played out in our families with much too much frequency. We really don't have to read or hear it, because we live. Regardless of what department you work for, your rank or your assignment you know how unfair corrections work can be. We confront the feelings of frustration of our work and the system every time we go on duty. -- __ /- - .

Issues specific to Corrections Officers Page 3 of 5 In academy training we're encouraged to control and deny any emotions. We're put above any display of feelings. Yet when we conduct ourselves this w~y we are accused of being cold or following the rules too closely. This puts us in a Catch-22 situation. Our professional stress is frequently compounded with personal stress. Traditionally law enforcement has attracted people who demand perfection. The work is demanding and the way we project ourselves is self-inducing of stress to us and those around us. Statistics bear out the magnitude of our exposure to stress by the number of officer deaths, bronchial diseases, suicides and emotional problems. Along with our health and emotional well being at stake the levels of occupational and self-induced stress contribute I to the breakdown of relationships between us and our families. Not only does it affect existing relationships it hinders the potential to develop other relationships. Studies show that we do not suffer the greatest stress at the time of a critical incident. The geatest sources of stress are experienced in daily frustration from which officers and our families can find no escape. People in general have a distinct stereotypical profile of a correction officer and his family. Our kids must often endure other kids and teachers asking about their rnothedfather the guard. This has a tendency to make them think that their family is somehow different from their friend's. The impact of this is for us to socialize only with people who are on the job. This causes more stress because of the isolation and not being sociable in the community at large. We've been denied certain vacation picks and had to explain the logic of seniority. Plays, practices, ball games, parent teacher meetings become a one parent affair because we can't get the day off. How does our family adjust to this absenteeism? Do they ever adjust? How do we react to these unfair demands and requirements of correction work? Because of situations like these it's common for our relationships to become confusing. It's problematic for us to move in and out of different roles such as officer, spouse, parent and friend. We have to learn how to balance the tough exterior with the soft inner core. One of the hardest things for us to do is to let go when we're off duty because we rely so much on self- control in our work. We're called on in any given situation to see only the black and white of the issue. We strive to be exact in our decisions. You can't bring these qualities in to a relation- ship. Jld L , L-' Sometimes we expect our families to fully understand the stress of our work. We may become distant fi-om our wives and husbands because we think that they don't want to under- stand. This leaves the spouse corfused and carrying around a lot of guilt. On the flip side we may seek refuge in the relationship depending fully on the other person, causing them to be overwhelmed by this. I-., .-. / .I /y ,-- ujg cc.+cL~ PLY.

This can lead to a depression that ultimately is going to affect both us and our families. The non-depressed person may not understand this depression or why the things that are changing are doing so. The things that were once fin things become emotional labors. This may cause the spouse or family to need treatment themselves. We know it can be difficult to be a correction officer, but it can also be a rewarding experience.

You have to develop a mental health plan for yourself just as you would for your physical well being. But always remember that the family is going through a difficult period with you. Don't forget the people you love are also suffering from your stress. If you are being affected by stress, you have to realize that there is something real and positive you can do. Some forms of stress can be changed or offset by changing our attitude and lifestyle. More serious forms or conditions such as lasting depression need to addressed with professional intervention and help. We must take the responsibility of being aware that our individual stress and attitude to it is affecting the most significant people in our lives. More and more departments nation wide are responding to the mental health needs of their officers and their families. These departments are taking the necessary steps to help officer's to change the stigma of seeking all and any help available. Letting go of the anger rather then feeling like you've lost control of your life, frees you to make the decisions you have to in order to move in a positive way to the quality of life you deserve. The wives, husbands and children of correction officers should be aware of the early warning signals that someone in the family is starting to suffer from the overload of correction family stress. Responses to stress can range fiom verbal arguing to drug abuse. Other indicators may include a family member being pessimistic and not wanting to socialize, having difficulty controlling their temper, and becoming extremely critical of other family members. Additional signs me crankiness, forgetfulness, sleep disturbances, anxiety, weight loss, poor eating habits and a tendency toward accidents. You should take immediate action against serious signs of crisis. Watch for alcohol or drug abuse, excessive crying, extreme signs of guilt and fear, paranoia, a desire for revenge and complete withdrawal. If you or someone in the family is having problems coping with the stress, do something about it. This type of awareness and action helps our families to successfully counter stress. This column is to be a forum for correction officers and their families. It's our chance to interact with families and officer's nation wide.

Left unchecked, however, stress can cause physical, emotional, and behavioral disorders which can affect your health, vitality, and peace-of-mind, as well as personal and professional relationships. Everyone handles stress differently, some better than others. If you think you have too much stress in your life, it may be helpful to talk with a doctor, member of.the clergy or other caring professional. Because reactions to stress can be a factor in depression, -anxiety and other mental and emotional disorders, they may suggest that you consult with a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, or other qualified counselor. J Here Is a checklist of negative reactions to stress and tension: 5 Do minor problems and disappointments upset you excessively? a Do the small pleasures of life fail to satisfy you? n Are you unable to stop thinking of your worries? D Do you feel inadequate or suffer from self-doubt? Are you constantly tired? Do you experience flashes of anger over a minor problem? Have you noticed a change in sleeping or eating patterns? Do you suffer from chronic pain, headaches, or back aches? a If you answered \"yes\" to most of these questions, consider the following suggestions for reducing or controlling stress: Be realistic. If you feel overwhelmed by some activities, learn to say NO! Shed the \"superman/supenvornan\" urge. No one is perfect, so don't expect perfection from yourself and others. Meditate for ten to twenty minutes. Visualize how you can manage a stressful situation more successfully. Take one thing at a time. Prioritize your tasks and tackle each one separately. Take on a hobby that will give you a break from your worries. Live a healthy lifestyle with good nutrition, adequate rest, regular exercise, limited caffeine and alcohol, and balanced work and play.

The survey was designed by members of Jock McClellan's 1993 class on Conflict Resolution. The questions are based primarily on the methods recommended by Dudley Weeks in The Eight Essential Steps to Conflict Resolution &os Angeles: Jeremy Tarcher, 1992), as well as on principles in Roger Fisher's and William Ury's Getting to Yes ( Penguin Books, 1991). First, print the survey. Then use the print-out to rate each of the following statements from 1 - 5 using the ratings below to indicate how often you do as the statement says. Please write your responses in the LEFT column of dashes. Answer the questions to portray your most usual way of dealing with conflicts like those at home or at work. Do not take long on any question. Give your initial reaction. The more honest your answers, the more useful the results will be.

Scoring the Conflict Resolution Questionnaire ' Reverse the scores for the 12 questions that give high scores for Y - unrecommended responses. Dudley Weeks says some responses to conflict lead to resolutions which build a relationship, and some do not. All 40 questions need to be on the same scaIe, giving a high number for desirable or effective responses and a low score for ineffective ones. But 12 of the questions are worded so that ineffective answers get a \"5\" instead of a \"1\". For example, question #1 reads \"I feel that conflict is a negative experience.\" Weeks would say that someone who answers \"Almost always\", a \"5\", will probably have difficulty approaching a conflict and that this w31 reduce the person's effectiveness. Therefore that response deserves a low score, and the \"5\" needs to be reversed to a \"1\". Doing this for the 12 questions will assure that all scores will be consistent, with higher scores going to flbetter\" responses. Please reverse the scores for the following questions: I, 3, 13, 18,22,24,26,27,31,32,33, and 35. Reverse those questions by looking at the response given in the left hand column and writing in a reversed score in the right hand column as follows: Answer: Score: Sbecomesl 4becomes2 3remains 3 2becomes4 lbecomes5 For the questions that do not need to be reversed. For the questions that do not need to be reversed, write the same number given in the left-hand answer column in the right-hand score column. Compute sub-totals and the total. The 40 questions are in groups of 4, based on topics in Week's book. Add the scores for each group of 4 and put the result in the blank. (The letter is just an abbreviation for the topic of that group .) Then add the sub-totals and enter the result in the \"Total\" blank. Interpret the results, and learn from them. The higher your scores, the more effective you are likely to be at frnding resolutions that meet everyone's real needs and that build your long-term relationship. Of the 10 sub-totals, which were the highest? These are probably aeas where you are effective. Which sub-totals were the lowest? These are probably areas where you might try a different approach. Use the sheet \"Learning from the Survey\" to understand where you might improve. Pick 2 or 3 of the questions with the lowest scores, and try out behaviors which might make you more effective at resolving conflicts productively. - 4 Conflict Resolution Questionnaire Learning from the Survey I Conflict Resolution - Main Page This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

VIEW CONFLICT AS NATURAL AND POSITIVE. View conflict as a natural outgrowth of diversity among people, which can be addressed in a win-win way that strengthens your relationships. Remember the value of building your long-term relationship. View the resolution of the conflict and the building of the relationship as inter-related parts. Prevention works best. View conflicts as oppoitunities for growth - for you and the other person, and for your relationship. Handle the differences in a way that strengthens your relationship - together you will find more satisfying resolutions for this and future conflicts. Address differences directly, realizing you are more likely to meet both your concerns and the other's if you discuss issues openly. Separate the people from the problem, so you can protect the relationship while addressing the problem. ATMOSPHERE. Start by establishing an effective atmosphere that promotes partnership and problem-solving. Meet with the other at a mutually satisfactory time, when you both have plenty of time and are free from distractions. Meet in an equally acceptable place that is tranquil and gives you equal power. Help the other feel comfortable and safe, affirming the importance of the relationship. Start by saying you know the two of you can invent some solutions together that are mutually acceptable. CLARIFY PERCEPTIONS. Work with the other so both are very clear about what the conflict is really about. Eliminate ghost issues that arise from misperceptions. Separate the people from the problem. Acknowledge emotions as legitamate. Then face the problem together. Be clear with yourself and with the other how you feel and how you perceive the problem Use \"I - Statements\" to tell the other how you feel, rather than \"You - Statements\" that blame. Assert your needs without attacking the other. Ask questions to clarify your perception of fie other's perceptions. Listen actively. Acknowledge what the other says. Look at yourself honestly, clarifying needs and misperceptions. Clear up misperceptions and stereotypes. Avoid pushing \"buttons.'' http ://www. qvctc.commnet.edu/classes/conflict/Imsy, html 8/29/9 9 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Even though you rigorously follow a stress management program, stress still could be ravaging you and shortening your life. This is true because most people's definition of stress management is erroneous. To the average person, it means learning to relax and enjoy Ue, taking time to mellow out in comfortable, stress-fiee environments, exercising regularly, and a healthy diet. Many, believing themselves to be engaged in pursuing greater health and seE-fUlfillment, energetically practice relaxation techniques, yoga, meditation, and biofeedback. They play tennis every weekend, jog faithfully, watch their cholesterol intake, and take pride in their enlightened lifestyle. Millions of dollars are spent annually on gym memberships, exercycles, and other means of improving cardiovascular efficiency. Mdtimitlion-dollar industries have been created to service these enthusiasts' need for clothing and shoes. The problem is one of timing. Much of the damage attributable to stress has occurred before these stress management efforts even have begun Permitting yourself to be bombarded by stressors during the day and trying to &do the damage evenings and weekends is the classic \"too little, too late.\" Living a hectic and frenzied life compounded by pressure and frustration and punctuated by periodic attempts to relax and exercise is a parody of stress management. More accurately, it is an endeavor to manage distress, not stress. While managing distress effectively is not to be decried, it is analogous to fighting a fire. Even with sophisticated apparatus, the best strategy is to avoid the conflagration in the fist place. This means learning to prevent stress from becoming distress, expanding the range of one's coping skills, and not allowing stressors to continue unabated. Even though distress management techniques have their place, they frequently are nothing more than expensive padlocks to put on a barn already empty of horses. The elimination of stress isn't the answer either. True stress management is distress prevention. In an experiment to find out what would happen in a stress-fiee environment, subjects were placed in a deprivation tank, where they floated in water warmed to body temperature. The drug curare was used to paralyze muscle movement. Eyes were blindfolded, ears were plugged, and there was nothing to smell or taste, or sensations to which the subjects had to adjust. After a period of relaxation, they began to hallucinate and have delusional thoughts - they became psychotic. Lacking stimulation, the brain produced its own. The marvelous mechanisms of brain and body require stimulation to function. The issue is how much, how frequent, and how long? Stress is the body's non-specific response to stressors such as frustrations, conoicts, and pressures. In more general tenns, they are known as adjustment demands. Every adjustment we make in life takes its toil in stress. Yet, stressors, as the deprivation tank iUustrates, can not and should not be avoided. They are essential to mental and physical health. Without the stress of learning, there would be no education. Without the stress of exercise, bodies would be flabby and unable to perform. Stressors are inevitable and even necessary- They sene to condition our minds and bodies, enabling greater performance. Stressors can stimulate growth and confidence and actually assist in ' 1 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.Managing Stress and Living Longer keeping us alive. The problem occurs when the stressors exceed our coping ability or continue too long. When that happens, stress becomes distress, and that is the issue of concern. There are two human conditions having the greatest potential for producing distress - impotence and isolation. When they are experienced, the human organism is at its most vulnerable to stress. Resist the impulse to jump to conclusions - this type of impotence refers to a psychological state in which we feel a demand to act, but lack the authority or ability. If you took psychology in college, you may remember studying the \"executive monkey\" experiment, conducted at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Two monkeys were strapped upright in a plastic box permitting limited movement, a console in fiont of each of them with a light and a button, The light was turned on 10 seconds before the monkeys received a jarring shock to their feet. The button would prevent the shock ifit was pushed within the 10-second grace period. The monkeys learned this fact faster than most graduate students. The researchers then added an inventive twist. They disconnected a wire to one of the buttons, reconnecting it to the other. Now, one monkey controlled the shock for both. Being responsible for another and having decision-making power, he was dubbed the executive monkey. After 23 days of this pressure, the executive monkey expired. A post-mortem revealed the beginning of atherosclerosis, incipient rend failure, and a perforated duodenal ulcer. The surviving non- executive monkey was sacrificed to the cause of science and found to be without physiological abnormality. The moral was supposed to be that executives were prone to stress-related diseases because they have responsibility for others. At first examination, that interpretation had face validity, and overstressed executives sympathized with the deduction. It duly was printed in most general psychology textbooks and taught to undergraduates. However, that conclusion was not supported by attempt replications. Every other attempt to duplicate the original results failed. Each time, it was the monkey whose button didn't work that developed ulcers. He knew he was going to get shocked, but was helpless to prevent it. This state is identified as responsibility without authorityy* better known in corporations as mid-level management. The most devastating type of stress is not heavy responsibility - it is having a sense of responsibility without the power to do anwg about it. Responsibility won't kill you as long as your buttons work, but feeling responsible for something over which you have no authority will send you to an early grave. To avoid the distressfbl consequences of feeling impotent, limit your sense of responsibility to those areas over which you have authority. Parents who agonize over the behavior of children whose age precludes parentai authority suffer f?om impotence. Employees who feel stymied in their careers because of the perceived inadequacies of their supervisors are making themelves impotent. Anyone who laments the quality of his or her life because of inabii@ to control the actions of another suffers fiom distress. In effect, they are saying to others, \"I am powerless to improve the qualrty of my life unless you change.\" That produces a feeling of impotence and heightened vulnerability to stress. This does not suggest that attempts to influence the lives of others are inconsequential. 2 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

However, don't be misled - influence is not authority. If others do not respond positively to your efforts to mod9 their behavior, don't make yourself impotent by persisting in your efforts. Keep the responsibility where the authority is. Ask yourself: \"What can I do to live a more successful life even though this other person is not cooperating with my pursuit of happiness?' That is the only effective question to ask. It focuses the issue on why you do - not what others do or don't do. Byxoncentrating on the authoriw you have to enrich you own life, you will minimize feelings of impotence. This reduces susceptibility to distress and has another important benefit - you'll be happier and more productive. -_ Isolation There is ample evidence that vulnerability to stress is intensified by the lack of close, bonded relationships. Social research confirms that we derive something from attachments that, in effect, serve to immunize us ftom stress. This \"need for nearness\" is dested in striving to feel wanted, needed, and valued. It is met by establishing intimate social bonds and involves the feelings of belonging and being loved. Even the need for self-esteem is an expression of the necessity for neamess. When we feel good about ourselves, it strengthens our confidence that we are worthy of belonging. Historically, marriage and family have been the prime sources for meeting nearness needs. In this age of anxiety, when tranquilizers are the most frequently prescribed medicine, it is not surprising that these institutions are less secure than ever before. Broken Mes seem to be the rule, not the exception. Sadly, family and marriage do not offer the stabiIity and support they once did. Actuarial statistics reveal that married people live longer than single people. We simply don't do as well alone as we do when we have intimacy. As the divorce rate escalates, so does vulnerability to stress. Increasingly, health specialists are adopting the attitude that disrupted social bonds afEect the body's immune system, increasing susceptibility to disease. The California Department of Mental Health found the following correlation between social ties and health: - People who isolate themselves from others face two or more times the risk of premature death. Terminal cancer strikes isolated people more often than those with bonded relationships. The rates of mental hospitalization are five to 10 times greater for separated, divorced, and widowed persons than for married people. Pregnant women under stress and without supportive relationships have three times the number of complications than expectant mothers with infie ties who are equally stressed. Women who can confide in a close fiiend are much less likely to become depressed. - - - Moreover, studies indicate the mortality rate of widowers is 40-60% higher during the first six months of bereavement. Ifremarriage occurs, mortality rates return to normal. 3 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

Not surprisingly, those who smoke have higher death rates than people who don't. The most revealing statistic is that, in both smoking and non-smoking populations, single, widowed, and divorced men had the highest rates. Divorced men who smoked had the highest rates of all. Being alone is bad enough, feeling unwanted is worse. If the loss of established relationships increases stress vulnerability, creating loving, committed relationships is the best safeguard against it. Several microcosmic population groups have been found with high percentages of centenarians. Efforts to discover the secret of their long lives have been inconclusive. The first, in the U.S.S.R. area of Georgia, led physically active lives, which led to the acceptance of cardiovascular fitness as the explanation. This conjecture was weakened by the discover of a similar group in India that had a high percentage of its populace living past 100 years of age despite being extremely sedentary in lifestyle. Eventually, the revelation of their high-fiber diet led to its attribution as the genesis of their longevity. In still another community in the Peruvian Andes, the aged not only weren't active, their diet was primarily home-made beer. Further reflection on these populations reveals only one common tie - in every instance, the communities valued and respected their elders. There were no mandatory retirement age or convalescent homes. There was no segregation by age at all. The older members of each group were involved in community activities, including meaningfid work, and were valued for their experience and knowledge. They felt needed, wanted, and loved. Every person is born with a genetically predetermined amount of stress-coping energy. Using this energy exacts a physiological toll known as aging. When it is depleted, death occurs. The most rapid depletion occurs in conditions of distress. Think of yourself as a vehicle and the stress-coping energy as gas in your car. The size of your gas tank, set at birth, and how well your engine is tuned determine how much mileage your vehicle will get. Many people treat their lives just like cars. The \"run out of gas\" long before they should because they don't take care of their \"engine7' or \"drive\" sensibly. While you can't change the size of your gas tank, you can do two things to maximize your mileage - keep your engine tuned and don't take any unnecessary trips. The next time you impotently rage at the \"idiot\" going 40 in the fast lane, ask yourself: Is it worth it? It could cost you seconds of your life. Do you really want to waste your finite stress- coping energy on someone you don't even know? Permitting the fEling of responsibility without a corresponding authority to act is like revving the car's engine with the brakes on. It may sound impressive, but it's a waste of gas. The next time you decide to \"write off' any of the people in your life because they have offended you, ask yourseE Can I afford it? Do you really want to lost the potential support and nourishment represented by that relationship? Doesn't it make more sense to salvage it? -. As important as diet and exercise are to \"tuning up your engine7\" they are not as crucial as avoiding the feelings of isolation. Making and maintaining loving relationships is the single most important way to stressproof your personality. Minuruzln g feelings of impotence and isolation are the philosophical heart of stress management. . .. 4 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Recently, you should have received a brochure that provided an overview of the Families, Officers, and Corrections Understanding Stress (FOCUS) Project. In that brochure, we indicated that the goal of the project was to reduce Correction Officer and family stress through education and training. The FOCUS project is the collaborative effort of AFSCME Council 4 and the Connecticut Department of Correction, in conjunction with ETP Inc. and Drs. M. E. Sullivan and J. B. Rogers (S & R Associates). The following survey was developed through that collaboration. In order to insure that the results of this survey accurately represent the perceptions of the Correction Officers, we want to urge you to answer each question as honestly as possible. To insure your confidentiality, the completed survey will only be handled by the AFSCME liaison and returned directly to S & R Associates for analysis. a The Connecticut Department of Correction, AFSCME (Locals 387, 391, and 1565), ETP Inc., and S & R Associates hope that we can begin to effect a significant change in the lives of all Correction Officers and their families with your help.
