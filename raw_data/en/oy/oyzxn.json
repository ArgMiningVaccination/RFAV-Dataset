These programs are coordinated by a psychologist, and include treatments such as relaxation techniques (including meditation), cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, and behavioral counseling. Behavioral counseling is used to help individuals make changes in their lives by looking objectively at behaviors, feelings, and thoughts in troublesome situations. At University Internal Medicine and Integrative Medicine, behavioral counseling is enhanced through other specific mind/body techniques like relaxation training and breathing techniques. This allows patients to take a proactive, self-care role in their health. Research shows the benefit of relaxation programs for improving the following: ADD/ADHD, anger/stress management, anxiety/panic, asthma, chronic pain, depression, fatigue, fibromyalgia, heart disease, insomnia, irritable bowel syndrome, psoriasis, post-traumatic stress disorder, and tension headaches. To get the most out of mind/body work, you should have open and honest communication with your provider. If you have any expectations or concerns for this work, make sure you clearly express them.
