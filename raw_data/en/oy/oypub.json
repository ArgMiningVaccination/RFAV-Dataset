Received: July 28, 2023; Published: August 14, 2023 Abstract A comprehensive search was carried out in mainstream bibliographic databases or Medical Subject Headings, including ScienDirect, PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science. The search was applied to the articles that were published between 2021 and mid-2023. With strict literature search and screening processes, it yielded 7 articles from 349 articles of initial literature database. A number of previous studies demonstrated that KTRs or non-KTRs with renal failure markedly reduced vaccine response, whereas adaptive protocols of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination or alternative adjuvant vaccines is now not known yet. A recent study revealed that acute kidney injury and mortality could be caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) around 50% and 23% of the infected KTRs. In conclusion, among the immunocompromised population, including KTRs, DPs, PDs, at least three doses of mRNA-COVID-19 vaccination was recommended to be the preparation of choice. Withdrawal of the immunosuppressants in KTRs and immunocompromised individuals prior COVID-19 vaccination and at least third dose of mRNA-COVID-19 vaccination should humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine in kidney transplant recipients and dialysis patients\".
