The ritual After setting up your Altar, it's important to sit and be present. Allow yourself time to connect and meditate, while holding the intention candle close to your heart. Feel yourself going deeply within and entering your inner wisdom. Feeling into your intention and breathing this into your candle is an important step, as this is a vital part of the ritual and the healing outcome. Once you have infused your intention, call in your guides, angels, ancestors and anyone else that you feel resonates with your heart. Begin the Sacred ritual by lighting the R.I.S.E. candle and dimming the lights to connect to the Divine Universal energy. You may like to use a prayer to begin the ceremony, see below: Prayer - As you light the candle repeat the following three times. allow the candle to burn out completely. \"In the name of the light, who is the lord of the universe. May the light and energy of this candle remove all fear, negativity and doubt and transmute to a powerful healing force. May this candle attract healing, positive energy and blessings. For the highest good of all and for the good of the universe, so be it, so be it, so be it.\" The next step is to fill out the date and your name using the Karmic Release Letter provided. Now read the letter out loud and with full commitment. Repeat as many times as you feel guided, use your own intuition always. When you are ready sign the letter to seal the deal, and now it is ready for the burning ritual to begin.
