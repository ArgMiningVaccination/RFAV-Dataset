One can either enter the age of wisdom with frustration and despair or adopt a positive lifestyle. When it comes to Ayurveda and menopause, practitioners recommend taking the second route. Today, we will discuss the significance of integrating healthy routines to promote comfort, relaxation, and happiness during later years. Let's have a look at post-menopause health tips that assist in facilitating wellness during this crucial period. Ayurveda and Menopause: Expert Recommended Post-Menopause Health Tips The menopause phase marks the end of creation and birth for a female body. The body releases reproductive organs from their duties, and hormonal levels fluctuate. These changes can cause distress and disruption for many people. Nonetheless, Ayurvedic practices can provide the required comfort and relaxation during this period. These routines take approximately forty days to form. Once formed, they promote longevity and health. Ancient texts mention herbs and practices that direct women toward healthy habits during menopause. Each of these steps facilitates a smooth, easy, and fruitful transition into the new phase. One can consider it as reaching an age of wisdom and tranquility. A time when catching a break and slowing your rigorous pace is beneficial for the body, mind, and soul. Regulation of Natural Sleep Cycle Night sweats and hot flashes are common symptoms of menopause. They may escalate due to irregular sleeping cycles and one's tendency to wake up when the sun is at its peak. Regulating the [circadian cycle](https://nunm.edu/2019/02/circadian-rhythms-womens-health/) (specifically the sleep-wake cycle) may reduce the chances of experiencing menopause-induced insomnia. One can do this by waking before the sunrises and ensuring that the body receives sufficient sunlight. Subsequently, rising early in the morning may promote optimal melatonin levels while countering hormonal changes. Sleeping three hours after sunset every day may regulate the natural circadian rhythm. A good night's sleep may keep the body nourished, energized, and more relaxed. Here are some post-menopause health tips to make this happen: - Maintain a proper sleeping schedule. - Avoid eating oily or heavy meals before bedtime. - Have your dinner right after sunset to prep for sleep. - Prevent distractions by reducing screen time during the night. - Meditate to fall asleep naturally. In short, adopt a disciplined lifestyle to keep the body changes and menopause symptoms in check. Maintain a Balanced Diet Plan to Support Healthy Elimination Menopause influences Vata and Pitta dosha. One must maintain a systematic and well-balanced diet plan to support these doshas naturally. Otherwise, one might have to deal with hot flashes, irritation, dryness, amongst other symptoms of menopause. A healthy breakfast, lunch, and early dinner (around 6:30 to 7 pm) are good Ayurvedic practices for women dealing with menopause. These healthy eating habits can facilitate healthy elimination (preferably in the morning). Good bowel movements may prevent gastrointestinal distress caused by menopause. Other post-menopause health tips include: - Plant-Based Diet Eating dark green vegetables (i.e., kale, spinach, broccoli, and chard) provides natural fiber. One can cook these vegetables, eat some of them raw or add them to a nice, light broth/soup. It, in turn, optimizes natural metabolism and supports healthy elimination. These vegetables also support growth and development by providing the body with essential nutrients, minerals, and vitamins. - Healthy Fats Daily intake of healthy fats (i.e., Omega 3 and Omega 6 fats) can also assist women. These good fats can support cognitive health and brain development, weight management and play a significant role in helping dhatus experience dryness due to menopause. Organic and natural sources of good fat include coconut, nuts (i.e., peanuts, almonds, and cashews), and seeds (i.e., flax seeds, sunflower seeds, hemp seeds). Triphala (made from Haritaki, Bibhitaki, and Amlaki) is another excellent source of good fats. Chyavanprash is a traditional Ayurvedic Jam that can nourish the whole body. These classic herbal blends are highly rejuvenating formulas revered by Ayurvedic practitioners. Athreya Herbs provides healthy fats in delicious jam form and edible oil varieties. These herbal products make daily usage convenient for modern women. - Herbal Teas & Milk Herbal teas are also beneficial for women dealing with menopause symptoms.

These herbal blends contain many bioactive compounds and nutrients that support natural immune health and overall rejuvenation. One can also drink Shatavari milk for bone strength and health. The inclusion of these herbal and organic ingredients in one's daily diet encourages healthy aging in women. Importance of Meditation and Exercise When it comes to Ayurveda and menopause, many practitioners advise restorative yoga and gentle meditation. Recommended lifestyle changes include: Mindfulness and Breathing Deep breathing exercises and alternate nostril breathing promote mental clarity and awareness. These practices followed by Sama Vritti (also known as equal breathing) are beneficial for mental health and optimal breathing. They might clear passageway for Prana (life force), which naturally boosts energy levels and vitality. Aromatherapy with aromatic Ayurvedic herbs and spices can also help. Daily Exercise Leisure walking, Pilates, yoga, and swimming are other positive lifestyle changes for menopause years. These activities can keep the body active and maintain physical health while supporting mental clarity and calmness. Performing these exercises at home can allow one to thrive and survive in the post-pandemic world. If one has interested in using recreational spaces and communal grounds, then social distance becomes necessary. Meditation Medication supports the adoption of a positive lifestyle for menopause years. It may uplift the spirit and promote a relaxed mind. In old age, sitting and walking in a garden or being surrounded by scenery can appear meditation. One can also elevate the experience through sound meditation. The latter revolves around natural sounds like forest breeze, raindrops, or a flowing river, etc. Or one can chant mantras when they perform yoga. These activities enable women to adopt an active lifestyle for menopause years without experiencing overexertion or exhaustion. In a way, these slow, conscious movements remind one to relax as they transition into old age. Proper Hydration for Dhatus and Tissues Menopause and aging can cause dryness and depletion inside the lymphatic tissues. Hormonal changes can also target specific tissues and areas of the body.

Ayurvedic practices include: - consumption of refreshing fluids like coconut water, lemonade, lime juice with honey. - Fresh fruit/vegetable juices every day. - Hot/lukewarm water in the morning right after one wakes up. Moreover, one may manage vaginal dryness with herbal oils. Using massaging oils (or simple coconut oil) for lubrication and leaving it overnight can promote optimal health in these targeted areas. Beauty and Skincare Routines after Menopause Many post-menopause health tips revolve around natural skin health and hair growth. One must maintain a healthy beauty regime to promote healthy aging. Many Ayurveda practices mention several topical massage oils, scalp masks, and herbal masks made from all-natural ingredients. Notable Ayurvedic herbs include Shatavari, Amalaki, Vidarikanda.
