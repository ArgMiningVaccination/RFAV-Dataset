Given the diagnostic delay and suboptimal sensitivity associated with these respective methods, alternative diagnostic strategies are needed for acute infection.We studied the use of a clinically validated liquid chromatography triple quadrupole method (LC/MS-MS) for detection of amino acids from plasma specimens. We applied machine learning models to distinguish between SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative samples and analyzed amino acid feature importance.A total of 200 samples were tested, including 70 from individuals with COVID-19, and 130 from negative controls. The top performing model overall allowed discrimination between SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative control samples with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.96 (95%CI 0.91, 1.00), overall sensitivity specificity of 0.92 (95%CI 0.85, 0.95).This approach holds potential as an alternative to existing methods for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

It is, however, unknown which features of the serological response may affect clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. We analyzed 983 longitudinal plasma samples from 79 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 175 SARS-CoV-2-infected outpatients and asymptomatic individuals. Within this cohort, 25 patients died of their illness. Higher ratios of IgG antibodies targeting S1 or RBD domains of spike compared to nucleocapsid antigen were seen in outpatients who had mild illness versus severely ill patients. Plasma antibody increases correlated with decreases in viral RNAemia, but antibody responses in acute illness were insufficient to predict inpatient outcomes. Pseudovirus neutralization assays and a scalable ELISA measuring antibodies blocking RBD-ACE2 interaction were well correlated with patient IgG titers Outpatient and asymptomatic individuals' SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, including IgG, progressively decreased during observation up to five months post-infection.

Establishment of a diverse antibody repertoire occurs by rearrangement of germline DNA at the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain loci to encode the membrane-bound form of antibodies, the B cell antigen receptor. Little is known about the B cells and antigen receptors stimulated by the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Here we show that the human B cell compartment in patients with diagnostically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and clinical COVID-19 is rapidly altered with the early recruitment of B cells expressing a limited subset of V genes, and extensive activation of IgG and IgA subclasses without significant somatic mutation. We detect expansion of B cell clones as well as convergent antibodies with highly similar sequences across SARS-CoV-2 patients, highlighting stereotyped nave responses to this virus. A shared convergent B cell clonotype in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was previously seen in patients with SARS. These findings offer molecular insights into shared features of human B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 and other zoonotic spillover coronaviruses.

The duration, persistence, and decay of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) in the proviral reservoir is not well defined.Methods: Participants with virologic failure of EFV-based regimens and drug-resistant viremia with the K103N mutation in plasma ribonucleic acid (RNA) were identified from AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) studies A364 and A5095. These individuals received a second-line, boosted protease inhibitor-based regimen with suppression of viremia for up to10 years during long-term follow-up (median = 3.6 years; interquartile range, 2.1-6.9 years). Proviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells was sequenced to identify the persistence of DRM.Results: Twenty-eight participants from ACTG 364 and ACTG Sanger sequencing of DNA detected K103N as well as additional reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) mutations. Ultradeep sequencing confirmed persistence of K103N in 71% of participants with minimal decay over time. In an adjusted model including years since suppression, persistent proviral K103N was 2.6 times more likely (95% confidence interval, 1.0-6.4) per log10 higher human immunodeficiency virus RNA at EFV failure.Conclusions: Persistence of RTI mutations in proviral DNA after virologic failure has implications for the effectiveness of future drug regimens and the recycling of RTI drugs.

Despite the availability of an effective vaccine, YFV continues to cause disease throughout regions where it is endemic, including intermittent large outbreaks among undervaccinated populations. A number of diagnostic methods and assays have been described for the detection of YFV infection, including viral culture, molecular testing, serology, and antigen detection. Commercial diagnostics are not widely available, and testing is generally performed at a small number of reference laboratories. The goal of this article, therefore, is to review available clinical diagnostics for YFV, which may not be familiar to many practitioners outside areas where it is endemic. Additionally, we identify gaps in our current knowledge about YF that pertain to diagnosis and describe interventions that may improve YFV detection.

To decrease the overuse of antibiotics, molecular diagnostics systems are needed that can rapidly identify pathogens in a clinical sample and determine the presence of mutations that confer drug resistance at the point of care. We developed a fully integrated, miniaturized semiconductor biochip and closed-tube detection chemistry that performs multiplex nucleic acid amplification and sequence analysis. The approach had a high dynamic range of quantification of microbial load and was able to perform comprehensive mutation analysis on up to 1,000 sequences or strands simultaneously in <2 h. We detected and quantified multiple DNA and RNA respiratory viruses in clinical samples with complete concordance to a commercially available test. We also identified 54 drug-resistance-associated mutations that were present in six genes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, all of which were confirmed by next-generation sequencing.

Of all febrile cases in the study, DENV-positive C cases accounted for an estimated 52.0% of patients with DENV viremia at presentation. Compared with previously detected, symptomatic dengue cases, DENV-positive C cases were significantly less likely to develop long-lasting humoral immune responses to DENV, as measured in healthy annual serum samples (79.7% vs 47.8%; P < .001). Humoral immunity was associated with viral load at presentation: 40 of 43 patients (93.0%) with a viral load 7.0 log10 copies/mL serum developed the expected rise in anti-DENV antibodies in annual samples versus 13 of 68 (19.1%) patients with a viral load below this level (P < .001).Antibody responses to DENV-positive C cases differ from responses to classic symptomatic dengue. These findings have important implications for DENV transmission modeling, immunology, and epidemiologic surveillance.

In contrast to IgM cross-reactivity, IgG and IgA antibodies against ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen were specific to ZIKV infection, and IgG avidity revealed recent ZIKV infection and past DENV-2 infection in patients in dengue-endemic regions. This assay could enable specific diagnosis of ZIKV infection over other flaviviral infections. View details for [DOI View (DENV) cocirculate in Nicaragua. In this study, we sought to compare the quantified viremia and clinical presentation of patients infected with 1 or more of these viruses.Acute-phase serum samples from 346 patients with a suspected arboviral illness were tested using a multiplex real-time reverse-transcription polymerase reaction for ZIKV, CHIKV, and DENV. Viremia was quantitated for each detected virus, and clinical information from request forms submitted with each sample was recorded.A total of 263 patients tested positive for 1 or more viruses: 192 patients tested positive for a single virus (monoinfections) and 71 patients tested positive for 2 or all 3 viruses (coinfections). Quantifiable viremia was lower in ZIKV infections compared serum, respectively; P < .001 for both comparisons), and for each virus, mean viremia was significantly lower in coinfections than in monoinfections. Compared with patients with CHIKV or DENV, ZIKV patients were more likely to have a rash (P < .001) and less likely to be febrile (P < .05) or require hospitalization (P < .001). Among all patients, hospitalized cases had higher viremia than those who did not require hospitalization (7.1 vs 4.1 log10 copies/mL serum, respectively; P < .001).ZIKV, CHIKV, and DENV result in similar clinical presentations, and coinfections may be relatively common. Our findings illustrate the need for accurate, multiplex diagnostics for patient care and epidemiologic surveillance.

Current nucleic acid technologies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) rely on sample amplification and can suffer from inhibition. Here, we introduce a label-free genetic screening platform based on high quality (high-Q) factor silicon nanoantennas functionalized with nucleic acid fragments. Each high-Q nanoantenna exhibits average resonant quality factors of 2,200 in physiological buffer. We quantitatively detect two gene fragments, SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) and open reading frame 1b (ORF1b), with high-specificity via DNA hybridization. We also demonstrate femtomolar sensitivity in buffer and nanomolar sensitivity in spiked nasopharyngeal eluates within 5 minutes. Nanoantennas are patterned at densities of 160,000 devices per cm2, enabling future work on highly-multiplexed detection. Combined with advances in complex sample processing, our work provides a foundation for rapid, compact, and amplification-free molecular assays.

We sought to determine the diagnostic yield of aligning off-target reads incidentally obtained during targeted hematolymphoid next-generation sequencing to a large database of viral genomes to screen for viral sequences within tumor specimens.Alignment of off-target reads to viral genomes was performed using magicBLAST. Localization of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) RNA was confirmed by RNAScope in situ hybridization. Integration analysis was performed using Virus-Clip.Four cases of post-cardiac-transplant folliculotropic mycosis (PTCL) were positive in off-target reads for MCPyV DNA. Two of the four cases of posttransplant fMF and the case of PTCL showed localization of MCPyV RNA to malignant lymphocytes, whereas the remaining two cases of posttransplant fMF showed MCPyV RNA in keratinocytes.Our findings raise the question of whether MCPyV may play a role in rare cases of T-lymphoproliferative disorders, particularly in the skin and in the heavily immunosuppressed posttransplant setting.

We sought to elucidate whether our local community blood supply is at increased susceptibility for transmission of transfusion-associated HEV infections.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We screened 10,002 randomly selected donations over an 8-month period between 2017 and 2018 at the Stanford Blood Center for markers of HEV infection using commercial IgM/IgG serological tests and reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays (RT-qPCR). Donor demographic information, including gender, age, self-identified ethnicity, location of residence and recent travel, were obtained from the donor database and used to generate multivariate binary logistic regressions for risk factors of IgG seropositivity.RESULTS: A total of 10,002 blood donations from 7507 unique donors were screened, and there was no detectable HEV RNA by RT-qPCR. The overall seropositivity rate was 12.1% for IgG and 0.56% for IgM. Multivariate analysis of unique donors revealed a significantly higher risk of IgG seropositivity with increasing age, White/Asian ethnicities and residence in certain local counties.CONCLUSION: Although HEV IgG seroprevalence in the San Francisco Bay Area is consistent with ongoing infection, the screening of a large donor population did not identify any viraemic blood donors. While HEV is an underrecognized and emerging infection in other regions, there is no evidence to support routine blood screening for HEV in our local blood supply currently; however, periodic monitoring may still be required to assess the ongoing risk.

This study is a retrospective epidemiologic survey to estimate mpox prevalence.Samples obtained for sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing from April to September 2022 in the public hospital and clinic system of San Mateo County, California were screened for mpox virus (MPXV) using polymerase chain reaction.16/1,848 samples from 11/1,645 individuals were positive for MPXV by qPCR. 4/11 individuals with positive MPXV testing were cisgender women, 2 of whom were pregnant at the time of sample collection. Both deliveries were complicated by chorioamnionitis. Anorectal and oropharyngeal samples were the most likely to be positive for MPXV (4/60 anorectal samples and 4/66 oropharyngeal samples compared with 5/1,264 urine samples and 3/445 vaginal samples).Our study is one of the first epidemiologic surveys for MPXV infection outside of sexual health/STI clinic settings. Relatively high rates of MPXV from oropharyngeal and anorectal samples reinforces the importance of MPXV testing at various anatomic sites, particularly if patients are presenting with non-lesional symptoms (pharyngitis, proctitis). However, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet authorized non-lesional MPXV testing. The identification of MPXV in women in our cohort suggests that the rates of mpox in women may have previously been underestimated and highlights the risk of pregnancy complications associated with mpox.

Correlates of active replication include nucleocapsid antigen and virus minus-strand RNA.Qualitative agreement (CLIA) with minus-strand RNA was determined using 402 upper respiratory specimens from 323 patients previously tested using a laboratory-developed SARS-CoV-2 strand-specific RT-qPCR. Nucleocapsid antigen levels, minus-strand and plus-strand cycle threshold values, as well as virus culture, were used to evaluate discordant specimens. Receiver operating characteristic curves were also used to identify virus RNA thresholds for active replication, including values harmonized to the World Health Organization International Standard.Overall agreement was 92.0% [95% confidence interval (CI): was 90.6% (95% CI: 84.4 - and - 0.88). Discordant specimens of nucleocapsid antigen and minus-strand RNA. 84.8% (28/33) were negative by culture. Sensitivity-optimized plus-strand RNA thresholds for active replication were 31.6 cycles or 3.64 log10 IU/mL; resulting in 100.0% equivalently to minus-strand detection via strand-specific RT-qPCR, though these methods may overestimate replication-competent virus compared to culture. Careful implementation of biomarkers for actively replicating SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to inform infection control decision-making and patient management.

However, existing real-time PCR (qPCR) assays are limited by poor inter-laboratory reproducibility. This is a barrier to biomarker integration into staging systems and management. It was hypothesized that EBV digital PCR (dPCR) would have similar sensitivity but improved precision relative to qPCR. Using the WHO EBV standard and patient specimens, the NRG BamHI-W EBNA-1, and EBER targets were compared. Testing was conducted in the North American reference laboratory for the NRG-HN001 randomized trial. The EBV dPCR assays achieved similar performance compared with qPCR. Although dPCR does not require quantitation standards, different dPCR thresholding algorithms yielded significant qualitative and quantitative variation. This was most evident with low levels of EBV DNA. No-template droplet dPCR offered higher sensitivity, lower limit of blank, higher precision at low plasma EBV DNA levels (1500 IU/mL), and higher overall agreement with clinical specimens compared to single-copy qPCR/dPCR targets (EBNA-1/EBER). These data confirm the rationale for the use of the BamHI-W target to define prognostic thresholds, and indicate that both qPCR and dPCR methods harmonized to the WHO standard can provide the necessary analytical performance.

Acebilustat, a leukotriene B4 (LTB4) inhibitor, has potential to reduce inflammation and symptom duration.In a single-center trial spanning Delta and Omicron variants, outpatients were randomized to 100 mg of oral acebilustat or placebo for 28 days. Patients reported daily symptoms via electronic query through Day 28 with phone follow-up on Day 120 and collected nasal swabs on Days 1-10. The primary outcome was sustained symptom resolution to Day 28. Secondary 28-day outcomes included time to first symptom resolution, area under the curve (AUC) of longitudinal daily symptom scores; duration of viral shedding through Day 10; and symptoms on Day 120.Sixty participants were randomized to each study arm. At enrollment, median duration and number of symptoms were 4 (IQR 3-5) days and 9 (IQR 7-11) symptoms. Most patients (90%) were vaccinated with 73% having neutralizing antibodies. A minority (44%) of participants (35% in the acebilustat arm and 53% in placebo) had sustained symptom resolution at Day 28 (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.34-1.04, p = 0.07 favoring placebo). There was no difference in mean AUC of symptom scores over 28 days (difference in mean of AUC 9.4, 95% CI -42.1-60.9, p=0.72). Acebilustat did not impact viral shedding or symptoms at Day 120.Sustained symptoms through Day 28 were common in this low-risk population. Despite this, LTB4 antagonism with acebilustat did not shorten symptom duration in outpatients with COVID-19.

To identify the immune features and temporal dynamics underlying SD progression, we performed deep immune profiling by mass cytometry of PBMCs collected longitudinally from SD progressors (SDp) and uncomplicated dengue (D) patients. While D is characterized by early activation of innate immune responses, in SDp there is rapid expansion and activation of IgG-secreting plasma cells and memory and regulatory T cells. Concurrently, SDp, particularly children, demonstrate increased proinflammatory NK cells, inadequate expansion of CD16+ monocytes, and high expression of the FcR CD64 on myeloid cells, yet a signature of diminished antigen presentation. Syndrome-specific determinants include suppressed dendritic cell abundance in shock/hemorrhage versus enriched plasma cell expansion in organ impairment. This study reveals uncoordinated immune responses in SDp and provides insights into SD pathogenesis in humans with potential implications for prediction and treatment.

Most cases are mild, but some evolve into severe dengue (SD), with high lethality. Therefore, it is important to identify biomarkers of severe disease to improve outcomes and judiciously utilize resources.METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: One hundred forty-five confirmed dengue cases (median age, 42; range <1-91 years), enrolled from February 2018 to March 2020, were selected from an ongoing study of suspected arboviral infections in metropolitan Asuncion, Paraguay. Cases included dengue virus types 1, 2, and 4, and severity was categorized according to the 2009 World Health Organization guidelines. Testing for anti-dengue virus IgM and IgG and serum biomarkers (lipopolysaccharide binding sera in plate-based ELISAs; in addition, a multiplex ELISA platform was used to measure anti-dengue virus and anti-Zika virus IgM and IgG. Complete blood counts and chemistries were performed at the discretion of the care team. Age, gender, and pre-existing comorbidities were associated with SD vs. dengue with/without warning signs in logistic regression with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.07 (per year; 95% confidence interval, 1.03, 1.11), 0.20 (female; 0.05,0.77), and 2.09 (presence; 1.26, 3.48) respectively. In binary logistic regression, for every unit increase in anti-DENV IgG in the multiplex platform, odds of SD increased by 2.54 (1.19-5.42). Platelet count, lymphocyte percent, and elevated chymase were associated with SD in a combined logistic regression model with ORs of 0.99 (1,000/muL; 0.98,0.999), 0.92 (%; 0.86,0.98), and 1.17 (mg/mL; 1.03,1.33) respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Multiple, readily available factors were associated with SD in this population. These findings will aid in the early detection of potentially severe dengue cases and inform the development of new prognostics for use in acute-phase and serial samples from dengue cases.

Quantitation of HAdV DNA in peripheral blood is used to assess the risk of disseminated disease and to monitor response to therapy. The lower limit of detection, precision, and linearity of the semiautomated AltoStar adenovirus quantitative PCR (qPCR) was evaluated using reference HAdV-E4 in EDTA plasma and respiratory virus matrix. Qualitative and quantitative agreement was determined using 122 clinical EDTA plasma specimens previously tested using a laboratory-developed HAdV qPCR. The 95% lower limit of detection (LLOD) was 33IU/mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 10 to 56) for EDTA plasma and 188IU/mL (95% CI, 145 to 304) for respiratory swab matrix. In both matrices, the AltoStar HAdV qPCR was linear from 7.0 to 2.0 log10 IU/mL. For the clinical specimens, overall agreement was 96.7% (95% CI, 91.8 to 99.1), positive percent agreement was 95.5% (95% CI, 87.6 to 98.5), and negative percent agreement was 98.2% (95% CI, 88.5 to 99.7). Passing-Bablok analysis of specimens quantifiable by both methods revealed a regression line of Y=1.11 X+0.00; there was positive proportional bias (95% CI of the slope, 1.05 to 1.22) but no systematic bias (95% CI of the Y-intercept, -0.43 to 0.23) compared to the reference. The AltoStar platform provides accurate quantitation of HAdV DNA and provides a semiautomated option for the clinical monitoring of HAdV following transplantation. IMPORTANCE Accurate quantification of human adenovirus DNA in the peripheral blood plays a critical role in the management of adenovirus infections in transplant recipients. Many laboratories utilize in-house laboratory-based PCR assays for the quantification of human adenovirus, as there are few commercial options available. Here, we describe the analytical and clinical performance of the semiautomated AltoStar adenovirus quantitative PCR (Altona Diagnostics). This platform provides sensitive, precise, and accurate quantification of adenovirus DNA that is well suited for virological testing following transplantation. Prior to implementing a new quantitative test in the clinical laboratory, a rigorous evaluation is required to determine assay performance characteristics and to correlate results to current in-house methods of quantitation.

Serum EBV antibody and plasma EBV DNA testing methods were considered. Both approaches were found to have favorable performance characteristics and to be cost-effective in high-risk populations. In addition to endoscopy, use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate screen-positive individuals was found to increase the sensitivity of NPC detection with minimal impact on cost-effectiveness of the screening program.

Determination of outbreak etiologies in the context of a worldwide pandemic may provide useful information to guide public health strategies. The aim of this study was to identify pathogens associated with outpatient infectious conjunctivitis during the COVID-19 Delta surge.This prospective study was conducted from April 2021 to September 2021. All outpatients presenting to the Aravind Eye Center (Madurai, India) with signs and symptoms consistent with acute infectious conjunctivitis were eligible. Three swabs were obtained from each participant: one from each conjunctiva and one from the anterior nares. Samples were processed for metagenomic RNA deep sequencing (RNA-seq).Samples from 106 study participants were sequenced. The most common presenting symptoms were tearing (86%) and itching (71%). Preauricular lymphadenopathy was present in 38% of participants. 20% of participants had close contacts with similar symptoms. Systemic symptoms such as coughing, runny nose, vomiting or diarrhea were uncommonly reported. 60% of all participants used some medicated eye drops upon enrollment. 75% of study participants demonstrated infection with human adenovirus D (HAdV-D). 11% of conjunctivitis was associated with SARS-CoV-2. 15% had no definitive pathogen detected. 8% of all participants had codetection of more than one pathogen on RNA-seq.During the COVID-19 Delta surge in India, HAdV-D was the most common pathogen associated with infectious conjunctivitis. SARS-CoV-2 was the second most common associated pathogen. Seasonal surveillance may be necessary for the determination of emerging and reemerging pathogens responsible for infectious conjunctivitis.

There remains significant debate whether SARS-CoV-2 can present as a primary conjunctivitis. The aim of this study was to identify pathogens associated with outpatient infectious conjunctivitis during the COVID-19 Delta surge.METHODS: This prospective study was conducted in the spring and summer months of 2021. 106 patients with acute conjunctivitis who presented to the Aravind Eye Center in Madurai, India were included. One anterior nasal swab and one conjunctival swab of each eye were obtained for each enrolled patient. Samples were subsequently processed for unbiased metagenomic RNA deep sequencing (RNA-seq). Outcomes included clinical findings and codetection of other pathogens with SARS-CoV-2 in patients with conjunctivitis.RESULTS: Among the 13 patients identified with human coronavirus RNA fragments in their swabs, 6 patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection, 5 patients had coinfections of SARS-CoV-2 and human adenovirus (HAdV), 1 patient had a coinfection with human coronavirus OC43 and HAdV, and 1 a coinfection of Vittaforma corneae and SARS-CoV-2. 30% had bilateral disease and symptoms on presentation. Petechial hemorrhage was noted in 33% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. No patients with SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-2 and HAdV infections had subepithelial infiltrates on presentation. All patients denied systemic symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: Among the patients presented with conjunctivitis associated with human coronavirus infection, over 50% of the patients had co-infections with other circulating pathogens, suggesting the public-health importance of broad pathogen testing and surveillance in the outpatient conjunctivitis population.

Amulti-omicapproach represents a powerful tool to examine risk across multi-ancestry genomes. We leverage a pandemic tracking strategy in which we sequence viral and host genomes and transcriptomes from nasopharyngeal swabs of 1049 individuals (736 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 313 SARS-CoV-2 negative) and integrate them with digital phenotypes from electronic health records from a diverse catchment area in Northern California. Genome-wideassociation disaggregated by admixture mapping reveals novel COVID-19-severity-associated regions containing previously reported markers of neurologic, pulmonary and viral disease susceptibility. Phylodynamic tracking of consensus viral genomes reveals no association with disease severity or inferred ancestry. Summary data from multiomic investigation reveals metagenomic and HLA associations with severe COVID-19. The wealth of data available from residual nasopharyngeal swabs in combination with clinical data abstracted automatically at scale highlights a powerful strategy for pandemic tracking, and reveals distinct epidemiologic, genetic, and biological associations for those at the highest risk.

Rapid deployment of non-invasive therapeutic avenues capable of preventing infection by all SARS-CoV-2 variants could complement current vaccination efforts and help turn the tide on the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we describe a novel therapeutic strategy targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA using locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides (LNA ASOs). We identify an LNA ASO binding to the 5' leader sequence of SARS-CoV-2 that disrupts a highly conserved stem-loop structure with nanomolar efficacy in preventing viral replication in human cells. Daily intranasal administration of this LNA ASO in the COVID-19 mouse model potently suppresses viral replication (>80-fold) in the lungs of infected mice. We find that the LNA ASO is efficacious in countering all SARS-CoV-2 \"variants of concern\" tested both in vitro and in vivo. Hence, inhaled LNA ASOs targeting SARS-CoV-2 represents a promising therapeutic approach to reduce or prevent transmission and decrease severity of COVID-19 in infected individuals. LNA ASOs are chemically stable and can be flexibly modified to target different viral RNA sequences and could be stockpiled for future coronavirus pandemics.

Screening programs can detect most NPC cases at an early stage, but existing EBV diagnostics are limited by false positives and low positive predictive value (PPV), leading to excess screening endoscopies, MRIs, and repeated testing. Recent EBV genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggest that EBV BALF2 variants account for more than 80% of attributable NPC risk. We therefore hypothesized that high-risk BALF2 variants could be readily detected in plasma for once-lifetime screening triage.We designed and validated a multiplex genotyping assay to detect EBV BALF2 polymorphisms in human plasma. Targeted next-generation sequencing was used to validate this assay, conduct association studies with clinical phenotype, and longitudinally genotype plasma to assess within-host haplotype stability. We examined the association between NPC and BALF2 haplotypes in a large non-endemic population and three prior EBV GWAS. Finally, we estimated NPC mortality reduction, resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness of BALF2 variant-informed screening using concordance with sequencing in a cohort of 24 NPC cases and 155 non-NPC controls. BALF2 haplotype was highly associated with NPC in this non-endemic population (I613V: odds ratio [OR] 7.9; V317M: OR 178.8). No other candidate BALF2 polymorphisms were significantly associated with NPC or hematologic disorders. Longitudinal genotyping revealed 97.8% within-host haplotype concordance, indicative of lifelong latent infection. In a meta-analysis of 755 NPC cases and 981 non-NPC controls, BALF2 I613V and V317M were significantly associated with NPC in both endemic and non-endemic populations. Modeled variant-informed screening strategies achieved a 46% relative increase in PPV with 7% decrease in effective screening sensitivity, thereby averting nearly half of screening endoscopies/MRIs among endemic populations in east/southeast Asia.EBV BALF2 haplotypes are temporally stable within hosts and can be readily detected in plasma via an inexpensive multiplex genotyping assay that offers near-perfect non-endemic populations, I613V and V317M were highly associated with NPC and could be leveraged to develop variant-informed screening programs that mitigate false positives with small reductions in screening sensitivity.

A systematic understanding of host factors influencing viral infection is critical to elucidate SARS-CoV-2-host interactions and the progression of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR knockout and activation screens in human lung epithelial cells with endogenous expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We uncovered proviral and antiviral factors across highly interconnected host pathways, including clathrin transport, inflammatory signaling, cell-cycle regulation, and transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. We further identified mucins, a family of high molecular weight glycoproteins, as a prominent viral restriction network that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in murine models. These mucins also inhibit infection of diverse respiratory viruses. This functional landscape of SARS-CoV-2 host factors provides a physiologically relevant starting point for new host-directed therapeutics and highlights airway mucins as a host defense mechanism.

Calibration to the First WHO International Standard for SARS-CoV-2 RNA may improve quantitative inter-assay agreement.METHODS: WHO standard was tested using four emergency use authorized RT-qPCRs to generate calibration curves and evaluate Ct of and a laboratory-developed test targeting E [LDT (E)], was assessed using 93 positive upper respiratory samples. Platform (target) pairs were compared via Bland-Altman analysis and Passing-Bablok regression.RESULTS: Ct values with the WHO standard were comparable across platforms and targets, except Xpert (N2) for which the mean difference was a median of 3.68 cycles (Interquartile Range, IQR=3.23 to 3.76 cycles) greater than other platform (target) pairs. Using clinical samples, the mean difference of Xpert (N2) to LDT (E) was 3.64 cycles (95% Confidence Interval, CI =1.51 to 5.76). After calibration, the mean difference of 0.08 log10 to 1.07, 95% CI intercept=0.28 to 0.42).CONCLUSIONS: Calibration to the WHO standard resulted in the harmonization of two RT-qPCR tests, whereas analysis by Ct value alone may have led to erroneous quantitation. Harmonization to the WHO standard has the potential to improve the generalizability of clinical associations with SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels.

However, which factors influence development of long-term symptoms, how symptoms vary across ethnic groups, and whether long-term symptoms correlate with biomarkers are points that remain elusive.METHODSAdult SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription PCR-positive (RT-PCR-positive) patients were recruited at Stanford from March 2020 to February 2021. Study participants were seen for in-person visits at diagnosis and every 1-3 months for up to 1 year after diagnosis; they completed symptom surveys and underwent blood draws and nasal swab collections at each visit.RESULTSOur cohort (n = 617) ranged from asymptomatic to critical COVID-19 infections. In total, 40% of participants reported at least 1 symptom associated with COVID-19 six months after diagnosis. Median time from diagnosis to first resolution of all symptoms was 44 days; median time from diagnosis to sustained symptom resolution with no recurring symptoms for 1 month or longer was 214 days. Anti-nucleocapsid IgG level in the first week after positive RT-PCR test and history of lung disease were associated with time to sustained symptom resolution. COVID-19 disease severity, ethnicity, age, sex, and remdesivir use did not affect time to sustained symptom resolution.CONCLUSIONWe found that all disease severities had a similar risk of developing post-COVID-19 syndrome in an ethnically diverse population.

We previously reported that AAK1, BIKE and GAK, members of the Numb-associated kinase family, control intracellular trafficking of multiple RNA viruses during viral entry and assembly/egress. Here, using both genetic and pharmacological approaches, we probe the functional relevance of NAKs for SARS-CoV-2 infection. siRNA-mediated depletion of AAK1, BIKE, GAK, and STK16, the fourth member of the NAK family, suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung epithelial cells. Both known and novel small molecules with potent AAK1/BIKE, GAK or STK16 activity suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, combination treatment with the approved anti-cancer drugs, sunitinib and erlotinib, with potent anti-AAK1/BIKE and GAK activity, respectively, demonstrated synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Time-of-addition experiments revealed that pharmacological inhibition of AAK1 and BIKE suppressed viral entry as well as late stages of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Lastly, suppression of NAKs expression by siRNAs inhibited entry of both wild type and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. These findings provide insight into the roles of NAKs in SARS-CoV-2 infection and establish a proof-of-principle that pharmacological inhibition of NAKs can be potentially used as a host-targeted approach to treat SARS-CoV-2 with potential implications to other coronaviruses.

Humoral and cellular immune responses were measured by anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG ELISA (anti-S1 IgG) and IGRA, booster vaccination.RESULTS: 496 immunosuppressed patients (54% female; median age 50 years) were included. 62% (261/419) of patients had positive anti-S1 IgG and 71% (277/389) had positive IGRA after primary vaccination, with 20% of patients having a positive IGRA only. Following booster, 69% (81/118) had positive anti-S1 IgG and 73% (91/124) had positive IGRA. Factors associated with low humoral response rates after primary vaccination included lymphoma (P=0.004); those associated with low cellular response rates included S1P receptor modulators (P<0.001) and mycophenolate (P<0.001). Of patients who had poor humoral response to primary vaccination, 35% (18/52) developed a significantly higher response after the booster. Only 5% (2/42) of patients developed a significantly higher cellular response to the booster dose compared to primary vaccination.CONCLUSIONS: Humoral and cellular response rates to primary and booster SARS-CoV-2 vaccination differ among immunosuppressed patient groups. Clinical testing of cellular immunity is important in monitoring vaccine response in vulnerable populations.

Older adults were experiencing more severe disease compared to children and were prioritized by vaccination efforts. While biologic therapies and vaccinations were implemented, there were changes in public health restrictions with subsequent surges resulting in more infected children. During these surges there was a rise of different SARS-CoV-2 variants with the dominant variant initially alpha (B.1.1.7 and other Pango lineages) and epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429) in early 2021 and a dramatic shift to delta (B.1.617.2 and other Pango lineages) by mid-summer 2021. In this study we aimed to characterize the clinical severity and host factors associated with disease by SARS-CoV-2 variant and evaluate if there are differences in disease severity by circulating variant. We retrospectively included all individuals 0-25 years of age who presented to our center and had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, SARS-CoV-2 variant mutation testing, and documented clinical notes from 1 January 2021 through 31 December 2021. We identified 745 individuals who met inclusion criteria and found the delta variant was associated with severe/critical disease compared to the other variants studied. The results of the model showed that underlying respiratory disease and diabetes were risk factors for progression to severe disease. These insights are important when evaluating public health measures and treatment options for children as more variants arise.

Here we demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas13d offers a broad-spectrum antiviral (BSA) to inhibit many SARS-CoV-2 variants and diverse human coronavirus strains with >99% reduction of the viral titer. We show that Cas13d-mediated coronavirus inhibition is dependent on the crRNA cellular spatial colocalization with Cas13d and target viral RNA. Cas13d can significantly enhance the therapeutic effects of diverse small molecule drugs against coronaviruses for prophylaxis or treatment purposes, and the best combination reduced viral titer by over four orders of magnitude. Using lipid nanoparticle-mediated RNA delivery, we demonstrate that the Cas13d system can effectively treat infection from multiple variants of coronavirus, including Omicron SARS-CoV-2, in human primary airway epithelium air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures. Our study establishes CRISPR-Cas13 as a BSA which is highly complementary to existing vaccination and antiviral treatment strategies.

We sampled wastewater from three nested locations with different sized populations within the same sewer network at a university campus and quantified SARS-CoV-2 RNA using reverse transcriptase droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR). SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations and/or concentrations normalized by PMMoV were positively associated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases for both the sewershed level and the subsewershed level. We also used an antigen-based assay to detect the nucleocapsid (N) antigen from SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples at the sewershed level. The N antigen was regularly detected at the sewershed level, but the results were not associated with either laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases or SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations. The results of this study indicate that wastewater monitoring based on quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using PCR-based methods is associated with COVID-19 cases at multiple geographic scales within the subsewershed level and can serve to aid the public health response.

Although detailed genetic characterization requires whole-genome sequencing (WGS), targeted nucleic acid amplification tests can serve a complementary role in clinical settings, as they are more rapid and accessible than sequencing in most laboratories. We designed and analytically validated multiplex reaction 1 and del69-70, K417N, and T478K in reaction 2. This assay had 95 to 100% agreement with WGS for 502 upper respiratory tract swab samples collected between 26 April 2021 and 1 August 2021, consisting of 43 Alpha, 2 Beta, 20 Gamma, 378 Delta, and 59 non-VOC infections. Validation in a separate group of 230 WGS-confirmed Omicron variant samples collected in December 2021 and January 2022 demonstrated 100% agreement. This RT-qPCR-based approach can be implemented in clinical laboratories already performing SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests to assist in local epidemiological surveillance and clinical decision-making.

Furthermore, most reports of fecal RNA shedding do not correlate these findings with GI symptoms.6.We analyze the dynamics of fecal RNA shedding up to 10 months after COVID-19 diagnosis in 113 individuals with mild to moderate disease. We also correlate shedding with disease symptoms.Fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected in 49.2% [95% Confidence interval = 38.2%-60.3%] of participants within the first week after diagnosis. Whereas there was no ongoing oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in subjects at and after 4 months, 12.7% [8.5%-18.4%] of participants continued to shed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the feces at 4 months after diagnosis and 3.8% [2.0%-7.3%] shed at 7 months. Finally, we find that GI symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting) are associated with fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.The extended presence of viral RNA in feces, but not respiratory samples, along with the association of fecal viral RNA shedding with GI symptoms suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infects the GI tract, and that this infection can be prolonged in a subset of individuals with COVID-19.

Clinical warning signs for SD manifest late in the disease course and are nonspecific, leading to missed cases and excess hospital burden. Better SD prognostics are urgently needed.METHODS: We integrated 11 public datasets profiling the blood transcriptome of 365 dengue patients of all ages and from seven countries, encompassing biological, clinical, and technical heterogeneity. We performed an iterative multi-cohort analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between non-severe patients and SD progressors. Using only these DEGs, we trained an XGBoost machine learning model on public data to predict progression to SD. All model parameters were \"locked\" prior to validation in an independent, prospectively enrolled cohort of 377 dengue patients in Colombia. We measured expression of the DEGs in whole blood samples collected upon presentation, prior to SD progression. We then compared the accuracy of the locked XGBoost model and clinical warning signs in predicting SD.RESULTS: We identified eight SD-associated DEGs in the public datasets and built an 8-gene XGBoost model that accurately predicted SD progression in the independent validation cohort with 86.4% (95% CI 68.2-100) sensitivity and 79.7% (95% CI 75.5-83.9) specificity. Given the 5.8% proportion of SD cases in this cohort, the 8-gene model had a positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV) of 20.9% (95% CI 16.7-25.6) and 99.0% (95% CI 97.7-100.0), respectively. Compared to clinical warning signs at presentation, which had 77.3% (95% CI 58.3-94.1) sensitivity and 39.7% (95% CI 34.7-44.9) specificity, the 8-gene model led to an 80% reduction in the number needed to predict (NNP) from 25.4 to 5.0. Importantly, the 8-gene model accurately predicted subsequent SD in the first three days post-fever onset and up to three days prior to SD progression.CONCLUSIONS: The 8-gene XGBoost model, trained on heterogeneous public datasets, accurately predicted progression to SD in a large, independent, prospective cohort, including during the early febrile stage when SD prediction remains clinically difficult. The model has potential to be translated to a point-of-care prognostic assay to reduce dengue morbidity and mortality without overwhelming limited healthcare resources.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a time and symptom-based duration of isolation for the presumed infectious period. The guidance to avoid retesting of asymptomatic patients in the 90days following a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is because of the possibility of detection of non-infectious viral shedding. When to reschedule asymptomatic patients who test RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 preoperatively is of considerable debate, both from the perspective of ensuring a patient's full preoperative fitness, as well as reducing the risk of viral transmission within the hospital. We describe the novel perioperative use of a strand-specific assay to detect minus strand ribonucleic acid (RNA) in a clinical decision-making algorithm to determine optimal timing of elective surgery after a patient tests RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. This is the first description in the literature of an attempt to further stratify patients who repeatedly test positive for SARS-CoV-2 into infectious versus non-infectious for perioperative planning.

We aimed to estimate and characterize the prevalence and incidence of COVID-19 in a US HCW cohort and to identify risk factors associated with infection.METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal cohort study of HCWs at 3 Bay Area medical centers using serial surveys and SARS-CoV-2 viral and orthogonal serological testing, including measurement of neutralizing antibodies. We estimated baseline prevalence and cumulative incidence of COVID-19. We performed multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to estimate associations of baseline factors with incident infections and evaluated the impact of time-varying exposures on time to COVID-19 using marginal structural models.RESULTS: 2435 HCWs contributed 768 person years of follow-up time. We identified 21/2435 individuals with prevalent infection, resulting in a baseline prevalence of 0.86% (95% CI, 0.53% to 1.32%). We identified 70/2414 (2.9%) incident infections yielding a cumulative incidence rate of 9.11 cases per 100 person years (95% CI 7.11 to 11.52). Community contact with a known COVID-19 case most strongly correlated with increased hazard for infection (HR 8.1, 95% CI, 3.8, 17.5). High-risk work-related exposures (i.e., breach in protective measures) drove an association between work exposure and infection (HR 2.5, 95% CI, 1.3-4.8). More cases were identified in HCW when community case rates were high.CONCLUSION: We observed modest COVID-19 incidence despite consistent exposure at work. Community contact was strongly associated with infections but contact at work was not unless accompanied by high-risk exposure.

SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs, including bamlanivimab and casirivimab-imdevimab, received emergency use authorization in the United States in November 2020 for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 disease.Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 27 kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 between July 2020 and February 2021 who were treated with bamlanivimab or casirivimab-imdevimab and immunosuppression reduction. We additionally identified 13 kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 who had mild to moderate disease at presentation, who did not receive mAbs, and had SARS-CoV-2 serology testing available.Results: There were no deaths or graft failures in either group. Both infusions were well tolerated. Four of the 27 patients treated with mAbs required hospitalization due to COVID-19. Four of 13 patients who did not receive mAbs required hospitalization due to COVID-19. Patients who received mAbs demonstrated measurable anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor blocking activity at the highest level detectable at 90 days postinfusion, whereas ACE2 blocking activity acquired from natural immunity in the mAb-untreated group was weak.Conclusions: Bamlanivimab and casirivimab-imdevimab combined with immunosuppression reduction were well tolerated and associated with favorable clinical outcomes in kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 IGRA was applied in contacts of households with index cases. Freshly collected blood in the lithium heparin tube was left unstimulated, stimulated with a SARS-CoV-2 peptide pool, and stimulated with mitogen.The overall sensitivity and specificity of IGRA were post-infection (P<0.01). The IFN- response remained relatively robust at 10 months post-infection (3.8 vs. 1.3 IU/mL, respectively). In 14 households, IGRA showed a positivity rate 43.5% (10/23) in index cases and contacts, respectively, exhibiting a difference of +50% (95% CI +25.4-+74.6) and +21.7% (95% CI, or IgG was in 100% and 73.9% (17/23) of contacts.The SARS-CoV-2 IGRA is a useful clinical diagnostic tool for assessing cell-mediated immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

The research consisted of quantitative data collection efforts: (1) demographic data collected, (2) student sample self-collection error rates, and (3) student sample self-collection time durations. Students were enrolled in a hybrid learning model, a teaching model in which students were taught in person and online, with students having the option to attend virtually as needed. Data were collected under waiver of consent from students participating in weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing.Errors over time for self-collection of nasal swabs such as contaminated swabs and inadequate or shallow swabbing; time taken for sample collection.Of 296 participants, 148 (50.0%) were boys and 148 (50.0%) were girls. A total of 87 participants (29.2%) identified as Asian; 2 (0.6%), Black or African White; 87 (29.2%), multiracial; and 6 (2.0%), other. The median school grade was fourth grade. From September 2020 to March 2021, a total of 4203 samples were obtained from 221 students on a weekly basis, while data on error rates were collected. Errors occurred in 2.7% (n=107; 95% CI,2.2%-3.2%) of student encounters, with the highest rate occurring on the first day of testing (20 [10.2%]). There was an overall decrease in error rates over time. From April to June 2021, a total of 2021 samples were obtained from 296 students on a weekly basis while data on encounter lengths were collected. Between April and June 2021, 193 encounters were timed. The mean duration of each encounter was 70 seconds (95% CI,66.4-73.7 seconds).Mastery of self-collected lower nasal swabs is possible for children 5 years and older. Testing duration can be condensed once students gain proficiency in testing procedures. Scalability for larger schools is possible if consideration is given to the resource-intensive nature of the testing and the setting's weather patterns.

We investigated whether antibodies stimulated by mRNA vaccination (BNT162b2), including third-dose boosting, differ from those generated by infection or adenoviral (ChAdOx1-S and Gam-COVID-Vac) or inactivated viral (BBIBP-CorV) vaccines. We analyzed human lymph nodes after infection or mRNA vaccination for correlates of serological differences. Antibody breadth against viral variants is lower after infection compared with all vaccines evaluated but improves over several months. Viral variant infection elicits variant-specific antibodies, but prior mRNA vaccination imprints serological responses toward Wuhan-Hu-1 rather than variant antigens. In contrast to disrupted germinal centers (GCs) in lymph nodes during infection, mRNA vaccination stimulates robust GCs containing vaccine mRNA and spike antigen up to 8weeks postvaccination in some cases. SARS-CoV-2 antibody specificity, breadth, and maturation are affected by imprinting from exposure history and distinct histological and antigenic contexts in infection compared with vaccination.

This information may help in clinical management of this vulnerable patient group.OBJECTIVE: To assess humoral and T-cell immune responses after two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in patients with PIDs and functional B-cell defects.METHODS: A double-center retrospective review of patients with PID who completed COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and who had humoral responses assessed through SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG antibody levels with reflex assessment of the antibody to block RBD binding to ACE2 (hereafter referred to as ACE2 receptor blocking activity, as a surrogate test for neutralization) and T-cell response evaluated by an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). Immunization reactogenicity was also reviewed.RESULTS: A total of 33 patients with humoral defect were evaluated. 69.6% received BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) and 30.3% received mRNA-1273 (Moderna). The mRNA vaccines were generally well tolerated without severe reactions. The IGRA was positive in 77.4% of our patients (24 of 31). About half of our subjects (16 of 33) had detectable RBD-specific IgG responses but only two of these 16 subjects had an ACE2 receptor blocking activity level of >50%.CONCLUSION: Vaccination of this cohort of PID patients with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines was safe and cellular immunity was stimulated in a majority. However, antibody responses to the spike protein RBD were less consistent, and, when detected, was not effective at ACE2 blocking.CLINICAL IMPLICATION: mRNA vaccination may be less effective at preventing acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 in our cohort of PID patients with functional B-cell defects. The Induction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific T-cell immunity by vaccination might help reduce the severity of disease in these patients.

We collected plasma specimens in July 2021 from 196 Mongolian participants fully vaccinated with one of four COVID-19 vaccines: Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Sputnik V, and Sinopharm. Functional antibody testing with a panel of nine SARS-CoV-2 viral variant receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins revealed marked differences in vaccine responses, with low antibody levels and RBD-ACE2 blocking activity stimulated by the Sinopharm and Sputnik V vaccines in comparison to the AstraZeneca or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines. The Alpha variant caused 97% of infections in Mongolia in June and early July 2021. Individuals who recover from SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination achieve high antibody titers in most cases. These data suggest that public health interventions such as vaccine boosting, potentially with more potent vaccine types, may be needed to control COVID-19 in Mongolia and worldwide.

NP were taken at baseline, 1-hour post-PVP-I spray (2 sprays/nostril), and 3days post-PVP-I spray (20 sprays/nostril). Symptom and adverse event questionnaires were completed at baseline, day 3, and day 5. University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Tests (UPSIT) were completed at baseline and day 30.RESULTS: Mean cycle threshold (Ct) values increased over time in all groups, indicating declining viral loads, with no statistically significant difference noted in the rate of change between placebo and PVP-I groups. 2.0% PVP-I group showed statistically significant improvement in all symptom categories, however also reported a high rate of nasal burning. Olfaction via UPSIT showed improvement by at least one category in all groups. There were no hospitalizations or mortalities within 30days of study enrollment.CONCLUSION: Saline and low concentration PVP-I nasal sprays are well tolerated. Similar reductions in SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal viral load were seen over time in all groups. All treatment groups showed improvement in olfaction over 30days. These data suggest that dilute versions of PVP-I nasal spray are safe for topical use in the nasal cavity, but that PVP-I does not demonstrate virucidal activity in COVID-19 positive outpatients.

Current nucleic acid technologies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), next-generation sequencing (NGS), and DNA microarrays rely on fluorescence and absorbance, necessitating sample amplification or replication and leading to increased processing time and cost. Here, we introduce a label-free genetic screening platform based on high quality (high-Q) factor silicon nanoantennas functionalized with monolayers of nucleic acid fragments. Each nanoantenna exhibits substantial electromagnetic field enhancements with sufficiently localized fields to ensure isolation from neighboring resonators, enabling dense biosensor integration. We quantitatively detect complementary target sequences using DNA hybridization simultaneously for arrays of sensing elements patterned at densities of 160,000 pixels per cm$^2$. In physiological buffer, our nanoantennas exhibit average resonant quality factors of 2,200, allowing detection of two gene fragments, SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) and open reading frame 1b (ORF1b), down to femtomolar concentrations. We also demonstrate high specificity sensing in clinical nasopharyngeal eluates within 5 minutes of sample introduction. Combined with advances in biomarker isolation from complex samples (e.g., mucus, blood, wastewater), our work provides a foundation for rapid, compact, amplification-free and high throughput multiplexed genetic screening assays spanning medical diagnostics to environmental monitoring.

This study aimed to determine the frequency, duration, and concentration of nucleocapsid antigen in plasma and its association with COVID-19 severity.METHODS: We utilized an ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence immunoassay targeting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen to evaluate 777 plasma samples from 104 individuals with COVID-19. We compared plasma antigen to respiratory nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) in 74 individuals with COVID-19 from samples collected 1day of diagnostic respiratory NAAT, and in 52 SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals. We used Kruskal-Wallis tests, multivariable logistic regression, and mixed-effects modeling to evaluate whether plasma antigen concentration was associated with disease severity.RESULTS: Plasma antigen had 91.9% (95% CI 83.2-97.0%) clinical sensitivity and 94.2% (84.1-98.8%) clinical specificity. Antigen-negative plasma samples belonged to patients with later respiratory cycle thresholds (Ct) when compared with antigen-positive plasma samples. Median plasma antigen concentration (log10 fg/mL) was 5.4 (IQR 3.9-6.0) in outpatients, 6.0 (5.4-6.5) in inpatients, and 6.6 (6.1-7.2) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. In models adjusted for age, sex, diabetes, and hypertension, plasma antigen concentration at diagnosis was associated with ICU admission (OR 2.8 [95% CI 1.2-6.2], P=.01), but not with non-ICU hospitalization. Rate of antigen decrease was not associated with disease severity.CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 plasma nucleocapsid antigen exhibited comparable diagnostic performance to upper respiratory NAAT, especially among those with late respiratory Ct. In addition to currently available tools, antigenemia may facilitate patient triage to optimize intensive care utilization.

Compared to controls, cases reported significantly more patient contact time. Cases were also significantly more likely to have performed airway procedures on the index patient, particularly placing the patient on high flow nasal cannula, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) (OR=11.6; 95% CI=1.7-132.1).DISCUSSION: This study highlights the risk of nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 from patients who become infectious midway into their hospitalization. Our findings also reinforce the importance of patient contact and aerosol-generating procedures as key risk factors for HCP infection with SARS-CoV-2.CONCLUSIONS: Re-testing patients for SARS-CoV-2 after admission in suspicious cases and using N95 masks for all aerosol-generating procedures regardless of initial patient SARS-CoV-2 test results can help reduce the risk of SARS-COV-2 transmission to HCP.

We investigated the use of liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/Q-TOF) combined with machine learning for the diagnosis of influenza infection.METHODS: We analyzed nasopharyngeal swab samples by LC/Q-TOF to identify distinct metabolic signatures for diagnosis of acute illness. Machine learning models were performed for classification, followed by Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis to analyze feature importance and for biomarker discovery.FINDINGS: A total of 236 samples were tested in the discovery phase by LC/Q-TOF, including 118 positive samples (40 influenza A 2009 H1N1, 39 influenza H3 and 39 influenza B) as well as 118 age and sex-matched negative controls with acute respiratory illness. Analysis showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 1.00 (95% confidence interval 0.96 (95% CI 0.81, 0.99). The metabolite most strongly associated with differential classification was pyroglutamic acid. Independent validation of a biomarker signature based on the top 20 differentiating ion features was performed in a prospective cohort of 96 symptomatic individuals including 48 positive samples (24 influenza A 2009 H1N1, 5 influenza H3 and 19 influenza B) and 48 negative samples. Testing performed using a clinically-applicable targeted approach, liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass AUC of 1.00 (95% CI 0.93, 1.00). Limitations include lack of sample suitability assessment, and need to validate these findings in additional patient populations.INTERPRETATION: This metabolomic approach has potential for diagnostic applications in infectious diseases testing, including other respiratory viruses, and may eventually be adapted for point-of-care testing.

Many NAATs, which use reverse-transcription real-time PCR (RT-PCR), are clinically validated, technically validated, and authorized by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to be interpreted qualitatively as \"detected\" (positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA) or \"not detected\" (negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA). As of this writing there are over 250 SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic tests that have obtained emergency use authorization from the FDA. The primary results generated by RT-PCR are fluorescent light emissions; serial detection of this fluorescence is plotted and the amplification curves visualized. Positive or negative interpretation depends on whether or not the curve exceeds a specified signal threshold. Part of the resulting process includes determination of the number of cycles needed before the fluorescent signal crosses this threshold (Ct value). In general, the more viral RNA in the initial specimen, the fewer the number of amplification cycles required to generate a positive signal; thus, the lower the Ct value, the higher the viral burden in the primary sample. Though all current SARS-CoV-2 NAATs are authorized only for qualitative interpretation, as of 10 December 2020, the FDA explicitly states that the Ct value results may be reported by the clinical laboratory in addition to the qualitative interpretation. Throughout the pandemic, many scientists, physicians, politicians, and public citizens have attempted to emphasize the importance (or unimportance) of certain pandemic-related interventions, mitigation strategies, the disease itself, and testing approaches. Some have advocated that a specific variable is most important in a testing approach and should be maximized to the potential detriment of the others: analytical sensitivity and specificity, cost, turnaround time, sample type, or accessibility of collection. If the truth was obvious, then there would be little debate, but the debate has been important and earnest. As Oscar Wilde wrote, \"The truth is rarely pure and never simple.\" We suggest that this quote describes the current situation on the debate over the relevance of Ct values, and we will explore the clinical utility of quantitative SARS-CoV-2 testing here.

Outpatients from the US were enrolled remotely via internet-based surveys and followed up for 21 days. Eligible participants had a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test result (nucleic acid amplification or antigen) within 7 days prior to enrollment, were aged 18 years or older, and were not hospitalized at the time of enrollment. Among 604 individuals screened, 297 were ineligible, 44 refused participation, and 263 were enrolled. Participants, investigators, and study staff were masked to treatment randomization.Interventions: Participants were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to a single oral 1.2-g dose of azithromycin (n=171) or matching placebo (n=92).Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was absence of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms at day 14. There were 23 secondary clinical end points, including all-cause hospitalization at day 21.Results: Among 263 participants who were randomized (median age, 43 years; 174 [66%] women; 57% non-Hispanic White and 29% Latinx/Hispanic), 76% completed the trial. The trial was terminated by the data and safety monitoring committee for futility after the interim analysis. At day 14, there was no significant difference in proportion of participants who were symptom free (azithromycin: 50%; placebo: P>.99). Of 23 prespecified secondary clinical end points, 18 showed no significant difference. By day 21, 5 participants in the azithromycin group had been hospitalized compared with 0 in the placebo group (prevalence difference, 4%; 95% CI, -1% to 9%; P=.16).Conclusions and Relevance: Among outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, treatment with a single dose of azithromycin compared with placebo did not result in greater likelihood of being symptom free at day 14. These findings do not support the routine use of azithromycin for outpatient SARS-CoV-2 BACKGROUND: Although mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines report 90% efficacy, breakthrough infections occur. Little is known about the effectiveness of these vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the highly-prevalent B.1.427/B.1.429 variant in California..METHODS: In this quality improvement project, we collected demographic and clinical information from post-vaccine SARS-CoV-2 cases (PVSCs), defined as health care personnel (HCP) with positive SARS-CoV-2 NAAT after receiving 1 vaccine dose. Available specimens were tested for L452R, N501Y and E484K mutations by RT-PCR. Mutation prevalence was compared among unvaccinated, early post-vaccinated (<=14 days after dose 1), partially vaccinated (positive test >14 days after dose 1 and 14 days after dose 2) and fully vaccinated (>14 days after dose 2) PVSCs.RESULTS: From December 2020-April 2021, HCPS received at of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and 660 HCP cases of SARS-CoV-2 occurred of which 189 were PVSCs. Among the PVSCs, 114 (60.3%), 49 (25.9%) and 26 (13.8%) were early post-vaccination, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated, respectively. Of 261 available samples from vaccinated and unvaccinated HCP, 103 (39.5%), including 42 PVSCs (36.5%), had L452R mutation presumed to be B.1.427/B.1.429,. When adjusted for community prevalence of B.1.427/B.1.429, PVSCs did not have significantly elevated risk for infection with B.1.427/B.1.429 compared with unvaccinated HCP.CONCLUSIONS: Most PVSCs occurred prior to expected onset of full, vaccine-derived immunity. Presumptive B.1.427/B.1.429 was not more prevalent in post-vaccine cases than in unvaccinated SARS-CoV-2 HCP. Continued infection control measures, particularly 14 days post-vaccination, and continued variant surveillance in PVSCs is imperative to control future SARS-CoV-2 surges.

A sub-cohort was followed prospectively to evaluate long-term COVID-19 symptoms.RESULTS: 168,190 patients underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, and 6,976 (4.15%) tested positive. In a multivariate analysis, asthma was not an independent risk factor for hospitalization (OR 1.12 [95% CI 0.86, 1.45], p=0.40). Among SARS-CoV-2 positive asthmatics, allergic asthma lowered the risk of hospitalization and had a protective effect compared to non-allergic asthma (OR 0.52 (0.28, 0.91), p=0.026); there was no association between baseline medication use as characterized by GINA and hospitalization risk. Patients with severe COVID-19 disease had lower eosinophil levels during hospitalization compared to patients with mild or asymptomatic disease, independent of asthma status (p=0.0014). In a patient sub-cohort followed longitudinally, asthmatics and non-asthmatics had similar time to resolution of COVID-19 symptoms, particularly lower respiratory symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: Asthma is not a risk factor for more severe COVID-19 disease. Allergic asthmatics were half as likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to non-allergic asthmatics. Lower levels of eosinophil counts (allergic biomarkers) were associated with a more severe COVID-19 disease trajectory. Recovery was similar among asthmatics and non-asthmatics with over 50% of patients reporting ongoing lower respiratory symptoms three months post-infection.

Infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) accelerates age-related immunological changes resulting in expanded oligoclonal memory CD8 T cell populations with impaired proliferation, signaling, and cytokine production. As a consequence, elderly CMV seropositive (CMV+) individuals have increased mortality and impaired responses to other infections in comparison to seronegative (CMV-) individuals of the same age. CMV is also a significant complication after organ transplantation, and recent studies have shown that CMV-associated expansion of memory T cells is accelerated after transplantation. Thus, we investigated whether immune aging is accelerated post-transplant, using a combination of telomere length, flow cytometry phenotyping, and single cell RNA sequencing. Telomere length decreased slightly in the first year after transplantation in a subset of both CMV+ and CMV- recipients with a strong concordance between CD57+ cells and short telomeres. Phenotypically aged cells increased post-transplant specifically in CMV+ recipients, and clonally expanded T cells were enriched for terminally differentiated cells post-transplant. Overall, these findings demonstrate a pattern of accelerated aging of the CD8 T cell compartment in CMV+ transplant recipients.

Genomic surveillance is an important tool for pandemic response, but many laboratories do not have the resources to support population-level sequencing. We hypothesized that a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) to genotype mutations in the viral spike protein could facilitate high-throughput variant surveillance. We designed and analytically validated a one-step multiplex allele-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain spike protein mutations with next-generation whole-genome sequencing. We then screened a large cohort of SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens from our San Francisco Bay Area population. Between December 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021, we screened 4,049 unique infections by genotyping RT-qPCR, with an assay failure rate of 2.8%. L452R 34 sequencing in and P.2 assay revealed rapid emergence of L452R in our population, with a prevalence of 24.8% in December 2020 that increased to 62.5% in March 2021. We developed and clinically implemented a genotyping RT-qPCR to conduct high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 variant screening. This approach can be adapted for emerging mutations and immediately implemented in laboratories already performing NAAT worldwide using existing equipment, personnel, and extracted nucleic acid.

Viral viability from longitudinally-collected specimens was assessed. Whole-genome sequencing and serological studies were performed to measure viral evolution and evidence of immune escape.FINDINGS: We found compelling evidence of ongoing replication and infectivity for up to 162 days from initial positive by subgenomic RNA, single-stranded RNA, and viral culture analysis. Our results reveal a broad spectrum of infectivity, host immune responses, and accumulation of mutations, some with the potential for immune escape.INTERPRETATION: Our results highlight the potential need to reassess infection control precautions in the management and care of immunocompromised patients. Routine surveillance of mutations and evaluation of their potential impact on viral transmission and immune escape should be considered.

These mutations enable the SARS-CoV-2 to evolve into new strains. Viral quasispecies emerge from de novo mutations that occur in individual patients. In combination, these sets of viral mutations provide distinct genetic fingerprints that reveal the patterns of transmission and have utility in contact tracing.METHODS: Leveraging thousands of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we performed a viral pangenome analysis to identify conserved genomic sequences. We used a rapid and highly efficient computational approach that relies on k-mers, short tracts of sequence, instead of conventional sequence alignment. Using this method, we annotated viral mutation signatures that were associated with specific strains. Based on these highly conserved viral sequences, we developed a rapid and highly scalable targeted sequencing assay to identify mutations, detect quasispecies variants, and identify mutation signatures from patients. These results were compared to the pangenome genetic fingerprints.RESULTS: We built a k-mer index for thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and identified conserved genomics regions and landscape of mutations across thousands of virus genomes. We delineated mutation profiles spanning common genetic fingerprints (the combination of mutations in a viral assembly) and a combination of mutations that appear in only a small number of patients. We developed a targeted sequencing assay by selecting primers from the conserved viral genome regions to flank frequent mutations. Using a cohort of 100 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples, we identified genetic fingerprints consisting of strain-specific mutations seen across populations and de novo quasispecies mutations localized to individual infections. We compared the mutation profiles of viral samples undergoing analysis with the features of the pangenome.CONCLUSIONS: We conducted an analysis for viral mutation profiles that provide the basis of genetic fingerprints. Our study linked pangenome analysis with targeted deep sequenced SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples. We identified quasispecies mutations occurring within individual patients and determined their general prevalence when compared to over 70,000 other strains. Analysis of these genetic fingerprints may provide a way of conducting molecular contact tracing.

This feature of the disease may be significant for patient health, epidemiology, and diagnosis. However, to date, methods to preserve stool samples from COVID patients, and to extract and quantify viral RNA concentration have yet to be optimized. We sought to meet this urgent need by developing and benchmarking a standardized protocol for the fecal detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We test three preservative conditions for their ability to yield detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA: OMNIgene-GUT, Zymo DNA/RNA shield kit, and the most common condition, storage without any preservative. We test these in combination with three extraction kits: the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, Zymo Quick-RNA Viral Kit, and MagMAX Viral/Pathogen Kit. Finally, we also test the utility of two detection methods, ddPCR and RT-qPCR, for the robust quantification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA from stool. We identify that the Zymo DNA/RNA shield collection kit and the QiaAMP viral RNA mini kit yield more detectable RNA than the others, using both ddPCR and RT-qPCR assays. We also demonstrate key features of experimental design including the incorporation of appropriate controls and data analysis, and apply these techniques to effectively extract viral RNA from fecal samples acquired from COVID-19 outpatients enrolled in a clinical trial. Finally, we recommend a comprehensive methodology for future preservation, extraction and detection of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in stool.

We sought to determine the rate of seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and of acute asymptomatic infection among firefighter first responders in a single county with early exposure in the pandemic.Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of clinically active firefighters cross-trained as paramedics or EMTs in the fire departments of Santa Clara County, California. Firefighters without current symptoms were tested between June and August 2020. Our primary outcomes were rates of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody seropositivity and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR swab positivity for acute infection. We report cumulative incidence, participant characteristics with frequencies and proportions, and proportion positive and associated relative risk (with 95% confidence intervals).Results: We enrolled 983 out of 1339 eligible (response rate: 73.4%). Twenty-five participants (2.54%, 95% antibodies and 9 (0.92%, 95% CI 0.42-1.73) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Our cumulative incidence, inclusive of self-reported prior positive PCR tests, was 34 (3.46%, 95% CI 2.41-4.80).Conclusion: In a county with one of the earliest outbreaks in the United States, the seroprevalence among firefighter first responders was lower than that reported by other studies of frontline health care workers, while the cumulative incidence remained higher than that seen in the surrounding community.

These errors can lead to missed opportunities for prevention-of-mother-to-child-transmission (PMTCT), early infant diagnosis and adult HIV-prevention, unnecessary lifelong antiretroviral treatment (ART) and wasted resources. Few national estimates or systematic quantifications of sources of errors have been produced. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of possible sources of misclassification errors in routine HIV testing in Zimbabwe.METHODS: RDT-based HIV test results were extracted from routine PMTCT programme records at 62 sites during national antenatal HIV surveillance in 2017. Positive- (PPA) and negative-percent agreement (NPA) for HIV RDT results and the false-HIV-positivity rate for people with previous HIV-positive results (\"known-positives\") were calculated using results from external quality assurance testing done for HIV surveillance purposes. Data on indicators of quality management systems, RDT kit performance under local climatic conditions and user/clerical errors were collected using HIV surveillance forms, data-loggers and a Smartphone camera application (7 sites). Proportions of cases with errors were compared for tests done in the presence/absence of potential sources of errors.RESULTS: NPA was 99.9% for both pregnant women (N=17224) and partners (N=2173). PPA was 90.0% (N=1187) and 93.4% (N=136) for women and men respectively. 3.5% (N=1921) of known-positive individuals on ART were HIV negative. Humidity and temperature exceeding manufacturers' recommendations, particularly in storerooms (88.6% and 97.3% respectively), and premature readings of RDT output (56.0%) were common. False-HIV-negative cases, including interpretation errors, occurred despite staff training and good algorithm compliance, and were not reduced by existing external or internal quality assurance procedures. PPA was lower when testing room humidity exceeded 60% (88.0% vs. 93.3%; p=0.007).CONCLUSIONS: False-HIV-negative results were still common in Zimbabwe in 2017 and could be reduced with HIV testing algorithms that use RDTs with higher sensitivity under real-world conditions and greater practicality under busy clinic conditions, and by strengthening proficiency testing procedures in external quality assurance systems. New false-HIV-positive RDT results were infrequent but earlier errors in testing may have resulted in large numbers of uninfected individuals being on ART.

Acute-phase sera were tested from 77 patients who presented with a suspected arboviral illness from January to May 2018. Samples were tested for DENV and ZIKV RNA by real-time reverse transcription-PCR, and for nonstructural 1 with lateral-flow immunochromatographic test. Forty-one patients (51.2%) had acute dengue; no ZIKV infections were detected. Sixty-five patients (84.4%) had anti-DENV-neutralizing antibodies by focus reduction neutralization testing (FRNT50). Qualitative detection with the pGOLD assay demonstrated good agreement with FRNT50 (kappa = 0.74), and quantitative results were highly correlated between methods (P < 0.001). Only three patients had anti-ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies at titers of 1:55-1:80, and all three had corresponding DENV-neutralizing titers > 1:4,000. Hospitalized dengue cases had IgG levels Anti-DENV pGOLD assay correlate well with FRNT, and quantitative results may inform patient risk stratification.

It is closely related to chikungunya virus, an emerging infectious disease. O'nyong-nyong virus causes a self-limited illness characterized by bilateral polyarthritis, rash, low-grade fever, and lymphadenopathy. In 1959, an extensive outbreak of ONNV occurred in East Africa, and decades later, another large outbreak was documented in Uganda in 1996. Limited evidence for interepidemic transmission is available, although serologic studies indicate a high prevalence of exposure; 1,045 febrile child participants in western and coastal Kenya were tested for the presence of ONNV using a multiplexed real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR assay. More than half of the participants had malaria parasitemia, and there was no evidence of active ONNV viremia in these participants. Further work is required to better understand the interepidemic circulation of ONNV and to reconcile evidence of high serologic exposure to ONNV among individuals in East Africa.

Here, over 1400 plasma proteins and 2600 single-cell immune features comprising cell phenotype, basal signaling activity, and signaling responses to inflammatory ligands were assessed in peripheral blood from patients with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19, at the time of diagnosis. Using an integrated computational approach to analyze the combined plasma and single-cell proteomic data, we identified and independently validated a multivariate model classifying COVID-19 severity (multi-class of this high-dimensional model recapitulated recent COVID-19 related observations of immune perturbations, and revealed novel biological signatures of severity, including the mobilization of elements of the renin-angiotensin system and primary hemostasis, as well as dysregulation of JAK/STAT, MAPK/mTOR, and NF-B immune signaling networks. These results provide a set of early determinants of COVID-19 severity that may point to therapeutic targets for the prevention of COVID-19 progression.

MeV is highly contagious and timely diagnosis is critical to limit spread. RNA detection is the most sensitive method for acute measles diagnosis; however, MeV nucleic acid amplification assays are not widely available.METHODS: We performed a diagnostic accuracy study of a triple-target, real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for simultaneous detection and L genes.RESULTS: The MeV MeV isolates representing (74/75) urine dilutions. MeV RNA detection in urine was markedly improved with the addition of a nucleic acid stabilizing agent. A 95% lower limit of detection (LLOD) of < 3.0 log10 copies/mL was established in each specimen matrix. No cross-reactivity with relevant viruses or interfering substances were identified in specificity studies. The MeV triple-target rRT-PCR detected all three gene targets in a clinical NP swab from an individual with confirmed measles infection. Furthermore, pooled testing from 798 influenza A/B/RSV-negative pediatric NP swabs identified two specimens positive for MeV RNA, confirmed by N gene sequencing to represent shedding the vaccine-type measles virus.CONCLUSIONS: The MeV triple-target circulating genotypes in three clinically-relevant matrices. Implementation of this assay in the clinical laboratory may facilitate timely diagnosis of acute measles infection and implementation of appropriate infection control interventions.

Although PTLD occurs rarely, it may be associated with poor outcomes. In most cases, PTLD is driven by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Few studies have investigated the mutational landscape and gene expression profile of PTLD. In our study, we performed targeted deep sequencing and RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) on 16 cases of florid follicular (FFH) type PTLD and 15 that include: ten monomorphic (M-PTLD), three two classic Hodgkin lymphoma type PTLDs (CHL-PTLD). Our study identified recurrent mutations in JAK3 in five of 15 PTLD cases and one of 16 FFH-PTLD cases, as well as 16 other genes that were mutated in M-PTLD, P-PTLD, CHL-PTLD and FFH-PTLD. Digital image analysis demonstrated significant differences in single cell area, major axis, and diameter when comparing cases of M-PTLD and P-PTLD to FFH-PTLD. No morphometric relationship was identified with regards to a specific genetic mutation. Our findings suggest that immune regulatory pathways play an essential role in PTLD, with the JAK/STAT pathway affected in many PTLDs.

Given the low prevalence for HIV infections in our institution's county, we suspect that a substantial portion of the reactive screens are false positives.We aimed to characterize the false positivity rate of the HIV screening test performed at Stanford Health Care. In parallel, we modified our reporting workflow to release both the screening and confirmatory results simultaneously to mitigate the stress of a presumptive positive test.We reviewed 45,296 eligible HIV screen specimens that underwent the Abbott ARCHITECT 4th generation HIV antigen/antibody combination assay between August 5, 2016 and March 16, 2021. Final sample signal/cutoff (S/CO) ratios 1 were deemed positive, which triggers a reflex order for the confirmatory Bio-Rad Geenius HIV 1/2 Supplemental Assay. Additional chart review was performed for positive screen cases with negative or indeterminate confirmatory results.Our institution demonstrated a 0.28% (128/45,296) positive screen rate, with 12.5% (16/128) of these samples confirmed as false positives based on a negative HIV-1 RNA test. Median S/CO ratios of true positive screens were significantly higher than those with negative or indeterminate confirmatory tests (602.27vs 2.98; p=0.0000323). We implemented a new synchronized reporting system for positive screens, which co-releases screen and confirmatory reports without compromise in the overall turnaround time.Our study demonstrates a relatively high percentage of false positive screens. Subsequently, by providing a more complete picture up front, our new reporting pipeline may reduce anxiety of a stand-alone positive screen and optimize downstream clinical decision-making.

Transfusions early during disease course was found to be beneficial. Lessons from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic could inform early responses to future pandemics and may continue to be relevant in lower resource settings. We sought to identify factors correlating to high antibody titers in convalescent plasma donors and understand the magnitude and pharmacokinetic time course of both transfused antibody titers and the endogenous antibody titers in transfused recipients.Methods: Plasma samples were collected up to 174 days after convalescence from 93 CCP donors with mild disease, and from 16 COVID-19 patients before and after transfusion. Using ELISA, anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD, S1, and N-protein antibodies, as well as capacity of antibodies to block ACE2 from binding to RBD was measured in an in vitro assay. As an estimate for viral load, viral RNA and N-protein plasma levels were assessed in COVID-19 patients.Results: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and RBD-ACE2 blocking capacity were highest within the first 60 days after symptom resolution and markedly decreased after 120 days. Highest antibody titers were found in CCP donors that experienced fever. Effect of transfused CCP was detectable in COVID-19 patients who received high-titer CCP and had not seroconverted at the time of transfusion. Decrease in viral RNA was seen in two of these patients.Conclusion: Our results suggest that high titer CCP should be collected within 60 days after recovery from donors with past fever. The much lower titers conferred by transfused antibodies compared to endogenous production in the patient underscore the importance of providing CCP prior to endogenous seroconversion.

This may be significant for patient health, epidemiology, and diagnosis. However, methods to preserve stool, and to extract and quantify viral RNA are not standardized. We test the performance of three preservativeapproaches at yielding detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA: theOMNIgene-GUTkit, Zymo DNA/RNA shield kit, and the most commonly applied, storage without preservative. We test these in combination with three extraction kits: QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, Zymo Quick-RNA Viral Kit, and MagMAX Viral/Pathogen Kit. We also test the utility of ddPCR and RT-qPCR for the reliable quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from stool. We identify that the Zymo DNA/RNA preservative and the QiaAMP extraction kit yield more detectable RNA than the others, using both ddPCR and RT-qPCR. Taken together, we recommend a comprehensive methodology for preservation, extraction and detection of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in stool.

However, breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated individuals have been reported. Meanwhile, multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have emerged worldwide, including the B.1.427/B.1.429 variant first described in California. Little is known about the real-world effectiveness of the mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines against novel variants including B.1.427/B.1.429.In this quality improvement project, post-vaccine SARS-CoV-2 cases (PVSCs) were defined as individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) after receiving at least one dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Chart extraction of demographic and clinical information was performed, and available specimens meeting cycle threshold value criteria were tested for L452R, N501Y and E484K mutations by RT-PCR.From December 2020 to March 2021, 189 PVSCs were identified out of 22,729 healthcare personnel who received at least one dose of an mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Of these, 114 (60.3%) occurred within 14 days of first vaccine dose (early post-vaccination), 49 (25.9%) within 14 days of the second vaccine dose (partially vaccinated), and 26 (13.8%) > 14 days after the second dose (fully vaccinated). Of 115 samples available for mutation testing, 42 were positive for L452R alone, presumptive of B.1.427/B.1.429; three had N501Y mutation alone and none were found with E484K mutation. Though on univariate analysis partially- and fully-vaccinated PVSCs were more likely than early post-vaccination PVSCs to be infected with presumptive B.1.427/B.1.429, when adjusted for community prevalence of B.1.427/B.1.429 at the time of infection, partially- and fully-vaccinated PVSC did not have statistically significantly elevated risk ratios for infection with this variant (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.81-2.43 and RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.59-2.16, respectively).The great majority of PVSCs occurred prior to the expected onset of full, vaccine-derived immunity. Although the B.1.427/B.1.429 variant did not represent a significantly higher proportion of PVSCs than expected, numbers were small and there was a trend towards higher representation in the partially- and fully-vaccinated subset. Continued infection control measures in the workplace and in the community including social distancing and masking, particularly in the early days post-vaccination, as well as continued variant surveillance in PVSCs, is imperative in order to anticipate and control future surges of infection.

Viral viability from longitudinally-collected specimens was assessed. Whole-genome sequencing and serological studies were performed to measure viral evolution and evidence of immune escape.We found compelling evidence of ongoing replication and infectivity for up to 162 days from initial positive by subgenomic RNA, single-stranded RNA, and viral culture analysis. Our results reveal a broad spectrum of infectivity, host immune responses, and accumulation of mutations, some with the potential for immune escape.Our results highlight the need to reassess infection control precautions in the management and care of immunocompromised patients. Routine surveillance of mutations and evaluation of their potential impact on viral transmission and immune escape should be considered.The work was partially funded by The Saban Research Institute at Children's Hospital Los Angeles intramural support for COVID-19 Directed Research (X.G. and J.D.B.), the Johns Hopkins Center of Excellence in Influenza Research Surveillance S.D.B. from the Crown Family Foundation, an Early Postdoc.Mobility Fellowship Stipend to O.F.W. from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), and a Coulter COVID-19 Rapid Response Award to S.D.B.

In both the 60 patients receiving Lambda and 60 receiving placebo, the median time to cessation of viral shedding was 7 days (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56 to 1.19). Symptoms resolved in 8 and 9 days in Lambda and placebo, respectively, and symptom duration did not differ significantly between groups (HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.39). Both Lambda and placebo were well-tolerated, though liver transaminase elevations were more common in the Lambda vs. placebo arm (15/60 vs 5/60; p = 0.027).

Assay performance was assessed by overall, positive, and negative percent agreement and Cohen's kappa coefficient.Overall agreement between the Fusion RA and ePlex RPP was 97.3 % (95 % CI 96.3-98.0), positive percent agreement was 97.2 % (95 % CI 93.0-99.2), negative percent agreement was 97.3 % (95 % CI 96.3-98.0), and the kappa coefficient was 0.85 (95 % CI 0.81-0.89). Forty additional viruses in 30 specimens were detected by Fusion that were not detected by ePlex. The maximum specimen throughput for parallel testing of the Fusion Respiratory Assays with SARS-CoV-2 was 275 samples in 20.7 h for Fusion SARS-CoV-2 and 350 samples in 20.0 h for Aptima Transcription Mediated Amplification SARS-CoV-2.Fusion RA demonstrated substantial agreement compared to the ePlex RPP. However, the Fusion detected respiratory viruses not identified by ePlex, consistent with higher clinical sensitivity.

However, there are limited prospectively-collected data on assay performance, and minimal clinical information to guide interpretation of discrepant results.Over a two-week period, 1080 consecutive plasma samples submitted for clinical SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing were tested in parallel Abbott) and anti-spike IgG (anti-S1, EUROIMMUN). Chart review was conducted for samples testing positive or borderline on either assay, and for an age/sex-matched cohort of samples negative by both assays. CDC surveillance case definitions were used to determine clinical sensitivity/specificity and conduct receiver operating characteristics curve analysis.There were 52 samples positive by both methods, 2 positive for anti-N only, 34 positive for anti-S1 only, and 27 borderline for anti-S1. Of the 34 individuals positive for anti-S1 alone, 8 (24%) had confirmed COVID-19. No anti-S1 borderline cases were positive for anti-N or had confirmed/probable COVID-19. The anti-N assay CI 79.6-92.3%]) Abbott anti-N sensitivity could be improved to 96.5% with minimal effect on specificity if the index threshold was lowered from 1.4 to 0.6.Real-world concordance between different serologic assays may be lower than previously described in retrospective studies. These findings have implications for the interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 IgG results, especially with the advent of spike antigen-targeted vaccination, as a subset of patients with true infection are anti-N negative and anti-S1 positive.

Although these assays remain important diagnostic tools for samples with low biomass, the lack of diagnostic range motivates alternative molecular approaches for ocular infections. The aim of this study was to determine the performance of a high-throughput RNA sequencing approach, RNA-seq, to detect infectious agents in ocular samples from patients with presumed ocular infections.We compared the performance of RNA-seq to pathogen-directed PCRs using remnant nucleic acids from 41 aqueous or vitreous samples of patients with presumed ocular infections. Pathogen-directed PCRs were performed at the CLIA-certified Stanford Clinical Virology Laboratory. RNA-seq was performed in a masked manner at the Proctor Foundation at the University of California San Francisco. Percent positive and negative agreement between the two testing approaches were calculated. Discordant results were subjected to orthogonal testing.The positive percent agreement between RNA-seq 100% (95% confidence (95% CI: 76.6%-97.9%). RNA-seq identified pathogens not on the diagnosis for 9.7% (4/41) of the samples. Two pathogens solely identified with RNA-seq were confirmed with orthogonal testing.RNA-seq can accurately identify common and rare pathogens in aqueous and vitreous samples of patients with presumed ocular infections. Such an unbiased approach to testing has the potential to improve diagnostics although practical clinical utility warrants additional studies.

However, the effect of dilution on analytical sensitivity through sample pooling has not been well characterized. We tested 1,648 prospectively pooled specimens by using 3 nucleic acid amplification tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2: a laboratory-developed real-time reverse transcription PCR targeting the envelope gene, and 2 commercially available Panther System assays targeting open reading frame 1ab. Positive percent agreement (PPA) of pooled versus individual testing ranged from 71.7% to 82.6% for pools of 8 and from 82.9% to 100.0% for pools of 4. We developed and validated an independent stochastic simulation model to estimate effects of dilution on PPA and efficiency of a 2-stage pooled real-time reverse transcription PCR testing algorithm. PPA was dependent on the proportion of tests with positive results, cycle threshold distribution, and assay limit of detection.

In high-incidence regions, screening trials have been conducted. We estimated the mortality reduction and cost-effectiveness of EBV-based NPC screening in populations worldwide.METHODS: We identified 380 populations in 132 countries with incident NPC and developed a decision-analytic model to compare ten unique onetime screening strategies to no screening for men and women at age 50years. Screening performance and the stage distribution of undiagnosed NPC were derived from a systematic review of prospective screening trials.RESULTS: Screening was cost-effective in up to 14.5% of populations, depending on the screening strategy. These populations were limited to East Asia, Southeast Asia, North Africa, or were Asian, Pacific Islander, or Inuit populations in North America. A combination of serology and nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was most cost-effective, but other combinations of serologic and/or plasma PCR screening were also cost-effective. The estimated reduction in NPC mortality was similar across screening strategies. For a hypothetical cohort of patients in China, 10-year survival improved from 71.0% (95%CI = 68.8%-73.0%) without screening to a median of 86.3% (range = 83.5%-88.2%) with screening. This corresponded to a median 10-year reduction in NPC mortality of 52.9% (range= 43.1%-59.3%). Screening interval impacted absolute mortality reduction and cost-effectiveness.CONCLUSIONS: We observed decreased NPC mortality with EBV-based screening. Screening was cost-effective in many high-incidence populations and could be extended to men and women as early as age 40years in select regions. These findings may be useful when choosing among local public health initiatives.

This included 41 (30.1%) individuals who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between March 13 and April 16, 2020. In multivariable analysis, employees of Hispanic ethnicity (OR = 2.01; 95% CI = 1.22-3.46) and those working in environmental services/food services/patient transport (OR = 4.81; 95% CI = 2.08-10.30) were at increased risk for seropositivity compared to other groups. Employees reporting a household contact with COVID-19 were also at higher risk for seropositivity (OR = 3.25; 95% CI = 1.47-6.44), but those with a work exposure were not (OR = 1.27; 95% CI = 0.58-2.47). Importantly, one-third of seropositive individuals reported no prior symptoms, no suspected exposures, and no prior positive RT-PCR test.CONCLUSION: In this study, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among HCP early in the northern California epidemic appeared to be quite low and was more likely attributable to community rather than occupational exposure.

Rapid, accurate, and easily configurable molecular diagnostic tests are imperative to prevent global spread of new diseases. CRISPR-based diagnostic approaches are proving to be useful as field-deployable solutions. In one basic form of this assay, the CRISPR-Cas12 enzyme complexes with a synthetic guide RNA (gRNA). This complex becomes activated only when it specifically binds to target DNA and cleaves it. The activated complex thereafter nonspecifically cleaves single-stranded DNA reporter probes labeled with a fluorophore-quencher pair. We discovered that electric field gradients can be used to control and accelerate this CRISPR assay by cofocusing Cas12-gRNA, reporters, and target within a microfluidic chip. We achieve an appropriate electric field gradient using a selective ionic focusing technique known as isotachophoresis (ITP) implemented on a microfluidic chip. Unlike previous CRISPR diagnostic assays, we also use ITP for automated purification of target RNA from raw nasopharyngeal swab samples. We here combine this ITP purification with loop-mediated isothermal amplification and the ITP-enhanced CRISPR assay to achieve detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA (from raw sample to result) in about 35 min for both contrived and clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples. This electric field control enables an alternate modality for a suite of microfluidic CRISPR-based diagnostic assays.

We evaluated the presence of dengue viremia during 4 years of surveillance (2014-2017) among children with febrile illness in Kenya. Acutely ill febrile children were recruited from 4 clinical sites in western and coastal Kenya, and 1,022 participant samples were tested by using a highly sensitive real-time reverse transcription PCR. A complete case analysis with genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analyses was conducted to characterize the presence of dengue viremia among participants during 2014-2017. Dengue viremia was detected 41.9% (361/862) of outpatient children who had undifferentiated febrile illness in Kenya. Of children with confirmed dengue viremia, 51.5% (150/291) had malaria parasitemia. All 4 dengue virus serotypes were detected, and phylogenetic analyses showed several viruses from novel lineages. Our results suggests high levels of dengue virus infection among children with undifferentiated febrile illness in Kenya.

This study aimed to determine the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma and its association with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical severity.METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional study was performed in a single-center tertiary care institution and included consecutive inpatients and outpatients with confirmed COVID-19. The prevalence of SARS CoV-2 RNAemia and the strength of its association with clinical severity variables were examined and included intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and 30-day all-cause mortality.RESULTS: Paired nasopharyngeal and plasma samples were included from 85 patients. The median age was 55 years, and individuals with RNAemia were older than those with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma (63 vs 50 years; P = .04). Comorbidities were frequent including obesity (37.6%), hypertension (30.6%), and diabetes mellitus (22.4%). RNAemia 28/85 (32.9%) of patients, including 22/28 (78.6%) who required hospitalization. In models adjusted for age, RNAemia was detected more frequently in individuals who developed severe disease including ICU admission (32.1 vs 14.0%; P = .04) and invasive mechanical ventilation (21.4% vs 3.5%; P = .02). All 4 deaths occurred in individuals with detectable RNAemia. An additional 121 plasma samples from 28 individuals with RNAemia were assessed longitudinally, and RNA was detected for a maximum duration of 10 days.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a high proportion of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, and an association between RNAemia and clinical severity suggesting the potential utility of plasma viral testing as a prognostic indicator for COVID-19.

Integrating self-collected, community-based screening offers a potential primary screening method in areas of limited resources. In this paper, we present a study evaluating knowledge, attitudes, and practices of cervical cancer and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) in rural Zimbabwe.METHODS: We performed a community-based cross-sectional knowledge, attitudes and practices of HPV and cervical cancer study in rural Zimbabwe from January 2017-May 2017. Women were selected for the study via random number generation from complete lists of inhabitants in the study area if they satisfied the inclusion criteria (30-years-old, 65-years-old, not pregnant, intact uterus). If selected, they participated in a 19-question structured knowledge, attitudes and practices survey. The questionnaire included questions on demographics, education, knowledge of HPV, cervical cancer, and risk factors. Chi-squared tests were evaluated comparing knowledge, attitudes and practices relating to HPV and cervical cancer screening with actual infection with HPV. Women were also offered a voluntary HIV and self-collected HPV screening.RESULTS: Six hundred seventy-nine women were included in the knowledge, attitudes and practices survey. Most women (81%) had heard of cervical cancer while the majority had not heard of HPV (12%). The number of women that had been screened previously for cervical cancer was low (5%). There were no significant differences between and within groups regarding knowledge of cervical cancer and actual overall infection with HR-HPV, HPV 16, and HPV 18/45 test results.CONCLUSIONS: Most women in rural Zimbabwe have heard of cervical cancer, but the number that had been screened was low. Extending existing outreach services to include cervical cancer screening, potentially including HPV screening, should include cervical cancer/HPV education and screening triage. This approach would serve to bridge the gap between knowledge and screening availability to address some of the barriers to cervical cancer care still affecting women in many regions of the world.

We examined whether testing and hospitalization data could help quantify the anticipated burden on the health system given shelter-in-place (SIP) order.MATERIALS AND METHODS: 16,103 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were performed on 15,807 patients at Stanford facilities between March 2 and April 11, 2020. We analyzed the fraction of tested patients that were confirmed positive for COVID-19, the fraction of those needing hospitalization, and the fraction requiring ICU admission over the 40 days between March 2nd and April 11th 2020.RESULTS: We find a marked slowdown in the hospitalization rate within ten days of SIP even as cases continued to rise. We also find a shift towards younger patients in the age distribution of those testing positive for COVID-19 over the four weeks of SIP. The impact of this shift is a divergence between increasing positive case confirmations and slowing new hospitalizations, both of which affects the demand on health systems.CONCLUSION: Without using local hospitalization rates and the age distribution of positive patients, current models are likely to overestimate the resource burden of COVID-19. It is imperative that health systems start using these data to quantify effects of SIP and aid reopening planning.

A test-based strategy that requires negative respiratory RT-PCR tests obtained after the resolution of symptoms. Alternatively, due to the limited availability of testing, many sites employ a symptom-based strategy that recommends excluding HCW from the workforce and keeping patients on contact precautions until a fixed period of time has elapsed from symptom recovery. The underlying assumption of the symptom-based strategy is that waiting for a fixed period of time is a surrogate for negative RT-PCR testing, which itself is a surrogate for the absence of shedding infectious virus.OBJECTIVES: To better understand the appropriate length of symptom based return to work and contact precaution strategies.STUDY DESIGN: We performed an observational analysis of 150 patients and HCW that transitioned from RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive to negative over the course of 2 months at a US academic medical center.RESULTS: We found that the average time to transition from RT-PCR positive to negative was 24 days after symptom onset and 10 % remained positive even 33 days after symptom onset. No difference was seen in HCW and patients.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest until definitive evidence of the length of infective viral shedding is obtained that the fixed length of time before returning to work or ceasing contract precautions be revised to over one-month.

As the availability and speed of SARS-CoV-2 testing platforms improve, results are increasingly relied upon to inform critical decisions related to therapy, use of personal protective equipment, and workforce readiness. However, early reports of RT-PCR test performance have left clinicians and the public with concerns regarding the reliability of this predominant testing modality and the interpretation of negative results. In this work, two independent research teams report the frequency of discordant SARS-CoV-2 test results among initially negative, repeatedly tested patients in regions of the United States with early community transmission and access to testing.METHODS: All patients at the University of Washington (UW) and Stanford Health Care undergoing initial testing by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab between March 2nd and April 7th, 2020 were included. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed targeting the N, RdRp, S, and E genes and ORF1ab, using a combination of Emergency Use Authorization laboratory-developed tests and commercial assays. Results through April 14th were extracted to allow for a complete 7-day observation period and an additional day for reporting.RESULTS: A total of 23,126 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests (10,583 eligible patients (8,977 UW, 11,935 Stanford) undergoing initial testing by NP swab; 626 initially test-negative patients were re-tested within 7 days. Among this group, repeat testing within 7 days yielded a positive result in 3.5% (4.3% UW, 2.8% Stanford) of cases, suggesting an initial false negative RT-PCR result; the majority (96.5%) of patients with an initial negative result who warranted reevaluation for any reason remained negative on all subsequent tests performed within this window.CONCLUSIONS: Two independent research teams report the similar finding that, among initially negative patients subjected to repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, the occurrence of a newly positive result within 7 days is uncommon. These observations suggest that false negative results at the time of initial presentation do occur, but potentially at a lower frequency than is currently believed. Although it is not possible to infer the clinical sensitivity of NP SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing using these data, they may be used in combination with other reports to guide the use and interpretation of this common testing modality.

HPV35 is one of the least frequently identified high-risk types in North America and Europe but was the most common high-risk HPV (hrHPV) infection in a cohort in rural Zimbabwe. Whole genome analysis is limited for HPV35; no such studies have been performed in Zimbabwe. Of 648 women in the initial cohort in Zimbabwe, 19 (19/648, 2.9%) tested positive for HPV35, and eight samples were successfully sequenced for HPV35. The maximum number of sequence variants for the whole genome was 58 nucleotides (0.7%) compared to the prototype (58/7879). The maximum number of sequence variants in was 3 (3/450, 0.7%) 2 These are the first HPV35 whole genome sequences from Zimbabwe, and these data further lend support to the carcinogenicity of HPV35 despite limited sequence heterogeneity. Further studies to determine carcinogenic effects and impact of HPV vaccinations are warranted, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.

While antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue is thought to be driven by viral load, this has not been conclusively shown. We evaluated the association between preinfection anti-DENV antibody titers, viral load, and disease severity among 133 dengue cases in a Nicaraguan pediatric cohort study.METHODS: Viral load was quantified in acute-phase serum by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and analyzed in relation to preinfection antibody titer (measured by inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and dengue severity, categorized using 3 definitions.RESULTS: Higher viral load was significantly associated with dengue severity; for each increase of 1.0 log10 copies/mL, the odds of severe dengue increased approximately 50%, regardless of severity definition. Viral load at presentation and the odds of severe disease were highest among patients with low to intermediate preinfection antibody titers and lowest among those with the highest antibody titers. We showed the effect of preinfection antibody titer on disease severity was mediated by viral load for each of 3 dengue severity outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the association between preinfection anti-DENV antibody titer, serum viral load, and disease severity, and provides evidence for the mechanism of antibody-dependent enhancement in dengue cases.

The aim of this study was to implement a multiplex real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) for ZIKV, CHIKV, and DENV in Paraguay to test patients who were clinically suspected of having dengue. We tested 110 sera from patients who presented to the Hospital de Clinicas in 2016 and had testing for DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1; 40 positive and 70 negative). Using a composite reference standard, we confirmed 51 dengue cases (46.4%): 38/40 NS1 positive and 13/70 NS1 negative. Chikungunya virus and ZIKV were detected in one sample each, both were DENV NS1 negative. The NS1 test demonstrated good agreement with rRT-PCR for DENV. However, multiplex rRT-PCR identified a subset of dengue cases and additional arboviral infections that would not be detected if NS1 assays are relied upon for diagnosis.

However, little is known about its real-world clinical impact as used in routine practice.We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients for whom plasma mNGS (Karius test) was performed for all indications at 5 U.S. institutions over 1.5 years. Comprehensive chart review was performed, and standardized assessment of clinical impact of the mNGS based on the treating team's interpretation of Karius results and patient management was established.A total of 82 Karius tests were evaluated, from 39 (47.6%) adults and 43 (52.4%) children and a total of 53 (64.6%) immunocompromised patients. Karius positivity rate was 50/82 (61.0%), with 25 (50.0%) showing two or more organisms (range, 2-8). The Karius test results led to positive impact in 6 (7.3%), negative impact in 3 (3.7%), no impact in 71 (86.6%), and was indeterminate in 2 (2.4%). Cases with positive Karius result and clinical impact involved bacteria and/or fungi but not DNA viruses or parasites. In 10 patients who underwent 16 additional repeated tests, only one was associated with clinical impact.The real-world impact of the Karius test as currently used in routine clinical practice is limited. Further studies are needed to identify high-yield patient populations, define the complementary role of mNGS to conventional microbiological methods and how best to integrate mNGS into current testing algorithms.

These mutations enable the SARS-CoV-2 to evolve into new strains. Viral quasispecies emerge from de novo mutations that occur in individual patients. In combination, these sets of viral mutations provide distinct genetic fingerprints that reveal the patterns of transmission and have utility in contract tracing.Leveraging thousands of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we performed a viral pangenome analysis to identify conserved genomic sequences. We used a rapid and highly efficient computational approach that relies on k-mers, short tracts of sequence, instead of conventional sequence alignment. Using this method, we annotated viral mutation signatures that were associated with specific strains. Based on these highly conserved viral sequences, we developed a rapid and highly scalable targeted sequencing assay to identify mutations, detect quasispecies and identify mutation signatures from patients. These results were compared to the pangenome genetic fingerprints.We built a k-mer index for thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and identified conserved genomics regions and landscape of mutations across thousands of virus genomes. We delineated mutation profiles spanning common genetic fingerprints (the combination of mutations in a viral assembly) and rare ones that occur in only small fraction of patients. We developed a targeted sequencing assay by selecting primers from the conserved viral genome regions to flank frequent mutations. Using a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples, we identified genetic fingerprints consisting of strain-specific mutations seen across populations and de novo quasispecies mutations localized to individual infections. We compared the mutation profiles of viral samples undergoing analysis with the features of the pangenome.We conducted an analysis for viral mutation profiles that provide the basis of genetic fingerprints. Our study linked pangenome analysis with targeted deep sequenced SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples. We identified quasispecies mutations occurring within individual patients, mutations demarcating dominant species and the prevalence of mutation signatures, of which a significant number were relatively unique. Analysis of these genetic fingerprints may provide a way of conducting molecular contact tracing.

In recent years, recurrent genetic mutations in ras homolog family member A (RHOA), tet methylcytosine dioxygenase dehydrogenase [NADP(+)] 2 (IDH2) have been identified as associated with AITL. However, a deep molecular study assessing both DNA mutations and RNA expression profile combined with digital image analysis is lacking. The present study aimed to evaluate the significance of molecular and morphologic features by high resolution digital image analysis in several cases of AITL. To do so, a total of 18 separate tissues from 10patients with AITL were collected and analyzed. The results identified recurrent mutations in RHOA, TET2, DNMT3A, and IDH2, and demonstrated increased DNA mutations in coding, promoter and CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) binding sites in RHOA mutated AITLs vs. RHOA nonmutated cases, as well as increased overall survival in RHOA mutated patients. In addition, single cell computational digital image analysis morphologically characterized RHOA mutated AITL cells as distinct from cells from RHOA mutation negative patients. Computational analysis of single cell morphological parameters revealed that RHOA mutated cells have decreased eccentricity (more circular) compared with RHOA nonmutated AITL cells. In conclusion, the results from the present study expand our understanding of AITL and demonstrate that there are specific cell biological and morphological manifestations of RHOA mutations in cases of AITL.

VF was defined as not attaining virologic suppression, discontinuing ART, or virologic rebound prompting change in ART.During the study, 2315 PWH began ART. Six companion drugs regimens: efavirenz, of 36 months, 214 (9.2%) PWH experienced VF (2.8 per 100 person-years) and 62 (2.7%) experienced HIVDR (0.8 per 100 person-years). In multivariable analyses, younger age, lower CD4 count, higher virus load, and b-atazanavir were associated with increased VF risk; lower CD4 count, higher virus load, and nevirapine were associated with increased HIVDR risk. Compared with efavirenz, dolutegravir, raltegravir, and b-darunavir were associated with reduced HIVDR risk. Risks of VF and HIVDR were not significantly associated with ART initiation year. Of the 62 PWH with HIVDR, 42 received an non-nucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), transfer inhibitor (INSTI), 5 a protease inhibitor (PI). HIVDR on an NNRTI or first-generation INSTI, 59% acquired dual class resistance and 29% developed tenofovir resistance; those receiving a PI or dolutegravir developed just M184V.Despite the frequent use of contemporary ART regimens, VF and HIVDR continue to occur. Further efforts are required to improve long-term ART virological responses to prevent the consequences of ongoing HIV-1 replication including virus transmission and HIVDR.

In Kenya, continued population growth and associated urbanization are conducive to vector spread in both urban and rural environments, yet mechanisms of viral amplification in vector populations is often overlooked when assessing risks for outbreaks. Thus, the characterization of local arbovirus circulation in mosquito populations is imperative to better inform risk assessments and vector control practices. Aedes species mosquitoes were captured at varying stages of their life cycle during different seasons between January 2014 and May 2016 at four distinct sites in Kenya, and tested for chikungunya (CHIKV), dengue (DENV) and Zika in 45 (5.9%) and DENV in 3 (0.4%) mosquito pools. No ZIKV was detected. Significant regional variation in prevalence was observed, with greater frequency of CHIKV on the coast. DENV was detected exclusively on the coast. Both viruses were detected in immature mosquitoes of both sexes, providing evidence of transovarial transmission of these arboviruses in local mosquitoes. This phenomenon may be driving underlying viral maintenance that may largely contribute to periodic re-emergence among humans in Kenya.

Poor allocation of limited testing resources leads to misutilization of health system resources, which complementary rapid testing tools could ameliorate.To predict SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity based on complete blood count components and patient sex.A retrospective case-control design for collection of data and a logistic regression prediction model was used. Participants were emergency department patients > 18 years old who had concurrent complete blood counts and SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. 33 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and 357 negative patients at Stanford Health Care were used for model training. Validation cohorts consisted of emergency department patients > 18 years old who had concurrent complete blood counts and SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing in Northern California (41 PCR positive, 495 PCR negative), Seattle, Washington (40 PCR positive, 306 PCR negative), Chicago, Illinois (245 PCR positive, 1015 PCR and South Korea (9 PCR positive, 236 PCR negative).A decision support tool that utilizes components of complete blood count and patient sex for prediction of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity demonstrated a C-statistic of 78 %, an optimized sensitivity of 93 %, and generalizability to other emergency department populations. By restricting PCR testing to predicted positive patients in a hypothetical scenario of 1000 patients requiring testing but testing resources limited to 60 % of patients, this tool would allow a 33 % increase in properly allocated resources.A prediction tool based on complete blood count results can better allocate SARS-CoV-2 testing and other health care resources such as personal protective equipment during a pandemic surge.

Testing was restricted to patients with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis. Positive ME Panel results were confirmed before reporting through correlation with direct stain (Gram and Calcofluor white) and CSF Cryptococcal antigen or by repeat ME Panel testing. Outcomes included ME Panel test utilization rate, negative predictive value of non-pleocytic CSF samples, test yield and false-positivity rate, and time to appropriate de-escalation of acyclovir.Results: Restricting testing to pleocytic CSF samples reduced ME Panel utilization by 42.7% (263 vs 459 tests performed) and increased test yield by 61.8% (18.6% vs 11.5% positivity rate; P < 0.01) with application of criteria. The negative predictive value of normal CSF WBC for ME Panel targets was 100% (195/195) for non-viral targets and 98.0% (192/196) overall. All pathogens detected in non-pleocytic CSF samples were herpesviruses. Application of a selective testing algorithm based on repeat testing of non-viral targets avoided 75% (3/4) of false-positive results without generating false-negative results.

The test performance characteristics of the Accula (Mesa Biotech) SARS-CoV-2 POC test need to be evaluated to inform its optimal use.Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess test performance of the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test.Study design: The performance of the Accula test was assessed by comparing results of 100 nasopharyngeal swab samples previously characterized by the Stanford Health Care EUA laboratory-developed test (SHC-LDT) targeting the envelope (E) gene.

Sixteen specimens detected by the SHC-LDT were not detected by the Accula test, and showed low viral load burden with a median cycle threshold value of 37.7. NPA was 100% (95% CI 94.2 to 100%).Conclusion: Compared to the SHC-LDT, the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test showed excellent negative agreement. However, positive agreement was low for samples with low viral load. The false negative rate of the Accula POC test calls for a more thorough evaluation of POC test performance characteristics in clinical settings, and for confirmatory testing in individuals with moderate to high pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2 who test negative on Accula.

Cost-effective algorithms for respiratory virus testing must take into consideration numerous factors, including which patients should be tested, what testing should be performed (for example, antigen testing versus reverse transcription-PCR testing or influenza A/B testing versus testing with a comprehensive respiratory virus panel), and the turnaround time necessary to achieve the desired posttesting outcomes. Despite the clinical impact of respiratory virus infections, the cost-effectiveness of respiratory virus testing is incompletely understood. In this article, we review the literature pertaining to the cost-effectiveness of respiratory virus testing in pediatric and adult patient populations, in emergency department, outpatient, and inpatient clinical settings. Furthermore, we consider the cost-effectiveness of a variety of testing methods, including rapid antigen tests, direct fluorescent antibody assays, and nucleic acid amplification tests.

This study investigates the semi-automated, next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based Vela Diagnostics Sentosa SQ HIV-1 Genotyping in a prospective cohort of HIV-1 infected patients. Two-hundred and sixty-nine samples were successfully sequenced by both NGS and Sanger sequencing. Among the 261 protease/reverse transcriptase (PR/RT) sequences, a mean of 0.37 drug resistance mutations were identified by both Sanger and NGS, 0.08 by NGS alone, and 0.03 by Sanger alone. Among the 50 integrase sequences, a mean of 0.3 drug resistance mutations were detected by both Sanger and NGS, and 0.08 by NGS alone. NGS estimated higher levels of drug resistance to one or more antiretroviral drugs for 6.5% of PR/RT sequences and 4.0% of integrase sequences, whereas Sanger estimated higher levels of drug resistance for 3.8% of PR/RT sequences. Although the samples successfully sequenced by the Sentosa SQ HIV Genotyping Assay demonstrated similar predicted resistance compared with Sanger, 44% of Sentosa runs failed QC requiring 17 additional runs. This semi-automated NGS-based assay may aid in HIV-1 genotypic drug resistance testing, though numerous QC issues were observed when this platform was used in a clinical laboratory setting. With additional refinement, the Sentosa SQ HIV-1 Genotyping Assay may contribute to the global efforts to control HIV-1.

Delayed diagnosis leads to poorer outcomes and early mortality, and continues to impede cancer control disproportionately in LMIC. Integrating self-collected, community-based screening for High Risk-Human Papilloma Virus (HR-HPV) into existent HIV programs is a potential screening method to identify women at high risk for developing high-risk cervical lesions.METHODS: We implemented community-based cross-sectional study on self-collection HR-HPV screening in conjunction with existing community outreach models for the distribution of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the World Health Organization Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) outreach in villages in rural Zimbabwe from January 2017 through May 2017.RESULTS: Overall, there was an 82% response rate: 70% of respondents participated in self-collection and 12% were ineligible for the study (inclusion criteria: age 30-65, not pregnant, with an intact uterus). Women recruited in the first 2-3months of the study had more opportunities to participate and therefore significantly higher participation: 81% participation (additional 11% ineligible), while those with fewer opportunities also had lower participation: 63% (additional 13% ineligible) (p<0.001). Some village outreach centers (N=5/12) had greater than 89% participation.CONCLUSIONS: Integration of HR-HPV screening into existing community outreach models for HIV and immunizations could facilitate population-based screening to scale cancer control and prevention programs in sub-Saharan Africa. Community/village health workers (CHW/VHW) and village outreach programs offer a potential option for cervical cancer screening programs to move towards improving access of sexual and reproductive health resources for women at highest risk.

Single-cohort transcriptomics has not yielded generalizable results or parsimonious, predictive gene sets. We analyzed blood samples of dengue patients from seven gene expression datasets (446 samples, five countries) using an integrated multi-cohort analysis framework and identified a 20-gene set that predicts progression to severe dengue. We validated the predictive power of this 20-gene set in three retrospective dengue datasets (84 samples, three countries) and a prospective Colombia cohort (34 patients), with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89, 100% sensitivity, and 76% specificity. The 20-gene dengue severity scores declined during the diseasecourse, suggesting an infection-triggered host response. This 20-gene set is strongly associated with the progression to severe dengue and represents a predictive signature, generalizable across ages, host genetic factors, and virus strains, with potential implications for the development of a host response-based dengue prognostic assay.

Here we reported an integrated clinicopathologic and molecular profiling analysis of four cases of clear cell adenocarcinoma arising in the urethra or the bladder. Utilizing a clinically validated 130-gene exon-sequencing assay, we identified recurrent pathogenic PIK3CA (p. KRAS (p.G12D) variants in three of four (75%) of the cases. In addition, an APC variant (P.S2310X), a TP53 variant (p.R273C), and a MYC amplification event were identified. The only CCA case without either PIK3CA or KRAS variants has a distinct pathogenesis through BK virus, demonstrated by positive BK virus PCR and SV40 immunohistochemistry. The novel finding of recurrent variants in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway provides not only insights into oncogenesis but also potential clinical therapeutic targets for patients with clear cell adenocarcinoma of the urinary tract.

A new real-time RT-PCR was developed for OROV and reassortant species. The new OROV rRT-PCR proved linear across 6-7 orders of magnitude with a lower limit of 95% detection of 5.6-10.8 copies/L. Upon testing dilutions of OROV genomic RNA, all dilutions with >10 copies/L were detected in both the OROV rRT-PCR and a comparator molecular assay, but the OROV rRT-PCR detected more samples with 10 copies/L (8/14 vs 0/13, respectively, P=0.002). In a set of 100 acute-phase clinical samples from Paraguay patients with a suspected arboviral illness, no patients tested positive for OROV RNA using either assay. The OROV rRT-PCR provides a sensitive molecular assay for the study of this important yet neglected tropical arboviral infection.

The qualitative agreement and quantitative accuracy of Aptima HBV was compared to the COBAS (CAP/CTM). 0.708 (standard error, 0.063; 95% CI, 0.585-0.831). Passing-Bablok regression revealed a regression line of y = 0.953x + 0.075 (95% CI of the slope, 0.883-1.011; to 0.299), and Bland-Altman analysis (Aptima slight negative bias (-0.054 log10 IU/mL, and limits of agreement of -1.093 to 0.984).The Aptima HBV test affords a suitable alternative to CAP/CTM for serum virus load testing and provides a key component of the diagnostic algorithm for the global eradication of viral hepatitis.

The primary objective of this study was to characterize dengue cases in the Central Department, where the majority of cases occur, and identify factors associated with DENV infection.Patients were enrolled from January-May 2018 if they presented with a suspected arboviral illness. Acute-phase specimens (8 days after symptom onset) were tested using rRT-PCR, a rapid diagnostic test for DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and anti-DENV IgM and IgG, ELISA for IgG against NS1 from Zika virus (ZIKV).A total of 231 patients were enrolled (95.2% adults) at two sites: emergency care and an outpatient clinical site. Patients included 119 (51.5%) dengue cases confirmed by rRT-PCR (n=115, 96.6%) NS1 and non-dengue cases were similar, though dengue cases were less likely to reside in a house/apartment or report a previous dengue case. Clinical and laboratory findings associated with dengue included red eyes, absence of sore throat, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. At an emergency care site, 26% of dengue cases (26/100) required hospitalization. In univariate analysis, hospitalization was associated with increased viral load, anti-DENV IgG, and thrombocytopenia. Among dengue cases that tested positive IgG against ZIKV NS1, the odds of DENV NS1 detection in the acute phase were decreased 10-fold (OR 0.1, 0.0-0.3).Findings from a predominantly adult population demonstrate clinical and laboratory factors associated with DENV infections and the potential severity of dengue in this group. The combination of viral load and specific IgG antibodies warrant further study as a prognostic to identify patients at risk for severe disease.

PCR cycle threshold (CT) was used to measure amplifiable cfDNA.In spiked samples, median CT for M. tuberculosis, S. enterica, and EBV cfDNA was significantly lower in blood collected in K2EDTA than Streck and PAXgene blood collection tubes, and significantly lower in EDTA-urine than Streck-urine. Blood and urine samples from TB patients preserved with K2EDTA and Tris-EDTA, respectively, showed significantly lower median M. tuberculosis CT compared with Streck blood collection tube and urine preservative. Processing delay increased median pathogen CT for Streck and PAXgene but not K2EDTA blood samples, and for urine preserved with Streck reagent but not EDTA. Double spin compared with single spin plasma separation increased median pathogen CT regardless of blood collection tube. No differences were observed between whole urine and supernatant, and between fresh and thawed plasma and urine after 24 weeks at -80 C. Larger plasma and urine volume in contrived and patient samples showed a significantly lower median M. tuberculosis CT. These findings suggest large volume single spin K2EDTA-plasma and EDTA-whole urine with up to 24-hour processing delay may optimize pcfDNA detection.

Clinical features of dengue often overlap with other infections and molecular diagnostic tools are not readily accessible to clinicians at hospitals. In addition, the prediction of plasma leakage in dengue is also difficult. Hematocrit level and ultrasound scans (combined with clinical parameters) are helpful to detect plasma leakage once it has happened, not before.Colombo Dengue Study (CDS) is a prospective cohort study of clinically suspected adult dengue patients recruited from the National hospital of Sri Lanka (within the first 3days of fever) that aimed to a) identify clinical and basic laboratory test parameters to differentiate dengue from non-dengue fever, b) evaluate the comparative efficacy of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for dengue diagnosis (vs. NS1 antigen test and RT-qPCR) and c) identify early associations that are predictive of plasma leakage or severe dengue. The basic laboratory tests considered here included hematological parameters, serum biochemistry and inflammatory markers.Only 70% of clinically suspected patients were confirmed as having dengue by either the NS1 antigen test or RT-qPCR. On a Bayesian latent class model which assumes no \"gold standard\", LAMP performed equally or better than RT-qPCR and NS1 antigen test respectively. When confirmed dengue patients were compared with others, the earlier group had significantly lower lymphocyte counts and higher aspartate aminotransferase levels (AST) within the first 3days of fever. Confirmed dengue patients with plasma leakage had a lower mean age and a higher median baseline AST level compared to those without plasma leakage (p<0.05).Clinical suspicion overestimates the true number of dengue patients. RT-LAMP is a potentially useful low-cost diagnostic tool for dengue diagnosis. Confirmed dengue patients had significantly higher AST levels and lower lymphocyte counts in early disease compared to others. In confirmed dengue patients, younger age and a higher AST level in early infection were associated with subsequent plasma leakage.

However, the understanding of the molecular correlates of severity is limited, partly due to difficulties in defining the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that contain DENV RNA in vivo. Accordingly, there are currently no biomarkers predictive of progression to severe dengue (SD). Bulk transcriptomics data are difficult to interpret because blood consists of multiple cell types that may react differently to infection. Here, we applied virus-inclusive single-cell RNA-seq approach (viscRNA-Seq) to profile transcriptomes of thousands of single PBMCs derived early in the course of disease from six dengue patients and four healthy controls and to characterize distinct leukocyte subtypes that harbor viral RNA (vRNA). Multiple IFN response genes, particularly MX2 in naive B cells and CD163 in CD14+ CD16+ monocytes, were up-regulated in a cell-specific manner before progression to SD. The majority of vRNA-containing cells in the blood of two patients who progressed to SD were naive IgM B cells expressing the CD69 and CXCR4 receptors and various antiviral genes, followed by monocytes. Bystander, non-vRNA-containing B cells also demonstrated immune activation, and IgG1 plasmablasts from two patients exhibited clonal expansions. Lastly, assembly of the DENV genome sequence revealed diversity at unexpected sites. This study presents a multifaceted molecular elucidation of natural dengue infection in humans with implications for any tissue and viral infection and proposes candidate biomarkers for prediction of SD.

Using three serotype-specific real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) and circulation of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) strains was previously investigated in a prospective cohort of MFexican children, their contacts, and nearby sewage. Subsequently, a deep sequencing approach targeting the P1 genomic region was applied to characterize OPV strains previously detected by rRT-PCR. Amplifiable RNA was obtained for sequencing from 40.3% (58/144) stool samples and 71.4% (15/21) of sewage using nucleic acids extracted directly from primary rRT-PCR-positive specimens. Sequencing detected one or more OPV serotypes in 62.1% (36/58) of stool and 53.3% (8/15) of sewage samples. All stool and sewage samples in which poliovirus was not detected by deep sequencing contained at least one non-polio enterovirus C (NPEV-C) strain. To improve screening specificity, a two-step, OPV serotype-specific multiplex rRT-PCR was evaluated. In stool specimens, the overall agreement between the original assays and the multiplex was 70.3%. By serotype, (S1), 65.6% for most original rRT-PCR positive/multiplex rRT-PCR negative results were collected in the summer and fall months, consistent with NPEV-C circulation patterns. In conclusion, this deep sequencing approach allowed for the characterization of OPV sequences directly from clinical samples and facilitated the implementation of a more specific multiplex rRT-PCR for OPV detection and serotyping.

The patient had a history of benign prostatic hypertrophy and urinary retention that required self-catheterization to relieve high post-voiding residual volumes. At 7 months post-transplant, he was found to have a urinary tract infection, moderate hydronephrosis of the transplanted kidney, and severe hydroureteronephrosis of the native left kidney and ureter, and underwent native left nephrectomy and transurethral resection of the prostate. Histopathologic examination of kidney and prostate tissue revealed CMV inclusions consistent with invasive CMV disease. This case highlights that CMV may extend beyond the kidney allograft to involve other parts of the genitourinary tract, including the native kidneys and prostate. Furthermore, we highlight the tissue-specific risk factors that preceded CMV tissue invasion. In addition to concurrent diagnoses, health care providers should have a low threshold for considering late-onset CMV disease in high-risk solid organ transplant recipients presenting with signs and symptoms of genitourinary tract pathology.

Low VE has been attributed to mismatches between the vaccine and circulating influenza strains and to the vaccine's elicitation of protective immunity in only a subset of the population. The low H3N2 VE in the 2012-2013 season was attributed to egg-adaptive mutations that created antigenic mismatch between the actual vaccine strain (IVR-165) and both the intended vaccine strain (A/Victoria/361/2011) and the predominant circulating strains (clades 3C.2 and 3C.3).We investigated the basis of low VE in 2012-2013 by determining whether vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were infected by different viral strains and by assessing the serologic responses to IVR-165, A/Victoria/361/2011, and 3C.2 and 3C.3 strains in an adult cohort before and after vaccination.We found no significant genetic differences between the strains that infected vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Vaccination increased titers to A/Victoria/361/2011 and 3C.2 and 3C.3 representative strains as much as to IVR-165. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that vaccination boosted cross-reactive immune responses instead of specific responses against unique vaccine epitopes. Only approximately one-third of the cohort achieved a 4-fold increase in titer.In contrast to analyses based on ferret studies, low H3N2 VE in 2012-2013 in adults does not appear to be due to egg adaptation of the vaccine strain. Instead, low VE might have been caused by low vaccine immunogenicity in a subset of the population.

We report 6 cases of T-cell lymphomas with Treg phenotype based on diffuse positivity for FOXP3 in tumor cells. The patients showed a median age of 56years with a male predominance. Sites of disease included lymph nodes (4), skin (2), subcutaneous tissue (1) and bone marrow (1). All cases showed monomorphic large cells, some with Hodgkin-like or anaplastic cells. All cases expressed pan T cell markers and lacked cytotoxic markers; one case showed diffuse PD1 staining. Only one case harbored human T-lymphotrophic virus (HTLV)-1 DNA within tumor cells and was classified as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Among 5 HTLV1-negative cases, 3 were classified as peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS) and 2 fulfilled criteria for ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) with diffuse and strong CD30 positivity. We concluded that Treg phenotype may be rarely seen in HTLV1-negative cases, such as PTCL, NOS and ALK-negative ALCL. Our findings expand the spectrum of T-cell lymphomas with regulatory phenotype and suggest that consideration should be given to HTLV1 DNA testing in the appropriate clinical setting to rule out ATLL.

We compared the performance of an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) NGS assay, the Sentosa SQ HIV genotyping assay for HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing, with Sanger sequencing on 138 protease/reverse transcriptase (RT) and 39 integrase sequences. The NGS assay used a 5% threshold for reporting low-frequency variants. The level of complete plus partial nucleotide sequence concordance between Sanger sequencing and NGS was 99.9%. Among the 138 protease/RT sequences, a mean of 6.4 DRMs was identified by both Sanger and NGS, a mean of 0.5 DRM was detected by NGS alone, and a mean of 0.1 DRM was detected by Sanger sequencing alone. Among the 39 integrase sequences, a mean of 1.6 DRMs was detected by both Sanger sequencing and NGS and a mean of 0.15 DRM was detected by NGS alone. Compared with Sanger sequencing, NGS estimated higher levels of resistance to one or more antiretroviral drugs for 18.2% of protease/RT sequences and 5.1% of integrase sequences. There was little evidence for technical artifacts in the NGS sequences, but the G-to-A hypermutation was detected in three samples. In conclusion, the IVD NGS assay evaluated in this study was highly concordant with Sanger sequencing. At the 5% threshold for reporting minority variants, NGS appeared to attain a modestly increased sensitivity for detecting low-frequency DRMs without compromising sequence accuracy.

While encephalitis and delayed engraftment are well-documented complications of HHV-6 following HSCT, the extent to which HHV-6 viremia causes disease in children is controversial. We performed a retrospective review of HHV-6 reactivation and possible manifestations in pediatric allogeneic HSCT patients at a single institution. Of 89 children and young adults who underwent allogeneic HSCT over a three-and-a-half-year period, 34 patients reactivated HHV-6 early post-transplant. Unrelated donor stem cell source and lack of antiviral prophylaxis were risk factors for the development of HHV-6 viremia. Viremia correlated with the presence of acute graft-versus-host disease, but not chronic graft-versus-host disease. We identified two subgroups within the viremic patients-a high-risk viremic and tissue-positive group that reactivated HHV-6 and had suspected end-organ disease and a low-risk viremic but asymptomatic group that reactivated HHV-6 but did not exhibit symptoms or signs of end-organ disease. Peak viral load was found to be strongly associated with mortality. Prospective studies in larger numbers of patients are needed to further investigate the role of HHV-6 in causing symptomatic end-organ disease as well as the association of viral load with mortality.

The early detection of CHIKV and ZIKV in mosquitoes may help to understand the dynamics of the diseases in high-risk areas, and to design data based epidemiological surveillance to activate the preparedness and response of the public health system and vector control programs. This study was done to detect ZIKV and CHIKV viruses in naturally infected fed female Aedes aegypti (L.) mosquitoes from active epidemic urban areas in Ecuador. Pools (n=193; 22 pools) and individuals (n=22) of field collected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes from high-risk arboviruses infection sites in Ecuador were analyzed for the presence of CHIKV and ZIKV using RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that both ZIKV and CHIKV viruses circulating in Ecuador correspond to the Asian lineages. Minimum infection rate (MIR) of CHIKV for Esmeraldas city was 2.3% and the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) was 3.3%. The minimum infection rate (MIR) of ZIKV for Portoviejo city was 5.3% and for Manta city was 2.1%. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for Portoviejo city was 6.9% and 2.6% for Manta city.

The assay uses a single-tube multiplex PCR to amplify highly conserved virus genomic regions without the need for previous virus enrichment or host nucleic acid subtraction. Multiplex sample sequencing was performed using Illumina MiSeq, and reads were aligned to a database of target sequences. Analytical and clinical performance was evaluated using reference viruses spiked into human plasma, as well as patient plasma and nonplasma samples, including bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and tissue from immunocompromised transplant recipients.For the virus spike-in samples, mVseq's analytical sensitivity and dynamic range were similar to quantitative PCR (qPCR). In clinical specimens, mVseq showed substantial agreement with single-target qPCR (92%; k statistic, 0.77; 259 of 282 viral tests); however, clinical sensitivity was reduced (81%), ranging from 62% to 100% for specific viruses. In 12 of the 47 patients tested, mVseq identified previously unknown BK virus, human herpesvirus-7, and Epstein-Barr virus infections that were confirmed by qPCR.Our results reveal factors that can influence clinical sensitivity, such as high levels of host DNA background and loss of detection in coinfections when 1 virus was at much higher concentration than the others. The mVseq assay is flexible and scalable to incorporate RNA viruses, emerging viruses of interest, and other pathogens important in transplant recipients.

In this study, we describe an internally controlled, multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for the detection of DENV and YFV. The DENV-YFV assay demonstrated specific detection and had a dynamic range of 2.0-8.0 log10 copies/L of eluate for each DENV serotype and was similar to a published pan-DENV assay: 48/48 acute-phase samples from dengue cases were detected in both assays. For YFV detection, mock samples were prepared with nine geographically diverse YFV isolates over a range of concentrations. The DENV-YFV assay detected 62/65 replicates, whereas 54/65 were detected YFV rRT-PCR. Given the reemergence of DENV and YFV in areas around the world, the DENV-YFV assay should be a useful tool to narrow the differential diagnosis and provide early case detection.

MAYV RNA can be detected in plasma during the first 3-5days of illness, but only a single rRT-PCR has been fully evaluated in the literature.To develop an rRT-PCR for MAYV and evaluate assay performance using human plasma and urine samples spiked with different MAYV strains.A MAYV rRT-PCR targeting a region of the 5'UTR and nsp1 gene was designed from the alignment of all complete-genome MAYV sequences to be compatible with existing laboratory protocols. The assay was evaluated using human samples spiked with six MAYV strains, including strains from each of the three genotypes.The linear range of the MAYV rRT-PCR extended from 1.0 to 8.0 log10copies/L, and the lower limit of 95% detection was 8.2copies/L. No detection was observed when the MAYV rRT-PCR was tested with genomic RNA from related arboviruses. The assay demonstrated linear amplification of all 6 MAYV strains when spiked into human plasma samples as well as 2 strains spiked into urine.We report the design and evaluation of an rRT-PCR for MAYV. Given the concern for MAYV emergence in the Americas and the few molecular tests that have been evaluated in the literature, this assay should provide a useful diagnostic for patients with an acute febrile illness.

By contrast with influenza viruses, little is known about the contemporaneous global diversity of these viruses, and the relevance of such for development of pharmaceutical interventions. Although far less advanced than for influenza, antiviral drugs and vaccines are in different stages of development for several of these viruses, but no interventions have been licensed. This scarcity of global genetic data represents a substantial knowledge gap and impediment to the eventual licensing of new antiviral drugs and vaccines for NIRVs. Enhanced genetic surveillance will assist and boost research and development into new antiviral drugs and vaccines for these viruses. Additionally, understanding the global diversity of respiratory viruses is also part of emerging disease preparedness, because non-human coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses have been listed as priority concerns in a recent WHO research and development blueprint initiative for emerging infectious diseases. In this Personal View, we explain further the rationale for expanding the genetic database of NIRVs and emphasise the need for greater investment in this area of research.

In total, 158 patients (41.0%) had malaria and 32 patients (8.3%) had CHIKV infections. Compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction, microscopy demonstrated a percent positive agreement of 49.7%. The percentage of malaria cases detected by microscopy varied significantly between clinical sites. Arboviral infections were the clinical diagnosis for patients on the Indian Ocean coast (91 of 238, 38.2%) significantly more often than patients in the Lake Victoria region (2 of 145, 1.4%; P < .001). However, detection of CHIKV infections was significantly higher in the Lake Victoria region (19 of 145 [13.1%] vs 13 of 239 [5.4%]; P = .012).The clinical diagnosis of patients with an acute febrile illness, even when aided by microscopy, remains inaccurate in malaria-endemic areas, contributing to inappropriate management decisions.

To date, evaluation of these mutations has been performed primarily on culture-enriched isolates by using conventional Sanger sequencing. We therefore developed a culture-independent, deep-sequencing method targeting the 5' untranslated region genomic region to characterize vaccine-related poliovirus variants. Error analysis of the deep-sequencing method demonstrated reliable detection of poliovirus mutations at levels of <1%, depending on read depth. Sequencing of viral nucleic acids from the stool of vaccinated, asymptomatic children and their close contacts collected during a prospective cohort study in Veracruz, Mexico, revealed no vaccine-derived polioviruses. This was expected given that the longest duration between sequenced sample collection and the end of the most recent national immunization week was 66 days. However, we identified many low-level variants (<5%) distributed across the 5' UTR and P1 genomic region in all three Sabin serotypes, as well as vaccine-related viruses with multiple canonical mutations associated with phenotypic reversion present at high levels (>90%). These results suggest that monitoring emerging vaccine-related poliovirus variants by deep sequencing may aid in the poliovirus endgame and efforts to ensure global polio eradication.

Pre-analytical variables can significantly impact the stability of RNA in urine.To determine optimal specimen processing protocols that would maximize detection of ZIKV RNA in urine by real-time, reverse transcriptase PCR, we investigated the effect of temperature, initial ZIKV concentration, use of nucleic acid stabilizers, and time on ZIKV RNA levels. Urine samples from healthy donors were spiked with ZIKV using the Exact Diagnostics() ZIKV Verification Panel, a commercially available panel composed of heat-inactivated ZIKV, at concentrations copies/mL room temperature, 4C, or -80C and frozen aliquots were exposed to no stabilizer (urine), Buffer ATL (Qiagen, Germantown, MD), or DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA).ZIKV RNA levels in urine declined steadily at room temperature, though was not significant by 48hours (ZIKV-high, p=0.09; ZIKV-low, p=0.20). ZIKV RNA titers were consistently when stored at 4C, suggesting that storage at 4C can slow the progression of RNA degradation. Freezing urine samples at -80C resulted in a significant loss of detectable ZIKV RNA in the ZIKV-low group. ZIKV RNA was detected in 5/6 replicates at 3 days, 1/6 replicates at 10 days, and 1/3 replicates at 30 days, with findings reproducible on repeat testing. Presence of either nucleic acid stabilizer in urine corrected this effect, and resulted in recovery of ZIKV RNA in all replicates. Use of a nucleic acid stabilizer in the ZIKV-high group did not add incremental benefit for the detection or quantitation of ZIKV RNA.ZIKV RNA is prone to degradation in urine with loss of detectable virus even when specimens are frozen at -80C for 10 days. Detection of ZIKV-positive urine samples, particularly those containing low ZIKV titers may be aided with the addition of a nucleic acid stabilizer during urine specimen processing.

We report the results of a retrospective chart review performed to assess the incidence, risk factors, and prognostic significance of PEF in pediatric HCT recipient at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital of Stanford University. A total of 119 patients undergoing HCT between January 2010 and December 2013 were selected through the hospital's Pediatric Stem Cell Transplant Program database. A retrospective chart review, including review of documentation, correspondence, imaging reports, laboratory values, and death records, was performed to collect data. The overall incidence of PEF in our population was 21%. Risk factors for the development of PEF included unrelated donor transplants and cord blood as the stem cell source (P=.005), whereas HLA mismatch approached significance (P=.05). The risk for development of PEF was found to not be significantly associated with acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), age at transplantation, sex, conditioning regimen, or viral reactivation status. Of interest, 6 of the 119 patients were found to have transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA). Four of those 6 patients developed PEF, suggesting TA-TMA as a risk factor for PEF. Eight of the 25 patients who developed PEF (32%) required pericardiocentesis. Five out of the 8 patients requiring pericardiocentesis died owing to causes unrelated to the procedure or to PEF itself. Pericardial fluid testing in 4 of these patients (50%) was positive for human herpesvirus 6, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and/or adenovirus. Finally, of significant interest, patients with PEF had a statistically significant higher likelihood of mortality compared with those without PEF (44% versus 17%; P=.007).

However, the proportion of NPC patients whose tumors are associated with EBV vary with geographic location, and there are a variety of assays for plasma EBV. To develop the level of evidence needed to demonstrate the clinical utility of plasma EBV DNA detection for NPC patients and encourage widespread adoption of this biomarker test in clinical laboratories, validated harmonized assays are needed. In 2015, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) convened a Workshop on Harmonization of EBV Testing for Nasopharyngeal Cancer, where experts in head and neck oncology and laboratory medicine addressed the limitations of currently available polymerase chain reaction-based EBV DNA quantitation assays and discussed strategies for advancing the development of harmonized EBV DNA assays and their appropriate clinical use. This article presents the key recommendations to direct future efforts in assay harmonization and validation.

The 1st WHO International Standard for BKV (primary standard) was introduced in 2016 as a common calibrator for improving the harmonization of BKV nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) and enabling comparisons of biological measurements worldwide. Here, we evaluated the Altona RealStar BKV assay (Altona) and calibrated the results to the international unit (IU) using the Exact Diagnostics BKV verification panel, a secondary standard traceable to the primary standard. The primary and secondary standards on Altona had nearly identical linear regression equations (primary standard, Y = 1.05X - 0.28, R(2) = 0.99; secondary standard, Y = 1.04X - 0.26, R(2) = 0.99) and conversion factors (primary standard, 1.11 IU/copy; secondary standard, 1.09 IU/copy). A comparison of Altona in IU/ml versus copies/ml using Passing-Bablok regression revealed similar regression lines, no proportional bias, and improvement in the systematic bias (95% confidence interval of intercepts: copies/ml, -0.52 to -1.01; IU/ml, 0.07 to -0.36). Additionally, Bland-Altman analyses revealed a clinically significant reduction of bias when results were reported in IU/ml (IU/ml, -0.10 log10; copies/ml, -0.70 log10). These results indicate that the use of a common calibrator improved the agreement between the two assays. As clinical laboratories worldwide use calibrators traceable to the primary standard to harmonize BKV NAAT results, we anticipate improved interassay comparisons with a potential for establishing broadly applicable quantitative BKV DNA load cutoffs for clinical practice.

Approximately 60% of adults are CMV seropositive indicating previous exposure. Following resolution of primary infection, CMV remains in a latent state. Reactivation is controlled by memory T cells in healthy individuals; transplant recipients have reduced memory T cell function due to chronic immunosuppressive therapies. In this study, CD8(+) T cell responses to CMV polypeptides IE-1 and pp65 were analyzed in sixteen CMV seropositive renal and cardiac transplant recipients longitudinally pre- and post-transplant. All patients received standard of care maintenance immunosuppression, antiviral prophylaxis and CMV viral load monitoring, with approximately half receiving T cell depleting induction therapy. The frequency of CMV-responsive CD8(+) T cells, defined by production of effector molecules in response to CMV peptides, increased during the course of a year post-transplant. The increase commenced after the completion of antiviral prophylaxis, and these T cells tended to be terminally differentiated effector cells. Based on this small cohort, these data suggest that even in the absence of disease, antigenic exposure may continually shape the CMV-responsive T cell population post-transplant.

Guayaquil, Ecuador, has a tropical climate and experiences frequent outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya virus, and in December 2015, ZIKV was identified. Given the well-documented effects of ZIKV in pregnancy, including microcephaly, we tested for the presence of ZIKV in both plasma and cervical cytology of pregnant women. We report the identification of a population of pregnant women with a high incidence of ZIKV infection detected in the plasma and lower reproductive tract. A case-control study was performed to determine the incidence of ZIKV infection among low-income, pregnant women at risk for preterm delivery compared to matched controls. Plasma and cervical cytology specimens were tested for ZIKV by rRT-PCR. Fifty-nine pregnant women were enrolled. ZIKV (32/59) overall: controls. ZIKV detection in plasma and cervical cytology specimens demonstrated good agreement. Overall, outcomes for neonates born to ZIKV-positive and ZIKV-negative mothers were similar. However, two neonates were born with microcephaly to case mothers who were ZIKV positive. We report a high incidence of ZIKV infection (54%) in a distinctive population in Guayaquil, Ecuador. We identify ZIKV in cervical samples that correlates with ZIKV in the plasma. These data raise concerns regarding the breadth of the ZIKV epidemic in Ecuador and demonstrate the utility of cervical cytology specimens for ZIKV testing.

Results from 554 laboratories participating in proficiency testing surveys for quantitative PCR assays of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) were evaluated to determine overall result variability and then were stratified by assay manufacturer. The impact of calibration to international units/ml (CMV and EBV) on variability was also determined. Viral loads showed a high degree of interlaboratory variability for all tested viruses, with interquartile ranges as high as 1.46 log10 copies/ml and the overall range for a given sample up to 5.66 log10 copies/ml. Some improvement in result variability was seen when international units were adopted. This was particularly the case for EBV viral load results. Variability in viral load results remains a challenge across all viruses tested here; introduction of international quantitative standards may help reduce variability and does so more or less markedly for certain viruses.

Progression to DHF/DSS is attributed to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE); however, because only a fraction of infections occurring in the presence of RNNIg advance to DHF/DSS, the presence of RNNIg alone cannot account for disease severity. We discovered that DHF/DSS patients respond to infection by producing IgGs with enhanced affinity for the activating Fc receptor to platelet reduction in vivo and was a significant risk factor for thrombocytopenia. Thus, therapeutics and vaccines restricting production of afucosylated, IgG1 RNNIg during infection may prevent ADE of DENV disease.

There are no standard diagnostic criteria for CMV pulmonary disease beyond histopathology findings on lung tissue, which is challenging to obtain in pediatric patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid is easier to obtain. Since CMV remains latent after primary infection and can potentially reactivate due to any inflammatory response, CMV detection in BAL specimen may not indicate acute CMV pulmonary disease. Thus, we describe the clinical manifestations and outcomes of pediatric patients with CMV detection in BAL fluid.We reviewed the clinical, radiologic, and laboratory data of patients <19 years old with a BAL specimen positive for CMV during a 5-year period.Thirty-four encounters in 29 patients were found with CMV detected in their BAL specimen. Half (17/34) of the encounters were in immunocompromised patients. CMV, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was the most common positive test. Forty-seven percent of the patients had other infections detected in BAL specimens. The majority of patients were never treated for CMV and resolved their acute respiratory illness. Only one patient had probable CMV pulmonary disease.CMV is frequently recovered from BAL specimens but does not usually indicate acute CMV pulmonary disease. We would suggest that other diagnoses be considered first, even if CMV is recovered.

No cases of ONNV infection were identified in serum from 385 Kenyan children who presented with an acute febrile illness. Additionally, ONNV was not detected in 120 mosquito pools collected in coastal and western Kenya. The ONNV rRT-PCR demonstrated good analytical sensitivity when performed in monoplex or as a component of an ONNV-CHIKV duplex assay.

Homotypic re-infections with DENV-1, -2, and -3 occurred 325-621 days after the initial infection. Each patient experienced one symptomatic dengue case and one DENV-positive C case, and two patients presented with symptomatic dengue during their second infection.

In conclusion, the Aptima HIV-1 Quant Dx assay provides a suitable alternative for HIV-1 monitoring in plasma and DBS.

The purpose of this review is to describe new molecular diagnostics for Leptospira and discuss advancements in the use of available methods.Efforts have been focused on improving the clinical sensitivity of Leptospira detection using molecular methods. In this review, we describe a reoptimized pathogenic species-specific real-time PCR (targeting lipL32) that has demonstrated improved sensitivity, findings by two groups that real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays targeting the 16S rrs gene can improve detection, and two new loop-mediated amplification techniques. Quantitation of leptospiremia, detection in different specimen types, and the complementary roles played by molecular detection and microscopic agglutination testing will be discussed. Finally, a protocol for Leptospira strain subtyping using variable number tandem repeat targets and high-resolution melting will be described.Molecular diagnostics have an established role for the diagnosis of leptospirosis and provide an actionable diagnosis in the acute setting. The use of real-time reverse-transcription PCR for testing serum/plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, when available, may improve the detection of Leptospira without decreasing clinical specificity.

We describe an individual with transmitted four-class drug resistance whose virus sequence had the previously uncharacterized mutation Q148N. Infectious molecular HIV-1 clones containing Q148N alone and in combination with G140S demonstrated 2.4-4.5 reduced elvitegravir susceptibility depending on the virus's genetic context but retained susceptibility to raltegravir and dolutegravir. This level of reduced elvitegravir susceptibility is lower than that observed with Q148H/K/R and in fact the infected individual responded to an initial treatment regimen containing tenofovir/emtricitabine/elvitegravir/cobicistat. Q148N was associated with a higher replication capacity than Q148H, suggesting that this mutation may be more fit in the absence of selective INSTI therapy.

The differentiation of these infections is important for epidemiologic surveillance as well as clinical care, though widely-used molecular diagnostics for DENV and CHIKV require the performance of two to four separate PCR reactions for detection.In the current study, we sought to develop and evaluate a single-reaction, multiplex real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) for the DENV and CHIKV (the pan-DENV-CHIKV rRT-PCR).From an alignment of all genome sequences in GenBank, a new CHIKV rRT-PCR was designed for use in multiplex with a previously described assay for pan-DENV detection. Analytical evaluation was performed in accordance with published recommendations, and the pan-DENV-CHIKV rRT-PCR was clinically compared to reference molecular diagnostics for DENV and CHIKV using 182 serum samples from suspected cases in Managua, Nicaragua.The pan-DENV-CHIKV rRT-PCR had a dynamic range extending from 7.0 to 2.0 log10copies/L for each DENV serotype and CHIKV, and the lower limits of 95% detection were 7.9-37.4copies/L. The pan-DENV-CHIKV rRT-PCR detected DENV in 81 patients compared to 75 using a reference, hemi-nested DENV RT-PCR, and it demonstrated perfect agreement with a reference CHIKV rRT-PCR (54 positive samples).The single-reaction, multiplex format of the pan-DENV-CHIKV rRT-PCR, combined with sensitive detection of both viruses, has the potential to improve detection while decreasing testing costs and streamlining molecular workflow.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, with CMV pneumonitis among the most severe manifestations of infection. Although bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples are frequently tested for CMV, the clinical utility of such testing remains uncertain. Methods. Retrospective analysis of adult patients undergoing BAL testing via CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR), shell vial culture, and conventional viral culture between August 2008 and May 2011 was performed. Cytomegalovirus diagnostic methods were compared with a comprehensive definition of CMV pneumonitis that takes into account signs and symptoms, underlying host immunodeficiency, radiographic findings, and laboratory results. Results. Seven hundred five patients underwent 1077 bronchoscopy episodes with 1090 BAL specimens sent for CMV testing. Cytomegalovirus-positive patients were more likely to be hematopoietic cell transplant recipients (26% vs 8%, P < .0001) and less likely to have an underlying condition not typically associated with lung disease (3% vs 20%, P < .0001). Histopathology was performed in only 17.3% of CMV-positive bronchoscopy episodes. When CMV diagnostic methods were evaluated against the comprehensive definition, the sensitivity and specificity of PCR, shell vial culture, and conventional culture were 91.3% and 94.6%, 54.4% and 97.4%, and 28.3% and 96.5%, respectively. Compared with culture, PCR provided significantly higher sensitivity and negative predictive value (P .001), without significantly lower positive predictive value. Cytomegalovirus quantitation did not improve test performance, resulting in a receiver operating characteristic curve with an area under the curve of 0.53. Conclusions. Cytomegalovirus PCR combined with a comprehensive clinical definition provides a pragmatic approach for the diagnosis of CMV pneumonitis.

A fundamental limitation is the small amounts of specimen that can be obtained from the eye. Molecular diagnostics can circumvent this limitation and have been shown to be more sensitive than conventional culture. The purpose of this review is to describe new molecular methods and to discuss the applications of next-generation sequencing-based approaches in the diagnosis of ocular infections.Efforts have focused on improving the sensitivity of pathogen detection using molecular methods. This review describes a new molecular target for Toxoplasma gondii-directed polymerase chain reaction assays. Molecular diagnostics for Chlamydia trachomatis and Acanthamoeba species are also discussed. Finally, we describe a hypothesis-free approach, metagenomic deep sequencing, which can detect DNA and RNA pathogens from a single specimen in one test. In some cases, this method can provide the geographic location and timing of the infection.Pathogen-directed PCRs have been powerful tools in the diagnosis of ocular infections for over 20 years. The use of next-generation sequencing-based approaches, when available, will further improve sensitivity of detection with the potential to improve patient care.

The assay targets sequences in two EBOV genes, lowering the risk for new variants to escape detection in the test. The objective of this report is to present analytical characteristics of the Xpert Ebola Assay on whole blood samples.This study evaluated the assay's analytical sensitivity, analytical specificity, inclusivity and exclusivity performance in whole blood specimens. EBOV RNA, inactivated EBOV, and infectious EBOV were used as targets. The dynamic range of the assay, the inactivation of virus, and specimen stability were also evaluated. The lower limit of detection (LoD) for the assay using inactivated virus was estimated 73 copies/mL (95% CI: 51-97 copies/mL). The LoD for infectious virus was estimated to be 1 plaque-forming unit/mL, and for RNA to be 232 copies/mL (95% CI 163-302 copies/mL). The assay viruses, Yambuku-Mayinga, Makona-C07, Yambuku-Ecran, Gabon-Ilembe, and Kikwit-956210, and correctly excluded all non-EBOV isolates tested. The conditions used by Xpert Ebola for inactivation of infectious virus reduced EBOV titer by 6 logs.In summary, we found the Xpert Ebola Assay to have high analytical sensitivity and specificity for the detection of EBOV in whole blood. It offers ease of use, fast turnaround time, and remote monitoring. The test has an efficient viral inactivation protocol, fulfills inclusivity and exclusivity criteria, and has specimen stability characteristics consistent with the need for decentralized testing. The simplicity of the assay should enable testing in a wide variety of laboratory settings, including remote laboratories that are not capable of performing highly complex nucleic acid amplification tests, and during outbreaks where time to detection is critical.

Previously, our group described a multiplex NAAT for the detection of dengue virus, Leptospira, and Plasmodium species with a callout for P. falciparum (the DLM assay) that demonstrated sensitive detection of P. falciparum from plasma samples during initial evaluation. In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of P. falciparum detection in febrile Nigerian patients using the DLM assay, microscopy, and a rapid diagnostic test (BinaxNOW Malaria). Assay performances were compared using a composite reference, which was considered positive if malaria was detected by two or more methods. Serum (n = 182) or plasma (n = 148) from 317 patients was tested; the average sample volume was 70 l (range, 5 to 300 l). The sensitivity and specificity of the DLM assay were 97.1% and 93.5%, respectively. The sensitivity of the malaria rapid diagnostic test (98.1%) was similar to that of the DLM assay, and both proved significantly more sensitive than microscopy (79%; P < 0.0001). When analysis was limited to samples with 75 l of serum or plasma, the sensitivity of the DLM assay improved to 99% and specificity was 97.5%. For P. falciparum cases, cycle threshold values in the DLM assay correlated with the parasite density detected by microscopy (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, P < 0.0001). In conclusion, malaria detection using the DLM assay on serum or plasma is more sensitive than and equal in specificity to microscopy in patients with P. falciparum malaria.

Herein, we review the application of NGS in clinical microbiology, focusing on genotypic resistance testing, direct detection of unknown disease-associated pathogens in clinical specimens, investigation of microbial population diversity in the human host, and strain typing. We have organized the review into three main sections: i) applications in clinical virology, ii) applications in clinical bacteriology, mycobacteriology, and mycology, and iii) validation, quality control, and maintenance of proficiency. Although NGS holds enormous promise for clinical infectious disease testing, many challenges remain, including automation, standardizing technical protocols and bioinformatics pipelines, improving reference databases, establishing proficiency testing and quality control measures, and reducing cost and turnaround time, all of which would be necessary for widespread adoption of NGS in clinical microbiology laboratories.

As BKV-specific treatments are limited, immunologic-based therapies may be a promising and novel therapeutic option for transplant recipients with persistent BKV infection. Here, we describe a whole-genome, deep sequencing methodology and bioinformatics pipeline that identifies amplified using long-range PCR with four inverse primer sets and fragmentation libraries were sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM. An error model and variant calling algorithm were developed to accurately identify rare variants. 65 samples from 18 pediatric HCT and kidney recipients with quantifiable BKV DNAemia underwent whole-genome sequencing. Limited genetic variation was observed. The median number of amino acid variants identified per sample was 8 (range 2-37, interquartile range 10), with the majority of variants (77%) detected at a frequency of less than 5%. When normalized for length, there was no statistical difference in the median number of variants across all genes. Similarly, the predominant virus population within samples harbored T-cell epitopes similar to the reference BKV strain that was matched for BKV genotype. Despite the conservation of epitopes, were detected in 77.7% of patients. Understanding epitope variation across the whole genome provides insight into the virus-immune interface and may help guide the development of protocols for novel immunologic-based therapies.

Patients often present with fever, headache, and neck pain, which may lead to a workup for meningitis including the acquisition of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Although Leptospira DNA has been detected in CSF by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), little data exist regarding the utility of testing CSF in addition to serum or plasma obtained on presentation. In this report, we present two cases of leptospirosis in returned travelers presenting with fever and headache. Our first patient had neutrophilic meningitis, and Leptospira was detectable only in CSF obtained on admission. The second patient had a normal CSF profile, but Leptospira was detected in CSF at a bacterial load 5- to 10-fold higher than that in plasma. CSF is an important specimen for the diagnosis of Leptospira by molecular methods and may yield an actionable diagnosis in the absence of leptospiremia.

However, optimal CMV levels for the initiation of preemptive therapy have not been defined.The objectives of our work were to evaluate the relationship between plasma CMV DNA levels at initiation of preemptive therapy with time to resolution of viremia and duration of treatment.Retrospective analysis of HCT recipients undergoing serial CMV PCR testing between June 2011 and June 2014 was performed.221 HCT recipients underwent preemptive therapy for 305 episodes of CMV viremia. Median time to resolution was shorter when treatment was initiated at lower CMV levels (15 days at 135-440 international units (IU)/mL, 18 days at 441-1000IU/mL, and 21 days at >1000IU/mL, P<.001). Prolonged viremia lasting >30 days occurred less frequently when treatment was initiated at 135-440IU/mL compared to 441-1000IU/mL and >1000IU/mL (1%, 15%, 24%, P<.001). Median treatment duration was also shorter in the lower viral load groups (28, 34, 37 days, P<.001).Initiation of preemptive therapy at low CMV levels was associated with shorter episodes of viremia and courses of antiviral therapy. These data support the utility of initiating preemptive CMV therapy at viral loads as low as 135IU/mL in HCT recipients.

However, clinical laboratories often do not receive paired specimens. In the current study, we tested serum samples using a highly sensitive real-time nucleic acid amplification test for Leptospira and compared results to MAT performed on the same specimens.478 serum samples from suspected leptospirosis cases in Rio de Janeiro were tested using a real-time RT-PCR for the diagnosis of leptospirosis, malaria and dengue (the Lepto-MD assay). The Lepto-MD assay detects all species of Leptospira (saprophytic, intermediate, and pathogenic), and in the current study, we demonstrate that this assay amplifies both Leptospira RNA and DNA. Dengue virus RNA was identified in 10 patients, and no cases of malaria were detected. A total of 65 samples (13.6%) were positive for Leptospira: 35 samples (7.3%) in the Lepto-MD assay, 33 samples (6.9%) by MAT, and 3 samples tested positive by both (kappa statistic 0.02). Poor agreement between methods was consistent regardless of the titer used to define positive MAT results or the day of disease at sample collection. Leptospira nucleic acids were detected in the Lepto-MD assay as late as day 22, and cycle threshold values did not differ based on the day of disease. When Lepto-MD assay results were added to the MAT results for all patients in 2008 (n=818), the number of detected leptospirosis cases increased by 30.4%, from 102 (12.5%) to 133 (16.3%).This study demonstrates a lack of agreement between nucleic acid detection of Leptospira and single-specimen MAT, which may result from the clearance of bacteremia coinciding with the appearance of agglutinating antibodies. A combined testing strategy for acute leptospirosis, including molecular and serologic testing, appears necessary to maximize case detection.

Two separate chikungunya virus genotypes have been responsible for outbreaks during this period, including strains adapted to transmission in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Further spread of this virus into new regions of the Western Hemisphere is predicted during the present rainy season in the tropics, and recurrent viral introductions and disease outbreaks, as occurred in Runion in 2010, should be expected.

Leptospira nucleic acids were detected in the Lepto-MD assay as late as day 22, and cycle threshold values did not differ based on the day of disease. When Lepto-MD assay results were added to the MAT results for all patients in 2008 (n=818), the number of detected leptospirosis cases increased by 30.4%, from 102 (12.5%) to 133 (16.3%).This study demonstrates a lack of agreement between nucleic acid detection of Leptospira and single-specimen MAT, which may result from the clearance of bacteremia coinciding with the appearance of agglutinating antibodies. A combined testing strategy for acute leptospirosis, including molecular and serologic testing, appears necessary to maximize case detection.

Several factors enhance the transmissibility of norovirus, including the small inoculum required to produce infection (<100 viral particles), prolonged viral shedding, and its ability to survive in the environment. In this review, we describe the basic virology and immunology of noroviruses, the clinical disease resulting from infection and its diagnosis and management, as well as host and pathogen factors that complicate vaccine development. Additionally, we discuss overall epidemiology, infection control strategies, and global reporting efforts aimed at controlling this worldwide cause of acute gastroenteritis. Prompt implementation of infection control measures remains the mainstay of norovirus outbreak management.

However, the benefit of using a clinical diagnostic that is specific for pathogenic species remains unclear. In this study, we present the development of a real-time PCR (rtPCR) for the detection of pathogenic Leptospira (the pathogenic rtPCR), and we perform a comparison of the pathogenic rtPCR with a published assay that detects all Leptospira species [the undifferentiated febrile illness (UFI) assay] and a reference 16S Leptospira rtPCR, which was originally designed to detect pathogenic species.For the pathogenic rtPCR, a new hydrolysis probe was designed for use with primers from the UFI assay, which targets the 16S gene. The pathogenic rtPCR detected Leptospira DNA in 37/37 cultured isolates from 5 pathogenic and one intermediate species. Two strains of the non-pathogenic L. biflexa produced no signal. Clinical samples from 65 patients with suspected leptospirosis were then tested using the pathogenic rtPCR and a reference Leptospira 16S rtPCR. All 65 samples had tested positive for Leptospira using the UFI assay; 62 (95.4%) samples tested positive using the pathogenic rtPCR (p=0.24). Only 24 (36.9%) samples tested positive in the reference 16S rtPCR (p<0.0001 for comparison with the pathogenic rtPCR and UFI assays). Amplicon sequencing confirmed the detection of pathogenic Leptospira species in 49/50 cases, including 3 cases that were only detected using the UFI assay.The pathogenic rtPCR displayed similar sensitivity to the UFI assay when testing clinical specimens with no difference in specificity. Both assays proved significantly more sensitive than a real-time molecular test used for comparison. Future studies are needed to investigate the clinical and epidemiologic significance of more sensitive Leptospira detection using these tests.

Improved genotypic detection of impending drug resistance may follow from recent technical advances. A severely T-cell-depleted patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia developed CMV pneumonia and high plasma viral loads that were poorly responsive to antiviral therapy. Serial plasma specimens were analyzed for mutant viral populations by conventional and high-throughput deep-sequencing methods. Uncharacterized mutations were phenotyped for drug resistance using recombinant viruses. Conventional genotyping detected viruses with the UL97 kinase substitution C607Y after treatment, a transient subpopulation of UL54 polymerase L773V mutants first detected 8 weeks after foscarnet was started, and a subpopulation of a mutant with deletion of UL54 codons 981 and 982 2 months after the addition of cidofovir. Deep sequencing of the same serial specimens revealed the same UL54 mutants sooner, along with a more complex evolution of known and newly recognized mutant subpopulations missed by conventional sequencing. The UL54 exonuclease substitutions and shown to confer ganciclovir-cidofovir resistance, while L773V was shown to confer foscarnet resistance and add to the ganciclovir resistance conferred by UL97 C607Y. Increased sequencing depth provided a more timely and detailed diagnosis of mutant viral subpopulations that evolved with changing anti-CMV therapy.

The current study describes the development of an internally controlled multiplex nucleic acid amplification test for the detection of dengue virus (DENV) and Leptospira and Plasmodium species, with a specific callout for Plasmodium falciparum (referred to as the UFI assay). During analytical evaluation, the UFI assay displayed a wide dynamic range and a sensitive limit of detection for each target, including all four DENV serotypes. In a clinical evaluation including 210 previously tested samples, the sensitivities of the UFI assay were 98% for DENV (58/59 samples detected) and 100% for Leptospira and malaria (65/65 and 20/20 samples, respectively). Malaria samples included all five Plasmodium species known to cause human disease. The specificity of the UFI assay was 100% when evaluated with a panel of 66 negative clinical samples. Furthermore, no amplification was observed when extracted nucleic acids from related pathogens were tested. Compared with whole-blood samples, the UFI assay remained positive for Plasmodium in 11 plasma samples from patients with malaria (parasitemia levels of 0.0037 to 3.4%). The syndrome-based design of the UFI assay, combined with the sensitivities of the component tests, represents a significant improvement over the individual diagnostic tests available for these pathogens.

Urine viral culture is the standard for CMV diagnosis in neonates and infants. The objectives of this study were to compare the performance of serial paired rapid shell vial cultures (SVC) and routine viral cultures (RVC), and to determine the optimal number of cultures needed to detect positive cases. From 2001 to 2011, all paired CMV SVC and RVC performed on neonates and infants less than 100 days of age were recorded. Testing episodes were defined as sets of cultures performed within 7 days of one another. A total of 1264 neonates and infants underwent 1478 testing episodes; 68 (5.4%) had at least one episode with a positive CMV culture. In episodes where CMV was detected before day 21 of life, the first specimen was positive in 100% (16/16) of cases. When testing occurred after 21 days of life, the first specimen was positive in 82.7% (43/52) of cases, requiring three cultures to reach 100% detection. The SVC was more prone to assay failure than RVC. Overall, when RVC was compared to SVC, there was 86.0% positive agreement and 99.9% negative agreement. In conclusion, three serial urine samples are necessary for detection of CMV in specimens collected between day of life 22 and 99, while one sample may be sufficient on or before day of life 21. Though SVC was more sensitive than RVC, the risk of SVC failure supports the use of multimodality testing to optimize detection.

However, CMV antiviral therapy can be complicated by drug resistance associated with mutations in the phosphotransferase UL97 and the DNA polymerase UL54. We have developed an amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing strategy for detecting CMV drug resistance mutations in clinical plasma specimens using a microfluidics PCR platform for multiplexed library preparation and a benchtop sequencing instrument. Plasmid clones of the UL97 and UL54 genes were used to demonstrate the low overall empirical error rate of the assay (0.189%) and to develop a statistical algorithm for identifying authentic low-abundance variants. The ability of the assay to detect resistance mutations was tested with mixes of wild-type and mutant plasmids, as well as clinical CMV isolates and plasma samples that were known to contain mutations that confer resistance. Finally, 48 clinical plasma specimens with a range of viral loads (394 to 2,191,011 copies/ml plasma) were sequenced using multiplexing of up to 24 specimens per run. This led to the identification of seven resistance mutations, three of which were present in <20% of the sequenced population. Thus, this assay offers more sensitive detection of minor variants and a higher multiplexing capacity than current methods for the genotypic detection of CMV drug resistance mutations.

Because diagnosis of congenital CMV requires viral detection within an infant's first 21 days of life, CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) placental tissue provides a unique opportunity to identify congenital exposure in cases in which CMV is not initially suspected. To assess the utility of this approach, a database of all CMV cultures performed from July 2001 to March 2012 was used to identify infants in whom urine CMV cultures were obtained within 100 days of life. Corresponding placentas were then identified through the pathology database. The database was also queried to identify placentas in which CMV immunohistochemical analysis had been performed. CMV was positive in FFPE placental tissue from 100% (5/5) of cases in which the first urine culture collected before the first 21 days of life was positive. Placentas from 20 infants with negative CMV urine cultures were CMV PCR negative. Interestingly, CMV was detected in 12.5% (1/8) of placentas in which the first CMV-positive urine culture was collected after the first 21 days of life. Furthermore, 4% (1/26) of placentas with chronic villitis by histology (no urine cultures available) were CMV PCR positive. In the 10 CMV PCR-positive placentas, including 3 cases of fetal demise, CMV immunohistochemistry was positive in just 6 cases.

The pan-DENV assay detected DENV in significantly more samples collected on or after day five of illness and in a subgroup of patients with detectable anti-DENV IgM at presentation. No significant difference in sensitivity was observed between the pan-DENV assay and the multiplex rRT-PCR, despite the presence of an internal control in the former. The detection of DENV RNA late in the course of clinical illness should serve to lengthen the period during which a confirmed, molecular diagnosis of DENV infection can be provided.

A subset of cases with amplifiable HPV DNA was also sequenced. HSIL was typically flat (15/20), and only a minority (4/20) had koilocytes. In contrast, only 1 LSIL was flat (1/23), and the remainder were exophytic. The majority of LSIL had areas of koilocytic change (20/23). HR-HPV DNA was detected in the majority (89%) of invasive carcinomas and HSIL biopsies, 86% and 97% of which were accurately labeled by strong and diffuse block-positive p16 and ProEx C, respectively. LSIL cases, HR-HPV (13%); most harbored low-risk HPV (LR-HPV) types and 11. Within the LSIL group, p16 outperformed ProEx C, resulting in fewer false-positive cases (5% vs. 75%). Ki-67 was also increased in HR-HPV-positive lesions, although biopsies with increased inflammation and reactive changes also showed higher Ki-67 indices. These data suggest that strong and diffuse block-positive nuclear and cytoplasmic labeling with p16 is a highly specific biomarker for the presence of HR-HPV in anal biopsies and that this finding correlates with high-grade lesions.

We conducted a study to harmonize the method between four centers with expertise in EBV DNA quantitation.Plasma samples of 40 patients with NPC were distributed to four centers. DNA was extracted and EBV DNA copy number was determined by real-time quantitative PCR (BamHI-W primer/probe). Centers used the same protocol but generated their own calibrators. A harmonization study was then conducted using the same calibrators and PCR master mix and validated with ten pooled samples.The initial intraclass correlations (ICC) for the first 40 samples between each center and the index center were 0.62 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.39-0.78], 0.70 (0.50-0.83), and 0.59 (0.35-0.76). The largest variability was the use of different PCR master mixes and calibrators. Standardization improved ICC to 0.83 (0.5-0.95), 0.95 (0.83-0.99) and 0.96 (0.86-0.99), respectively, for ten archival frozen samples. For fresh plasma with spiked-in EBV DNA, correlations were more than 0.99 between the centers. At 5 EBV DNA copies per reaction or above, the coefficient of variance (CV) was less than 10% for the cycle threshold (Ct) among all centers, suggesting this concentration can be reliably used as a cutoff for defining the presence of detectable EBV DNA.Quantitative PCR assays, even when conducted in experienced clinical labs, can yield large variability in plasma EBV DNA copy numbers without harmonization. The use of common calibrators and PCR master mix can help to reduce variability.

In clinical specimens, constant and variable quantification differences between the CAP/CTM CMV test and comparator assays were observed.High interlaboratory agreement and precision of CAP/CTM CMV test results across 5 different laboratories over 4 orders of magnitude suggest that this assay could be valuable in prospective studies identifying clinical viral load thresholds for CMV treatment.

However, there is considerable intra- and inter-laboratory variability in the results, which impact comparability and clinical practice. OBJECTIVES/STUDY DESIGN: Using 380 samples from 135 HSCT recipients, we compared the new FDA approved COBAS() AmpliPrep/COBAS() TaqMan() CMV test (CAP/CTM CMV test) developed and standardized using the 1st WHO International Standard for CMV with pp65 antigenemia and COBAS() AMPLICOR MONITOR CMV tests.The median time between transplantation and testing samples was 57 days (range, 0-207 days). The median CMV load (log(10)) was 3.17 IU/mL (3.21 copies/mL). Among samples load, 52% were negative by pp65 antigenemia. CMV loads were higher in pp65 antigenemia-positive than in negative samples. One pp65-antigenemia-positive cell per 100,000 leukocytes corresponded to a median CMV load of 1200 IU/mL. CMV loads determined by the CAP/CTM CMV test were slightly lower than the ones by the AMPLICOR MONITOR CMV test (-0.15 [95% CI, -0.18 to differences indicated only limited co-linearity.The CAP/CTM CMV test is more sensitive than pp65 antigenemia and the AMPLICOR MONITOR CMV test in HSCT recipients. The lower limit of quantification and co-linearity with the international WHO standard renders the CAP/CTM CMV test suitable for future clinical trials defining viral load thresholds of CMV therapy.

In 47 cases where L1 sequencing demonstrated that the predominant HPV type was 6, 11, 16, or 18, type-specific, real-time polymerase chain reaction provided concordant results. Sequencing revealed additional low-risk (HPV 40) and high-risk HPV types (HPV 31, 33, 56, and 58) in anorectal specimens, whereas HPV 6 or 11 were the types found in laryngeal papillomas.Both L1 sequencing and type-specific, real-time polymerase chain reaction are suitable methods for routine HPV testing of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues in a clinical laboratory setting.

Despite the widespread nature of this infection, available molecular diagnostics have significant limitations. The aim of this study was to develop a multiplex, real-time, reverse transcriptase-PCR (rRT-PCR) for the detection, quantitation, dengue a single assay targeting the untranslated region and capsid of the DENV genome was designed using molecular beacons to provide serotype specificity. Using reference DENV strains, the assay was linear from 7.0 to 1.0 log cDNA equivalents/L for each serotype. The lower limit of detection using genomic RNA was 0.3, 13.8, 0.8, and 12.4 cDNA equivalents/L for serotypes 1-4, respectively, which was 6- to 275-fold more analytically sensitive than a widely used hemi-nested RT-PCR. Using samples from Nicaragua collected within the first five days of illness, the multiplex rRT-PCR was positive in 100% (69/69) of specimens that were positive by the hemi-nested assay, with full serotype agreement. Furthermore, the multiplex rRT-PCR detected DENV RNA in 97.2% (35/36) of specimens from Sri Lanka positive for anti-DENV IgM antibodies compared to just 44.4% (16/36) by the hemi-nested RT-PCR. No amplification was observed in 80 clinical samples sent for routine quantitative hepatitis C virus testing or when genomic RNA from other flaviviruses was tested.This single-reaction, quantitative, multiplex rRT-PCR for DENV serotyping demonstrates superior analytical and clinical performance, as well as simpler workflow compared to the hemi-nested RT-PCR reference. In particular, this multiplex rRT-PCR detects viral RNA and provides serotype information in specimens collected more than five days after fever onset and from patients who had already developed anti-DENV IgM antibodies. The implementation of this assay in dengue-endemic areas has the potential to improve both dengue diagnosis and epidemiologic surveillance.

Rapid detection of influenza is important for prompt initiation of antiviral therapy and appropriate patient triage. In this study the Cepheid Xpert Flu assay was compared with two rapid antigen tests, BinaxNOW Influenza A & B and BD Directigen EZ Flu A+B, as well as direct fluorescent antibody testing for the rapid detection of influenza A and B. Using real-time, hydrolysis probe-based, reverse transcriptase PCR as the reference method, influenza A sensitivity was 97.3% for Xpert Flu, 95.9% for direct fluorescent for BinaxNOW, and 71.6% for BD Directigen. Influenza B sensitivity was 100% for Xpert Flu and direct fluorescent antibody testing, 54.5% for BinaxNOW, and 48.5% for BD Directigen. Specificity for Xpert BinaxNOW, and BD Directigen, and 99.2% for direct fluorescent antibody testing. All methods demonstrated 100% specificity for influenza B.

In this study, we compared the artus CMV Rotor-Gene PCR, utilizing an automated nucleic acid extraction (the artus CMV protocol), with the COBAS Amplicor CMV Monitor test (our reference protocol). We then analyzed the results of all CMV PCR tests ordered following the implementation of the artus CMV protocol at our institution and followed 91 adult patients with positive test results. The artus CMV protocol had a linear range extending from 2.0 to 7.0 log(10) copies/ml and had a lower limit of 95% detection of 57 copies/ml. With archived plasma samples, this protocol demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 94% specificity for the detection of CMV DNA. Following implementation of the artus CMV protocol, 320 of 1,403 (22.8%) plasma samples tested positive (compared with 323/3,579 [9.0%] samples in the preceding 6 months), and 227 (16.2%) samples had copy numbers of <400/ml. Ninety-one adult patients had at least one positive test. The data were analyzed using a threshold of 200 copies/ml, and in 22 episodes, the viral load increased from <200 copies/ml to 200 copies/ml on sequential tests. In 21 of these 22 episodes, either the viral load continued to increase or antiviral treatment was initiated in response to the repeat value. In summary, we evaluate the performance characteristics of a protocol utilizing the artus CMV PCR and identify clinically meaningful changes in CMV DNA copy numbers even when they are initially detected at a low level.

We used real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to quantify the plasma HPV DNA in 40 HPV-positive OPC, 24 HPV-negative head-and-neck cancer patients and 10 non-cancer volunteers. The tumor HPV status was confirmed by p16(INK4a) staining and HPV16/18 polymerase chain reaction or HPV in situ hybridization. A total of 14 patients had serial plasma samples for HPV DNA quantification during radiotherapy.HPV DNA was detectable in the plasma samples of SCC90- and HeLa-bearing mice but not in the controls. It was detected in 65% of the pretreatment plasma samples from HPV-positive OPC patients using E6/7 quantitative polymerase chain reaction. None of the HPV-negative head-and-neck cancer patients or non-cancer controls had detectable HPV DNA. The pretreatment plasma HPV DNA copy number correlated significantly with the metabolic tumor volume (assessed using (18)F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography). The serial measurements in 14 patients showed a rapid decline in HPV DNA that had become undetectable at radiotherapy completion. In 3 patients, the HPV DNA level had increased to a discernable level at metastasis.Xenograft studies indicated that plasma HPV DNA is released from HPV-positive tumors. Circulating HPV DNA was detectable in most HPV-positive OPC patients. Thus, plasma HPV DNA might be a valuable tool for identifying relapse.

Although a majority of 2009 (H1N1) influenza A virus remains oseltamivir susceptible, the threat of resistance due to the His275Tyr mutation is highlighted by the limitations of alternative therapies and the potential for rapid, global fixation of this mutation in the circulating influenza A virus population. In order to better understand the emergence of resistance, we developed a rare-variant-sensitive high-resolution melting-curve analysis method (RVS-HRM) that is able to detect the His275Tyr oseltamivir resistance mutation to 0.5% in a background of susceptible virus. We applied RVS-HRM to clinical specimens from patients who developed oseltamivir resistance and demonstrated the ultrasensitive detection of influenza A virus N1 neuraminidase quasispecies. Interestingly, we were unable to detect the oseltamivir resistance mutation in pretreatment samples, suggesting that resistant virus does not reach even this very low detection threshold until exposed to selective drug pressure. Thus, patients naive to oseltamivir are most likely to be susceptible when this drug is used as a first-line treatment modality.

Real-time PCR testing for the mecA gene (mecA PCR), which confers methicillin resistance in staphylococci, has the added potential to reduce antibiotic usage, improve clinical outcomes, lower health care costs, and avoid emergence of drug resistance. A retrospective study was performed to identify patients infected with methicillin-sensitive staphylococcal isolates who were receiving vancomycin treatment when susceptibility results became available. Vancomycin treatment and length of hospitalization were compared in these patients for a 6-month period before and after implementation of mecA PCR. Among 65 and 94 patients identified before and after mecA PCR, respectively, vancomycin usage (measured in days on therapy) declined from a median of 3 days (range, 1 to 44 days) in the pre-PCR period to 1 day (range, 0 to 18 days) in the post-PCR period (P < 0.0001). In total, 38.5% (25/65) of patients were switched to beta-lactam therapy in the pre-PCR period, compared to 61.7% (58/94) in the post-PCR period (P = 0.004). Patient hospitalization days also declined from a median of 8 days (range, 1 to 47 days) in the pre-PCR period to 5 days (range, 0 to 42 days) in the post-PCR period (P = 0.03). Real-time PCR testing for mecA is an effective tool for reducing vancomycin usage and length of stay of hospitalized patients infected with methicillin-sensitive staphylococci. In the face of ever-rising health care expenditures in the United States, these findings have important implications for improving outcomes and decreasing costs.

To facilitate prompt identification and appropriate therapy, we describe here a rapid and robust multiplex real-time PCR assay that is able to definitively distinguish S. lugdunensis from other staphylococci. Using melting curve analysis, the assay also identifies Staphylococcus aureus and CoNS other than S. lugdunensis and determines MecA-dependent resistance to methicillin (meticillin). When applied to a panel of well-characterized staphylococcal reference strains, as well as 165 clinical isolates previously identified by conventional methods, the assay was both sensitive and specific for S. lugdunensis, correctly identifying the reference strain and all 47 S. lugdunensis isolates without inappropriate amplification of other staphylococci. Furthermore, rapid biochemical identification using the WEE-TAB system to detect ornithine decarboxylase activity was found to be unsuitable as an alternative to PCR identification, displaying just 31% sensitivity and 77% specificity when tested on a subset (90 isolates) of the clinical strains. We therefore propose that this simple, accurate PCR approach will allow for the routine and timely identification of S. lugdunensis in the clinical microbiology laboratory.

However, it remains unsettled whether drug-resistant mutants are fixed in the bacterial population or if they would revert in the absence of drug pressure.To document the occurrence of isoniazid (INH) reversion in a patient with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and investigate its association with fitness cost.Genotypic and phenotypic assays were used to characterize the reversion of INH resistance in isolates from a patient with pulmonary TB. The pre-reversion katG mutation was reconstructed in a pan-susceptible laboratory strain (H37Rv DeltakatG::katG W300G) and tested for susceptibility to INH and oxidative stress.Genotyping and drug susceptibility testing showed that an isogenic strain of M. tuberculosis reverted from an INH-resistant to a susceptible phenotype in the absence of INH therapy. The genotypic basis of this reversion was mapped to the katG codon 300 which reverted from GGG (glycine, H37Rv DeltakatG::katG W300G mutant was resistant to INH, but also showed a deficiency in coping with oxidative stress.This study confirms that, in the absence of INH pressure, some INH-resistant mutants will revert to a drug-susceptible phenotype. This finding may have broader implications for INH-resistant strains and for the clinically useful lifespan of INH.

The spindle checkpoint halts the cell cycle in response to defects in generating proper attachments or tension on kinetochores, although the precise signal that triggers the checkpoint is unclear because tension and attachment are coupled. The target of the checkpoint is the Cdc20 protein, which initiates the anaphase-promoting complex (APC)-dependent degradation of the anaphase inhibitor Pds1/securin. Although the molecular details of spindle checkpoint activation are still being elucidated, phosphorylation by at least four kinases is a crucial requirement. However, less is known about the mechanisms that silence the checkpoint after kinetochores biorient. Here, we show that the catalytic subunit of the budding yeast protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) homolog, Glc7, regulates exit from the checkpoint. Glc7 overexpression prevents spindle checkpoint activation in response to both tension and attachment defects. Although glc7 mutant cells are able to efficiently release from a non-checkpoint-mediated metaphase arrest, they are uniquely sensitive to transient spindle checkpoint activation as a result of a failure in spindle checkpoint exit. We therefore propose that PP1 activity silences the checkpoint by reversing key phosphorylation events.

In the developing world, microbiologists use human blood agar because of the high cost and inhospitable conditions for raising wool sheep or horses to supply blood. Many pathogens either fail to grow entirely or exhibit morphologies and hemolytic patterns on human blood agar that confound colony recognition. Furthermore, human blood can be hazardous to handle due to HIV and hepatitis. This study investigated whether blood from hair sheep, a hardy, low-maintenance variety of sheep adapted for hot climates, was suitable for routine clinical microbiology studies.Hair sheep blood obtained by jugular venipuncture was anticoagulated by either manual defibrination or collection in human blood bank bags containing citrate-phosphate-dextrose. Trypticase soy 5% blood agar was made from both forms of hair sheep blood and commercial defibrinated wool sheep blood. Growth characteristics, colony morphologies, and hemolytic patterns of selected human pathogens, including several streptococcal species, were evaluated. Specialized identification tests, including CAMP test, reverse CAMP test, and satellite colony formation with Haemophilus influenzae and Abiotrophia defectiva were also performed. Mueller-Hinton blood agar plates prepared from the three blood types were compared in antibiotic susceptibility tests by disk diffusion and E-test.The results of all studies showed that blood agar prepared from citrated hair sheep blood is suitable for microbiological tests used in routine identification and susceptibility profiling of human pathogens. The validation of citrated hair sheep blood eliminates the labor-intensive and equipment-requiring process of manual defibrination. Use of hair sheep blood, in lieu of human blood currently used by many developing world laboratories and as an alternative to cost-prohibitive commercial sheep blood, offers the opportunity to dramatically improve the safety and accuracy of laboratory diagnosis of pathogenic bacteria in resource-poor countries.

However, the current commercially available molecular assays identify mycobacteria only to the complex level and are unable to differentiate M. tuberculosis from the closely related M. bovis and M. bovis BCG. We describe here a rapid robust two-step, multiplex, real-time PCR assay based on genomic deletions identify M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. bovis BCG, and other members of the complex. When tested against a panel of well-characterized mycobacterial reference strains, the assay was both sensitive and specific, correctly identifying all strains. We applied this assay to 60 clinical isolates previously identified as M. tuberculosis complex and found 57 M. tuberculosis isolates and 3 M. bovis BCG isolates from patients who had received intravesical BCG. Furthermore, analysis of 15 clinical specimens previously identified as M. bovis by spoligotyping revealed an isolate of M. tuberculosis that had been misidentified. We propose that this assay will allow the routine identification of M. tuberculosis complex members in the clinical laboratory.

We explored the relationship between Glc7 and Ipl1 and found that the phosphorylation of the Ipl1 substrate, Dam1, was altered by decreased Glc7 activity, whereas Ipl1 levels, localization, and kinase activity were not. These data strongly suggest that Glc7 ensures accurate chromosome segregation by dephosphorylating Ipl1 targets rather than regulating the Ipl1 kinase. To identify potential Glc7 and Ipl1 substrates, and PEX31) encode newly identified ipl1 dosage suppressors, and all 10 suppressors encode proteins that physically interact with Glc7. The overexpression of the Gip3 and Gip4 suppressors altered Glc7 localization, indicating they are previously unidentified Glc7 regulatory subunits. In addition, the overexpression of Gip3 and from the galactose promoter restored Dam1 phosphorylation in ipl1-321 mutant cells and caused wild-type cells to arrest in metaphase with unsegregated Gip3 and Gip4 overexpression Glc7's functions. of Glc7 regulatory subunits can titrate Glc7 away from relevant Ipl1 targets and thereby suppress ipl1-321 cells by restoring the balance of phosphatase/kinase activity.

Although the checkpoint is activated by either the lack of kinetochore-microtubule attachments or defects in the tension exerted by microtubule-generated forces, it is not clear whether these signals are linked. We investigated the connection between tension and attachment by studying the conserved budding yeast Ipl1Aurora protein kinase that is required for checkpoint activation in the absence of tension but not attachment. Here, we show that spindle-checkpoint activation in kinetochore mutants that seem to have unattached kinetochores depends on Ipl1 activity. When Ipl1 function was impaired in these kinetochore mutants, the attachments were restored and the checkpoint was turned off. These data indicate that Ipl1 activates the checkpoint in response to tension defects by creating unattached kinetochores. Moreover, although the Dam1 kinetochore complex has been implicated as a key downstream target, we found the existence of unidentified Ipl1 sites on Dam1 or additional important substrates that regulate both microtuble detachment and the checkpoint.

Despite significant advances in our understanding of spindle checkpoint function, the primary signal that activates the spindle checkpoint remains unclear. Whereas some experiments indicate that the checkpoint recognizes the lack of microtubule attachment to the kinetochore, others indicate that the checkpoint senses the absence of tension generated on the kinetochore by microtubules. The interdependence between tension and microtubule attachment make it difficult to determine whether these signals are separable. In this article (which is part of the Chromosome Segregation and Aneuploidy series), we consider recent evidence that supports and opposes the hypothesis that defects in tension act as the primary checkpoint signal.

The budding yeast Ipl1/Aurora protein kinase allows the absence of tension to activate the spindle checkpoint. We found that checkpoint activation in the mtw1-1 kinetochore mutant requires Ipl1p, suggesting that Mtw1p promotes tension. We isolated mtw1-1 dosage suppressors and identified Dsn1, a kinetochore protein that immunoprecipitates with the Mif2/CENP-C and Cse4/CENP-A proteins, as well as Mtw1, Nnf1, and Nsl1 kinetochore proteins. mtw1 and dsn1 exhibit similar phenotypes, suggesting that Mtw1p and Dsn1p act together. Although mtw1 mutant cells contained unattached chromosomes, attachment was restored by impairing Ipl1p function. These results suggest that mtw1 mutant kinetochores are competent to bind microtubules but Ipl1p generates unattached chromosomes. We therefore propose that an Mtw1 complex is required for kinetochore biorientation that is monitored by the Ipl1p kinase.

We have cloned a kinase, Nlk, that is a murine homolog of the Drosophila nemo (nmo) gene. The Nlk amino acid sequence is 54. 5% similar and 41.7% identical to murine Erk-2, and 49.6% similar and 38.4% identical to human Cdc2. It possesses an extended amino-terminal domain that is very rich in glutamine, alanine, proline, and histidine. This region bears similarity to repetitive regions found in many transcription factors. Nlk is expressed as a 4. 0-kb transcript at high levels in adult mouse brain tissue, with low levels in other tissues examined, including lung, where two smaller transcripts of 1.0 and 1.5 kb are expressed as well. A 4.0-kb Nlk message is also present during embryogenesis, detectable at day E10. 5, reaching maximal steady state levels at day E12.5, and then decreasing. Nlk transiently expressed in COS7 cells is a 60-kDa kinase detectable by its ability to autophosphorylate. Mutation of the ATP-binding Lys-155 to methionine abolishes its ability to autophosphorylate, as does mutation of a putative activating threonine in indicates that 60-70% of Nlk is localized to nucleus, whereas 30-40% of Nlk is cytoplasmic. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirms that Nlk resides predominantly in the nucleus. Nlk and Nmo may be the first members of a family of kinases with homology to both Erk/MAPKs and Cdks.
