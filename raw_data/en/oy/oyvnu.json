Furthermore, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region are among the most affected areas by the COVID-19 pandemics and present a high proportion of CAM users. Therefore, this study evaluates the association between the consumption of herbal supplements or homeopathic remedies to prevent COVID-19 and the intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 in the LAC region. We conducted a secondary data analysis of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) survey with Facebook to assess COVID-19 beliefs, behaviours, and norms. Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using generalized linear models of the Poisson family with the log link function. The prevalence of the use of products to prevent COVID-19 was the following: consumption of herbal supplements (7.2%), use of homeopathic remedies (4.8%), and consumption of garlic, ginger, and lemon (11.8%). An association was found between using herbal supplements (19.0% vs. 12.8%; aPR = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.30-1.58), the use of homeopathic remedies (20.3% vs. 12.3%; aPR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.25-1.98), and the consumption of garlic, ginger, and lemon (18.9% vs. 11.9%; aPR = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.50-1.61) and non-intention to vaccinate against COVID-19. In the LAC population, there is an association between using herbal supplements, using homeopathic remedies and consuming garlic, ginger, and lemon to prevent infection by COVID-19 and non-intention to vaccinate against this disease. Therefore, it is necessary to design targeted strategies for groups that consume these products as preventive measures against COVID-19 to increase vaccination coverage and expand the information regarding transmission and prevention strategies for SARS-CoV-2.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-06-08", "cleaned_text": "Consumption of Herbal Supplements or Homeopathic Remedies to Prevent COVID-19 and Intention of Vaccination for COVID-19 in Latin America and the Caribbean [https://doi.org/10.3390/tropicalmed7060095](https://doi.org/10.3390/tropicalmed7060095) [Impact of COVID-19 Global Crisis on On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic [ [2](#B2-tropicalmed-07-00095)], reporting a total of 251,885,689 cases and 5,079,013 deaths worldwide for this disease up to 11 November 2021 [ [3](#B3-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. [4](#B4-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. Although vaccination is the most cost-effective public health strategy [ [5](#B5-tropicalmed-07-00095), [6](#B6-tropicalmed-07-00095)], for the control of COVID-19, according to some experts, coverage must reach >70% of the population [ [7](#B7-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. However, a significant proportion of the world population is reluctant to use the vaccine due to information and misinformation prevalent worldwide regarding vaccines. The reasons for rejection are fear of adverse effects, beliefs, medical mistrust, and structural barriers [ [8](#B8-tropicalmed-07-00095), [9](#B9-tropicalmed-07-00095), [10](#B10-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. Some studies have estimated that acceptance of the vaccine against COVID-19 during the first year of the pandemic varied from 27.7% to 93.3% in the world [ [11](#B11-tropicalmed-07-00095), [12](#B12-tropicalmed-07-00095), [13](#B13-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. [14](#B14-tropicalmed-07-00095), [15](#B15-tropicalmed-07-00095)], including a lower intention to vaccinate their children [ [16](#B16-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, lower vaccination intention has also been described in people and health professionals who use or indicate traditional and complementary medicine [ [17](#B17-tropicalmed-07-00095), [18](#B18-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. However, there is currently insufficient evidence on the efficacy and safety of these therapies in preventing or treating COVID-19 [ [19](#B19-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. [20](#B20-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. It is estimated that up to four billion people (representing 80% of the world's population) living in developing countries use herbal medicinal products as a primary source of medical care [ [21](#B21-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. In Africa, up to 80% of the population uses traditional medicine to treat their health problems [ [22](#B22-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. However, an estimated 57 countries in the African region face a critical shortage of health workers, with a deficit of 2.4 million doctors and nurses [ [23](#B23-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. Africa has 2.3 health workers per 1000 inhabitants, compared to the Americas, with 24.8 health workers per 1000 inhabitants [ [23](#B23-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. Likewise, in East Asia, the prevalence of alternative and complementary traditional medicine has been reported in up to 76.7% of the population [ [24](#B24-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. However, only 1.3% of the world's health workforce cares for people who suffer from 25% of the global burden of disease [ [23](#B23-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. [3](#B3-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. It has been described that in LAC, gender, fear of oneself or a family member becoming seriously ill and having depressive symptoms are associated with vaccinating [ [8](#B8-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. According to the WHO Regional Office for the Americas (AMRO/PAHO), 71% of the population in Chile and 40% of the population in Colombia use traditional medicine [ [25](#B25-tropicalmed-07-00095)], and up to 70% of the population of the entire continent use medicinal plants [ [26](#B26-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. Despite the potential benefits that these therapies could represent, their use is associated with a lower intention to vaccinate against COVID-19. This scenario is of utmost importance for LAC, one of the regions hardest hit by the pandemic and the most unequal in the world. Limited access to health services has been compounded by the disruption of services generated by COVID-19 and the appearance of new COVID-19 variants [ [27](#B27-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. In addition, the use of CAM is frequent, and to our knowledge, there are no studies on this association. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the association between the consumption of herbal supplements or homeopathic remedies to prevent COVID-19 and the intention to vaccinate against COVID-19. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design 2.2. Population, Sample, and Sampling [Figure 1](#tropicalmed-07-00095-f001)). 2.3. Variables 2.4. Statistical Analysis [8](#B8-tropicalmed-07-00095), [28](#B28-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. Collinearity was evaluated using variance inflation factors (VIF), considering a cut-off point of less than 10. Additionally, given the potential selection bias, a comparative analysis was carried out between the participants who had missing or no missing data of each exposure with the other variables of interest, not finding essential differences ( [Tables S1-S3](#app1-tropicalmed-07-00095)). A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all the statistical tests performed. 2.5. Ethical Considerations 3. Results 3.1. Selection of the Study Sample [Figure 2](#tropicalmed-07-00095-f002)). The participants were then divided into three groups according to the type of exposure. 3.2. Characteristics of the Samples Included in the Study [Figure 1](#tropicalmed-07-00095-f001)). The non-intention to vaccinate was 13.2% in the group using herbal supplements and 12.7% in both participants using homeopathic remedies and those consuming garlic, ginger, and lemon. In general, all the groups reported a good, very good, or excellent health status ( [Table 1](#tropicalmed-07-00095-t001)). 3.3. Prevalence of Using Herbal Supplements to Prevent COVID-19 Infection by Each LAC Country [Figure 2](#tropicalmed-07-00095-f002)A and [Table S4](#app1-tropicalmed-07-00095)). 3.4. Prevalence of the Use of Homeopathic Remedies to Prevent COVID-19 Infection by Each LAC Country [Figure 2](#tropicalmed-07-00095-f002)B and [Table S5](#app1-tropicalmed-07-00095)). 3.5. Prevalence of Garlic, Ginger, and Lemon Consumption to Prevent COVID-19 Infection by Each LAC Country [Figure 2](#tropicalmed-07-00095-f002)C and [Table S6](#app1-tropicalmed-07-00095)). 3.6. Bivariate Analysis According to Each Measure Taken to Prevent COVID-19 Infection [Table 2](#tropicalmed-07-00095-t002)). 3.7. Association between Using Herbal Supplements to Prevent COVID-19 Infection and Non-Intention from Vaccinating against COVID-19 [Table 3](#tropicalmed-07-00095-t003)). 3.8. Association between the Use of Homeopathic Remedies to Prevent COVID-19 Infection and Non-Intention from Vaccinating against COVID-19 [Table 3](#tropicalmed-07-00095-t003)). 3.9. Association between the Consumption of Garlic, Ginger and Lemon to Prevent Infection by COVID-19 and Non-Intention to Vaccinate against COVID-19 [Table 3](#tropicalmed-07-00095-t003)). 4. Discussion [29](#B29-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. In Hong Kong, 44% of respondents used CAM during the pandemic [ [29](#B29-tropicalmed-07-00095)], similar to Ethiopia's. On the other hand, a survey found that 46.2% of participants used traditional medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19 cases [ [30](#B30-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. Another study in India showed that 85.2% used Ayurvedic or homeopathic medicine to maintain health during the pandemic [ [31](#B31-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. [32](#B32-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. The variability in terms of the results could be influenced by methodological and cultural aspects, personal experiences, access to health systems, the impact of COVID 19 in each context, and differences regarding the local use of each product in different countries. Among the methodological aspects, it is worth highlighting the differences in terms of the populations studied since some studies include patients with a history of COVID-19 infection or in quarantine during the first phase of the pandemic, where the probability of worrying about the infection and with it, seek some help, is more significant. Likewise, given the variability found in CAM types, and given that the tool used for our study was not specific, there could be confusion regarding what is considered CAM, as described in the studies evaluating the use of homemade remedies [ [33](#B33-tropicalmed-07-00095), [34](#B34-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. [29](#B29-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. Likewise, 3.8% of the population used CAM to reduce COVID-19 symptoms and cure them, and 1% to protect themselves from infection and did not need to follow any hygiene precautions [ [29](#B29-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. In this country, it was described that social networks and the Internet, in general, were the primary motivators for participants to use them, and vitamin C was the most widely used dietary supplement [ [35](#B35-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. [36](#B36-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. In a study in England, India, and the United States, it was found that 93% of those interviewed thought that home remedies helped treat COVID-19 or other viral infections and boost immunity [ [37](#B37-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. Most took a mixture of Ayurvedic herbs and spices, lemon, or other fruits as a source of vitamin C [ [37](#B37-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. Concerning this, although several studies were published on the role of CAM in the management of COVID-19 [ [38](#B38-tropicalmed-07-00095)], such as high Andean phytotherapy [ [39](#B39-tropicalmed-07-00095)], herbal therapy [ [40](#B40-tropicalmed-07-00095)], traditional Chinese medicine [ [41](#B41-tropicalmed-07-00095)], and homeopathy [ [42](#B42-tropicalmed-07-00095), [43](#B43-tropicalmed-07-00095)], to date there is no conclusive evidence about its benefit [ [44](#B44-tropicalmed-07-00095), [45](#B45-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. That is due to methodological problems in these studies that even conditioned the retraction of some investigations in international scientific journals [ [46](#B46-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. Despite this lack of evidence, the use of CAM can condition a sense of security and increase the probability of rejection of the COVID-19 vaccine as occurs with other vaccines, which would increase exposure to the disease without protection. However, another possibility is that the use of CAM serves as an additional protective measure against COVID-19 rather than an alternative to the vaccine or other available medical care. [47](#B47-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. Also, in this country, a qualitative study carried out among doctors who used CAM showed that practitioners framed vaccination decisions as choices at individual and family levels rather than focusing on public health benefits and consequences [ [48](#B48-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. In Spain, a study showed that hesitancy before vaccination was associated with mistrust in conventional medicine and was higher among CAM users [ [17](#B17-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. [49](#B49-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. Some studies have shown similar results specifically for vaccination against COVID-19. For example, a Finnish study showed that people with more distrust of official sources of information and with more support for CAM and non-pharmacological methods were more reluctant to receive the vaccine [ [50](#B50-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. In LAC, a study on health personnel from the northeast of Mexico who showed doubts about vaccination found that preference for homeopathy was one of the reasons [ [18](#B18-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. What was described would be in line with what was found in our study, indicating that people using CAM have a lower probability of vaccinating against COVID-19, being necessary the development of educational interventions and other strategies to promote vaccination in this population. [20](#B20-tropicalmed-07-00095)], states that should not be used to treat several serious diseases [ [51](#B51-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. There are statements from official entities such as the Food and Drug Administration of the United States and the National Health Service of the United Kingdom against its use and regulation [ [52](#B52-tropicalmed-07-00095), [53](#B53-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. To date, homeopathy does not have scientific support from good quality controlled clinical trials published in reliable scientific journals, which would allow establishing that its interventions are effective. Furthermore, people who use CAM are possibly part of groups that contribute to misinformation about vaccines [ [54](#B54-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. The association between rejection of vaccines and CAM and frequenting commercial websites selling \"natural products\" suggests that cultural factors may reinforce an anti-vaccination stance by associating vaccines with capitalism, big pharma, and significant company earnings [ [55](#B55-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. Indeed, some studies report the high content of misinformation about vaccines on CAM web pages [ [55](#B55-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. [56](#B56-tropicalmed-07-00095)]. 5. Limitations 6.
