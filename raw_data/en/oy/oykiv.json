Thomas LondonHepB.org In 2003, the Hepatitis B Foundation (HBF) established a research institute, renamed in 2013 as the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute, to accelerate the pace of research for a cure. The Blumberg Institute is focused on discovering new ways to eliminate the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and to discover curative therapies. Our researchers are committed to quickly bringing forth ideas for beneficial human use, to fulfill the mission of the HBF. Most ambitiously, our goal is to hand off discoveries for human development within a three-year time frame. Today, the Blumberg Institute supports one of the the largest concentrations of nonprofit scientists working on the problem of HBV and related liver cancer. There is great excitement about the possibilities of new curative therapies for hepatitis B, and our recent progress is highlighted below. Experimental Therapeutics, led by Ju-Tao Guo, MD, the W. Thomas London Distinguished Professor, working with Jinhong Chang, MD, PhD, professor, and Timothy Block, PhD , president of HBF and Blumberg Institute, has identified several HBV antivirals that have unique targets (see Campagna, 2013; Guo & Guo, AVR, 2015; Cai, 2015; Cui, 2016; Liu, 2016). Some of these are now entering human clinical trials, with Phase II studies expected by the end of 2017. Dr. Guo has been studying the compound's mechanism of activity in detail. For example, HBV cccDNA synthesis has been shown to depend upon cellular repair enzymes (Cui, 2016; Qi, 2016). Working with Dr. Chang, they have identified first-in-class 'agonists' of stimulator of interferon genes (see Guo, 2015; Chang, 2015; Zhang, 2016). The group also searches for new drugs, using our natural products collection, led by Matt Todd, PhD with Jason Clement PhD and Sung Park, PhD. But most importantly, Blumberg Institute research discoveries are now in human clinical trials! In a license with Arbutus Biopharma, a biotech company dedicated to hepatitis B therapeutics, one HBV antiviral from our labs is in Phase I trials, and another that we have been working on collaboratively could be in human trials within the next 12 months. This is a huge milestone since our hope is that these drugs will contribute centrally to the management of, and hopefully cure for, hepatitis B.

Blumberg Institute Discoveries Enter HBV Clinical TrialsThe newsleTTer of The Hepatitis B Foundation page 3 Hepatitis B Foundation Releases Roadmap for a Cure Ju-Tao Guo, MD Jinhong Chang, MD, PhD Timothy Block, PhDThe Blumberg Institute research accomplishments even transcend hepatitis B and liver cancer. Some of the assays we design, and consequently drugs we find, have activity against other viruses. One important parallel line of work involves development of drugs active against hemorrhagic and other fever viruses of public health concern. This year, we reported new Yellow Fever virus and Ebola virus active drugs, with efficacy alone and in combination, in animal studies, carried out with collaborators at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). Early Detection Biomarkers is exciting work being conducted by our Translational Medical Research and Cancer Biomarker Discovery group, led by Dr. Timothy Block with Ying-Hsiu Su, PhD. They have focused on identification and development of liver cancer biomarkers to assist early detection and guide therapies, based on work with Anand Mehta, DPhil, now at Medical U. of South Carolina. One of the biomarkers, GOLPH 2 (GP73), has been studied in thousands of people (resulting in more than 150 publications from many institutions) and is in development by Abbott Labs for use in the U.S. (It is approved for use in China by the Chinese FDA). When used with other markers, in an algorithmic value, our biomarkers provide a very compelling non-invasive system to detect liver cancer early (Wang, 2017), and this is licensed to a spin-out company co-owned by the Blumberg Institute and inventors, called Glycotest. Dr. Su took a genetic approach and determined that human urine contains small DNA fragments from the blood that come from virtually every organ. She has now developed a panel of tests to detect specific cancer associated mutations in DNA isolated from human urine, allowing for non-invasive detection of colorectal cancer, polyps, and of course, liver cancer. This is licensed to a company she created, called JBS.New Cancer and Stem Cell Center, led by Richard Pestell, MD, PhD, world renowned cancer biologist, joined our faculty this year and has invigorated our cancer therapeutics and biology programs, establishing the Blumberg Institute's Pennsylvania Center for Cancer and Regenerative Medicine Research. They have now made a ground-breaking observation of a protein that appears to \"suppress\" prostate cancer. This information may be useful in developing new drugs, and in early cancer detection. Also, in the cancer research program, Blumberg Institute professors Yanming Du, PhD, and John Kulp, PhD, collaborated with doctors from Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York and found that the aminothiozole compound, found to be highly selective against liver cancer cells in our labs, retained excellent activity against primary liver cancers taken right out of patients. This is very encouraging and future study of these compounds is underway. The Blumberg Institute is on a roll! The dream of discovering a curative therapeutic for hepatitis B, and seeing it in use to help people, is well on track, with drugs from or in collaboration with our labs, already being tested in people. Therefore, our model in which a nonprofit research institute accelerates translation of its discoveries into human use is working. But, we expect more of our discoveries, and discoveries we inspire, to reach human trials, soon. Stay tuned!The Hepatitis B Foundation is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to finding a cure and improving the quality of life for those affected by hepatitis B worldwide through research, education and patient advocacy.

Based on consensus from 37 leading experts, our Roadmap for a Cure identifies six of the most promising areas of research into this deadly liver disease, as well as potential funding sources. The Roadmap will serve as the basis for focusing research and driving HBF's advocacy efforts to ensure sufficient public-private sector funding to eliminate hepatitis B by the year 2030. The Roadmap is the cornerstone of our Hep B Cure Campaign, a national advocacy effort to double the federal research budget to find a cure for hepatitis B and related liver cancer. In preparing the Roadmap, we sought to build on reports from the World Health Organization, and the U.S. National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, which concluded that hepatitis B could be eliminated by 2030 if a cure is found. Our Roadmap defines specific areas of research to make this ambitious goal a reality: improved understanding of virology and viral therapeutics, and immunology; liver cancer and cirrhosis therapeutics and diagnostics; and developing research reagents and experimental models. We convened a virtual workshop of 37 of the world's leading experts in hepatitis B and liver disease to identify the most promising avenues of research. Their consensus provided the basis of two papers: a white paper titled, \"A Roadmap for a Cure: Priority Areas for Chronic Hepatitis B and Liver Cancer,\" and a scientific manuscript titled, \"A Research Agenda for Curing Hepatitis B Virus Infection,\" which was accepted for publication in the journal Hepatology. To create a professional judgement budget for the Roadmap, HBF asked a panel of five experts in health research funding to align the scientific projects with existing funding at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Currently, the NIH spends an estimated $44 million each year on hepatitis B. The proposed budget calls for an additional $232 million of NIH support over the next six years (2018-2023) to support the science needed to eliminate hepatitis B. \"The time is right for an aggressive and rigorous research campaign to find a cure,\" said Dr. Timothy Block, president of the HBF and its Baruch S. Blumberg Institute. \"The almost 1 million deaths from hepatitis B worldwide is unacceptable, but recent advances in science make this a winnable battle. I am optimistic that a cure is possible and within reach.\" The HBF's Roadmap for a Cure is available at www.hepb.org/roadmap. The Hepatitis B Foundation officially launched its Hep B Cure Campaign and unveiled the Roadmap for a Cure at the Congressional Briefing on May 24 in Washington, DC. The Briefing was hosted by HBF during May Hepatitis Awareness Month in collaboration with the Congressional Hepatitis Caucus, Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, U.S. Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI) and U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA), and with the support of National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable (NVHR) and the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations (AAPCHO). Congresswoman Grace Meng (D-NY) gave a keynote address at the Congressional Briefing. \"With over 40% of my constituents being Asian Americans, hepatitis B is a priority health issue since it disproportionately impacts these communities,\" said Meng. \"This new Roadmap for a Cure is very exciting and reflects an increasing optimism among the scientific community that a cure for hepatitis B is within reach.\" Congressmen Charles Dent (R-PA) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) also supported the briefing, demonstrating bi-partisan concern for hepatitis B.Hepatitis B Foundation Releases Roadmap for a Cure First NatioNal CoNseNsus researCh PlaN For the elimiNatioN oF heP atitis B Hep B Cure Campaign Launched at Congressional Briefing hepatitis B foundation | B Informed | Fall 2017 | hepb.org 3 Hepatitis B Foundation Congressional Briefing in Wash, DC, during May Hepatitis Awareness Month.

Only people already infected with hepatitis B, or those who acquire hepatitis B and D at the same time, can become infected. Hepatitis D can be contracted the same way as hepatitis B: direct contact with infected blood or bodily fluids. Unlike hepatitis B, mother to child transmission is uncommon. Who is at risk of hepatitis D? Anyone with chronic hepatitis B who has immigrated from Sub-Saharan Africa, China, Russia, Middle East, Mongolia, Romania, Georgia, Turkey, Pakistan and the Amazonian River Basin should be tested. Hepatitis D rates in some of these countries can reach up to 60 percent in people infected with chronic hepatitis B. How is hepatitis D treated? Although there are several promising new drugs in clinical trials, there is only one currently available treatment, pegylated interferon.

The Patient Empowerment program built on the success of our three-year citywide education campaign from 2011- 2013 that provided hepatitis B education to the 1.1 million residents, which included 280,000 households, 1,400 providers and free testing of 12,000 adults, as well as 5,400 pregnant women (whose newborns were vaccinated if the moms were infected). The program focused on 1,500 chronically infected individuals, who were identified in the first phase, to empower them to take an active role in managing their disease. It involved training doctors from 52 villages about hepatitis B management and treatment, and how to support and guide the patients who were enrolled. During monthly visits and support group sessions, the doctors helped patients set their own management goals; discuss healthy choices and behaviors to prevent disease progression; identify barriers to taking care of themselves; and implement strategies for overcoming barriers. A major goal of the empowerment program was for patients to understand the importance of regular medical check-ups, and motivate them to keep appointments. At the end of the two-year program, there was a dramatic decrease in smoking and drinking alcohol, especially among infected men. Additionally, over 90% of participants reported that it was important to receive regular check-ups regardless of how they felt or how busy they were. Of those who were referred for medical evaluation, 80% reported completing a doctor visit and 74% were recommended to begin treatment, with all but two successfully beginning HBV treatment. The program had a substantial and meaningful impact on chronically HBV-infected residents in Haimen City, as reflected by lifestyle changes and improvements in hepatitis B knowledge and beliefs. The HBF hopes to expand this innovative program and use it as a model for other highly impacted communities to help reduce the enormous burden of hepatitis B worldwide. Worldwide, the medical community is fully acknowledging a hidden threat to people with hepatitis B - the hepatitis D virus (Delta or HDV). Hepatitis D, the most severe form of viral hepatitis, affects an estimated 15 to 20 million people worldwide and 20,000 people living with chronic hepatitis B in the U.S. Those who are coinfected with hepatitis B and D are at double the risk of developing cirrhosis and liver cancer, compared to those who are infected only with HBV. Since its discovery in 1977, and decades of declining prevalence, U.S. health officials assumed hepatitis D did not pose a public health threat. Recent U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) studies, however, have found that 4-5% of Americans with chronic hepatitis B are also infected with hepatitis D. As a result of these findings, researchers that include Hepatitis B Foundation's Medical Director Robert Gish, MD, are now urging medical organizations to establish hepatitis D screening and monitoring guidelines so doctors will start testing patients for this deadly virus. Educating both patients and providers about the dangers of hepatitis D coinfection is also the focus of the HBFs Hepatitis Delta Connect program (hepdconnect.org). Empowering Hepatitis B Patients in Haimen City, China A Deadly Mix: Hepatitis Delta and HBV Over 1,500 chronically infected patients were empowered to take an active role in managing their disease.6 hepatitis B foundation | B Informed | Fall 2017 | hepb.org The 5th Annual Hep B United National Summit and Advocacy Day was held July 26-28 in Washington, DC, to commemorate World Hepatitis Day on July 28 and to celebrate five years as a national coalition dedicated to reducing the health disparities associated with hepatitis B. The summit is the largest gathering of hepatitis B community leaders from around the country with over 80 partners representing community-based hepatitis B coalitions, patient advocates, local and state health agencies, national organizations, and federal partners. Meeting sessions focused on capacity building, sustainability, grant writing, partnering with local and state health agencies, collaborating on data collection, using storytelling to raise awareness, and leveraging the CDC's Know Hepatitis B campaign. At a Congressional reception during the summit, the Hepatitis B Foundation introduced its storytelling campaign, #justB: Real People Sharing Their Stories of Hepatitis B, which featured an exhibit of the 18 stories. On Advocacy Day, Hep B United members met with over 35 Congressional offices to advocate for increased federal resources to eliminate hepatitis B. We especially thank our Congressional Champions Senator Mazie Hirono, and Reps. Grace Meng, Judy Chu, Brian Fitzpatrick, and Charles Dent for their support and for posing with HBF's liver mascot, O'Liver, on World Hepatitis Day! The 2017 Hep B Champion Awards, presented by Hep B United and CDC's Dr. Cynthia Jorgensen , were given to five individuals whose collaborative community initiatives were highly successful: Cathy Phan , Health Initiatives project manager at HOPE Clinic; Vivian Huang, MD, MPH, director of Adult Immunization and Emergency Preparedness at NYC Dept. of Health and Mental Hygiene; Hong Liu, PhD, executive director of Midwest Asian Health Association; Dan-Tam Phan-Hoang, MSc, program manager of HBI-Minnesota; and the National Task Force for Hepatitis B: Focus on AAPIs. Established by the Hepatitis B Foundation and AAPCHO in 2012, Hep B United now has more than 30 local coalitions across 27 cities in 22 states and the District of Columbia, all with the goal of promoting screening, vaccination, and linkage to care to eliminate hepatitis B. The HBF is proud to announce the launch of a new logo reflecting the growth of our organization. Since our founding in 1991, HBF now includes a research institute, the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute, and a life sciences incubator, the Pennsylvania Biotechnology Center, both of which are advancing our mission to find a cure. The new logo incorporates a bold \"B\" in blue and gold to demonstrate our focus on hepatitis B. The \"B\" is repeated in new logos for the Blumberg Institute and Biotech Center as well, to demonstrate the relationship between all three organizations.

I was excited and ready to be the world's number one dad. As a finance person, I wanted to get some planning in gear \u2014 a will, a rainy day fund, life insurance. I was going to check these off by the time baby came. The insurance application included a blood test. One afternoon I got a call from the insurance company. The test results were in. The man asked, \"Do you know when you contracted hepatitis B?\" I was floored. I had no idea what he was really talking about. All I knew about hepatitis was that it was supposed to be something bad. That night, I told my wife. She was as surprised as I was. The next day, I locked myself in my office and spent hours online. Roaming through the search engines was like walking through a thick forest. Some articles roared at me like monsters, telling me I was doomed and would be six feet under by age 45. Others told me I'd be OK and could have a normal and full life. As I read on and on, I could not help wondering, \"What did I do, to get this? Did it happen when I came here to the U.S. or was it way back home in Ghana, where I lived for a couple years, or in Tanzania, where I grew up?\" The next several months were a journey through fear, understanding, and reassurance. After visits to a gastroenterologist, and a battery of tests, it was clear that I was going to survive. The doctor said that the virus was not replicating and was not currently causing any harm. He told me, \"It's good that you found out, because with minor lifestyle changes, you will be Ok.\" Stop drinking? Check. More veggies? Check. More cardio classes? Check. Bring it on! I understand now, that like all of us with this virus, I didn't do anything, to get hepatitis B. Knowing exactly where it came from isn't so important. What matters is what I can do to take care of myself ... so that I can still be the world's number one dad.

Thomas London, MD, an internationally renowned physician-scientist dedicated to the study of hepatitis B, who passed away in June. Dr. London was a key member of the research team that discovered the hepatitis B virus in the early 1960s, and founding member of the Board of the Hepatitis B Foundation and its research arm, the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute. He also served as a distinguished scientific and medical advisor to both organizations. Dr. London represented the very best in a doctor and scientist - sincere compassion, and successful achievement in advancing the cause and cure of hepatitis B. Dr. London was part of the team of scientists, led by Dr. Baruch S. Blumberg, credited with the discovery of the hepatitis B virus. Dr. London devoted his entire career to research on the etiology, pathogenesis, and prevention of primary liver cancer (or hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC) with particular emphasis on the epidemiology of chronic hepatitis B infection. In 2015, to recognize the extraordinary contributions of Dr. London, the Blumberg Institute created the W. Thomas London Distinguished Professorship. At the ceremony to celebrate the named professorship, Harvey Alter, MD, eminent scientist at the NIH and co-discoverer of the hepatitis B virus (and C virus), described the seminal contributions of Dr. London as \"world changing in magnitude, but done quietly, and modestly.\" Dr. London's wisdom and guidance will be greatly missed. 8 hepatitis B foundation | B Informed | Fall 2017 | hepb.org /hepbfoundation @hepbfoundation @hepbfoundation /hepbfoundation hepb.org/blog @hepbfoundation B back issues are available online at www.hepb.org/newslettersFind HBF on social media networks...For More Information About Hepatitis B Foundation Programs HBV Info & Support List ...
