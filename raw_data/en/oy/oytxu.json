Finding balance in our lives and bodies can sometimes feel like we're at odds with ourselves. And in today's uncertain world, managing the highs and lows of daily life can be all the more challenging. Our inability to reach equilibrium may seem like a failure. But in reality, the idealistic state of balance so many of us are trying to achieve doesn't exist. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is rooted in the idea that balance is not a static condition but a dynamic state. This is reflected in the concept of [Yin and Yang](https://elixhealing.com/blogs/the-wisdom/yin-and-yang?_pos=1&_sid=88c5478b1&_ss=r), the most fundamental principle of TCM, which represents finding balance and harmony in the universe, nature and our daily lives. Just as the outside world is constantly changing, our bodies are always flowing. This is true for everyone, but especially for people who menstruate, as our [cycle](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premenstrual-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20376780) naturally causes our body's rhythm to fluctuate throughout each month. Balance is, therefore, not an ideal we achieve but a continuous motion to maintain. The first step is to tune into our body and from there, we can begin to find harmony and balance. Introducing Daily Harmony Many of you told us that stress significantly impacts your body. It makes you feel fatigued but also keeps you up at night. Some of you experience irregularities in your menstrual cycle because of it. You told us you wanted a product that could help you better support your body every day of the month. Something to help you adapt to daily stress, increase your energy, and enhance your mood. And so we created just that. Daily Harmony is specifically designed to help you maintain balance while navigating life's daily stressors. It is a clinical strength, natural hormone-balancing herbal blend based on [Xiao Yao San](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/xiao-yao-san) (XYS), one of the most heavily-researched and clinically-proven herbal formulas in Asia. Fortified with [adaptogens](https://elixhealing.com/blogs/the-wisdom/what-are-adaptogens-and-how-can-they-help-during-my-cycle?_pos=1&_sid=29e67eb25&_ss=r) (herbs that support stress response), [Daily Harmony](https://elixhealing.com/products/daily-harmony) is proven to enhance mood, improve focus, and ease the effects of stress on the mind and body - helping you to better harmonize with the ups and downs of daily life.

More specifically, they help our bodies better manage stress by leveling our [serum cortisol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19016404/) (the stress hormone) as well as by preventing [ neurotransmitter depletion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26889268) (as in serotonin, dopamine, and GABA).
