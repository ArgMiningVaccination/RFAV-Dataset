Which brands can be trusted and which brands are just greenwashing? I tried out Caraway cookware to see if they would earn a spot on my list of recommended clean cookware. Read on to find out... Caraway cookware review Caraway states that they are on a mission to craft well-designed, non-toxic ceramic-coated kitchenware that thoughtfully raises the standards of what you cook with. I have shared in the past about my limited recommendations for clean cookware brands including [Xtrema](https://musthavemom.com/xtrema-cookware-safe-cookware/) and [cast iron](https://musthavemom.com/the-benefits-of-cooking-with-cast-iron/). After doing many hours of research on the safest cookware options for my family, I have come up with a very limited list of brands I trust. [Caraway](https://musthavemom.com/carawaycookware) is a brand I had my eye on for awhile but the jury was still out. Let's dive in and see what I unearthed about the brand. I opted to test out the Caraway Cookware Set for the purposes of putting the pans through the paces and seeing how they stood up. The set includes: - Storage - magnetic pan racks and a canvas lid holder - 10.5 frying pan - 3 quart sauce pan - 4.5 quart saute pan - 6.5 quart dutch oven The box came extremely well packaged and impressed me with the thoughtfulness of including storage and organization for my cupboards. Shipped in recycled cardboard with zero plastic bags, low impact print dyes, and 100% biodegradable cork trivets makes for a very well thought out package. Cooking for my family of six gave me plenty of opportunities to fully test out the new Caraway cookware and see how it held up. I put away all of my other cookware to see if this set was sufficient and had all the pans I needed to make breakfast, lunch and dinner for my family. It passed with flying colors and was definitely sufficient for everything I needed to make meals for my family. Before we dive any deeper into the functionality of the Caraway cookware set, I want to dive deep into whether the brand is clean cookware or not. Let's see how they stack up! Caraway products are made without any toxic materials like PFAS, PTFE, PFOA, or other hard-to-pronounce chemicals. If you aren't already aware of the health dangers with traditional non-stick cookware, let's review. Polytetrafluoroethylene (such as Teflon\u00ae) is in 95%+ of non-stick pans. 2.5 minutes is all it takes for a traditional non-stick pan on high heat to exceed 500\u00b0F and begin releasing chemicals. Research by the Environmental Working Group & many other scientists demonstrated these 'forever chemicals' take decades or longer to leave the body and they never break down in the environment. These are very harmful to your health. Want more info? Watch the movie Dark Waters which highlights what Teflon does to people and how they hide the truth from you. Caraway Cookware materials Caraway cookware uses a [mineral-based coating](https://musthavemom.com/carawaycookware) that won't leach toxic materials into your clean & healthy ingredients. Their ceramic non-stick is made from inorganic natural ingredients which are all 100% safe to use in contact with all foods (and FDA approved). High quality ceramic-coated aluminum cookware free of PTFE (such as Teflon\u00ae), lead, cadmium, and other toxic materials that can make their way into your food. We put the [Caraway cookware](https://musthavemom.com/carawaycookware) through many different food tests to see just how non-stick the safe coating was. We did eggs, cheese, chicken, steak, pasta and much more in these pans. Nothing stuck! The coating is quite amazing and is truly a safe non-stick coating. They are the only pans I am using right now. The set is sufficient for our family of six and they wash up easily with nothing stuck on even after making eggs and other foods that usually present a problem after cooking. I'm very impressed with Caraway cookware and they have joined my very short list of recommended, non toxic cookware.
