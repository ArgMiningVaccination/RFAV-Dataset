Listing a study does not mean it has been evaluated by the U.S. Federal Government. Read our | |ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04780061| | | Recruitment Status : Terminated (Public PCR testing stopped in Ontario) First Posted : March 3, 2021 Last Update Posted : October 25, 2022 - Study Details [Tabular View](/ct2/show/record/NCT04780061) study proposed is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III randomized controlled trial powered to detect meaningful differences in the overall health and symptom severity of people with COVID-19 between the treatment and control arms. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned, using a web randomization system, in a ratio of 1:1 to one of the following groups: (1) nutrient therapy with vitamin D, vitamin C, vitamin K2, and zinc or (2) placebo. Total trial duration will be 12 weeks. Nutrients or placebo will be given for a period of 21 days following enrolment and randomization. Total trial duration will be 12 weeks. Adverse events will be collected during the treatment phase plus one additional week (maximum 4 weeks). With respect to the primary outcome of participant-reported overall health, power calculations were conducted based on between-group differences at a single time point (21 days) and Cohen's guideline for a small effect size of 0.3. A sample size of 176 (88 per arm) provides 80% power to detect a difference at an of 0.05. To account for an approximate 10-15% lost to follow-up we will enrol 200 participants (100 per arm). Purpose:||Treatment| |Official Title:||Dietary Supplements to Reduce Symptom Severity and Duration in People With SARS-CoV-2: A Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Clinical Trial| |Actual Study Start Date :||July 12, 2021| |Actual Primary Date :||May D3 50,000 IU Formulation: Capsule. Each capsule will contain 500 mg (50,000 units) cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) Dose: One capsule on day 1 of the intervention period Specific Product: Vitamin K2/D Formulation: Liquid. Each 0.0285 mL drop mcg (MK-7, vitamin (vitamin D3). Dose: 0.114 mL (four drops) twice daily for 21 days totalling 240mcg MK-7 and 1,000 units cholecalciferol per day. Specific Product: Vitamin C/Zinc Formulation: Capsule. Each capsule will contain 666 mg ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and 8.3 mg of zinc acetate Dose: Three capsules three times daily for 21 days totalling 6 g ascorbic acid and 75 mg zinc acetate per day. | Drug: Vitamin D3 50,000 IU | This is a loading dose of Vitamin D. Vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3]) is a fat-soluble vitamin that is synthesized following ultraviolet radiation to the skin, naturally occurs in a few dietary sources and is available as a dietary supplement. Other Name: Cholecalciferol Dietary Supplement: Vitamin C/Zinc This is a combination of Vitamin C and Zinc. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid, ascorbate) is a water-soluble vitamin that naturally occurs in many foods and is sold as a dietary supplement. It is required for the functioning of several enzymes and is important for the immune system. Zinc is one of the most abundant essential trace elements in the human body and is required for the function of several hundred enzymes and transcription factors. Dietary Supplement: Vitamin K2/D This is a combination of Vitamin K2 (menaquinone-7) and vitamin D. Vitamin K (menaquinone-7 [vitamin K2]) is a fat-soluble vitamin found in foods and sold as a dietary supplement. Vitamin K plays a large role in synthesizing coagulation factors in the blood, and vitamin K deficiency has been associated with uncontrolled bleeding. Vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) is an alternate form of vitamin K found in foods and supplements; however, vitamin K2 has a better absorption profile50 and additionally plays a role in bone metabolism controlling the binding of calcium, especially in older adults, where it attenuates the rate of bone loss | Placebo Comparator: Control | Specific Product: Vitamin D3 50,000 IU Placebo Equivalent: microcrystalline cellulose capsule, 350 mg Specific Product: Vitamin K2/D Placebo Equivalent: Medium chain triglyceride oil Specific Product: Vitamin C/Zinc Placebo Equivalent: microcrystalline cellulose capsule, 350 mg | Other: Microcrystalline Cellulose Capsule | Placebo equivalent of Vitamin C/Zinc and Vitamin D3. Other: Medium Chain Triglyceride Oil Placebo equivalent of Vitamin K2/D - Participant-reported overall health [ Time Frame: During the intervention period (Daily for 21 days) ]Measured using the EuroQol Visual Assessment Scale (EQ-VAS). Scores each day range from 0 (worst health imaginable) and 100 (best health imaginable). - Effect of COVID-19 on the health status of participants [ Time Frame: Baseline plus weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 ]Measured using the EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire. Scores are converted into a unique health state. Health states are converted to an index value between 0 and 1, where 1 is considered the best possible health. - Symptom Severity of common COVID-19 symptoms [ Time Frame: During the intervention period (Daily for 21 days) ]Measured using an internally-developed questionnaire. Includes fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, headache, myalgia/arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, congestion, loss of taste, and loss of smell. Scores range from 0-3 for each symptom, totaling 0-42 for each day. 0 = no symptom, 1 = mild symptom, 2 = moderate symptom, 3 = severe symptom. - Total symptom duration [ Time Frame: During the intervention period (21 days) ]Measured as the time to a complete reduction of symptoms with no relapses (i.e., a 0 in all categories on the symptom questionnaire). - Incidence of delayed return to usual health [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ]Measured by the number of people experiencing \"ongoing symptomatic COVID-19\" (symptoms persisting between 4 and 12 weeks) and the number of people experiencing \"post-COVID-19 syndrome\" (symptoms persisting longer than 12 weeks) - Frequency of Hospitalizations [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ]Includes ER visits, acute care admissions, and ICU admissions - Hospital Length of Stay [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ]Number of days in acute care or ICU - All-cause mortality [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ] Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.
