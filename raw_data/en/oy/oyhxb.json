Here's what you need to know.", "sitename": "vaccinelaw.com", "date": "2021-04-15", "cleaned_text": "All vaccines recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have the potential to cause side effects for some recipients. But, these vaccines can also cause potentially serious injuries. As a result, vaccine recipients and parents must know the differences between side effects and symptoms, as many vaccine-related injuries require prompt medical treatment to prevent unnecessary complications. However, some side effects and symptoms overlap. For example, while pain after a flu shot can merely be a short-term side effect, it can also be a sign of a [ shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA)](https://vaccinelaw.com/lawyer/Vaccine-Injection-Shoulder-Injury-(SIRVA)-Vaccine-Lawyer_cp11020.htm). With this in mind, anyone who has any concerns about a possible vaccine-related injury should see a doctor promptly. Common Vaccine Side Effects According to the CDC The CDC [ lists](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm) common side effects for various vaccines on its website. This includes all vaccines recommended for routine administration to adults and children and vaccines recommended for travel. As the CDC explains: \"Any vaccine can cause side effects. For the most part, these are minor (for example, a sore arm or low-grade fever) and go away within a few days.\" Some examples of the side effects the CDC lists for common vaccines include: Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis (DTaP) - Soreness or swelling at the injection site, fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, vomiting, and fussiness for babies and small children. Seasonal Influenza - Soreness, redness and swelling at the injection site; fever; muscle aches; and headaches. Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) - Soreness, redness or rash at the injection site; fever; and gland swelling. Hepatitis B - Soreness at the injection site. Zoster (Shingles) - Redness and swelling at the injection site, mild to moderate arm pain, fatigue, headaches, shivering, fever, stomach pain, and nausea. Possible Symptoms of Vaccine Injuries As a general rule, if a side effect does not go away within a few days, if it seems worse than you would expect, or if it becomes more pronounced over time, this is a potential sign of a vaccine-related injury. Additionally, conditions not identified as possible side effects by the CDC may be symptomatic of a vaccine injury as well. For example, some potential warning signs of a vaccine injury [ include](https://vaccinelaw.com/lawyer/Vaccine-Injuries_cp20627.htm): Difficulty sleeping Difficulty talking, eating or swallowing Severe fatigue or fever Severe shoulder or arm pain Pain that becomes progressively worse or that worsens with certain movements Limited range of motion Numbness, tingling or a \"pins and needles\" sensation This list is not exhaustive, and, once again, if you have any concerns, you should not hesitate to seek a medical diagnosis. If you are diagnosed with a vaccine-related injury, you should also consult with an attorney, as you may be entitled to compensation under the [ National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP)](https://vaccinelaw.com/lawyer/FAQS_cp11728.htm).
