It has 4 of my favorite spring greens to cleanse and rejuvenate with after a long winter. If you are like me and ate way too many quarantine pizzas this winter- now is the time to give back some love to your body and feel energized again! Spring Green Made with Jasmine infused Green Tea, Nettles, Peppermint, First Flush Matcha Each of these plants offers you the gifts of spring health! Jasmine infused Green Tea Green tea is one of the best ways to support your body after being in quarantine for winter. It one of the best sources of antioxidants we have which prevent cancer, strokes and heart disease. It lowers your cholesterol, helps the body lose weight and increases your memory and brain function. It is the ultimate spring tonic! The Chinese have been using green tea for centuries and infused Jasmine blossoms maybe even before they started with tea! Jasmine flowers are layered next to the tea leaves to infuse them with their scent. Jasmine is a calming essence that helps reduce stress and relieve depression. It also is incredibly pleasurable to the palette especially paired with the vegetal note of green tea. Singing Nettle- I could write a whole blog post on the amazing healing powers of the Stinging Nettle plant. Oh wait, I already did! [Check out the full guide to nettles, with recipes and a harvesting guide here.](https://northfork53retreat.squarespace.com/news/2019/3/23/feel-the-sting-heavy-nettles) Peppermint Peppermint has been used to help digestion for centuries. It is also widely used to relieve headaches and menstrual cramps. It can help with spring allergies and clearing your sinuses. It's naturally antibacterial and improves sleep and anxiety. And it tastes wonderfully refreshing and sweetens your breath too! This is why I add mint to so many of our teas- it is the complete gift of health and flavor in one! Matcha Matcha has all the benefits of green tea but even more amplified because it is cultivated to concentrate the antioxidants in the tea tips before harvest. Matcha really deserves it's own blog soon but one thing it's known for is energy! Matcha makes you feel energized without any caffeine jitters. It does this by offering your brain a mega dose of rare amino acid called L-theanine. L-theanine energizes the brain while relaxing the stress response in body at the same time. This relaxed energy is perfect for thinking clearly and meditation, problem solving and getting things done! "}
