No Surprises Act You have the right to receive a \"Good Faith Estimate\" explaining how much your medical care will cost. Under the law, healthcare providers need to give patients who don't have insurance or who are not using insurance an estimate of the bill for medical services. - You have the right to receive a Good Faith Estimate for the total expected cost of any non-emergency services. - Make sure your healthcare provider gives you a Good Faith Estimate in writing at least 1 business day before your service. You can also ask your healthcare provider, and any other provider you choose, for a Good Faith Estimate before you schedule a service. - If you receive a bill that is at least $400 more than your Good Faith Estimate, you can dispute the bill. - Make sure to save a copy or picture of your Good Faith Estimate.

What to Expect at When Working with Jen First Session During your first appointment (the 60-minute initial consultation) you and Jen will discuss what brings you in, discuss your current concerns and get a better idea of the symptoms you are experiencing. She's then going to review the Initial Consultation Questionnaire you completed before your appointment. She'll likely ask clarifying questions in order for her to make sure she has a thorough picture of your health history. Jen is also going to ask you about your current diet, exercise habits, lifestyle, and sleep patterns. She's also going to ask you to tell her about all medications and supplements you're currently taking. None of these questions are coming from a place of judgement. Each bit of information you share with her will help her better conceptualize what might be contributing factors to how you're currently feeling. Jen is going to put you at ease and partner with you to help you start feeling better. Treatment Plan Together you will create a treatment plan that is realistic and achievable for you. It may include diet changes, lifestyle changes and specific supplement recommendations. Your treatment plan will be customized specifically to you and your individual needs and concerns. Also, Jen will be respectful of things you don't want to change as well as mindful of where you are right now in your life and your life circumstances. She is going to work with you to encourage you and give you hope that you can feel better. Jen also believes traditional medicine has a place in our health and wellbeing, therefore she works in complement to traditional medicine. While treatment plans vary, as they are customized to each person, we can provide a general idea of what treatment might look like after the initial 60-minute consultation. Jen may recommend some testing and labs (we make it super easy by using a service that sends the kits directly to your home or sending you to a local lab). These tests and/or labs will only be recommended if Jen needs a clearer understanding of what is happening physiologically within your body (her goal is to treat the underlying cause of your symptoms, and not just treat the symptoms). Follow Up After the initial consultation most people will need a 30-minute follow up appointment 2-3 weeks later and, after another 2-3 weeks, Jen will likely want to see you again for a 15-30 minute follow up appointment. These follow up appointments are for Jen to check in to see how you're doing, how the treatment plan is working, make tweaks to the plan as needed, and of course give you encouragement. About 6-8 weeks after that third appointment Jen would like to see you for a short 15-minute follow up appointment just to check in, provide any encouragement, and troubleshoot any areas where you might need help. Remember, Jen is here to help and encourage you - not scold or make you feel bad. Change can be super hard and she gets it. "}
