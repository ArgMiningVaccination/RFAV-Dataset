Most traditional medicines are mostly naturopathic, from Eastern medicine to original Western medicine, since the Greek, Roman, Persian, and European cultures, from Hippocrates and Paracelsus to Samuel Hahnemann and beyond. The real healer practices the integrative healing art form, from the body to its bio-energy, mind, and spirit. Modern naturopathic medicine is nowadays implementing traditional practices with scientific developments in nutrition, orthomolecular therapy, vitamins, minerals, nutraceutical supplements, detoxification, etc. Naturopaths aim to prevent illness through stress reduction and changes to diet and lifestyle. BACH FLOWERS Dr. Edward Bach, an English homeopath, discovered the Original Bach Flower Remedies (herbal tinctures) which is a system of 38 Flower Remedies that corrects emotional imbalances. Because the remedies are extremely diluted they do not have a characteristic scent or taste of the plant. As this dilution process results in the statistical likelihood that little more than a single molecule may remain, what amplifies the energetic/ vibrational nature of the botanical to be transmitted to the user. AROMATHERAPY It is a form of botanical medicine that uses plant materials and aromatic essential oils compounds as active ingredients, which are the immunological system of the plant, for the purpose of aiding in one's mood, cognitive, psychological, or physical wellbeing. Some essential oils possess anti-microbial, anti-viral, and anti-fungal effects, scientific evidence exists that essential oils have therapeutic effects. "}
