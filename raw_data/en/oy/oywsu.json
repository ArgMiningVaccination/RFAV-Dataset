Now I am showing some images to get some idea for writing your article. Now you got some idea. Let' Start to write our article. The Benefits of Meditation by Karan Yogi Meditation is a practice in which an individual trains the mind or transform the mind to realise the benefits of inner peace or enlightenment. Meditation begins by heating the activities of the brain for some time and going into a state of stillness or silence. In today's time, when one's life is affected be immense stress due to pressure emanating from excessive materialism, professional success, social acceptance, etc, meditation comes as a heavenly refuge. A major benefit of effective meditation is a reduction of anxiety and effects of depression. Thousands of years ago, a wandering Nepalese prince sat under a tree, vowing not to rise until he attained enlightenment. After a long night of deep meditation, Siddhartha Gautama, better known as the Buddha, saw the light and declared that suffering is subjective and can be reduced through self-awareness. This was laid the foundation of meditation as as successful technique for reducing suffering. Many studies have shown that meditation not only has mental but profound physiological effects on the body. Thus, to achieve peace of mind, meditation is an exercise not to be missed. It should ideally be followed daily and be supported by a healthy lifestyle and a healthy diet. Only 15-30 minutes of his daily can have a magical effect on one's life.
