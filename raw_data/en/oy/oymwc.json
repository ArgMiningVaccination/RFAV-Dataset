It truly has changed my life, I feel less stressed, more aware, and at peace in my life. I have an outlet to release anything that no longer serves my highest good and I can meditate anywhere! Since I have been practicing over a year, my body knows when I need to sit and get still! My favorite part of about this mediation is the silence and I feel relaxed making sure I have back support! Thank you Catherine! Much appreciation and love! - 4/10/2012First to Review If you have any stress in your life, or are looking for a different type of peacefulness, this is an amazing tool to use in your life. Catherine is a very gifted teacher, I highly recommend her if you are looking for meditation. She has studied and has much to share. Give yourself the Gift of Your Life. Check this out. - 1/5/2016 In addition to being an amazing meditation teacher, Catherine is also a skilled Ayurvedic healer. I was visiting from out of town and got that awful tickle in my throat that means a horrible cold coming on. I knew I would be in good hands with Catherine! She knew exactly what to do and in less than a day the sore throat had passed and I had moved on to a mild residual cough. Within another few days that included holiday celebrations and travel the cough was gone as well. By following her simple and practical instructions (and you need to follow her recommendations - all of them), I avoided a cold that could have ruined the holidays for me. Thanks Catherine! You saved Christmas! :-) - 6/28/2013 Catherine is amazingly awesome!!!! This was one of the best decisions of my life!!! - 8/29/2012 I tend to find myself \"spinning\" throughout the day so I took a meditation course by Catherine. Catherine has a lot of knowledge on meditation and is a great teacher. I find the flow of my day goes much smoother when I meditate.
