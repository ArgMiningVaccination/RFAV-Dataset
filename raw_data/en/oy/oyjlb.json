[Comments in red by Stephen Barrett, MD, and Timothy N. Gorski, MD]One of society's greatest achievements \u2014 and one of its greatest challenges \u2014 has been the dramatic improvement in the development and dissemination of information. Over the past several decades, new technologies have enabled people all over to world to gain rapid access to information. Not only does information travel faster, significantly more of it has become available in the United States because of increased population, higher educational levels, and changes in the workforce and economic structure. This is especially true of health information, including information about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). In a desire for improved quality and length of life, the public has sought increased information on healing systems, practices, and products from other cultures and healing traditions. Many Americans use these in the context in which they were originally developed. Others have borrowed practices and products from these systems and adapted, changed, or used them in ways that are very different from their original design or intent. New therapies, practices, and products that lie outside the conventional health care system have also been developed. All of these fall under the rubric of CAM, and people have both benefited and suffered from information about their usage, benefits, safety, and effectiveness. [This falsely implies that widely available information about \"CAM\" practices and products is largely accurate and provides benefits with little harm.] To ensure public safety in the continually evolving area of CAM, accurate information must be available so that people can make informed choices. [This is a truism, but most of members of the Commission have been spreading misinformation for many years.] This includes choosing the most appropriate type of practitioner, deciding what type of approach can benefit certain conditions, ascertaining the ingredients in a product (such as a dietary supplement), and determining whether ingredients are safe and can assist in maintaining health. Yet far too often information to help make these choices is nonexistent, inaccurate, or difficult to find. [The amount of information is huge, but most of it is untrustworthy.] The ready availability of accurate information is especially important to people who are confronting a life-threatening illness. For someone newly diagnosed with a serious or life-threatening illness, seeking information about the disease and treatment options is often their first course of action. Many people quickly become overwhelmed by the vast array of often-conflicting information that is available, and yet for some diseases and conditions, there is a scarcity of information. Getting accurate and useful information should not be an additional burden during this difficult time. [This implies that \"CAM\" is important to people with serious and lifehtreatening illnesses. Few \"CAM\" methods that might be useful for seriously ill people can actually influence the course of the ailment. The information most needed is about what to avoid rather than whatb to use.] To be effective, information must be tailored to the population it seeks to reach. People of different cultural, ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds often have different views of health and healing, different patterns of use of health care services and products, and different ways of acquiring information. People's views and behavior also vary with their age, literacy, and specific health conditions. Informational materials need to reflect the characteristics and behavior of the target population in content, style, language, and format. The Internet has given people access to vast amounts of health care information that would not have been available to them previously. Along with the advantages of being able to find information on virtually any topic quickly, the Internet presents concerns about quality, particularly in regards to CAM information. People may be making life-and-death decisions based on information from the Internet that may be misleading, incomplete, or inaccurate. [Since the Commissioners know that this is happning, it is curious that they use the weasel-word \"may.] This is particularly true in the case of CAM, for which a significant amount of evidence-based material is not yet available. As people become more interested in CAM and explore the Internet looking for information about its usefulness, efforts should be made to ensure that they have access to the most reliable information possible. [What they need most is information on what to avoid.] Other avenues of finding information about CAM are also important. The Federal government is one of the largest developers of health information, and efforts should be made to expand its coordination of existing CAM resources. [The only real gaps in government CAM information are (a) the failure to identify which CAM methods are worthless and (b) the failure of NCCAM and other government agencies to refer people to information sources that are justifiably critical of CAM methods. Setting up more agencies with similar policies would worsen the situation rather than improve it.] Public libraries are an important source of information in many communities. Training librarians in how to find information on CAM would help people navigate through the maze of available resources. [Whether that would useful would depend on who does the training and what is taught.] Advertising and marketing are another means through which people learn about CAM products and services. Although only a small percentage of the approximately $200 billion spent yearly on advertising [1] is for CAM products and services, that percentage nonetheless is significant. The vast majority of advertisers of CAM products and services comply with current laws, yet misleading and fraudulent health claims exist and are cause for great concern. [Advertising that is misleading does not comply with our laws. Most \"CAM\"-related advertising is misleading. The Commission has no factual or evidentiary basis for claiming otherwise.] Some people, particularly those who are ill, have limited language or educational skills, or lack access to the conventional health care system, are especially susceptible to advertisements that promise to cure a disease, symptom, or problem. Not only are some of these products, services, and treatments ineffective, some may even be harmful, especially if they delay necessary treatment or take money away from those with limited resources. Efforts to enforce existing laws curbing such abuses should be increased. [This is an excellent recommendation. However, although stronger federal action could drive many \"CAM\" entrepreneurs out of business, the U.S. Congress is dominated by \"CAM\" advocates who have seriously weakened consumer protection during the past decade. If WHCCAMP really wants more protection for consumers, it should advocate repealing the [Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act of 1994,](https://www.quackwatch.org/Quackwatch.com/02ConsumerProtection/dshea.html) which severely weakened FDA enforcement powers. And it should also oppose \"CAM\" advocates' efforts to weaken FTC enforcement in the same way.] One of the fastest growing areas in CAM has been dietary supplements. Sales of these products totaled $17 billion in 2000 [2], and more than 158 million consumers used them [3]. Because they are classified as dietary supplements, these products are not subject to the rigorous testing and oversight required of prescription drugs, which are targeted toward disease conditions. For this reason, complete and accurate labeling and package insert information on ingredients and on potential benefits and risks is essential. The current system does not make such information easily available to consumers. [One reason for this is the [Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act of 1994](https://www.quackwatch.org/Quackwatch.com/02ConsumerProtection/dshea.html), which classified herbs as detary supplements and made it nearly impossible for the FDA to regulate them.] The use of CAM practices and products is a growing part of the American lifestyle. As CAM continues to grow and evolve, the development and dissemination of accurate, complete, and useful information on products, practices, and practitioners will be one of the most important mechanisms for ensuring the public's safety. [Whether that would useful would depend on who does the training and what is taught. Actually, accurate information and appropriate law enforcement would decimate the \"CAM\" marketplace and lead to delicensing of the majority of \"CAM\" practitioners.] Availability of Reliable, Useful, and Accessible Information for the Public on CAM Practices and Products CAM Information from the Federal Government Consumers, health professionals, and the media often look to the Federal government for reliable and authoritative information on a wide range of health topics. The government produces thousands of fact sheets, reports, pamphlets, posters, books, and other materials that provide useful, accurate information on specific diseases, health care delivery services, research findings, and other health care topics. Information is also available though various government Internet sites and toll-free numbers, many of which are associated with a clearinghouse. [So far, the U.S. Government has ignored the vast majority of \"CAM\" practices that are irrational.] The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), located in the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has a congressional mandate to \"establish a clearinghouse to exchange information with the public\" about CAM [4.] The clearinghouse has a toll-free telephone number and provides fact sheets, information packages, and publications on CAM research and NCCAM activities. [NCCAM and its predecessors have not been a trustworthy source of information. They have consistently and deliberately avoided criticizing the majority of \"CAM\" methods that are irrational. In addition, consumers who call for information may be referred to unreliable sources.] Consumers and health care professionals can also obtain CAM- related information from NIH's National Cancer Institute and the Office of Dietary Supplements. [The amount of useful information ifrom these agencies is small.] The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Food, Safety, and Applied Nutrition has a website with information on dietary supplements. Other government entities, such as the Department of Agriculture and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), also have information related to specific CAM topics. [The FDA, FTC and USDA distribute high-quality information but have not addressed most \"CAM\"-related practices that are irrational.] Despite these resources, information on CAM from the Federal government is inconsistently available and often difficult to locate. For a variety of reasons, including limited awareness or acceptance of CAM by Federal staff or leadership, lack of agency policy on the inclusion of CAM information, and limited availability of research on many of the CAM products and services people are using, government agencies with oversight responsibilities for various aspects of health care often do not include any information on CAM in their materials. This has resulted in significant gaps in information on diseases, health conditions, practitioners, and products. Existing materials should be reviewed and, where appropriate, CAM information should be added and new materials developed. [This would be a good idea if the information were accurate. However, the odds of that happening in today's political climate are slim. The Commission seems to be implying that the availability of accurate information about \"CAM\" would promote it, but just the opposite is true.] Even when high-quality, comprehensive information on CAM is available from the Federal government, it is often difficult for the public to navigate the system and locate the desired information in a timely manner. Greater efforts should be made to promote the use of the Firstgov.gov search engine, an easy-to-use government-wide search engine. For people who do not use the Internet, a centralized, toll-free telephone number would help direct callers to the appropriate department or agency to answer their questions. Consumers, health care practitioners, the media, and other members of the public have expressed a desire for a centralized place in the Federal government to get objective, comprehensive information on CAM quickly. [This would be a good idea if the information were accurate. However, the odds of that happening in today's political climate are slim.] CAM Information From Public Libraries Many people, especially elderly and low-income people, do not have access to the Internet or do not know how to use a computer to get CAM information on the Internet. People without access to the Internet at home or at work often use publicly available resources \u2014 such as libraries \u2014 to find information. Public libraries exist in most communities and are a source of Internet access and guidance. However, many librarians lack training in how to find reliable information about CAM on the Internet. They may also be unaware of other sources of information on CAM such as books, periodicals, and newsletters. The National Library of Medicine has begun working directly with public libraries through the American Library Association to train local librarians in how to use the Internet to find health information. This effort should be expanded to include more training and focus on how to find information about CAM, both on the Internet and in other resources. [The Commission seems to be implying that the availability of accurate information about \"CAM\" would promote it, but just the opposite is true.] The Role of Public and Private Organizations in Developing and Disseminating Information about CAM Differences in how people find and use information are an important consideration in the development, distribution, and evaluation of information about CAM. According to the most recent National Adult Literacy Survey, 48 percent of U.S. adults, or close to100 million people, have very limited literacy because they lack English skills, have reading disabilities, or lack sufficient education [5]. In addition to varying literacy skills, differences in how information is located and used can exist among men and women, people in different age or income groups, and people with different racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds. Health information materials (print, radio, television, or other media) are often targeted toward specific audiences, particularly populations at higher risk of developing a particular disease or condition or those with a higher propensity for using a particular practice or product. Materials may be produced in different languages, and the content, illustrations, and style may be altered to reach the intended population. Currently available demographic data do not provide adequate information about CAM usage among various population subgroups or the range of methods and patterns in accessing CAM information. However, it is known that the use of CAM varies significantly by racial, ethnic, and cultural background, age group, health status, income, and literacy. CAM materials should be developed for each of these specific groups. Some populations are particularly susceptible to advertisements of CAM products such as herbs, tonics, and vitamins that have not been shown to be effective or that, in some cases, are even harmful. These populations may also be vulnerable to the fraudulent claims of services that promise to cure disease and treat health care problems not addressed through the conventional health care system. The involvement of trusted community leaders is essential to any effort to educate vulnerable consumers and develop strategies to prevent them from being targeted by marketing of unnecessary, harmful, exorbitantly priced, or otherwise detrimental products. [Whether or not the above activities are useful would depend upon who compiles and controls the information. So far \u2014 for political reasons \u2014 the government-generated teachings about CAM methods have been woefully inadequate. There is no reason to believe that additional funding will modify this situation.] CAM Information from Other Countries Lack of information on the effectiveness of CAM therapies is often cited as the reason for not providing them or reimbursing consumers for them. However, a potentially significant amount of high-quality CAM information has been published in other countries but is not available in English or in the United States. As globalization of information increases, the research, findings, and experiences of people in other countries can provide valuable information on the safety and efficacy of CAM. Identifying and analyzing studies published in languages other than English requires expertise in both languages and science. Greater efforts should be made to make these resources available. [This paragraph falsely implies that a large amount of information about the benefits of \"CAM\" products is available in other countries but not in the United states.] Recommendation 11: The Federal government should make available accurate, useful, and easily accessible information on CAM practices and products, including information on safety and effectiveness. Actions |11.1||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should establish a task force to facilitate the development and dissemination of CAM information within the Federal government and to eliminate existing gaps in CAM information. The task force should include consumers, CAM providers, scientists, and conventional health care practitioners. Resources should subsequently be provided to close identified gaps and improve the availability, coordination, and dissemination of information. [The only real gaps in government CAM information are (a) the failure to identify which CAM methods are worthless and (b) the failure of NCCAM and other government agencies to refer people to information sources that are justifiably critical of CAM methods. Setting up more agencies with similar policies would worsen the situation rather than improve it.]| |11.2||Federal Departments and agencies with missions or activities relevant to CAM should 1) develop informational materials about CAM that are easy to understand and use, and 2) support and collaborate with national and local community leaders and CAM leaders and organizations to identify strategies for enhancing the development, availability, and accessibility of information on the safety and effectiveness of CAM practices and products. [It is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities and to promote unsubstantiated methods.]| |11.3||Increased funding should be provided to the National Library of Medicine and the American Library Association to expand training of librarians to include helping consumers find information on CAM. [This is another way to promote dubious methods. Why should a particular subset of medical literature get special status or attention in libraries merely because it deals with unproven, disproved or irrational therapies? Moreover, it is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities and to promote unsubstantiated methods.]| |11.4||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should direct resources to streamline the process of identifying and making available relevant, high-quality CAM information from other countries and in other languages. [This falsely assumes that other countries have high-quality \"CAM\" information available.| Quality and Accuracy of CAM Information on the Internet The Internet has emerged as a major source of information about health care, including information related to CAM, for both consumers and providers. According to the most recent estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau, over half of all households in the United States have computers, 90 percent of all children age 6 to 17 have access to computers through their home or school, and 42 percent of all households can log onto the Internet [6]. An estimated 60 million U.S. adults used it to obtain health-related information last year [7]. Most Internet sites are general health information sites that include CAM information, but some sites are specific to CAM. The quality, accuracy, accessibility, and timeliness of Internet information vary greatly. Some sites provide accurate, up-to-date information, while many others contain information that is inaccurate, misleading, or outdated. The ability to ensure the quality of information on the Internet is extremely limited, both because of the nature of the technology and the First Amendment's protection of free speech. Several organizations have developed standards on ethics-related issues such as privacy and financial sponsorship of health sites on the Internet. However, some of these same organizations have developed websites that have been cited as having problems with quality, accuracy, accessibility, or timeliness of CAM-related information. [Cited by whom?] Some do not have any qualified CAM practitioners on their review boards, and the standards do not appear to have had much impact on the quality of information on these Internet health sites. [This falsely implies that qualified \"CAM\" practitioners exist and that editorial input from \"CAM\" practitioners would improve the quality of \"CAM\" informaiton on major health sites.] Public-private partnerships that include industry groups, consumers, and governments have been successful in developing guidelines and establishing standards for many products and services. Examples include the World Wide Web Consortium, a group of more than 500 public and private organizations that have developed guidelines to make web content accessible to people with disabilities, and the Healthy People Consortium, composed of hundreds of public and private organizations that have developed objectives for the Nation's health. The government can play an important role in bringing key people together to develop voluntary, non-binding guidelines that will assist industry in setting minimum standards for quality, accuracy, accessibility, and timeliness of CAM-related information on the Internet. Regardless of efforts to develop standards and ensure quality, consumers will always need to evaluate and validate information they receive from the Internet. Public education in using the Internet as a source of health information can help individuals search for knowledge and make decisions about their health. [Nearly all of the WHCCAMP Commissioners are involved in the dissemination of false and misleading infomation. Perhaps they should be concerned with cleaning up their own acts.] Internet users are concerned not only about the quality and accuracy of the information they are getting, but also about the information they may unwittingly be giving out. In a recent study, 85 percent of people seeking health information on the Internet said they are concerned about their employer or health insurance company tracking their site visits and using that information to change their insurance status or rates [7]. Unfortunately, privacy protections for people seeking health information on the Internet are limited. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 protects the privacy of consumer information collected by health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers conducting electronic transactions, but it does not protect consumers seeking health information on the Internet. In 1998, Congress enacted the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which prevents the collection of personally identifiable information from young children without their parents' consent. The FTC has filed four civil penalty actions this year to enforce the act, and additional cases are under investigation. Congress should take steps to expand privacy protection for health information seekers on the Internet. Recommendation 12: The quality and accuracy of CAM information on the Internet should be improved by establishing a voluntary standards board, a public education campaign, and actions to protect consumers' privacy. Actions |12.1||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should form a public-private partnership to review new and existing websites and to develop voluntary standards promoting accuracy, fairness, comprehensiveness, and timeliness of information on CAM web sites, as well as the disclosure of sources of support and possible conflicts of interest. Sites reviewed and found in compliance with the standards could publicize the fact and display a logo denoting their merit. [DHHS's healthfinder.gov already does a poor job of sorting out reliable and unreliable sources of CAM information. There is no reason to believe that another government-sponsored system would work better.]| |12.2||Funding should be provided to the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education to conduct a joint public education campaign that teaches consumers how to evaluate health care information, including CAM information, on the Internet and elsewhere. [Whether or not such information is useful would depend upon who compiles and controls it. So far \u2014 for political reasons \u2014 the government-generated teachings about CAM methods have been woefully inadequate. There is no reason to believe that additional funding will modify this situation.]| |12.3||Congress should protect consumers' privacy by requiring all health information sites, including CAM sites, to disclose whether they track users and if so, how that information is used and stored, including whether it is sold to third parties. [Individual privacy should be protected regardless of what information is sought.]| Availability of Information on the Training and Education of Providers of CAM Health Services to Enhance Consumer Knowledge and Choice Training, licensing requirements, certification, scope of practice, regulations, and even definitions of CAM practitioners can vary considerably. For example, traditional or lay naturopaths and naturopathic physicians have significantly different levels and types of training, yet most consumers are unaware of the difference. [Since neither group is likely to provide rational health care, it may not make much difference which ones consumers select.] In some states, acupuncture can be practiced by professional acupuncturists who have spent several years in training or by practitioners of another health modality (e.g., a physician, dentist, podiatrist, physical therapist, or chiropractor) with less, limited, or no additional training or experience in acupuncture. [This falsely implies that medical doctors who practice acupuncture are generally less qualified than graduates of schools that tach \"Oriental medicine\" to nonphysicians. However, the opposite is true because most (if not all) \"Oriental medicine\" are not qualified to make competent diagnoses or render appropriate treatment.] Herbalists may have years of informal training and experience or no formal training and little experience. The situation is further complicated by state variations in licensing requirements and scope-of-practice regulations. [Since neither herbalist group is likely to provide rational health care, it may not make much difference which ones consumers select. Navigating the maze of titles and certificates among the various types of practitioners is a challenge for consumers, most of whom are unfamiliar with the nuances of these professions. Information on a practitioner's qualifications should be readily available to help consumers make informed choices in their selection and use of a practitioner. Information on state regulations, requirements, and disciplinary actions should be readily available to help ensure consumers' safety. [Consumers who want this information are already free to ask for it. Requiring qualified practitioners to provide it without being asked will merely increase their overhead. Requiring unqualified practitioners to disclose their background would only be useful if consumers could judge the validity of nonstandard credentials \u2014 something very few people can do. The real way to protect consumers is to prevent unqualified individuals from practicing.] CAM practitioners without any formal training may be reluctant to make that fact known. Moreover, consumers may not be able to distinguish between a degree or certificate obtained from an accredited organization and a degree or certificate purchased from an organization with no requirement that students meet appropriate educational standards. However, disclosure of such information will help consumers evaluate the qualifications of practitioners and make informed choices. In addition to practitioners, people such as vendors, retailers, and multi-level marketers of CAM products should disclose their qualifications for providing health-related information. [It should be made illegal to for anyone to practice any form of health care without appropriate credentials. Training from a nonaccredited school cannot prepare anyone for clinical practice in any are of health care. Public display of such credentials should be banned.] Recommendation 13: Information on the training and education of providers of CAM services should be made easily available to the public. Actions |13.1||The Commission recommends that states require all persons providing CAM services to disclose information regarding their level and scope of training and to make it easily available to consumers. [Consumers who want this information are already free to ask for it. Requiring qualified practitioners to provide it without being asked will merely increase their overhead. Requiring unqualified practitioners to disclose their background would only be useful if consumers could judge the validity of nonstandard credentials \u2014 something very few people can do. The real way to protect consumers is to prevent unqualified individuals from practicing.]| |13.2||The Commission recommends that states disclose information on State guidelines, requirements, licensure, certification, and disciplinary actions of health providers, including CAM providers, and make it easily accessible to the public. [Some state licensing boards already provide such information.Whether doing this is cost-effective and actually protects people has not been demonstrated. Curiously, far less public information is available about chiropractors than about medical doctors and other mainstream practitioners.]| Availability of CAM Products That Are Safe and Meet Appropriate Standards of Quality and Consistency The availability and use of dietary supplements in the United States has grown significantly in the past several years. As a result, public interest in the safety and effectiveness of dietary supplements has also increased. Because they are regulated as foods rather than drugs, dietary supplements are regarded -from a regulatory perspective \u2014 as generally safe for human consumption. Yet problems with the composition and purity of some of these products have been reported and raise questions about their safety. Some dietary supplements do not contain the ingredients or the amount of the ingredients declared on the label. For example, in laboratory testing of 25 separate Echinacea products, only 14 (56 percent) were found to have the amount and type of Echinacea and polyphenol (or marker compound) claimed on the label [8]. Testing of 13 SAMe (S-adenosyl-L-methionine) products showed that 5 had less than half the amount listed on the label and 1 had no detectable level at all [9]. An analysis of 25 ginseng products showed substantial variability in the concentration of marker compounds [10]. Some herbal preparations contain ingredients other than those listed on the label, including undeclared pharmaceuticals. Herbal products claiming to contain only natural ingredients were found to contain the prescription drugs glyburide and phenformin, which are used to treat diabetes [11]. Two other herbal products were found to contain warfarin and alprazolam, prescription drugs that can cause serious health effects if not taken under medical supervision [12]. Dietary supplements have been found to be contaminated with heavy metals, microorganisms, and pesticides, and toxic levels of mercury have been reported in some imported herbal products [13]. In April and May 2001, two manufacturers recalled several products as a result of Salmonella contamination [14]. Public concern with dietary supplements includes not only possible contamination and adulteration, but also active ingredients that may be toxic or cause unwanted side effects. For example, aristolochic acid, a naturally occurring compound associated with cancer and renal failure, has been found in several herbal products, prompting a nationwide recall of products containing this substance [15]. Certain pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which are found in numerous plants used medicinally around the world, have been found to be harmful to the liver [16]. Such examples raise questions about whether current regulations are adequate to ensure the safety of dietary supplements and whether regulatory agencies can respond quickly when a problem is identified. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994, a manufacturer is responsible for determining that the dietary supplements it produces or distributes are safe and that its claims are substantiated by adequate scientific evidence. However, DSHEA does not require manufacturers to disclose the source of the information they used to determine the safety of their products. The failure to require safety data weakens the current regulatory system, making it unable to provide consumers with sufficient and scientifically valid information. [The first step in protecting consumers would be to repeal DSHEA, which was passed to weaken the FDA's ability to regulate herbs and idetary supplements.] Even though dietary supplements are regulated as foods, which are subject to the standards of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), DSHEA encouraged the FDA to develop separate GMPs for dietary supplements. The process of development has been an effective collaboration between many members of the dietary supplement industry and the Federal government. Implementation of GMPs for dietary supplements will help ensure the identity, purity, quality, strength and composition of these products. Formal publication and implementation of the GMPs are pending. [The overall effect of DSHEA has been to flood the marketplace with worthless products. Even if GMPs are established, DSHEA has made it impossible to enforce quality standards.] While implementation of GMPs for dietary supplements will address domestically produced products, finished products imported from some other countries may not meet these standards or the standards of responsible manufacturers. Such products may find their way into commerce. Appropriate government entities should work with manufacturers and importers to improve the monitoring of imported dietary supplements and prevent naturally or accidentally contaminated or adulterated products from entering the United States. Cooperation with appropriate international organizations should be encouraged in order to establish standards of quality for the ingredients in dietary supplements. These standards should include preventing the exploitation of endangered animal and plant species for the manufacture of dietary supplement products. Since the passage of DSHEA in 1994, many new dietary supplements have been introduced into the United States. For many of these supplements, particularly botanicals, validated analytical methods have not been developed. Moreover, different analytic methods are used by different manufacturers, leading to varying test results regarding concentrations of active ingredients or other marker compounds. Government, industry, and scientific organizations have begun developing analytical methods for botanicals and other dietary supplements so that consensus can be reached regarding the chemical and physical standards for composition and quality. These efforts need to be accelerated. Congress has included language in the fiscal 2002 appropriation bill for the Department of Health and Human Services in support of the development of standards, and the Commission recommends that this progress be continued. [This might be a good idea, but it will have little effect unless the FDA has more freedom to ban noncompliant products.] A framework for reviewing data on the safety of ingredients in dietary supplements is being developed by the Institute of Medicine. While this is an important step that will assist in improving the safety of specific ingredients of dietary supplements, the Commission believes that an independent review process is needed to evaluate the safety of dietary supplements, many of which contain multiple ingredients that can interact with drugs, foods, and other ingested products. An external review process was recommended by the Presidential Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels in 1997 [17] and more recently by a scientific conference [18]. Continuous, enhanced cooperation between government and industry is needed to make certain that dietary supplements are safe. [These might be a good ideas, but they will have little effect unless the FDA has more freedom to ban unsafe products. Consumer protection would be far greater if the FDA had the power to ban useless products and if manufacturers has to prove safety and effectiveness before making claims. However, DSHEA prevents both of these things from happening.] Recommendation 14: CAM products that are available to U.S. consumers should be safe and meet appropriate standards of quality and consistency. Actions |14.1||The efforts of both the public and private sectors to ensure the development, validation, and dissemination of analytical methods and reference materials for dietary supplements should be accelerated.| |14.2||The proposed Good Manufacturing Practices for Dietary Supplements should be published expeditiously, followed by a timely review of comments and completion of a final rule. The Food and Drug Administration should be provided with adequate resources to complete this task. [GMPs deal mainly with the technicalities of manufacturing and the cleanliness of manufacturing and storage facilities. They are not a substitute for ensuring that the health claims for such products are legitimate. Worthless or dangerous products prepared according to GMPs are still worthless or dangerous.]| |14.3||Adequate funding should be provided to appropriate Federal agencies, including U.S. Customs and Food and Drug Administration inspection authorities, to enforce current laws monitoring the quality of imported raw materials and finished products intended for use as dietary supplements. [The FDA already has the legislative tools to do this, but many other tasks compete for attention from its limited resources.]| |14.4||Manufacturers should have on file and make available to the FDA upon request scientific information to substantiate their determinations of safety, and current statutory provisions should be periodically reexamined to determine whether safety requirements for dietary supplements are adequate. [Manufacturers are already required to have information available to the FDA, but it is obvious that current laws do not protect the public. The only way to protect the public is to require proof of safety and effectiveness before marketing.]| |14.5||An objective process for evaluating the safety of dietary supplement products should be developed by an independent expert panel. [It is not possible to evaluate safety without considering effectiveness.]| Availability of Accurate Information on Potential Benefits, Risks, and Appropriate Use of Dietary Supplements and Other CAM Products The regulation of products such as foods, drugs, vitamins, minerals, and botanicals is determined by the intended use of the product, and the label must conform to the laws and regulations governing the product's intended use. Thus, the same product can be marketed as a prescription drug, dietary supplement, or food, depending on the manufacturer's statements regarding the product's intended use. Any product that claims to diagnose, prevent, mitigate, treat, or cure a disorder must be approved as a drug by the FDA; otherwise, such claims cannot be included on the label. Statements that a nutrient will reduce the risk of disease, such as \"diets high in calcium may reduce the risk of osteoporosis\" or \"diets low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure\" are known as health claims and must be approved under the provisions of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. This act applies to dietary supplements as well as conventional foods and it allows health claims to be made only after extensive FDA review of the scientific literature, using the \"significant scientific agreement\" standard to determine that the nutrient-disease relationship is well established. Recent Federal legislation allows a product to claim a health benefit if the manufacturer provides evidence of an \"authoritative statement\" from a Federal agency or scientific organization such as the National Academy of Sciences. However, claims about treating, preventing, curing, or mitigating diseases are reserved only for drugs. Dietary supplements may make claims related to structure and function of the body, such as \"improves immune function,\" or make no claim at all on the label. [No dietary supplement product \"improves immune function,\" and nearly all \"structure-function claims are misleading because they are incomplete. Since nutrients have many biocehnical and physiologic functions, it is truthful to state that nutrient A can \"support\" function B. However, if a person's diet is adequate with respect to nutrient A, taking a supplement is a waste of money. Therefore, to avoid being misleading, stucture-function claims must disclose the likelihood of benefit (which, for many nutrients, is very small).] Not having to undergo approval as drugs has greatly increased the accessibility of dietary supplements to the public, yet it has limited the availability of label information on potential risks, benefits, and appropriate use. For example, because it is distributed as a dietary supplement, glucosamine sulfate (2-amino-2-deoxyglucose), which has been shown in numerous scientific studies published in peer-reviewed journals to be effective in treating osteoarthritis [19], can claim only that it helps to maintain joint health. Likewise, numerous scientific studies, a monograph by the U.S. Pharmacopeia, and a meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association show that Saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) is an effective treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia [20]. This information cannot be included on the label because dietary supplements are limited to structure-function claims. [This situation is relevant to only a small percentage of supplement and herbal ingredients.] Manufacturers of products such as these have no incentive to petition the FDA for a health or drug claim because the products are not patentable and the manufacturers are therefore unlikely to recover the cost of additional research to support the claim. This situation also acts as a deterrent to investment in research on risks, benefits, and appropriate conditions of use. Yet, even when such information is known, manufacturers are limited by current regulations as to what they can claim. When information about substantial, documented risks does becomes available, as in the case of the potential interaction between St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) and certain prescription drugs [2]1, it should be included on the label of both the prescription drug and the dietary supplement. Labels should provide information about significant interactions with prescription or over-the-counter drugs, foods, or other health products, as well as information about likely, significant risks to vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, pregnant or nursing women, and those with certain health conditions or compromised immune systems. [That is true, but it is an argument for requiring manufacturers to meet the standards for drug approval.] Under current law, which holds the manufacturer responsible for ensuring the safety of products before marketing, the provision of such information is primarily the responsibility of the manufacturer. As with labeling for all products covered by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, dietary supplement labels must include all facts that are material in light of consequences (such as potential risks and interactions) that may result from use of the product or representations made about it [22]. However, some manufacturers believe that insufficient scientific evidence is a justification for not informing the FDA of a potential problem. Greater emphasis should be placed on this important responsibility of manufacturers. [Manufacturers should be required to report adverse effects.] The public expects that products sold in the United States have been deemed safe. Most people are unaware of the complexities and implications of existing regulatory guidelines or recent court decisions that have upheld the right of commercial free speech in the advertising and labeling of dietary supplements. Since many dietary supplements are purchased without the knowledge or advice of an appropriately trained and credentialed provider, information on benefits, appropriate use, and potential risks should be made easily available to consumers at the time of purchase. [This falsely assumes that manufacturers would be willing to provide information that is accurate and complete and that the FDA has sufficient resources to ensure the validity of the information. If the U.S. Congress wants to protect consumers, it much repeal DSHEA and give the FDA much stronger enforcement tools.] Although product labeling is of primary importance, labels have only limited space for information. Other options such as package inserts and point-of-sale information should be considered to ensure that consumers receive all pertinent information. Some imported products have labels with information in a language other than English. Current regulations requiring information on labels to be in English should be enforced. This does not preclude another language from being used also, but it does ensure that the majority of consumers, providers, and regulators can understand the information. Because the use of dietary supplements has grown so dramatically since the enactment of DSHEA, Federal and State regulatory agencies need more well-trained, highly skilled professionals with expertise in dietary supplements to safeguard the public. [Increasing expertise would not help unles the FDA has adequate regulatory tools, which it does not.] Expert staff are needed, particularly in the rapidly evolving area of botanicals, to help develop mutually supportive relationships between regulatory agencies and industry, thus engendering consumer confidence. Providing accurate information to consumers on CAM products is a complex technical, legal, and regulatory matter that requires ongoing participation by and consultation with the public. Recommendation 15: Provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as modified by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, should be fully implemented, funded, enforced, and evaluated. Actions |15.1||The Food and Drug Administration and other agencies with regulatory responsibilities should be provided with additional resources to 1) enforce the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act's regulations regarding labeling of dietary supplements, 2) enforce current provisions requiring that dietary supplements be labeled in English, even if the same information is also included in another language, and 3) employ additional professionals with expertise in dietary supplements. [It is difficult to understand, in practical terms, what such \"additional resources\" would accomplish. It would be far more effective to demand that products be proven safe and effective before they are marketed.]| |15.2||Current provisions requiring disclosure of material facts by manufacturers of CAM products should be enforced, and manufacturers should meet their responsibility to disclose material facts on the label, package, and/or package insert, so that the public will have information about known risks and well-documented significant interactions. Information on potential benefits of dietary supplements should also be made easily available at the time of purchase. [Current drug laws require that products marketed for the prevention, cure, mitigation, or treatment of disease be labeled with adequate directions for their intended uses. If dietary supplements (and herbs) had to meet this standard, the industry would collapse.]| |15.3||Congress should periodically evaluate the effectiveness, limitations, and enforcement of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, including its impact on public health, and take appropriate action to ensure the public's safety. [The impact is obvious: since its passage, the marketplace has been flooded with unsubstantiated claims for dietary supplements and herbs. The only appropriate action would be to repeal the law.]| Advertising of Dietary Supplements and Other CAM Practices and Products The FTC is responsible for ensuring that advertising is truthful, not misleading, and substantiated so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products being marketed. The FTC does this by enforcing laws that prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices in print and broadcast advertisements (including the Internet), catalogs, and similar direct-marketing materials. Since the passage of DSHEA, the FTC has placed increased emphasis on monitoring the advertising of dietary supplements. More than 1,500 businesses in the United States manufacture dietary supplements [23] and an estimated $700 million was spent by these companies in 2000 to advertise their products on television and in print [24]. Almost $192 billion was spent on direct marketing of all health care products in 2000, including mail, catalogs, teleservices, and the Internet. This marketing is estimated to have generated $1.7 trillion in sales [25]. To help the dietary supplement industry conform to its standards of truthful and not misleading advertising, the FTC has produced a guide that provides detailed explanations and descriptions of acceptable statements [26]. Still, abuses have been identified, particularly on the Internet and in direct-mail advertising materials. Deceptive advertising by this small segment of the industry can not only hurt consumers, but also cause manufacturers and distributors that comply with current anti-deception and substantiation standards to lose market share and suffer financially. Deceptive advertising comes in many forms. Some advertisements promise to treat or cure a disease or condition without scientific backing for the claim. Others claim to slow or reverse the aging process and increase longevity, energy, memory, and sexual function. Although some products may be beneficial for such conditions, others have no effect. In some cases, these products cause serious unintended effects, ranging from the consequences of delayed treatment to interactions with prescription drugs to increased risk of developing other conditions. A recent Government Accounting Office (GAO) report and Senate hearing [27] highlighted the potential for physical and economic harm posed by certain dietary supplements marketed and advertised as anti-aging therapies. In addition to the potential medical consequences of these supplements, the GAO reports, 20 companies marketing the products have been targeted by law enforcement agencies and have cost consumers approximately $36 million [28]. Because of the proliferation of health fraud on the Internet, the FTC has established Operation Cure.all, an ongoing project specifically targeting deceptive health marketing claims. Although Operation Cure.all is not aimed specifically at CAM- related sites, many of the fraudulent claims uncovered by the program are for CAM products and services to cure cancer, AIDS, and other chronic diseases. Although the FTC has identified hundreds of Internet sites with questionable or clearly fraudulent health claims and has sent out e-mail advisories to more than 500 of them, the agency has brought formal action against only16 since 1997. In addition to the Internet cases, the FTC has brought 40 enforcement actions since 1997 against companies for deceptive marketing of dietary supplements in other media, including radio, television, newspapers, magazines and direct mail. The advertising challenged by the FTC promoted products for such conditions as attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, colds and allergies, impotence, diabetes, vascular diseases, and obesity. Current FTC efforts should be significantly expanded to decrease the amount of false or deceptive advertising, to solicit public comments on CAM advertising, and to expand the use of CAM experts in the process of examining advertisements. [To increase FTC efforts, Congress would have to increase its budget so it can afford to hire more staff. No \"CAM\" expertise is needed to deterine whether advertising is false. The FTC can easily do this by asking sellers for substantiation and subjecting what is submitted to review by mainstream experts.] ] Recommendation 16: Activities to ensure that advertising of dietary supplements and other CAM practices and products is truthful and not misleading should be increased. |16.1||Congress should provide additional support to the Federal Trade Commission to 1) expand efforts to identify false and deceptive advertising of CAM-related health services and products and take appropriate enforcement action when necessary, 2) use appropriate CAM experts in the process of examination of CAM-related advertising, 3) increase activities to help consumers distinguish useful and reliable information from deceptive and unsubstantiated advertising in all forms of marketing and advertising, including at the point of purchase; and 4) seek additional public comment on the benefits and potential problems in the advertising of CAM-related services and products. [This is an excellent recommendation. However, although stronger federal action could drive many CAM entrepreneurs out of business, the U.S. Congress is dominated by CAM advocates who have seriously weakened consumer protection during the past decade. If WHCCAMP really wants more protection for consumers, it should advocate repealing the 1994 Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act which severely weakened FDA enforcement powers. And it should also oppose CAM advocates' efforts to weaken FTC enforcement in the same way.]| Collection and Dissemination of Information on Adverse Events Stemming from the Use of Dietary Supplements Most dietary supplements are likely to be safe for human consumption, yet, as with any biologically active substance, adverse events can and do occur. The rigorous pre-market testing and review process required for pharmaceuticals is not required for dietary supplements. Therefore, monitoring of adverse events after supplements reach the market is critical to understanding their effects and interactions and to responding quickly when problems do occur. The FDA uses the Adverse Events Reporting system to identify emerging problems with specific products and general trends in illness and death related to dietary supplements. However, reporting is voluntary \u2014 manufacturers and distributors are not required to notify the FDA of adverse reactions that are reported to them. In April 2001, the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services issued a report calling adverse event reporting for dietary supplements \"an inadequate safety valve\" [29]. The report identifies the limitations of the Adverse Events Reporting system in detecting serious adverse events and recommends ways of improving it. Serious adverse events (as defined under Medwatch and the FDA's Standard Operating Procedures of 1999) related to dietary supplements need to be identified and, when necessary, contained in a timely manner to prevent unnecessary illness and death. Since manufacturers are not required to register themselves or their supplements with the FDA before producing or selling them, a potentially dangerous situation could be extremely difficult to contain. [The best solution to this problem should be to require proof of safety and effectiveness before they are marketed.] Manufacturers and suppliers should be required to register their products with the FDA so that the agency can quickly notify other manufacturers and suppliers and the public when a serious adverse event occurs. In addition, information from poison control centers needs to be linked with the Adverse Events Reporting system. Recommendation 17: The collection and dissemination of information about adverse events stemming from the use of dietary supplements should be improved. Actions |17.1||Congress should require dietary supplement manufacturers and suppliers to register with the Food and Drug Administration, and the agency should encourage voluntary registration until such a requirement is in effect, so that manufacturers, suppliers, and consumers can be promptly notified if a serious adverse event is identified. [This is one of the few valid ideas in the WHCCAMP report.]| |17.2||Recent congressional support for improving the Food and Drug Administration's adverse events reporting system should be enhanced by requiring dietary supplement manufacturers and suppliers to maintain records and report serious adverse events to the agency. [This is one of the few valid ideas in the WHCCAMP report.]| |17.3||Additional resources and support should be provided to 1) the Food and Drug Administration to simplify the adverse events reporting system for dietary supplements, and to streamline the database for timely review and follow-up on received reports; and 2) the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other appropriate Federal agencies to increase outreach activities to consumers, health professionals (including poison control centers, emergency room physicians, CAM practitioners, and mid-level marketers) in order to improve both manufacturers' and the public's awareness of and participation in voluntary event reporting. [This might be useful, but it would be more efficient to require that products be proven safe and effective before marketing.]| References - Coen Robert, The Insider's Report, Universal McCann, Dec 3, 2001. http://www.mccann.com/insight/bobcoen.html. - U.S. Dietary Supplements Market Size Expressed as Dollar Sales by Top Six Product Categories for 1994 to 1998 and Forecast for 1999 and 2000, National Business Journal, 2000, Dialog file No. 93, San Francisco: The Dialog Corporation, 2000. - Survey of Consumer Use of Dietary Supplements, Prevention Magazine.

In March 2000, President Clinton announced the creation of a [White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy (WHCCAMP)](https://www.whccamp.hhs.gov/) to provide a report to the President on \"legislative and administrative recommendations for assuring that public policy maximizes the benefits to Americans of complementary and alternative medicine.\" Nearly all of the Commissioners are philosophically aligned and economically involved with the so-called \"CAM\" movement. Few knowledgeable critics were appointed. The Commission worked for two years and submitted its final report to HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson in March 2002. The report, which represents the views of 17 or the 19 Commissioners, recommends across-the-board \"integration\" of \"CAM\" into government health agencies and the nation's medical, medical education, research, and insurance systems \u2014 a situation that would promote unscientific practices and waste countless millions of taxpayer dollars. The other two Commissioners warned Secretary Thompson that the report was biased and that the process of preparing it was corrupt. Here's what they wrote: March 10, 2002 The Honorable Tommy G. Thompson Secretary, Health and Human Services Washington, DC 20201 Dear Mr. Secretary: We would like to thank the American public for allowing us to serve on the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy. The Commission struggled with many complex issues and the final report reflects the enormous effort and hard work of the Commissioners and staff. We support many of the Commission's recommendations and appreciate the efforts to accommodate a diversity of views and achieve a consensus. Nonetheless, we feel it necessary to write this additional statement to provide clarification as these recommendations are considered for implementation. These are views we have stated consistently throughout the Commission's twenty months of deliberations. The Executive Order 13147 directed that The White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Policy \"shall provide a report, through the Secretary, to the President on legislative and administrative recommendations for assuring that public policy maximizes the benefits to Americans of complementary and alternative medicine.\" While many of the Commission's recommendations will help maximize the benefits of proven safe and effective approaches, practices and products, they do not appropriately acknowledge the limitations of unproven and unvalidated \"CAM\" interventions or adequately address the minimization of risk. In this statement we will seek to be specific in our critique about these risk/benefit questions. In this effort we hope to give voice to the healthy skepticism that exists in many sectors of American public life with regard to complementary and alternative medicine, a perspective that may not have been adequately represented in the constitution of the Commission or in the testimony that we heard. 1. Acknowledging the Limitations of Unproven CAM Interventions While the Report acknowledges that much of what is considered \"CAM\" has not been shown to be safe and effective, a presumption exists that complementary and alternative medicine will be found to be beneficial. This advocacy tone persists in the Report despite great efforts to achieve editorial balance. Despite qualifying statements added to the Introduction of the Report \u2014 which we endorse \u2014 the body of the document continues to give voice to a perspective that suggests that the most \"CAM\" interventions will be proven to be safe and effective through scientific research. Last minute revisions to the Introduction do not mitigate more global statements that permeate the Report. There continues to be language suggesting that \"CAM\" will lead us into a new paradigm of health care that will provide answers for those with chronic disease, as well as our aging and under-served populations. We will discuss these concerns in the context of research priorities, access and the underserved, the provision of primary care services and medical education. 1.1 Research Priorities We strongly endorse the need for more research; however, we recognize that research dollars are finite. The Commission's lack of a prioritization strategy for research initiatives, given the many areas that \"CAM\" encompasses, makes a general endorsement of research of limited value. Promising areas of research should be investigated because they potentially have something to offer to the health of the American people or because they advance our scientific understanding of illness and healing. Asking for more research money to investigate an approach, practice or product simply because it is \"CAM\" is an ideological, not evidence-based approach to science. Recommendations for research on \"frontier areas of science\" without a strategy for building this research on scientific foundations may result in spending precious health care research dollars on areas that are unlikely to yield any beneficial data such as \"iridology\", \"psychic healing\" et. al. While dogmatic disbelief of everything that is not currently explainable is foolish, and indeed unscientific, it seems equally foolish to ask the taxpayer to bear the enormous expense of sorting out those areas that are plausible from those that are improbable. With sound research priorities in mind, we feel it is important to point out that many of the recommendations made in the research and access sections of the Report are already being undertaken by NCCAM, a Center within the National Institutes of Health. NCCAM has established fifteen specialty research centers that cover \"CAM\" approaches for many areas of major public health need. These centers are focused on studying the underlying mechanisms of \"CAM\" modalities, cancer treatments, \"CAM\" for end-of-life care, botanicals, the use of \"CAM\" therapies to reduce health disparities and integrative medicine. Given the concentration of expertise and existing infrastructure at NCCAM, recommendations for a wide sweeping \"CAM\" research agenda to be implemented across a large number of federal agencies does not appear to be a cost-effective or logical way to make progress. 1.2 Access and the Underserved When the Commission sought to be inclusive by expanding access to \"CAM\" products, providers and modalities to underserved populations through demonstration projects or other programs it did not adequately appreciate that these recommendations were being made for populations which have limited or no access to conventional medical care. In this context, the provision of \"CAM\" becomes neither a complementary nor integrative intervention, but rather a less validated alternative to conventional care. The Commission heard testimony that many underserved populations utilize folkloric or \"CAM\" interventions because they cannot afford access to conventional care. It is worth considering whether these individuals would prefer a drug benefit over access to unproven supplements or if they would seek out \"CAM\" providers if they had the resources to receive care from primary care practitioners. Given the state of the science, most \"CAM\" interventions can only be said to add to and not replace conventional interventions. A consideration of \"CAM\" entitlements or an expansion of insurance benefit packages is one thing in the context of preexisting access to conventional medical care. It is ethically quite another in the absence of such coverage. While there is room for diversity in the health care system, we should not be a party to creating a separate but unequal care system. It is our strong belief that we should provide basic health care to every American before expanding benefits to include treatments or approaches that have not been shown through rigorous research to treat or prevent disease. We must never foster a second-tier of medical care for those who are economically disadvantaged. 1.3 Primary Care Practitioners The Commission debated at great length whether or not we would recommend that \"CAM\" practitioners be included in loan-forgiveness and scholarship programs, especially as it relates to their possible inclusion in the National Health Service Corps. The Report carefully delineates the eligibility requirements for inclusion in this program and why Title VII of the Public Health Services Act does not recognize \"CAM\" practitioners as primary care providers eligible for inclusion in this program. While we endorse demonstration projects that seek to identify what, if any, value \"CAM\" providers add to established primary care teams, we want to go on record noting that we do not believe that CAM providers are fungible with the primary care providers enumerated in Title VII. This concern does not mean that some CAM practitioners do not have the potential to add to the public health or meaningfully affect the lives of patients. It is simply that they are not positioned for equivalency with conventional primary care providers. Efforts to equate their degree of training, or the scientific basis of their practice, with that of the designated primary care specialties puts the public at risk of receiving unvalidated and non-evidence based primary care. 1.4 Education and Training of Conventional Practitioners Conventionally trained health care practitioners must be able to dialogue with their patients about a wide variety of topics including sexuality, domestic violence, substance abuse, spirituality, death and dying, pain, emotional health and non-conventional therapies. We strongly support the need for health care providers to be able to critically assess the evidence for approaches, practices and products that their patients may be using, however, most medical schools (approximately 72%) already teach courses on what is considered \"CAM\". If the critique is that conventional medical curricula are lacking in areas such as nutrition, self-care instruction or preventive medicine, the appropriate response is to improve the teaching of this subject matter. Furthermore, as medical educators we believe that recommendations for curricular reform will be better received if they are not cast in language that implies a mandate. Whatever is included in the medical curriculum must remain true to scientific integrity, avoid ideological indoctrination and guard against teaching unproven treatments to the next generation of health care providers. 2. The Minimization of Risk To fully meet the spirit of the Executive Order, the Report would need to do more than identify the benefits to be maximized. It would also need to avoid the assumption of avoidable risk, especially when the benefits are uncertain and the risks are clear. We will now comment on how the Report's lack of definitional clarity limits appropriate risk management, address public preferences regarding regulation and consider the special concerns of vulnerable populations. 2.1 Lack of Definitional Clarity Addressing the risks or benefits associated with \"CAM\" interventions is difficult because the recommendations suffer from a lack of specificity. Generic recommendations neither serve the public interest nor protect the public health because they fail to distinguish between approaches, practices and products for which there is some scientific evidence and those that either stretch the realm of logic or are demonstrably unsafe. The Report's inability to discriminate amongst \"CAM\" practices, products and practitioners leaves its recommendations open to interpretation. This limits their applicability as public policy. The Report's lack of definitional clarity undermines the legitimacy of safe and effective non-conventional approaches by failing to distinguish them from treatments that are improbable or fraudulent. For instance, there is strong evidence that relaxation therapies help reduce chronic pain in patients with a variety of medical conditions. Glucosamine sulfate has been found superior to placebo for the treatment of osteoarthritis. However, chelation therapy has not been shown to be beneficial for the treatment of ischemic heart disease, though is still promoted as a treatment. Alternative diets, coffee enemas, ozone therapy, and shark cartilage offer little for cancer patients, however, acupuncture, aromatherapy, and meditation may be useful for nausea/vomiting, mild relaxation, and pain/anxiety, respectively. The Report's inclusion of all \"CAM\" practices, without appropriate nuance, fails to adequately appreciate the heterogeneity of these practices. This omission undermines those areas within CAM that have already demonstrated safety and efficacy and may be ready for integration into the healthcare system. Wellness and Health Promotion \"Promoting wellness\", \"health promotion\" and \"prevention practices\" are phrases that recur throughout the Report and are cited as being the focus of many \"CAM\" approaches. It is unclear what these terms actually mean, as no clear examples are provided in the document. If it means that one can enhance his or her sense of well being through a healthy diet, regular exercise and other lifestyle modifications, there is little debate. There is a large body of evidence for the beneficial role of nutrition, exercise and stress management in the scientific literature. The Commissioners debated the inclusion of these lifestyle approaches under \"CAM\" and the final Report acknowledges that these approaches are found in both \"CAM\" and conventional medicine, but claims that there is a \"greater emphasis\" placed upon them in \"CAM.\" One has only to visit the local book store to find the numerous \"fad\" diet books that fall under \"CAM\" nutrition \u2014 high fat/high protein diets, eat according to your blood type diets and fruitarian diets, to name a few. There is no single \"CAM\" nutritional approach. In addition, if one were to accept that there actually is a greater \"emphasis\" on sound, scientific nutrition and exercise amongst \"CAM\" practitioners, there is no documented evidence that they are any more successful than conventional practitioners in motivating their patients to make lifestyle changes. The Report fails to point out that \"CAM\" \"health promotion\" and \"prevention practices\" also toxins,\" \"cleansing the liver\" and/or by \"cleansing the blood\" via a multitude of supplements and questionable practices. Our uncritical acceptance of \"CAM\" wellness and health promotion can be interpreted as an endorsement of these claims. It is absolutely unclear what role, if any, \"CAM\" practices play in preventing disease and to what extent patients are burdened with useless treatments and products in their pursuit of \"wellness.\" The Contributions of Public Health and Medicine to Wellness Registered dietitians, clinical nutritionists, conventionally trained scientists, physicians and public health professionals have done the bulk of the research in the area of nutrition. It is important not to overlook the contributions of the pioneering Framingham study that documented the epidemiology of obesity, smoking and heart disease, which led to heart healthy diets, smoking cessation, and a greater emphasis on exercise. Through rigorous science we now have a much better understanding of the role foods, nutrients and exercise play in health and disease. The notion that only \"CAM\" supports healthy nutrition is neither accurate nor fair. Furthermore, the suggestion that conventional medicine is primarily focused on disease, while \"CAM\" is primarily focused on health promotion and prevention was a point of contention on the Commission. This perspective fails to adequately acknowledge public health initiatives that have been an integral part of medicine for decades, efforts that have dramatically improved the health of the Nation. Cooptation of Spirituality The most troubling of these conflations is the inclusion of spirituality under the rubric of \"CAM.\" There is no question that many Americans find comfort in prayer, religion and/or spiritual practices and that more attention should be paid to the role of spirituality in health care. Nonetheless, it is disconcerting that the Report often categorizes spirituality as a \"CAM\" modality. The Report cites papers that assert that when a patient is diagnosed with cancer and turns to prayer for comfort, he or she is considered to be using \"CAM.\" When spirituality is so designated, \"CAM\" prevalence grows dramatically. The truth is that spirituality transcends any arbitrary designation of conventional and non-conventional medicine and cannot be claimed by any particular group. Furthermore, the conflation of spirituality and/or religion with CAM could lead to an abridgement of the free exercise of religion by subjugating its practice to a regulated modality. In sum, generic pronouncements about \"CAM\" neither serve the public interest nor protect the public health. It is essential to separate the effective from the ineffective, the safe from the unsafe and to contextualize these practices against conventional modalities before any of them can be recommended for incorporation into the Nation's healthcare system. While recognizing that research will eventually answer many of these questions, the Commission's inability to distinguish and critically evaluate broad categories of practitioners and modalities in a meaningful way, limits the applicability of many worthy recommendations. 2.2 Public Preferences and the Regulation of Supplements The access section of the Report is predicated upon the premise that, \"The public has expressed interest in maintaining easy access to CAM practitioners.\" Notwithstanding the selection bias of those who presented public testimony to the Commission, the data does not support that this is the view of a majority of Americans. In fact, if we consider the regulation of dietary supplements as a well-studied case in point, the literature indicates that the use of dietary supplements has decreased and that the majority of Americans support increased regulation of supplements, including requiring the Food and Drug Administration to review the safety of new dietary supplements prior to their sale. This support for increased regulation and safer products is likely a consequence of publicity surrounding St. John's Wort and drug-interactions, the potential liver toxicity of Kava, the presence of the anti-coagulant warfarin in PC-SPES, an herbal product used for prostate cancer and the presence of heavy metals in a number of Asian herbal preparations. We strongly support a number of recommendations made in the Report regarding the quality, safety and advertising of dietary supplements and the full implementation of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA). However, it remains to be seen if the full implementation of DSHEA will provide the public with the right combination of access and safety that national surveys indicate it desires. For this reason, we strongly endorse the recommendation that Congress re-evaluate DSHEA following full implementation. 2.3 Vulnerable Populations Patients will often resort to \"CAM\" practices, modalities and practitioners upon the diagnosis of a debilitating, chronic or terminal condition. Recent Senate hearings have documented the special vulnerability of the elderly on fixed-incomes to these phenomena. The Report's contention that medicine lacks adequate treatment for pain and symptom management could contribute to the mistaken notion that conventional medicine has nothing to offer patients who chronically ill or in the process of dying. It is important that the public be aware of the fine work done in hospices around the country and the emergence of palliative care as an important evidence-based clinical discipline able to ameliorate patient and family distress. 3. Closing Statement We hope that the American public is well served by the Commission's work. The Commission made enormous progress during its deliberations and we support many of its recommendations. We believe that some of aspects of \"CAM,\" when appropriately defined, have the potential to benefit the health of the American public. However, the Commission's inability to appropriately acknowledge the limitations of unproven and unvalidated \"CAM\" interventions or adequately address the minimization of risk necessitates this statement. We remain optimistic that the work of the Commission and the many people who presented testimony before it will make a contribution to the public's understanding of this complex issue. We hope that the diversity of views on this topic does not engender divisiveness. Where medical care is concerned, the common good calls for ideology and advocacy to yield to scientifically sound evidence of safety and efficacy. We are confident that this can be accomplished with respect and compassion for all Americans. We appreciate the honor of serving with our fellow Commissioners and thank you for your consideration.

The article contributed significantly to the recent explosion of interest in \"alternative medicine\" in the United States. The paper reports a telephone poll of 1539 people on their use of \"unconventional\" methods on the previous year. Until that time quackery and medical pseudoscience practices existed in a fringe subculture. This began to change around the time of this article's appearance and the report has become one of the most frequently cited articles in the medical literature. The lead author was David M Eisenberg, MD, whose chief publication up until this time had been a popular book on the wonders of traditional Chinese medicine entitled Encounters With Qi. The article began by acknowledging the difficulty of defining \"unconventional, alternative, or unorthodox therapies,\" referring to \"medical practices that are not in conformity with the standards of the medical community.\" This is a fairly satisfactory definition of \"alternative medicine\" if \"the standards of the medical community\" are understood to include methods that are truly effective or which are under appropriate and well-designed scientific investigation. But the Eisenberg article settled on a definition of \"unconventional medicine\" being those \"medical interventions not taught widely at U.S. medical schools or generally available at U.S. hospitals.\" It addressed the question of how widespread these methods are and how much money is spent on them in relation to medical care that is more or less in conformity with medical and scientific standards. The 1539 people interviewed were a subset of 2295 respondents who agreed to participate and actually finished the interview. The 2295 people were, in turn, found by calling 5158 telephone numbers and excluding more than half of them because they were not working, were \"not assigned to households,\" did not speak English, or were cognitively or physically impaired. But for the sake of argument and brevity, my comments leave aside the implications of these facts - that the survey was not representative of the population. The telephone polling began by asking respondents about 24 medical conditions. Only 8% of respondents offered other \"important conditions.\" The ten most frequently reported medical conditions listed by the Eisenberg survey are shown in Table 1 with, for comparison, figures from the Centers for Disease Control's Vital and Health Statistics, Prevalence of Selected Chronic Conditions 1990-92. |Medical Condition||From Table 3 of | Eisenberg Article. |CDC Vital and Health Statistics, Prevalence of Selected Chronic Conditions |\"Back |Chronic bronchitis||5.2%| The Eisenberg survey also asked about dizziness, diabetes, and cancer, but the rates of these disorders and 11 others that the 1539 respondents were asked about were not given in the article. Presumably they were less than 8%, although, as is shown, hearing problems, skin conditions, and heart disease in the general population are in this range of prevalence according to the CDC. Deafness, of course, was the condition that D.D. Palmer \"cured\" when he \"discovered\" chiropractic more than a hundred years ago. Notably absent from Eisenberg's data were common ailments such as colds, cough, and flu. Neither was there mention of obstetric or gynecologic disorders, which are probably the most common medical problems of reproductive aged women. Among women aged 18-44, for example, roughly the range in which Eisenberg reported the highest rate of use of \"unconventional medicine,\" the CDC reported the prevalence of menstrual disorders as 2.8%, bladder infections 1.4%, kidney infections 1%, and other disorders of the female genital tract at 3%. Taken together as genitourinary problems, and including pregnancy and pregnancy-related complications, these would almost surely total 8% or more. Yet they appear to have been excluded. Also absent was obesity, which is notable because commercial weight loss centers were included in \"unconventional medicine\" methods and were used by more respondents than the majority of other methods. As one of a variety of chronic medical conditions that has proven extraordinarily resistant to successful management by any means, obesity has been and continues to be a prime target for \"alternative medicine\" promoters. Its absence here is inexplicable. When the survey respondents were asked about their use of \"unconventional medicine\" and whether or not they had seen a practitioner or \"provider\" of same, the answers broke down as shown in Table 2. |Type of Therapy||Used in Past 12 Months (%)||Saw a provider | (% of those exercise and prayer)||34||36| \"In the case of prayer, we thought [additional] questions would be inappropriate. As for exercise, we thought the term was too vague and the practice sufficiently ubiquitous to preclude the gathering of useful data.\" [from \"The Interview\" section of Eisenberg et al, 1993] The survey did not include some common aberrant methods, and included ones that did not fit the report's own definition. Among those not mentioned were chelation therapy (for atherosclerosis), antineoplastons, iridology, reflexology, aromatherapy, crystal therapy, kinesiology, magnets, acids and other non-herb \"nutritional supplements\" consisting of biochemical precursors, co-factors, and intermediates, Maharishi Medicine (previously known as Ayurveda), naturopathy, urine-drinking, bee pollen, royal jelly, snake venom, colloidal silver, colonics, light therapy, and ozone therapy. All of these methods and others continue to receive credulous media attention, are widely promoted, and have attracted outspoken and devoted advocates. Their absence from the list raises questions of completeness and of representation of the \"alternative\" field. Perhaps their use fell below the level of detection, but if so, that makes the \"34%\" use of \"alternative methods\" to be made up of other methods, perhaps not at all unconventional. Turning to the listed items, hypnosis, while only 1%, was included in \"unconventional medicine.\" Yet hypnosis is an accepted adjunct to medical science in appropriate circumstances. It is taught at many U.S. medical schools and psychiatry residencies. Biofeedback, despite lack of firm effectiveness, retains a similar position. Although chiropractic was listed as the second most commonly used method, the study did not distinguish it from manipulative therapy, used by some osteopathic physicians and physical therapists. Some respondents may have experienced \"chiropractic \" in those forms. The study did not look at these important distinctions in order to distinguish, say, hypnosis used for pain control from use in past-life regression or to recall alien abduction experiences, or medical manipulation for joint mobilization from chiropractic treatment of childhood ear infections and learning disabilities. The following statement explained about the methods reported in the survey: \"We did not ask whether the respondents' providers of unconventional therapy were medical doctors.\" So, conceivably, some \"chiropractic\" was administered by physical therapists and D.O.'s. Some, or possibly all \"biofeedback\" took place at medical clinics specializing in pain management. And \"megavitamin therapy\" might include niacin for hypercholesterolemia and other standard pharmacologic applications of vitamins. In the case of chiropractic there is another curious anomaly. Fully 30% of those who said they used chiropractic in the previous 12 months apparently did so without benefit of a chiropractor. The authors acknowledge that \"Some forms of unconventional therapy typically involve a provider (for example, a chiropractor or acupuncturist).\" But there is no attempt to explain or account either for the 30% of chiropractic use that people were practicing on themselves or the more curious finding that 9% of users of acupuncture had apparently been practicing on themselves. Or do these inconsistencies suggest another form of massage? Again, \"Some users of unconventional therapy may visit a provider less often than once a year but may continue to use the prescribed unconventional therapy.\" Was this the case only with imagery, \"spiritual healing,\" and commercial weight loss programs, or also with a third of those who said they had used chiropractic and nearly a tenth of those who said they had used acupuncture? The most-used \"unconventional medicine\" was \"relaxation techniques.\" It was among the most-used methods for all of the ten top medical conditions considered besides \"back problems\" and allergies, as shown in Table 3. |Of Those with||\"Unconventional Medicine\" use in the just what are \"relaxation techniques?\" Medical school graduates, as well as professionals in hospitals would agree that the idea of physical, mental, and emotional rest are components of good medical care. What is \"massage?\" It is a universal practice, when people injure themselves reflexively resort to \"massage\" the area. It would be difficult, given this, to find anyone who does not utilize \"unconventional medicine.\" The authors recognized this problem, saying: \"Some of the unconventional therapies studied warrant further clarification. For example, 'massage therapy' or 'relaxation therapy' may mean different things to different people.\" But, again, this was stated only in the small print, not to be found in interpretation and discussion of results. \"Spiritual healing\" certainly means different things to different people as well. To most it means a healing ceremony of some sort, usually with a group. But is it also \"spiritual healing\" when a Catholic priest comes to the hospital bed to administer a sacrament? Or when anyone says a religious prayer? These practices are not taught in medical schools, but it seems doubtful that this deserves to be considered as \"unconventional medicine.\" Likewise, the use of \"imagery,\" especially in the management of insomnia and anxiety, is so customary that it is a clich\u00e9 to speak of counting sheep to bring on drowsiness or imagining one's audience to be naked in order to allay stage fright. But most, if not all of these qualifications, and omissions of distinctions had the cumulative effect of maximizing the numbers of survey respondents who could be said to have used \"unconventional medicine.\" This, in turn, was used to support similarly magnified extrapolations of the use and economic impact of \"unconventional medicine.\" So, for example, the Eisenberg report stated: The estimated number of ambulatory visits to providers of unconventional therapy in 1990 was 425 million. This number exceeds the estimated 388 million visits in 1990 to all primary care physicians (general and family practitioners, pediatricians, and specialists in internal medicine) combined. But these \"providers\" included masseurs and masseuses who make no claims of curing any diseases, commercial weight loss methods, and self-help group meetings. And they might have included many physicians or people who working in conjunction with physicians, delivering appropriate care in conformity with medical scientific standards. Or perhaps they were not included. It is not possible to know from the data presented. The article compares \"alternative\" visits to those to general and family practitioners, pediatricians, and internists. As before, there is no mention of obstetrics and gynecology, even though it is well-known that many women depend on their Ob/Gyn physicians as their primary doctors, or to other medical specialists who might serve as primary physicians. Considering the prevalence of \"back problems,\" allergies, and anxiety and depression, why not include the annual number of visits to orthopedists, physiatrists, physical therapists, allergists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and clinical social workers? By including some practitioners and excluding others, the authors are able to pick their way to justifying their major conclusion that, \"unconventional medicine has an enormous presence in the U.S. health care system.\" The authors go on with their finding that \"fewer than 3 in 10 users of unconventional therapy mention its use to their medical doctors,\" ignoring the fact that some of this \"unconventional medicine\" may even have been supplied by or at the recommendation of medical doctors. Moreover, the importance of visits to \"unconventionals\" is variable. A physician may not attach much importance to whether a patient had a massage, attended a Weight Watchers' meeting, or even seen a chiropractor in the previous 12 months. No one study is expected to answer all questions about an investigated matter. But what would be useful to know is how many people, given a serious diagnosis by a physician, seek out acupuncture, homeopathy, or a brown rice diet in lieu of appropriate medical or surgical treatment, or use substances that interfere with prescribed drugs? How many unnecessarily use ineffective methods for disorders that are self-limited? \"Roughly half of those who use unconventional medicine for their principal medical conditions have no supervision of this treatment by either a medical doctor or a provider of unconventional therapy.\" But, again, what is the significance of someone's using \"relaxation techniques\" or imagery in an unsupervised setting? \"The use of unconventional therapy,\" they warned, \"especially if it is totally unsupervised, may be harmful.\" But what is this harm? Are the 30% of people who use chiropractic on their own more liable to injure themselves than are chiropractors to injure the other 70% of those who use this form of \"unconventional medicine?\" Would it be safer for people having a massage, or attending a self-help group? What may truly be harmful where these methods are concerned, is their substitution for proved measures in the setting of serious or potentially serious medical conditions. Two references were given by the authors in support of the idea that their data show a risk to the public of unsupervised \"unconventional medicine.\" One was the 1984 report of the U.S. Congress' Subcommittee on Long-Term Health and Aging, Quackery: a $10 Billion Scandal, known as the Pepper Report for the late chair of that committee, Claude Pepper. The other is the 1987 report of the Department of Health and Human Services' Health, Information and the use of Questionable Treatment: A Study of the American Public. The adverse effects noted in these sources are primarily from methods \u2014 herbs \u2014 that this article's data indicate were used by only a small minority of their respondents. They also found evidence of harm caused by delay or forgoing of appropriate medical treatment because of the substitution of unproved and ineffective therapies that are deceptively promoted. The present study did not mention those problems. The present report suggested that \"medical doctors should begin to ask patients about their use of unconventional therapy whenever they take a history.\" Yet delay seeking medical care may arise from \"spiritual healing\" and \"prayer\" as from other \"unconventional medicine.\" Yet the authors declined to ask patients details about about these two methods because it \"would be inappropriate.\" The major problem of the original survey was its exaggeration of the prevalence of questionable, unproven, disproven, and irrational health and nutrition use. The conclusions put forward in this article have been reported repeated since its publication. This has especially taken the form of a subtle term-switching device in which the curious and rather idiosyncratic \"unconventional medicine\" was converted to the authors' definition of \"alternative medicine\". The authors have not hesitated to use such language distortion. Dr. Eisenberg has argued strenuously that his data show the need for physicians to cooperate with their patients' use of whatever \"alternative medicine\" that they may find appealing. On September 9, 1997, for example, the University of Texas-Southwestern and the Alternative Medicine Research Foundation of Texas sponsored a CME conference in Dallas. Dr. Eisenberg was the keynote speaker, and he used his time to review his 1990 data. He admitted that much of the \"unconventional medicine\" considered in the survey was essentially \"extended self-care.\" He then, without further explanation, began referring to \"alternative medicine\" and focused on herbs, acupuncture, and homeopathy. There was no discussion of \"relaxation techniques,\" which accounted for the largest use of \"unconventional medicine\" in his 1993 article. There was no consideration of chiropractic, massage, imagery, or \"spiritual healing\" or of commercial weight-loss programs. Dr. Eisenberg, at this same conference in 1997, ridiculed critics of homeopathy as having taken the position that, \"it can't work, so it doesn't work?\" This paper was presented at the \"Science Meets Alternative Medicine\" conference sponsored by the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine in Philadelphia on February 27th of 1999. At that time, one commentator suggested that Dr. Eisenberg could hardly help how others might misinterpret his work. But in September of 1998 Dr. Eisenberg was a co-author of another article that appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association [JAMA 280:784-787]. The second sentence of that report stated: We have known for several years that approximately 1 in 3 adults in the United States uses chiropractic, acupuncture, homeopathy, or one of many other treatment modalities. The reference for this fact being \"known,\" of course, was the 1993 NEJM article. Fortunately, this deception did not appear in Dr. Eisenberg's follow up survey, a report of which appeared last November in JAMA. But in this updated report building on the 1990 data, there was no pretense about \"unconventional medicine.\" Non-rational methods were referred to as \"alternative medicine\" throughout. There was also, this time, an acknowledgement that there are \"more alternative\" and \"less alternative\" therapies among those considered in both the 1990 data and in the follow-up survey of 2055 respondents in 1997. But there was no attempt to sort out which therapies were \"more alternative\" or \"less alternative.\" There was no consideration given to what distinguishes \"more alternative\" from \"less alternative\" therapies. There was no attempt to identify whether a particular application of a therapy was consistent with facts and reason or not. The principal data presented in the follow-up survey are shown in Table 4. |Type of Therapy||Used in past 12 more therapy (excluding | exercise and prayer) |33.8||42.1 | * P .05; P .01; P .001 Many of the same problems of the 1993 article apply to this updated survey. For example, relaxation therapy and massage have still not been clarified, although this was said to be warranted five years previously in the 1993 paper. On the whole, the 1998 article is slightly less polemical that that of 1993. Given the promotional success of the earlier report, perhaps there was no need to be more emphatic. In 1998 it is merely stated that, \"the prevalence and expenditures associated with alternative medical therapies in the United States have increased substantially,\" and that, \"the magnitude of the demand for alternative therapy is noteworthy.\" Eisenberg and his co-authors do not speculate on why this is so, but express a sort of uncomprehending interest in their findings, \"in light of the relatively low rates of insurance coverage for these services.\" They do speculate that increased insurance coverage of \"alternative medicine\" would almost surely further increase its use. But they do not address the question of whether the increased use of \"alternative medicine\" since the 1990 survey has had any health benefits. On the contrary, they draw proper attention to the hazards of adverse effects, particularly in the elderly and infirm. But their data are of no help in assessing this very serious risk and no suggestions for addressing it are offered. Elsewhere, Dr. Eisenberg has suggested that physicians \"supervise\" their patients' use of \"alternative medicine\" and even co-manage their care with \"alternative medicine\" practitioners. But even in the updated 1998 survey report, Eisenberg and his collaborators do not suggest that physicians make an attempt to educate their patients or try to discourage or curtail their use of unproven and ineffective methods. Most concerning is absence of comment on major driving force behind alternative medicine - relaxed regulatory environment of the marketplace. The 1998 report mistakenly assumes \"alternative\" medicine use reflects demand for it and/or dissatisfaction with biomedical care. Two years after the collection of the Eisenberg's original survey data, Congress appropriated funds for what was to become the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM). The impetus was the will of one senator, Harkin of Iowa who used his committee chairmanship to appropriate funds because of his personal belief in bee pollen and other ineffective remedies. OAM has now been upgraded with increased funding to the Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. A year after the 1993 NEJM report, the [Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA)](https://www.quackwatch.org/02ConsumerProtection/dshea.html) freed the health food industry from much of the regulatory oversight of the FDA. An avalanche of uncritical media coverage of unproved claims and practices followed. A swell of advertising dollars poured into the print and electronic media. This was a potent, and not coincidental combination. Ideologically motivated private foundations such as the $300 million Fetzer Foundation had poured millions of dollars into medical school courses and research, had sponsored the Bill Moyers' PBS series \"Healing and the Mind,\" sponsored the Eisenberg study plus his Harvard Medical School course and annual post-graduate courses for physicians and other health professionals. These and the first Eisenberg paper itself acted to create a perception that \"alternative medicine\" is safe, effective, and at least as good, if not better than, scientific biomedicine. The authors did not comment on the fact that use of acupuncturists, homeopaths, and chiropractors remained stable over the ten years, while the \"alternative medicine\" that drew the greatest increase in use, more than tripling between 1990 and 1997 were over-the-counter herbal medicine, folk remedies, and homeopathic products, all of which have been aggressively mass-marketed in the wake of DSHEA. Major manufacturers are rolling out herbal and homeopathic versions of their established trade-named products. Vitamin sales lagged by comparison, having been previously marketed maximally for years. On the other hand, many \"nutritional supplements\" combine herbs, vitamins, as well as additional ingredients and may claim to be homeopathic as well. Thus, someone's purchasing a single over-the-counter \"nutritional supplement\" of this kind would contribute to an increased prevalence of use of several different forms of \"alternative medicine.\" In 1996, under pressure from organized acupuncturists, the FDA reclassified acupuncture needles as Class II \"medical devices,\" which permitted their use and associated claims of various health benefits. In 1997 the OAM, in association with its former interim Director, carefully orchestrated a seemingly biased panel that issued a consensus statement in favor of acupuncture. The 1998 Eisenberg article mentioned none of these things, while marveling at the public's alleged demand for \"alternative medicine.\" The impression remains that acupuncture and \"natural\" products are safe, effective, and even constitute \"cutting edge\" medical science. Eisenberg is silent on how these factors may have affected his updated survey information of 1997. Yet they are crucial to any evaluation. Manufacturers are now selling products which are, for all intents and purposes, medications. But, legally, as \"nutritional supplements,\" they are \"foods.\" Even food products are now appearing which contain herbal ingredients, such as soup containing Saint John's Wort and corn chips laced with kava. Any serious discussion of the prevalence, let alone the medical and public health implications of \"alternative medicine\" will be non-productive until and unless their terminology is clarified. For if \"unconventional\" medicine cannot be distinguished from \"alternative medicine,\" \"complementary medicine,\" \"integrative medicine,\" and quackery, then there will be nothing left to call quackery or illegal promotion. Likewise, if medicine cannot be distinguished from exercise, prayer, relaxation, self-help practices, and other \"extended self-care,\" then there will be nothing left that will not be medicine. These issues are important not only scientifically, but also in the social, cultural, and economic context of continued medical scientific progress amid rising medical care costs. Unfortunately, Dr. Eisenberg, his collaborators, the lay and medical press and other commentators have been obscuring rather than clarifying, hindering instead of helping, honest efforts to confront them. ________________________ Dr. Gorski practices obstetrics and gynecology in Arlington, Texas, and is president of the Greater Dallas-Fort Worth Council Against Health Fraud.

[Hide Full Content](#fourteen-thousand-twenty-four) [The Medical Messiahs: Afterword](https://quackwatch.org/hx/mm/21-2/) On a Saturday afternoon in June 1990, on a Chicago El train rumbling from Wrigley Field back to the Loop, a friendly, well-dressed woman handed another passenger a single sheet of paper crowded with suggested uses for aloe vera, plus three telephone numbers from which that botanical in its various processed forms might be ordered.

On a Saturday afternoon in June 1990, on a Chicago El train rumbling from Wrigley Field back to the Loop, a friendly, well-dressed woman handed another passenger a single sheet of paper crowded with suggested uses for aloe vera, plus three telephone numbers from which that botanical in its various processed forms might be ordered. As juice, gel, lotion, facial, shampoo, and activator, aloe vera, according to this simple document, could come to grips with over a hundred health problems, external and internal, from scalp sores to athlete's foot, from migraine headaches to intestinal flu. From the earliest times, aloe has played a multiple role in medication, favored by Dioscorides and Galen [1]. The aloe vera variety was introduced at least as early as the sixteenth century to the Dutch West Indies, where it was grown on the island of Curacao. Official from the first edition of the United States Pharmacopeia, aloe was prescribed by physicians and was included in such popular patent medicines as Brandreth's Vegetable Universal Pills and Kickapoo Indian Sagwa [2]. Aloe may still be found in the 1990 edition of the United States Pharmacopeia Drug Information volume on Advice to the Patient, as one of two botanical laxative ingredients in an over-the-counter medicine called Nature's Remedy [3]. The vast variety of therapeutic values once ascribed to aloe in regular medicine, and still retained to a considerable extent in folk belief, has, under scientific scrutiny, shrunk to a bare minimum [4]. Internally, the dried latex (juice) of aloe has cathartic power. Externally, the fresh gel or mucilage (often confusingly called juice) may be of use in treating minor burns and bruises. Commercial fabrications, however, have not necessarily shown such dermatological benefits and, indeed, have been toxic to cultured cells on which tests have been made. Scientific medicine would certainly give no credence to the implied claims on the Chicago handout that aloe vera would prove useful in treating arthritis, asthma, baldness, cancer of the skin, coronary thrombosis, diabetes, female problems, gallstones, glaucoma, psoriasis, and stomach ulcers. Passengers suffering from such severe ailments who yield to the El train soft-sell promotion and purchase aloe vera for their ills contribute to the nation's multibillion-dollar annual quackery toll. Just how many billions quackery's bill amounts to can only be estimated. A quarter-century ago, despite the most intensive regulatory and educational campaign against health fraud in the nation's history, the figure approximated, according to an informed public official, \"two or more billion\" a year, and it was growing [5]. Hardly anyone, however, anticipated the rapidity of its expansion. By 1984 a subcommittee of the Select Committee on Aging of the House of Representatives, chaired by Claude Pepper of Florida, concluded after a four-year staff study that quackery afflicting the elderly alone added up to \"A $10 Billion Scandal.\" [6] For the population as a whole, testified Victor Herbert at a hearing held by the subcommittee, the annual sum was two-and-a-half times as great [7]. Early in 1990, other expert observers put the figure at $28 billion [8]. Dr. Herbert, a professor of medicine at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center, a lawyer, and one of the nation's most dogged foes of quackery, had in his testimony broken down his $25 to $26 billion yearly health fraud total into its component parts [9]. Six billion dollars, he told the House subcommittee, went for \"food supplement, pill, powder and potion quackery.\" About $3 billion each were expended for arthritis, cancer, and heart disease quackery. Several complex categories each accounted for $2 billion: (1) \"quack diagnostic tests, such as specious computer questionnaires, hair analyses, cytotoxicity testing, kinesiology, iridology\"; (2) \"naturopathic, herbalist, occult healing and other cult quackery\"; and (3) \"clinical ecology, hypoglycemia, nontoxic, metabolic, and natural quackery.\" In the $1 billion range fell three more quack genres: (1) false treatment for Alzheimer's disease and mental illnesses; (2) \"quackery-promoting literature\"; and (3) diploma mills providing false credentials to those offering dubious regimens of treatment. Thus the terrain of quackery had become broader and more costly than ever and, Dr. Herbert charged, more adept at its ability to \"maim and kill.\" How to explain the two-decade boom in pseudomedicine? Why did the guarded optimism among fighters opposed to health fraud in the late 1960s dissipate, to be replaced by gloom in the mid-eighties? In part, currents in the broad environment were responsible. On a narrower front, the cohesion and vigor of antiquackery efforts diminished, while the energy, ingenuity, and collaborative efforts of those promoting unproven therapies expanded considerably. As the century wore on, philosophical currents presented and the impact of events revealed human nature in a less optimistic way than when the century had begun [10]. Error was more firmly rooted than it once had seemed to be, less easily eradicated by that universal panacea, education. Progress, once deemed well-nigh inevitable, had slowed, if not reversed itself. Lookers toward the future \"shifted their gaze from utopias to dystopias.\" [11] Many of the disillusioned, especially among the young, came to distrust reason and to flirt with wild varieties of unreason. Astrology soared, not as a pastime but for real: publishing houses minted millions from it; almost every campus had a peripheral course in reading the stars; in time its influence invaded the whitest houses in the land. Tarot cards, numerology, and palmistry flourished. Paperbacks on these themes were among the hottest-selling items in university bookstores from Cambridge to Berkeley [12]. A popular magazine announced: \"Witches are surfacing everywhere.\" [13] Vietnam and Watergate left a legacy of disillusionment with big government, including its regulatory function. Environmental alarms, especially with regard to nuclear energy, increased skepticism of big science, including government's scientific role [14]. An ironic expression of this perspective came in a 1979 commencement address by Kurt Vonnegut. \"We would be a lot safer,\" the novelist told the graduates, \"if the Government would take its money out of science and put it into astrology and reading Palms.\" [15] The distrust harbored by citizens went beyond government. \"There is virtually no one,\" columnist Erma Bombeck asserted, also in 1979, \"who is beyond question or suspicion.\" [16] Scientists, Carl Sagan observed, had acquired a negative image in the public mind [17]. Physicians became more vulnerable to sometimes querulous suspicion. Following a television program in 1978 presenting the perspectives of the medical profession, hundreds of viewers wrote letters voicing a wide variety of complaints [18]. The year before, patient visits to orthodox physicians had declined by eleven percent [19]. Consumer literacy regarding medicine and science generally, critics charged, had seriously declined. Sagan considered the level of science education in the schools abysmal [20]. John Allen Paulos blamed widespread mathematical illiteracy for muddled judgments in many areas, not least in health [21]. \"Today,\" complained a psychology professor, \"we can go from kindergarten through graduate school without having to take a single course in the sort of logic, scientific methods and self-understanding which would help protect us from quackery.\" [22] John C. Burnham, tracking the theme of popular science and health through American history, compressed his sobering conclusion into his title, How Superstition Won and Science Lost [23]. Whatever their capacity for being confused, Americans had entered upon a period of great preoccupation with keeping fit. Taking control of one's own health, in a variety of ways, amounted to a public passion. \"Running,\" Lewis Thomas wrote in one of his perceptive essays, \"a good thing for its own sake, has acquired the medicinal value formerly attributed to rare herbs from Indonesia.\" [24] But beyond exaggerated expectations lay false advice and fraudulent products. A healthy attitude could be twisted into unhealthy buying. Taking charge of one's health could get distorted into handing that health into the custody of an unscrupulous marketer and paying dearly for the deception. Promoters of specious wares plugged into self-help psychology. A firm vending a fake vitamin, brought to court by the Food and Drug Administration, chose to simplify the confrontation in a publicity release by terming it \"Self-help v. 'Doctor knows best,' \" thus sneaking its specious product, condemned by scientific medicine, under a rubric invested with popular enthusiasm [25]. While the cultural climate became more hospitable to irrational ventures, both the criticism and the regulation of health quackery declined from the high plateau of intensity reached in the 1960s. The American Medical Association, dominant in the realm of nostrum fighting since early in the century, while not abandoning the role completely, in 1975 abolished its quackery committee and closed down its Department of Investigation [26]. The major joint educational campaign against quackery, sponsored by regulatory and voluntary health associations during the sixties, had no counterpart in the seventies. The interpretation of unorthodoxy in the popular media, print and electronic, shifted away from skepticism, often toward drum-beating support. One rare critic wondered if a great many of the self-help health books universally available were not a \"Rx for Disaster.\" [27] David Leff described the science in the checkout-counter tabloid press as a \"neo-medieval fantasy world of magic, mystery and miracle.\" [28] Even mainstream newspapers and magazines have been known to curb their critiques of quackery in order to avoid the threats of economic and legal reprisals [29]. Television and radio talk shows have often given promoters of unscientific health ideas and products a welcome warm enough to constitute endorsement [30]. Some television programs, indeed, have masqueraded as entertainment, even hiring out-of-work actors to serve as studio audience. In fact, however, these programs are nothing but half-hour or hour-long commercial pitches for obesity, baldness, and impotency \"cures.\" [31] Regulatory control of quackery also receded in the seventies. To make this point starkly was one of Claude Pepper's main goals in his 1984 subcommittee report and hearing [32]. The Postal Service, aided by a 1983 law increasing penalties on repeat offenders, had continued to perform with skill and diligence, although its enforcement officials could handle only a fraction of fraudulent promotions introduced into the mails. Otherwise, federal antiquackery efforts had become \"minimal.\" The Food and Drug Administration spent only .001 percent of its budget combating health fraud. Although possessing an earlier proud record, the FDA:s current efforts, in the subcommittee's judgment, \"resemble indifference and neglect.\" The Federal Trade Commission's role in seeking to restrain false advertising related to health also had shrunk to the extent that it had become \"almost non-existent, . . . imperceptible.\" The Commission seemed \"strangely Were the federal agencies doing a satisfactory job? \"In a word, no.\" Nor were state and local antiquackery endeavors any more vigorous. Government inaction, testified a former committee aide, had given a green light to quackery and the perception that \"the law of the jungle\" was legitimate; it was \"open season to rip off the elderly.\" [33] Congressman Pepper agreed: the recent boom in quackery resulted from its \"immense profitability and apparent absence of risk. [34] The regulatory agencies could make a plausible case that their resources had not been adequate for the broad scope of the responsibilities assigned them by the Congress, and that quackery cases were complex, difficult, and expensive to investigate and litigate [35]. Food and Drug Commissioner Arthur Hull Hayes, Jr., for example, confessed in 1983 that the agency was \"simply overmatched. . . . There are too many quacks, too skilled at the quick change of address and product name, for the cumbersome procedures of the FDA.\" The 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendments had vastly increased the FDA's obligations for controlling prescription drugs and had prompted a retrospective review\u2014begun in the early seventies and still under way\u2014of over-the-counter medicines, to assure their safety, their efficacy, and the truthfulness of their label claims [36]. The results of this review would help curb quackery in the long run, but in the meantime it absorbed much agency time. So too did implementing the Medical Device Amendments that became law in 1976 [37]. As a result of its accumulating duties, the Food and Drug Administration had accorded quackery a lower priority [38]. Moreover, a modification of the way in which the FDA conducted its business made its control of quackery arguably less effective. Partly as a result of advice given the agency by two Citizens Advisory Committees, the FDA began to regulate more by education and less by litigation, becoming, as it were, more of a counseling agency helping legitimate industry untangle its complex problems, and less of a police force. Crises arose from industry's excessive zeal or unwitting accidents, and usually got settled without going to court. Recalls boomed; prosecutions plummeted. For most of the FDA's mission, involving legitimate drugs, devices, and food additives, the highly scientific, collaborative, rarely litigious approach may well have been the most efficient and effective way. However, to protect the public from old-fashioned, bare-bones, hard-core quackery, as well as from new-fashioned, ingenious, ruthless, hard-core quackery, some critics both within and without the FDA came to believe, required the return to a greater reliance on criminal prosecutions. Victories in court, especially those imposing heavy fines and imprisonment, would cause other promoters with similar operations to stop or to modify their procedures. Court victories would also provide greater credibility to the FDA and others in carrying on expanded antiquackery educational campaigns. Such legal decisions would further help shield critics of quackery from nuisance libel suits. With the ambient cultural climate favorable and regulators greatly preoccupied With other tasks, proprietors of questionable and specious health products increased the vigor and blatancy of their promotions. They met their would-be customers at all the old places. Health food stores boomed, and survey after survey around the country revealed the distorted, often dangerous, counsel offered by the clerks. After AIDS had been identified, for example, Dr. John H. Renner sent students to health food stores in Kansas City to ask if they had products that would help ward off that dread disease, and fifteen of sixteen managers said they did [39].. Many of the herbs for sale in such stores, even herbs with ancient reputations in folk tradition, posed grave hazards to health [40]. Pyramidal schemes for the vending of nutritional supplements to friends and neighbors, who would then be recruited as salespersons, resurfaced in an inflated way [41]. A newer form for face-to-face selling expanded: the alternative therapy convention, at which a wide variety of wares was displayed at booths, and occasional lectures were delivered to those in attendance. Typical was a cancer-nutrition convention held in Detroit in 1978, boosting such unorthodox modalities as reflexology, iridology, ionization, kinesiology, chelation, and transcutaneous nerve stimulation, plus a broad gamut of vitamin and mineral supplements [42]. Clinics, as will be seen below, also proliferated, both within the nation and outside its borders, a way of reducing or escaping regulatory attack. Advertising ran rife in specialty catalogs, the magazines of unorthodoxy, and the scantily self-policed press, as well as over the airwaves. Cautious about claims, advertisers relied on getting their curative messages across in First Amendment-protected feature articles, often in the same journals in which the ads appeared [43]. Sometimes such stories were deliberately planted. in 1986 an officer and a former officer of General Nutrition, Inc., the largest chain of health food stores in the United States and Canada, pleaded guilty to misbranding a proprietary form of evening primrose oil by arranging newspaper and magazine stories and radio coverage that falsely praised the oil's value in preventing such serious diseases as arthritis, hypertension, and multiple sclerosis. This campaign was planned to coincide with company advertising [44]. Advertising became increasingly sophisticated, often composed by M.D.s and Ph.D.s and crafted with cleverness and skill, making pseudoscience sound like science [45]. The slickness of his advertising, suggested Wilbur J. Blechman, Jr., a longtime observer of arthritis quackery, was perhaps the quack's solitary scientific achievement [46]. Some advertising sent the reader to a health food store. Other advertising persuaded him or her to mail in money. Since use of the mails for ordering and delivering health wares that might transgress fraud statutes posed some degree of risk for promoters, they sought increasingly to dilute this hazard by resorting to such new inventions as the 800 long-distance number and commercial delivery systems. Other modern devices came into play: computers, banks of WATS-line telephones, customized lists for reaching special groups of likely customers, credit cards. \"This is the new electronic midway,\" the attorney general of Maine wrote for Congressman Pepper's subcommittee. \"Two-headed cows are easily ignored compared to the late night phone call to your home by an out-of-state caller who uncannily knows that you are an elderly person suffering from a medical ailment and who can convince you to invest large amounts of money for relief and magic lures.\" [47] .The new techniques were used to preach and expand old gospels. The nutrition myth, so effective in the 1960s, retained its persuasive power [48]. Indeed, when A Study of Health Practices and Opinions, sponsored by seven federal agencies, appeared in 1972, it revealed that a large proportion of American adults engaged in self-treatment that could be characterized as \"rampant empiricism,\" guided by no coherent body of theory, true or false\u2014except in one signal respect [49]. When it came to self-treatment with vitamins and food supplements, consumers did adhere to a set of doctrines, and these bore a remarkable resemblance to the fake tenets of the nutrition myth. Three out of every four Americans believed that, no matter how nutritionally adequate their diet, using extra vitamins would imbue them with added pep. Nutritional solutions to health problems developed into the dominant feature of unorthodoxy in the years that followed [50]. Modifications of diet and other lifestyle changes aimed at preventing and ameliorating serious degenerative diseases became an increasing concern of scientific medicine as the major infectious diseases came increasingly under control. As so often before, unorthodox medicine mirrored a theme of mainstream science, distorting it to suit its own promotional purposes. The preoccupations of many consumers made them unusually receptive to such carefully crafted promotions. For those seeking to keep fit by their own efforts, diet was a major mode of self-help. Especially for those desiring to keep thin for the sake of health and beauty, a compelling urge since early in the century and now at a new peak of intensity, promoters vended an incredible range of food supplements, drugs, devices, dietary regimens, and books of advice, promising an easier solution than cutting down on calories through self-restraint. The vitamin and mineral market kept booming, with predictions rosy for continuing growth [51]. In time, quackery related to the most dire of diseases, cancer and AIDS, came to encompass a nutritional component. Critics continued to expose the fallacies and caution of the hazards in pseudonutrition: that consumers on a rounded diet did not need vitamin supplementation, that megadosing could not ward off dread diseases and might itself injure the body, that certain so-called vitamins were not vitamins at all, that some products sold for weight loss were worthless and others could kill, The warning words of scientific nutritionists, dietitians, consumerists, and regulators, however, were outweighed a thousand or more to one by the printed and oral verbiage of pitchmen. Consequently, as a witness asserted at the Pepper subcommittee hearing, \"the biggest area of quackery right now is phony diet pills, phony diet cures,\" a number of which were on display in the hearing room [52]. The Food and Drug Administration had been concerned with the disordered state of the nutritional marketplace for a long time. In 1962 the agency had announced its intention to update the regulations for food supplements first put in place after the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act had been passed in 1938 [53]. This proposal led to marathon hearings that accumulated a record of 32,000 pages. In 1973 the FDA issued revised proposals that it hoped might ultimately rationalize the promotion of vitamins and supplements. Charging to the attack came the health food industry, led by the National Health Federation, many of whose members would be forced to change drastically their promotional practices should the regulations go into effect. Flying furiously the flag of \"medical freedom,\" NHF leaders stirred up their customers into a frightened and frenzied lobbying force of considerable numbers. This development was just what had worried Food and Drug Commissioner Alexander Schmidt the most. \"The opposition with which we are most concerned,\" Schmidt announced, stems from the honest fears of many citizens. Some fear that FDA is going to make certain vitamin pills unavailable or, if available, then only by prescription and at higher cost. Others fear that FDA may infringe on their right to decide what they will eat. None of this is true. The single most important purpose and effect of the regulation is to require full and honest labeling and fair promotion of vitamin and mineral products as the basis for a more informed consumer choice [55]. The misguided customers of nutritional pseudoscience chose to believe their marketers rather than the regulators. Prodded by the NHF, thousands of common citizens expressed to members of the Congress their anger about the FDA's proposals and their support of a bill that had been introduced by Congressman Craig Hosmer, cosponsored by 150 other members of the House [56]. The bill, if it became law, would not only negate the FDAA's attempt to tighten controls, but would cut back the agency's authority to regulate vitamins and food supplements to a pre-1938 level. In the three-year contest that followed, some two million NHF-generated letters flooded Congress. Some members said that the vitamin-control issue spurred more mail than Watergate [57]. Besides responding to such pressure from constituents, some congressmen were also no doubt voting their own convictions, beguiled by the constant reiteration of the nutrition myth. In 1974 a variant version of the first bill passed the Senate by a margin of 81 to 10 [58]. In the 94th Congress, during the nation's centennial year, a revised Senate version of the vitamin bill became attached as a rider to a \"must\" bill, the Health Research and Health Services Act. The House version passed without the rider, but the conference committee accepted it. Both houses then concurred, and President Gerald Ford quickly signed the bill into law [59]. Congress cannot be said to have given the issue serious consideration, as indicated by the devious parliamentary strategy. Moreover, the 94th Congress did not hold hearings on the bill, despite strong opposition to it by a wide spectrum of groups, including the American Society of Clinical Nutrition, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association of Retired Persons, Consumers Union, and Ralph Nader's associates [60]. A trade newsletter termed the course of events \"one of the 'legislative miracles' in a lifetime.\" [61] The 1976 amendment to the 1938 act represented the first retrogressive step in federal legislation respecting self-treatment wares since the initial Food and Drugs Act became law in 1906. The amendment, as the Food and Drug Administration viewed it, would bar the agency from \"limiting the potency of vitamins and minerals in dietary supplements to nutritionally useful levels; classifying a vitamin or mineral preparation as a 'drug' because it exceeds a nutritionally rational and useful potency; requiring the presence in dietary supplements of nutritionally essential vitamins and minerals; [and] prohibiting the inclusion in dietary supplements of useless ingredients with no nutritional value.\" [62] Toward the close of this legislative adventure, Commissioner Schmidt spoke of the then pending bill as \"a charlatan's dream.\" [63] The law did indeed embolden the purveyors of food supplements and accelerated the trend toward moving unorthodox pills and potions from risky \"drug\" status into the presumably safer \"food\" category. The National Health Federation lobbied strenuously for more forthright legislation to give consumers access to products regulators could otherwise deny them. Senator Steven D. Symms introduced such a bill into the 94th Congress. It would have repealed the requirement of proving to the FDA's satisfaction the efficacy of a drug for its indicated uses before a promoter could market it in interstate commerce [64]. This stipulation had been added to food and drug law by the Kefauver-Harris amendments of 1962. The bill did not pass, but others followed it, introduced by Senator Jesse Helms and by Congressman Lawrence McDonald, a physician and adviser to an NHF publication [65]. The NHF also pushed a \"Foods are not Drugs\" bill that would bar the FDA from taking actions against manufacturers or distributors of foods who made claims that their products would \"prevent, cure, or mitigate disease.\" [66]. Sometimes the NHF sought to keep legislation from passing, or even from being considered. In connection with his hearing in 1984, Congressman Pepper introduced three bills to strengthen in various ways government's authority to control health fraud [67]. The NHF termed the proposals \"lysenkoism,\" and, when they did not pass in that session, worked hard to persuade Pepper not to introduce them in the next. [68]. \"NHF President Maureen Salaman,\" reported William T. Jarvis in the National Council Against Health Fraud Newsletter, \"went so far as to buy a plane ticket on a flight with Mr. Pepper and arranging to have her seat assignment next to him and bent his ear all the way to his destination.\" [69] Probably sensing the futility of the effort, Pepper did not reintroduce his bills. The National Health Federation promoted a number of crusades [70]. It fought the extension of fluoridation tooth and nail. It campaigned against state laws to license scientific nutritionists and to bar the untrained from using the designation. It took a stand against such established health measures as milk pasteurization and vaccination for smallpox and polio. It supported an expansive gamut of unorthodox health doctrines and practices in its publications, special mailings, and convention programs. It helped fund litigation involving persons whose causes it favored. For most of its members, Stephen Barrett concluded, \"Nutrition is a religion, not a science.\" The NHF also sought to blame the nation's health ills on organized medicine and its conspiratorial allies. \"The biggest and the most costly and the most dangerous quackery rampant in the United States today,\" NHF's legislative representative, Clinton Miller, charged at the Pepper subcommittee hearing, \"is the medical quackery inside organized medicine as represented by the American Medical Association.\" [71] The NHF and its allies in the nutritional products industry also counterattacked those who criticized their policies. William Jarvis, recipient of the NHF's initial \"Health Bigot of the Year Award,\" told of a conversation with Clinton Miller in which the latter said, \"There is nothing personal in all of this, but when you are the enemy, we have to clobber you.\" [72] Such blows included comparing Jarvis, Stephen Barrett, and Victor Herbert to Hitler, Goering, and Goebbels. Herbert told the Pepper subcommittee of an interview, appearing in an NHF publication, with Robert Atkins, formulator of a diet disparaged by scientific nutritionists [73]. Atkins had stated that Herbert \"house[d] an evil spirit that needs to be exorcised.\" Soon thereafter Herbert had received death threats by mail and phone. The NHF placed on its board of governors David T. Ajay, president of the National Nutritional Foods Association, a trade association of health food producers, distributors, and retailers [74]. In 1978 Ajay proclaimed \"Operation Counterattack,\" a series of lawsuits against critics of the industry. The next year Ajay and two other distributors launched a libel suit for themselves and the NNFA against Elizabeth M. Whelan, executive director of the American Council of Science and Health, and Fredrick J. Stare, Emeritus Professor of Nutrition of the Harvard School of Public Health, both sharp critics of nutritional quackery [75]. None of the plaintiffs was mentioned in the publications at issue, and a judge eventually threw the case out of court. For the defendants it was a welcome, if time-consuming and costly, victory. In the 1970s, the National Health Federation, with its aggressive leadership, more than a hundred local chapters, and 25,000 members, increased its influence by allying with the expanding ranks of the supporters of Laetrile, an unproven cancer remedy [76]. In the early days of the NHF, its founder, Fred J. Hart, had collaborated with Harry Hoxsey, then the most prominent figure in cancer unorthodoxy, who was locked in a struggle with the Food and Drug Administration he was to lose in 1960 [77]. Hart, during this period, testified against a bill being considered by the California legislature aimed at curbing cancer quackery [78] Another hostile witness was Ernst Krebs, Jr., codeveloper, with his father, of Laetrile. When the FDA forced Hoxsey to abandon his Dallas clinic, his successor began treating cancer patients with Laetrile [79]. The FDA made its first seizure of Laetrile at the clinic in 1960. A nurse who had long been on Hoxsey's staff carried his medications across the border to Mexico, where they are still prescribed for cancer [80]. That is true also of Laetrile, but before its almost complete exile Laetrile provoked \"one of the most politicized medical disputes in American history.\" [81] The Laetrile of commerce was amygdalin, a chemical first isolated from bitter almonds in 1830 by two French chemists, although the product Ernst Krebs, Jr., trademarked as Laetrile had a slightly different structure [82] The significant ingredient was cyanide, some six percent by weight [83], and by centering on this poison Krebs fashioned his first explanation as to how Laetrile combated cancer [84]. When the Laetrile molecule reaches the cancer site, Krebs argued, an enzyme especially abundant in cancerous areas splits the molecule, releasing hydrogen cyanide to kill the cancer. Another enzyme protects normal cells, detoxifying any cyanide that strays into them. Thus Laetrile purportedly fulfills a prime objective of cancer chemotherapy: specificity of action. An impressed business manager for a group of doctors opined that Krebs had made a major step toward receiving a Nobel Prize. Soon, however, cancer specialists were to deny Krebs's premise. The normal cells turn out to contain more of the molecule-cleaving enzyme than do neoplastic tissues. Indeed, Laetrile administered by injection undergoes scarcely any metabolic breakdown and is excreted virtually intact in the urine. Laetrile taken orally, however, can be split by ingredients in food, releasing its poison and placing the person at grave risk. Indeed, both Laetrile and apricot kernels from which it was made killed a number of people [85]. Under the management of the two Krebs, father and son, Laetrile developed modest sales but encountered increasing criticism from cancer scientists and the beginning of legal restraints from both California and federal regulators. Indeed, in time, the would-be Nobelist spent several months in jail [86]. A series of happenstances lofted Laetrile into the national limelight. As the Krebs pair faltered, a Canadian adventurer, Andrew R. L. McNaughton, took control of Laetrile's destinies. He trumpeted his discontent when he failed to secure an investigational New Drug exemption from the Food and Drug Administration, even though he had not submitted adequate evidence. He expanded his drum-beating, placing in the Hearst American Weekly articles penned by G. D. Kittler, the man who thought Krebs, Jr., should win a Nobel Prize. This admirer then published a paperback, promising that Laetrile would \"be to cancer what insulin was to diabetes.\" [87] McNaughton gained a recruit from within the cancer research establishment, Dean Burk, who gave Laetrile a semblance of scientific legitimacy. McNaughton sought to escape rising regulatory pressures by establishing manufacturing and treatment facilities in Tijuana, to which American patients began to go and from which Laetrile was smuggled into the United States and distributed clandestinely. To McNaughton's assistance came a growing network of institutional support. The first patient treated in Tijuana established the International Association of Cancer Victims and Friends to publicize Laetrile, help cancer victims get to Mexico, and fly the flag of medical freedom. This organization and another that seceded from it, the Cancer Control Society, had unusual success in bringing Laetrile's message to members of the middle class, including some with considerable education [88]. More important still for Laetrile's expansion of social and political influence was the arrest in 1972 of a California physician, John A. Richardson, for prescribing Laetrile in violation of the state's antiquackery law. Two trials ended with hung juries. The California Board of Medical Quality Assurance then stepped in and revoked Richardson's license on grounds of incompetence and gross negligence. These events upset some of Richardson's fellow members of the John Birch Society. Such dedicated disciples of freedom-from-government doctrine saw in this physician's case a prime example of bureaucratic oppression. Led by Robert W. Bradford, a nuclear technician at Stanford University, Richardson's friends formed the Committee for Freedom of Choice in Cancer Therapy. By 1977 Bradford claimed five hundred chapters with some 35,000 members throughout the nation. Experienced in Birch battles against fluoridation and sex education, Committee members used a wide variety of tactics to condemn the community of cancer scientists, to castigate its allegedly futile therapeutic methods of cutting, burning, and poisoning, and to make any governmental interference with a cancer patient's right to use Laetrile or any other unorthodox treatment seem a violation of the Constitution and the fundamental rights of man. Laetrile at this time, although still the same substance, had changed guises again. Ernst Krebs, Jr., while retaining much of his original theory as to Laetrile's mode of action, had converted cancer to a deficiency disease and transformed Laetrile from a chemotherapeutic drug to a vitamin, designated B-17. In addition to controlling cancer, B-17 could now prevent it. Nutritional scientists denied that Laetrile fulfilled any of the criteria for a true vitamin. \"In short,\" summed up veteran vitamin researcher Thomas H. Jukes, \"nothing could be less like a vitamin than laetrile.\" [89] Such criticism did not deter Laetrile enthusiasts. Krebs, Jr., testifying before Senator Edward Kennedy's Subcommittee on Health in 1977, termed Laetrile \"a scientific revolution as profound as the germ theory of disease ... and the Copernican theory.\" What Vitamin C is to scurvy, niacin to pellagra, and Vitamin D to rickets, he asserted, Vitamin B-17 is to cancer [90]. If every American took Laetrile regularly, Dr. Richardson told the subcommittee, \"in 20 years cancer would be relegated to the dusty pages of history.\" Besides fighting a propaganda battle in the arena of public opinion, Laetrile's champions sought victories in legislatures and courts. The main legislative effort came in the states. Alaska passed the first law giving Laetrile special distribution status, and by the early 1980s half the states had enacted statutes, the terms varying from place to place. [91]. Members of the Committee for Freedom of Choice played a major lobbying role in the state campaigns. The most significant judicial encounter began with patients who had returned from Laetrile clinics in Mexico and wanted to prevent the Food and Drug Administration from interfering with their imports of the amygdalin product for continuing treatment. The principal plaintiff who emerged was Glen L. Rutherford, a manufacturer's representative from Conway Springs, Kansas [92]. At the Tijuana clinic, he had been treated with Laetrile and enzymes, and an intestinal polyp had been cauterized. Cancer specialists believed that the excision of a polyp solved the problem in a high proportion of cases, but Rutherford wanted the reassurance of Laetrile. In 1975 he won this right from a federal judge in Oklahoma. Judge Luther Bohanon ruled that Rutherford and all other cancer patients as a class who secured physicians' affidavits designating them as terminally ill could import a limited amount of Laetrile in both injectable and oral forms for their personal use. Considering the deliberate pace of the law during the process of appeals, that privilege stretched through a dozen years [93]. The Circuit Court, taking into account amygdalin's hazard when ingested by mouth, barred oral dosage forms. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the safety and efficacy standards of the law did indeed apply to terminal patients. Despite the Court's failure to address all other issues explicitly, \"the tone of the opinion,\" commentators observed, \"left no doubt as to the Supreme Court's determination to uphold the FDA ban on laetrile.\" [94] The Circuit Court so interpreted the decision and ordered judge Bohanon so to rule. He finally did so in 1987. The FDA then issued an Import Alert, stating that, as an unapproved drug, Laetrile under its various designations could not be brought into the country [95]. Along this extended judicial trail, the Food and Drug Administration was ordered to conduct administrative proceedings, and Commissioner Donald Kennedy and his staff turned this task into as thorough and insightful a review of a highly promoted unorthodox drug as could be found in the American literature [96]. The report countered the various claims made for Laetrile's effectiveness in cancer, disputing the shifting theories, remarking upon the inadequate anecdotal character of pro-Laetrile reporting, and citing the lack of promise in numerous well-controlled animal studies made at the National Cancer Institute and private cancer research centers. The report criticized as unpersuasive the few animal tests interpreted as favorable to Laetrile by Dean Burk and others. The commissioner found that Laetrile's appeal lay in the psychology of patients and their families caught in the crushing cancer crisis. The \"disparagement of conventional therapy\" by Laetrile advocates was \"morally reprehensible,\" leading sufferers away from proven treatment. Commissioner Kennedy further met the \"freedom of choice\" argument head-on. Congress had decided, he noted, \"that the absolute freedom to choose an ineffective drug was properly surrendered in exchange for the freedom from the danger to each person's health and well-being from the sale and use of worthless drugs.\" In any case, the choice to use Laetrile, made in an atmosphere of double stress, compounded from the fear of disease and the zeal of Laetrile advocates, with seldom any \"rational laying out of competing arguments,\" could not accurately be described as free. The litigation and the legislative battles in the states made Laetrile an issue of national concern. News magazines carried cover stories, and high-ranked television programs looked at Laetrile [97]. Conservative columnists, most notably James J. Kilpatrick, attracted to the freedom of choice theme, gave Laetrile favorable attention [98]. The promoters intensified their own publicity with a series of paperback books [99]. The National Health Federation put leading Laetrile figures\u2014including Andrew McNaughton and Glen Rutherford\u2014on its board of governors and gave the Laetrile cause continuing support with publicity, financing, and legal aid [100]. A majority of Americans came to believe decriminalization of Laetrile would be a good idea [101]. Some Laetrile leaders sounded smug about their prospects [102]. \"Rest assured, gentlemen,\" Bradford told Senator people demand Laetrile. . . . And they are going to get it whether Big Brother wants it or not. . . . We cannot expect that thousands of American cancer sufferers are going to wait for more long years, while the Federal Government fiddle-faddles through animal tests and more redtape. Do we really want another American civil war?\" Laetrile advocates hoped that they might yet achieve the repeal of the effectiveness provision in the drug law [103]. During the 1980 presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan was quoted in an interview in the National Health Federation journal as favoring such action [104]. Richard Crout, director of the FDA's Bureau of Drugs, feared that this might happen and hoped that, if \"the political heat\" engendered by Laetrile pressure groups got too much for Congress, the members might choose a less extreme course, exempting Laetrile alone from the effectiveness requirement. That Dr. Crout should venture to discuss such a worst case possibility suggested its potential for happening. As public sentiment favoring Laetrile mounted, and as tens of thousands of cancer patients forsook orthodox therapy to rely on Laetrile instead, a debate began within the scientific community. Should the established rules for testing new drugs be firmly adhered to, or, in Laetrile's case, should the rules be breached, with the government itself assuming the testing burden, or even, as the distinguished editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, F.J. Ingelfinger, suggested, should Laetrile be made freely available in the marketplace, with detailed records kept of its use?105 After great deliberation, the middle course was followed. The National Cancer Institute solicited case histories from physicians who had used Laetrile and, in the mass of unchecked data, found the minimal suggestive evidence to warrant proceeding with clinical trials 106]. The FDA doubted that the evidence was sufficient but recognized societal reasons for pushing forward to resolve the issue scientifically [107]. After consulting with Laetrile physicians, NCI scientists devised protocols that defined Laetrile as amygdalin and included a special diet and numerous vitamins in the regimen, according to then current Laetrile treatment practice [108]. The FDA gave the NCI an Investigational New Drug exemption, thus bringing the experiment under the law. Charles Moertel of the Mayo Clinic led the team of investigators at four cancer research hospitals. With the trials having months to run, Dr. Moertel surprised the scientific community and the nation when, on April 30, 1981, he made an initial report to the American Society of Clinical Oncology [109]. \"Laetrile has been tested,\" he declared. \"It is not effective.\" It did not relieve symptoms of cancer patients or extend their life span. In only one case was there a reduction of tumor size, but it proved temporary. The fuller published report of the investigative team confirmed and amplified Dr. Moertel's announcement [110]. Laetrile had produced \"no substantive benefit . . . in terms of cure, improvement, or stabilization of cancer, improvement of symptoms related to cancer, or extension of life span.\" indeed, \"patients died rapidly.\" Oral dosages of amygdalin produced some evidence of cyanide toxicity. In sum, Laetrile failed to meet the FDA's safety and efficacy standards. Laetrile leaders sought to deny the trial's validity. \"The whole thing,\" charged Robert Bradford, \"is a put-up deal to discredit Laetrile. It was a phony test.\" [111] Despite such disparagement, the failure of Laetrile in the National Cancer Institute clinical trials had considerable impact on public perception of the drug's efficacy. By this time, in any case, Laetrile's image had already gone into decline [112]. The Supreme Court had expressed its skepticism. The campaign for state laws had faltered, and some states had repealed laws earlier enacted [113]. Little Chad Green and actor Steve McQueen, headlined for awhile as successful Laetrile users, had died [114]. Interest in Laetrile did not vanish within the realm of cancer unorthodoxy, but it did diminish. In 1982, shortly after the final National Cancer Institute evaluation of Laetrile was published, Barrie Cassileth of the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center wrote a short article in the New England journal of Medicine entitled \"After Laetrile, What?\" [115] Replacing Laetrile, she explained, was an \"unusual\" mode, differing from past unorthodoxies and constituting \"more of a challenge than did Laetrile or its predecessors.\" The regimens were multiple and varied, featuring \"antimedicines\" in the sense that diet patterns, detoxification, and mind control were central to therapy. What brought a certain unity out of complexity, Dr. Cassileth suggested, was theory. The new mode owed much to New Age philosophies and religions from the Far East, as well as to earlier unorthodox traditions that once had great vogue in an earlier America: homeopathic and naturopathic concepts, and the belief that intestinal putrefaction lay at the root of disease. Old cancer quackeries had been medications; the new mode stressed lifestyle changes, adjustments purportedly to restore life to more \"natural\" patterns. Patients could play an active role in their own healing. The wide scope of ideas fostered an expansive range of disease coverage. Not cancer alone, but other ills fell prey. Since lifestyle was chiefly involved, the new wave was largely beyond the control of licensing and regulatory agencies. Clinics were the customary treatment sites. One of unorthodoxy's zealous journalists had already paraded a series of cancer clinics in the pages of Penthouse [116]. Laetrile's promoters had already recognized advantages in the developing pattern of \"total metabolic therapy\" and had adopted it. In Robert Bradford's book, Now That You Have Cancer, he likened the new therapeutic approach to a crown containing nine jewels, with Vitamin B-17 \"the crown jewel within that diadem.\" The other parts included diet, exercise, vitamins A, C, and E, and another false vitamin, B-15 or pangamic acid, that the Krebses had promoted vigorously. Such a total approach, Bradford insisted, provided \"the best chance to control cancer.\" The complexity, it may be presumed, would seem to possess the merit of making Laetrile a less conspicuous regulatory target. To approximate this new expanded regimen surrounding Laetrile, the NCI research team had included the vitamins and enzymes in their protocols. The 1984 report and hearing of Congressman Pepper's subcommittee unquestionably spurred increased attention to quackery on the part of regulatory agencies, the press, and the public. The tide and temper of concern, however, had already begun to turn. The reporting of events that blackened Laetrile's image played a part in this. So too did the appearance of several books surveying the field of quackery from a severely critical perspective. The Health Robbers, engineered by physician Stephen Barrett, had been published in 1976, followed by a revised edition four years later. Also issued in 1980 were Victor Herbert's Nutrition Cultism and a collection of hard-hitting articles from Consumer Reports entitled Health Quackery. Newspaper journalists also displayed a revived interest in investigating quackery's deceptions and hazards. An excellent example was a series by James DeBrosse, researched with the FDA's help and published, despite the threat of multiple lawsuits, by the St. Petersburg Times [117]. Speaking to the Pharmaceutical Advertising Council in 1982, FDA Commissioner Arthur Hull Hayes, Jr., cited Consumer Union's Health Quackery and admitted that his agency was doing \"not much\" about the problem [118]. Dr. Hayes\u2014and later Congressman Pepper\u2014might properly have given the FDA more credit for its campaign to restrain Laetrile. Hayes did believe that the agency \"acted promptly\" against \"products that actually do or could harm users\" but neglected those that deprived users of legitimate therapy and those posing hazard only to the purse. The overall task was too huge for the FDA alone; its staff power was woefully insufficient. The agency could afford only one or two prosecutions a year against the worst offenders and could \"never hope to even stalemate the quacks with publicity.\" The regulatory agencies must cooperate. The Better Business Bureau might join with the medical and advertising professions to give quackery pitiless exposure. A year later Commissioner Hayes congratulated the Pharmaceutical Advertising Council for acting on his cue and proposing plans for a joint public service campaign with the FDA, carried in a variety of media, focusing on quackery's flaws [119]. Internally, also, the FDA was rethinking its stance toward quackery, prompted by \"concern and frustration\" both at headquarters and in the field about the existing program [120]. This process was \"agonizingly slow\" because of conflicting opinions among agency personnel about what to do [121]. An effort at resolution occurred at a Policy Board Quackery Go-Away in March 1983, which determined to change the target name from \"quackery\" to \"health fraud,\" arranged better internal coordination on health fraud matters, and agreed to allocate resources specifically for compliance in this field [122]. More activity did occur. A pilot program, \"Tipped Off or Ripped Off,\" aimed at medical devices whose promotion grossly deceived the public, even though no threat to health was involved [123]. The promoter of such a device would be warned of his sins and, unless changes were made within a month, the agency would publicize them. This plan was expanded to drugs, and a new standing committee on health fraud could decide on seizures, injunctions, or prosecutions to halt promotions dangerous to health [124]. Simultaneously, warning letters would go to firms marketing similar products. A Drugs and Biologic Fraud Branch was established for coordinating activities, initiating actions, and providing support to other federal regulatory agencies [125] In the agency's A Plan for Action, issued in 1985 after Dr. Frank E. Young had become commissioner, health fraud became one of the FDAs top ten priorities, with the promise of \"increased emphasis\" on both enforcement and education [126]. The climate for enforcement, however, was not propitious in the 1980s. Tight budgets and antiregulatory sentiment restrained the bureaucrat's hand. Decisions of a type the FDA had hitherto made on its own now might be overruled by officials in the Department of Health and Human Services or the Office of Management and Budget [127]. Prosecutions relating to quackery remained few and far between, and critics kept complaining [128]. The arrival of a new, mysterious, frightening, infectious epidemic, when such contagions had been deemed on their way toward extinction, forced the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies into emergency action. \"We stand nakedly in front of a very serious pandemic,\" stated the director-general of the World Health Organization, \"as mortal as any pandemic has ever been.\"[129] Victims of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, lacking approved medications that could cure or, for several years, even palliate their condition, turned desperately to rumored or fraudulently promoted treatments [130]. As gatekeeper for new medications, the FDA, when legitimate drugs seemed tardy in arriving, bore the brunt of AIDS activist organization wrath [131]. Many ordinary citizens, convinced the cause of AIDS was ubiquitous, panicked into purchasing falsely advertised \"protective\" devices. Postal inspectors filed a complaint against an alleged air-purifying gadget called Viralaid\u2014\"The product of lightning harnessed for your use!\"\u2014to protect \"bed linens, bath towels, even eating utensils.\" [132] The Environmental Protection Agency acted against antiseptics overpromising to safeguard home and office environments. 133 A plastic shield was vended to cover public telephones, to block the user from the breath and spit of previous mouths [134]. Of those stricken with AIDS, or fearing this fate, a great many entered \"a jungle of truly questionable and quack products.\" [135] Dr. John Renner of Kansas City tabulated over three hundred quack schemes and guessed there might be thousands more [136]. Victor Herbert pointed to one significant trend: \"Every cancer scam has become an AIDS scam.\" [137] Robert Bradford and Mike Culbert, with headquarters in San Francisco and a treatment center in Tijuana, now covered AIDS as well as cancer. 138 Garlic pills, enemas, and meditation formed part of the regimen, but its central element, Culbert told a television interviewer, was \"live cell therapy, the embryonic cellular extracts from calves, although sheep, goats will do just as well.\" In the Bahamas, Dr. Lawrence Burton, a zoologist, dispensed a blood serum treatment for cancer that possessed the potential of taking Laetrile's place as an American social movement built upon an unorthodox therapy [139]. Burton added AIDS to cancer as a disease that he claimed could be treated effectively by his therapy. With sad irony, it was later demonstrated that some samples of the serum had become contaminated, as shown by the presence of antibodies to the AIDS-causing human immunodeficiency virus. The FDA barred Burton's product from importation. As the viral destruction of immunity became established and widely announced to be the genesis of AIDS, safeguarding immunity became a central doctrine in unorthodox therapy [140]. The health food industry eagerly latched on to this approach, and a variety of products surged into the marketplace with explicit or guarded claims for preventing or combating AIDS. The FDA took action against over-the-counter and mail-order medications using the immunity pitch if AIDS was named or obviously implied in the name or labeling. The agency sent regulatory letters to makers of whey-concentrate colostrum with names like Stimulac, and sought to stop the promotion of Prevention Plus and Resist-AIDS tablets [141]. Another group of drugs presented the FDA with more difficult decisions. Unproven products, some made by American pharmaceutical firms, others derived from the science or folklore of foreign nations, had gained wide use in the guerrilla clinics of the AIDS underground [142]. A number of these drugs went into legitimate clinical trials, although too slowly to suit AIDS activists, a few to emerge with true therapeutic roles related to secondary afflictions to which AIDS patients were prone, others to prove ineffective or lethal. Under the double pressure of the AIDS lobby and the Reagan administration's desire to reduce regulatory burdens, the FDA devised policies of earlier release for drugs showing some promise to treat life-threatening diseases [143]. Moreover, the agency did not interfere with individuals seeking the treatments dispensed at underground clinics, unless the marketers made illegal labeling claims [144]. The FDA further permitted people with AIDS to bring back from other countries, or to have mailed to them from abroad, limited supplies of any AIDS product that caught their fancy, except those on Import Alert. The FDA's modifications of policy kept the agency in the middle of controversy, the changes seeming insufficient to the AIDS community, but to some health scientists threatening the integrity of the new drug introduction system and the control of quackery [145]. Commissioner Young gave a reporter this apologia for FDA policy: \"I'd rather err on being compassionate. People with this dreaded disease have limited hope, and I don't want to rob them of it.\"[146] With AIDS quackery as with other health fraud, FDA officials continued to assert that education had to play the leading role in the agency's counterattack. Its \"big guns\u2014regulatory actions and criminal prosecutions,\" would be fired off only occasionally, when the provocation seemed overwhelming [147]. Intensive effort went into the FDA's educational campaign [148]. Cooperating with the Council of Better Business Bureaus, the FDA sought to secure tighter screening of advertising by all branches of the media and urged direct marketers to check more carefully their product claims. In a variety of ways, the agency and its allies also sought to jolt the broad public into greater awareness of health fraud hazards. The joint effort with the Pharmaceutical Advertising Council put spots on television and radio and public service announcements in newspapers, magazines, and medical publications, all warning of quackery. A consumer brochure produced by the Council, the FDA, the FTC, and the Postal Service received massive circulation. The FDA undertook special programs to increase sensitivity about health fraud among physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and pharmaceutical manufacturers. An Information Exchange Network was inaugurated with the National Association of Consumer Administrators, and Health Fraud Surveillance Teams were begun with the Association of Food and Drug Officials, thus strengthening federal and state cooperation in detecting and planning attacks on fraudulent ventures. FDA Consumer published numerous articles on the health fraud theme, and the agency issued press releases on newsworthy developments. The FDA's Consumer Affairs Officers stressed health fraud in their numerous meetings with members of the public. Special programs were targeted at groups deemed especially vulnerable: the elderly, Hispanic citizens, arthritis sufferers, and people with AIDS. The National Health Fraud Conferences of the 1960s were revived. The first of the new series, sponsored by the FDA, the FTC, and the Postal Service, met in Washington in September 1985 [149] Congressman Claude Pepper, on his eighty-fifth birthday, came to bestow his blessing on the enterprise. Commissioner Young called health fraud \"a disease, devouring, destroying and contagious,\" and quackery's most committed critics, among them Victor Herbert, Stephen Barrett, and Grace Powers Monaco, elaborated the grim details. Regional conferences across the country and in Puerto Rico carried the message closer to the grass roots until the next National Health Fraud Conference, sponsored by the FDA and Trinity Lutheran Hospital, convened in Kansas City, Missouri, in March 1988 [150]. Those who assembled seemed to accept some basic assumptions: that quackery was too deeply entrenched to be destroyed, but much could be done \"to minimize the negative impact . . . upon society.\"[151] There were hopeful signs: a recent \"substantial increase,\" despite low budgets, in federal enforcement [152] and a considerable improvement in networking among quackery's foes. The current masks worn by the illegitimate were vividly described. Much time at the conference went into considering the practical aspects of combating health fraud: how to gather evidence during an investigation; how to write accurately about the problem; how to avoid legal difficulties; how to improve education in the schools. Another National Health Fraud Conference would meet in Kansas City in September 1990. This time the Food and Drug Administration would not be among the four official sponsors, while the American Medical Association would resume its 1960s role. The theme of the conference, according to the preliminary announcement, would be \"Quackery, Health Fraud, and Misinformation: A Pandora's Box.\" [153] Quackery has always been Pandora's box, constantly reopened with hope, never releasing a genuine benefit, although sometimes the opener is fooled into believing so. The box has an infinite capacity. Old cheats like before-and-after pictures and the fake diagnostic test come out wrapped in new tinsel [153]. In one case, for a weight-loss scam, both pictures were taken on the same day of the same woman, the company president, who apparently donned a padded robe for \"before\" and a swimsuit for \"after.\" In another instance, a Los Angeles lab claiming to test blood for allergies was itself put to the test. Federal investigators paid the required $350 fee, sending in blood from a vegetarian described as \"overweight, irritable [and] constipated.\" The lab reported allergies to milk, blue cheese, and yogurt. The patient was a cow. Pandora's box continues to be stuffed with a variety of brazen health deceptions beyond recounting, perhaps beyond reckoning. Despite increased efforts at education, the perennial proneness seems not to have diminished perceptibly. A national survey conducted by Louis Harris and Associates, which the FDA helped devise, found that more than a quarter of the American public reported using one or more questionable health care treatments [154]. At Kansas City, Deputy Commissioner Norris stated that the agency believed this figure \"seriously underestimated the extent of the problem.\" [155] More than half of such users thought they had derived some benefit, certainly evidence of self-deception. The poor and sick seemed at special risk, but college education offered no protection against resort to questionable products. Cancer quackery offers evidence of how both populist and elitist elements of the population have been preyed upon. James Patterson stressed the class nature of the phenomenon [156]. The poor have been vulnerable in both an economic and an educational sense, constituting a counterculture suspicious of expert knowledge, especially skeptical of orthodox medical opinion, trusting instead in folk tradition, home remedies, faith healing, and quackery. A survey conducted by Jon D. Miller of Northern Illinois University found that three-quarters of his respondents believed \"there are good ways of treating sickness that medical science does not recognize.\" [157] Remarks by Glen Rutherford at the Kansas City hearing on Laetrile conducted by the FDA catch the bitter feeling often expressed toward establishment medicine [158]. \"You people in authority,\" the FDA's stubborn opponent said, \"consider all the rest of us a bunch of dummies. . . . You set yourself up as God and Jesus Christ all rolled up into one. And we don't have any rights. . . . Patrick Henry said: 'Give me liberty, or give me death.' Glen Rutherford says, 'Let me choose the way I want to die. It is not your prerogative to tell me how. Only God can do that.'\" The educated also become seduced by cancer unorthodoxy. Revealing this truth again, Barrie Cassileth and her colleagues followed her terse answer to the question \"After Laetrile, What?\" with an empirical study, sampling the experience of patients in her Philadelphia region treated both in cancer centers and by unorthodox practitioners [159]. The researchers found that patients taking unorthodox treatment alone or in addition to conventional therapy tended to be better educated than those receiving only conventional treatment. The study reported that 54 percent of patients on conventional therapy also used unorthodox treatments, and that 40 percent of those so doing abandoned conventional care. Eight percent of the patients had received no conventional treatment at all. Perhaps the most surprising finding was that 60 percent of the dispensers of unorthodox treatment were physicians. The principal unorthodoxies Cassileth and her associates discovered were those of the new wave, \"metabolic therapy, diet therapies, megavitamins, mental imagery applied for anti-tumor effect, spiritual or faith healing, and 'immune' therapy.\" A \"common perspective\" gave unity to the diversity: \"Cancer and other chronic illnesses tend to be viewed not as disease entities, but as symptoms of underlying dysfunction, disorder, or toxicity.\" As a consequence, therapy was aimed at enhancing the patient's physical and mental capacity to counteract what was deemed fundamentally wrong. This pattern reveals that unorthodox cancer treatment had moved to a considerable degree under the \"alternative\" or holistic umbrella. From this position the foes of scientific medicine not only condemn the medical/regulatory establishment and lobby against it in legislative bodies, but they also frame a counter-paradigm that they seek to persuade the public is intellectually more valid and therapeutically more effective than the system of science. \"One of the major successes of pseudoscientific thinking,\" William Jarvis has written, \"has been tacit acceptance of the word 'alternatives' into current health jargon.\" [160] Holistic medicine,\" Clark Glymour and Douglas Stalker have argued, \"is a pablum of common sense and nonsense offered by cranks and quacks and failed pedants who share an attachment to magic and an animosity toward reason. Too many people seem willing to swallow the rhetoric-even too many medical doctors-and the results will not be benign.\" [161] These two philosophers have edited a book in which scholarly specialists expose the illogic of major elements in the holistic movement [162]. As a sociologist has observed, \"the fate of medical social movements is not determined by the soundness of their theories or the effectiveness of their therapies, but by their ability to mobilize political and social resources effectively.\" [163] The civil war that Robert Bradford predicted over Laetrile is now being waged fiercely on a broader front, and it is too soon to say whether science or antiscience will win. At the peak of the Laetrile movement, scientist Thomas Jukes, a dedicated foe of quackery, asserted that public acceptance of unorthodox health practices had become \"so well established, and [is] so little challenged that its impact will produce a decline of scientific medicine and its replacement by quackery.\" [164] Despite a decade of counterattack on pseudomedicine by the revived legions of regulators and quackbusters, Dr. Jukes commented early in 1990, \"Unfortunately, I see no reason to retract my pessimistic opinion.\" Whatever the odds, the intense contest continues for the allegiance of the people. Those dedicated to the cause of science and reason need to take a committed stand.

An analysis of data from the Nurses' Health Study has found that the risk of nontraumatic osteoporotic hip fracture was significantly higher among women who had the highest total vitamin A intake compared with women with the lowest vitamin A intake. [Feskanich D and others. Vitamin A intake and hip fractures among postmenopausal women. JAMA 287:47-54, 2002] The increase was attributable to dietary intake of retinol (preformed vitamin A) rather than beta-carotene (which the body converts into vitamin A). The data were derived from a total of 72,337 women aged 34 to 77 years who were followed for up to 18 years. The authors concluded that \"long-term intake of a diet high in retinol may promote the development of osteoporotic hip fractures on women\" and that \"the amounts of retinol in fortified foods and vitamin supplements may need to be reassessed since these add significantly to total retinol consumption in the United States.\" The most significant food sources of retinol in the United States are animal liver, milk, butter, margarine, fortified breakfast cereals, and meal-replacement beverages. An accompanying editorial stated that the study's findings \"question whether women represented by this study cohort\u2014white US women of high socioeconomic status\u2014should avoid supplements containing retinol if their diet is rich in low saturated fat, low-trans margarine. low-fat dairy products, and fruits and vegetables.

Naturopaths claim to stimulate the body's natural healing processes by ridding it of waste products and \"toxins.\" Their practices combine commonsense health and nutrition measures and rational use of a few herbs with a huge variety of unscientific practices. Naturopaths are licensed as independent practitioners in eleven states and the District of Columbia and can legally practice in a few others. Those who have attended on-campus schools are pressing for licensure in the remaining states. [Quackwatch has posted several reports](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Naturopathy/index.html) to help legislators and prospective patients understand what naturopaths do. FTC zaps \"Zapper\" sellers. Marvin and Miguelina Beckwith, of Blaine, Washington, have been enjoined from making unbsubstantiated claims for any of their products. Doing business as Western Dietary Products, Inc., they had claimed that their \"Zapper Electrical Unit\" is effective against Alzheimer's, and HIV/AIDS and that various herbal products can treat and cure cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, arthritis, and HIV/AIDS [ [FTC prohibits marketers of herbal products and the \"Zapper\" from making unsubstantiated claims](https://www.ftc.gov/opa/2001/12/westdiet.htm). FTC News Release, Dec 28, 2001] The Beckwiths based the disputed claims on the theories of Hulda Regehr Clark, an unlicensed naturopath who claims she can cure these diseases, sometimes within a few hours. The government's case was supported by three lengthy affidavits that thoroughly debunked Clark's theories and treatments. Although she was not a party to this action, it might discourage others from marketing what she recommends. [Detailed information about Clark is posted on Quackwatch](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/clark.html). ACS Web site attacks questionable therapies. The [American Cancer Society Web site](http://www.cancer.org/eprise/main/docroot/eto/eto_5?sitearea=ETO) has greatly expanded and improved the quality of its information on \"complementary and alternative therapies.\" Most of the new information comes from the [American Cancer Society's Guide to Complementary and Alternative Methods](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0944235247/quackwatch-20), which was published in 2000. More than 100 methods are discussed. FDA asks doctors to report kava-related liver toxicity. On December 19, the The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a [letter asking doctors to review their cases of liver toxicity](http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/SAFETY/2001/kava.htm) to determine whether any may be related to the use of kava-containing herbal products and to report such cases to MedWatch. The request was made because products containing extracts of kava have been implicated in Europe in at least 25 cases of serious liver toxicity, including hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver failure. In addition, the FDA has received several reports of serious injury allegedly associated with the use of kava-containing products, with at least one report of liver failure requiring liver transplantation in a previously healthy young woman. Health care costs rising sharply. The Center for Studying Health System Change has concluded that health-care costs rose sharply in 2000, the largest increase in a decade. Despite the recent focus on increased spending for prescription drugs, the upward trend was largely attributable to rising hospital spending. The likely causes for are the retreat from tightly managed care (which may have raised the level of use of hospital services), increased leverage on the part of hospitals to demand higher payments from insurers, and labor shortages. Total health care costs in 2000 rose 7.2%, with inpatient and outpatient care accounting for 47% of the increase. Prescription drug spending, while still high, dropped to a 14.5% increase in 2000, down from an 18.4% increase in 1999. Spending for physician services decreased from 5.7% in 1999 to 4.8% in 2000. If these trends continue, in light of a slowing economy and shrinking corporate profits, employers could respond by raising their employees' out-of-pocket costs, and the number of uninsured persons could grow.

Frank Wiewel first came to the attention of NCAHF as the head of the IAT Patients Association (IATPA), which he operated using the address of Box 10, Otho, Iowa. \"IAT\" stands for \"Immunoaugmentative Therapy,\" the name given a questionable cancer treatment advanced by zoologist Lawrence Burton, PhD. Burton, who originally operated in New York, moved his practice to the Bahamas to avoid the accountability required by United States consumer protection laws. With the help of New York Congressman Guy Molinari, IATPA was instrumental in getting the U.S. Congress's Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) to investigate questionable cancer medicine [1]. Wiewel vigorously promoted IAT and portaryed it as a victim of a misguided medical/governmental cartel. However, Burton's flight from legal accountability cast grave doubts upon his veracity. IAT fell further into disrepute when samples of the substance Burton was injecting into patients blood were found to be contaminated with AIDS and hepatitis viruses. Burton's clinic became more suspect after it failed to follow through with its promise to cooperate with the OTA's evaluation of its veracity as the centerpiece of its overall assessment of \"unconventional cancer therapies.\" Burton, who had vowed to take the secret of his cancer therapy with him to his grave, died in 1993. NCAHF also came into contact with Mr. Wiewel when he attended a National Health Fraud Conference representing a group called People Against Cancer (PAC) which was also located at Box 10, Otho, Iowa. Whereas in the first instance, Wiewel was heavily promoting IAT, in the case of his PAC, he claimed to have \"no vested interest in any therapy,\" \"not financially affiliated with any physician or clinic,\" \"receive no funds or referral fees from anyone treating cancer,\" and \"do not make treatment recommendations.\" Wiewel claimed to \"provide options,\" and to \"educate with unbiased information toward informed choice.\" In reality, he consistently bashed standard cancer treatment, impugned the trustworthiness of standard cancer research and care, and extolled the value on offbeat cancer theories and procedures. PAC's book list is a library of books by a who's who of fringe practitioners, mavericks, and outright quacks. Wiewel is totally biased against evidence-based cancer care, and in favor of a wild and woolly cancer treatment marketplace. This is done in the name of \"freedom of choice.\" Unfortunately, Wiewel's idea of freedom of choice is one in which the cancer patient bears all of the responsibility while the promoter enjoys all of the freedom. Wiewel clearly has built his organization upon the public's paranoid idea that a grand conspiracy exists to suppress effective cancer cures, general distrust of the \"establishment,\" and the strong desire of a segment of cancer patients to \"leave no stone unturned\" in their desperate search for a miracle. In 1987, Wiewel and his IATPA supporters picketed a conference on cancer quackery held in Ft. Lauderdale sponsored by the Florida Division of the American Cancer Society. NCAHF participated in the conference. Accompanying Wiewel at that time was a young man who was represented to be living proof that IAT was effective. NCAHF later learned that the man died about two years afterward. It is not unusual for promoters of questionable cancer remedies to publicly parade individuals alleged to have been cured of cancer who later die. NCAHF asserts that it is plausible that Mr. Wiewel \u2014 and others who have stood up for questionable cancer treatments \u2014 is a victim of his ignorance of the biology of cancer who has become ensnared an ego-trap. The Biology of Cancer The American Cancer Society's\"seven danger signals\" indicate a need for a thorough examination \u2014 they are not definitive. Most people experiencing the signals do not have cancer. In addition, people's symptoms may not reflect the seriousness of their cancer. The absence of overt symptoms makes it possible for people with cancer to believe that they have been cured when, in fact, the disease is still present and progressing. Normal survival variations found among cancer patients is such that in any population of patients, unusual long-term survival will occur. NCAHF has found that the most common reason given by patients who believe they have been cured by unproven cancer remedies is that they have survived longer than a physician said that they would. They apparently were not aware that survival-time forecasts are based upon group averages. Physician estimates of expected survival times are based upon the median for the particular disease and its stage. \"Median\" means the point at which half of individual patients will have died. Thus, half will also survive longer than the median, and some of these will survive for an extraordinary lengths of time. A professor of surgery has stated: It might surprise many readers to learn that we are uncertain about the natural history of untreated breast cancer. I have studied and written about this subject for nearly 25 years. Anecdotally, I have about a dozen patients with well-documented case histories who have refused all active therapy and have lived in symbiosis with their tumors for up to 35 years [4]. The first half of cancer patients who die will do so within a relatively short time period compared to the group's overall length of survival. One gauge of doctor's inability to predict survival is a report that 84% of survival predictions given hospice patients were wrong, and the tendency in prognoses involving more than 3-4 months is to underestimate survival time [5]. Anyone who deals with a large number of cancer patients is bound to come in contact with a number of \"unusually\" long-term survivors. It is easy to understand how people can be influenced by such experiences to believe that something they are doing deserves credit for their good fortune. Financial Gains. Mr. Wiewel's promotion of unproven cancer medicine has brought him both income and notoriety. Wiewel rose from obscurity to a public figure of national visibility. PAC's financial report for the year ending 12/31/98 states that its gross income was $269,985 for for 1994 [6]. Wiewel pays himself a salary and finances his travels around the country and internationally as he lobbies on behalf of the promoters of unproven cancer medicine. Wiewel benefited enormously from the establishment of the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and may have played a role in the strange series of events that led to its creation. Iowa Congressman Berkeley Bedell experienced prostate cancer. Although Bedell had standard therapy, like many cancer patients, he appears to have been emotionally traumatized by his disease, and the inability of honest physicians to assure him that his cancer was completely cured. In his quest for certainty, Bedell explored the world of \"alternative\" cancer remedies. NCAHF has been told that Wiewel advised Bedell in this mission. Despite the fact that as a former Congressman he has access to the best cancer experts, Bedell patronized Gaston Naessens, a Canadian with a long history of promoting unproven cancer remedies. Bedell got Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) to introduce a bill, which he lobbied personally, that eventually established the NIHOAM. Bedell and Wiewel eventually became members of the OAM advisory board. Wiewel has used this affiliation to give status to the unproven remedies he promotes [7,8]. Wiewel, Bedell and Ralph Moss (editor of The Cancer Chronicles, which PAC distributed during its early days), who had the ear of Senator Tom Harkin to the degree that they became known as \"Harkinites,\" so politicized the OAM that the office's first full-time director, Joseph Jacobs, MD, resigned in frustration. The issue was whether or not the OAM would operate according to scientific standards for which NIH was known, or whether personal testimonials, anecdotal evidence, metaphysical ideologies, and subjective acclamations would be given the imprimatur of NIH. Wiewel also rallied to the defense of Stanislaw R. Burzynski, MD, when he was charged with mail fraud; violating the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and contempt for failing to obey court orders against previous violations. Claims that Burzynski has been a victim of the big drug companies are refuted by the indictment which stated that from 1988 to 1994, the Burzynski Research Institute grossed $40 million and that Burzynski and his wife took in over $5 million in personal income [9]. Wiewel seem oblivious to the financial gains of the marketers \"alternative\" cancer methods.

Hearing on Swindlers, Hucksters and Snake Oil Salesmen: The Hype and Hope of Marketing Anti-Aging Products to Seniors September 10, 2001A Written Response to the Statement of the Honorable Dan Burton (R-IN), Chairman, House Committee on Government ReformBy Timothy N. Gorski, M.D., F.A.C.O.G. Assistant Clinical Professor, University of North Texas Health Science Center President, Dallas/Fort Worth Council Against Health Fraud Board Member, National Council Against Health Fraud Associate Editor, Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine Introduction The Honorable Congressman Dan Burton's forceful objections to the Senate Special Committee's hearing and his accusations directed at me and my testimony are serious and deserve a response. I appreciate the opportunity of doing so, though it is without benefit of a paid research staff. In addition, I am under considerable pressure of time while caring for my patients in my full-time practice of obstetrics and gynecology as well as meeting my family obligations. Although I prefer to be brief, the nature of these objections limits that intention. The Nature and Purpose of the Hearing To begin with, Chairman Breaux and the Senate Special Committee on Aging are to be commended, not condemned, for considering the very serious problem of fraud in the dietary supplement industry and, in particular, its impact on older Americans. This problem has received very little attention since the 1984 Pepper Report [1], and it is absolutely clear that current law and enforcement resources have been and remain insufficient to address it. Senator Breaux made it very clear in his opening remarks that the focus of the hearing was on the \"bad actors\" in the multibillion dollar dietary supplement industry. The activities of Mr. A. Glenn Braswell were considered in detail and it was brought out that current penalties for fraud in this business are insufficient to stop or deter it. Mr. Braswell and Mr. Tepper, appearing under subpoena, repeatedly exercised their Fifth Amendment privileges. Additional witnesses, including myself, presented evidence, including many examples, showing that Mr. Braswell's misbehavior is far from unique and must be considered in its context to be understood. It was clearly and emphatically not the purpose of the hearing to indiscriminately discount the benefit of all vitamin, mineral or other supplementation of the diet or to condemn all manufacturers of such products. No evidence was presented that would argue for such a conclusion. Nor was the purpose of the hearing to take issue with well-established facts concerning the health benefits of diet, exercise, or the use of vitamin and mineral supplementation generally or in the management of specific health problems. On the contrary, evidence was presented by myself showing that perpetrators of fraud take advantage of the deliberate blurring of distinctions between the rational and the irrational engaged in by advocates of the latter. It was also not the purpose of the hearing to consider the many ways in which the nation's medical care system as a whole might be improved, or even what improvement might consist of. But the Honorable Congressman Burton took the opportunity to assert that, \"Many of our nation's seniors are subjected to treatments in 'conventional medicine' that are not necessary, cost more and are more dangerous than equally effective alternatives.\" There are simply no facts to support this claim. As I pointed out in my testimony, there is widespread recognition and a wealth of examples to prove that the standards of medical science \u2014 falsely labeled \"conventional,\" and sometimes \"traditional\" or \"orthodox\" \u2014 are in continual flux in response to evidence. Treatments of any kind that are clearly shown to be superior have always quickly supplanted previous methods without need of legislative mandates. This is the essence of scientific progress. Congressman Burton expresses outrage that I would question the conclusions of a report \"published after peer-review in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.\" Yet it is a fact that the findings of the article in question [2] have been systematically misrepresented by its lead author and by other advocates of irrational and aberrant methods including the NCCAM. The facts related to this deception have been documented in another peer-reviewed journal [3]. This is the way of science. The literature is not sacred scripture, but dialogue in which facts are presented, considered, critiqued, and conclusions reached, rejected or modified. But this process should be governed by facts and reason and not by political, ideological or emotional considerations. DSHEA [Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act] Several witnesses identified the 1994 DSHEA legislation, however well-intended it may have been at the time, as a principal contributor to the problem of fraud in the dietary supplement industry. This assessment has also been made by others [4-8], including former FDA Commissioner David Kessler [9] and the editors of The New England Journal of Medicine [10]. As the FDA's own website advises consumers, \"there is no provision under any law or regulation that FDA enforces that requires a firm to disclose to FDA or consumers the information they have about the safety or purported benefits of their dietary supplement products.\" [11] The FDA cannot take action against supplements that are worthless or merely suspected of being harmful, as it can \u2014 and has \u2014 in the case of both prescription and over-the-counter medications. Evidence presented at the hearing showed that the FDA has been unable to remove even dangerous supplements from the marketplace, not even ephedrine products which have injured thousands of people. When enforcement actions are taken, the FDA has no authority to inflict financial penalties, so that perpetrators of fraud bear no net financial cost from their predations. There is not even a requirement that the FDA be notified about the sale of a \"dietary supplement\" or of the identity and whereabouts of its manufacturer and promoters. In essence, the provisions of DSHEA established an enormous and unprecedented \"honor system\" for substances promoted as having drug benefits. Evidence presented at the hearing \u2014 which represented merely a small sampling \u2014 showed that many in the industry are simply not honorable. Nor will the promulgation of good manufacturing practices adequately address the problem. So great has the problem become that polling data now show that \"a majority of Americans surveyed supported the following: to require that the Food and Drug Administration review the safety of new dietary supplements prior to their sale; to provide increased authority to remove from sale those products shown to be unsafe; and to increase government regulation to ensure that advertising claims about the health benefits of dietary supplements are true.\" [12] Evidence was presented at the hearing that the FTC has stepped up its enforcement actions in the regulatory vacuum created by DHSEA. This it has been able to do by relying on its authority to take action against advertising that lacks a competent scientific basis. But Congressman Burton would remove even this means of recourse against fraud in the dietary supplement industry. In the 106th Congress he introduced the so-called \"Dietary Supplement Fairness in Labeling and Advertising Act,\" H.R. 3305, which would have amended the Federal Trade Commission Act in order to render the FTC as ineffectual as the FDA. [13] I am very grateful that the Honorable Congressman Burton raised the matter of red yeast rice as an alternative to prescription \"statin\" drugs. This is yet another excellent example of how DSHEA has corrupted the law and, with it, the understanding of Americans with respect to products promoted as having health benefits. For on the one hand was the \"drug\" lovastatin, sold under the trade name Mevacor\u00ae, which the FDA requires be proven safe and effective for its intended purpose before marketing. On the other hand was the \"dietary supplement\" lovastatin, sold under the trade name Cholestin\u00ae (since reformulated), which was not subject to such strictures. Both contained the same active ingredient possessing the same pharmacologic activity and therefore the same potential for beneficial as well as adverse effects. If the \"drug\" is not safe without its use being prescribed and monitored by a physician, why should the \"dietary supplement\" be so considered? And if the \"dietary supplement\" is safe to use without medical supervision, why not the \"drug\" as well? The same potential for confusion and contradiction exists whenever a substance is found to exist naturally somewhere in the universe and, at the same time, happens to be a prescription medication. Because of the fact that many medications are derived from animal or botanical sources, this situation can be expected to arise frequently. Another current example is that of vinpocetine, sold in Europe as a prescription drug to treat dementia at the same time it is promoted in the US \u2014 probably fraudulently [14] \u2014 as a dietary supplement to improve memory and concentration. Congressman Burton laments the fact that the FDA eventually won its case in the matter of Cholestin\u00ae, but the fact is that if cerivastatin could be found in a plant extract, it could be marketed as a dietary supplement under DSHEA. UNTHSC Clinical Faculty Appointment In addressing the Honorable Congressman Burton's personal attack on me, I would like to begin by thanking his staff for discovering an oversight concerning my clinical faculty appointment to the University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC). Unfortunately, a proper investigation was not conducted with the result that the accusations of intentional misrepresentation or concealed wrongdoing of any kind is absolutely and utterly false, offensive and represents a grotesque smear of both myself and UNTHSC. The facts are very simple. In late 1987 I joined the medical staff of the Dallas-Fort Worth Medical Center in Grand Prairie, Texas, a teaching hospital utilized by what was then the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine, later renamed UNTHSC. As a consequence, and much to my satisfaction, I was thereafter continuously involved with the teaching and training of medical students and resident physicians of UNTHSC. In 1991, without my having taken action of any kind, I was notified that I had been appointed to the assistant clinical faculty of the school's department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Though unasked for, I was gratified at this simple recognition of the many freely volunteered unpaid hours of effort that I devoted towards educating future physicians. Other members of the medical staff at the hospital were undoubtedly so recognized as well. But as to those details I have no information. In any case, I continued to have direct involvement with the medical education program at the hospital, including the evaluation of medical students and house staff performance until the hospital's closure on November 7, 2000 as a result of federal budget cuts. At no time did I receive any request from UNTHSC for any credentials verification, a function that was, in any case, carried out routinely by the hospital's medical staff office. Had I received such a request I would have been glad to comply with it. It is outrageous for anyone to assert the contrary: that I could not or would not. It is perhaps even more concerning that it would be assumed that an institution as outstanding and reputable as the UNTHSC would permit uncredentialed or unqualified individuals to teach and supervise its medical students and residents in the difficult, complex, and, at times, hazardous discipline of Obstetrics and Gynecology. I am justly proud of my association with UNTHSC and take spirited exception to its being unjustly slurred. I am in receipt of a letter dated October 10, 2001, from Ronald R. Blanck, DO, President of UNTHSC, a copy of which I have forwarded to the US Senate Special Committee on Aging. Dr. Blanck stated: I have learned that we did appoint you as clinical faculty in 1991, and it was never rescinded. Although you were in an inactive status since 1995, your position as Clinical Assistant Professor in the Department of OB/GYN remains valid. You have received a letter from the Acting Chairman of the Department of OB/GYN, Dr. Gary Meyer, requesting additional information so we may update our files and continue your appointment. But, I repeat since you received no notification of termination, and in fact none was sent, your appointment at the health science center remains in force. I hope this lays to rest any and all doubts in this matter. Office Of Alternative Medicine (OAM) / National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) I did not address the very different and much larger subject of the problems with the OAM/NCCAM in my testimony. My intention was only to put the subject of fraud in the dietary supplement industry into context and to highlight how far government policies of the last decade have departed from the findings of the 1984 Pepper report. But as Congressman Burton characterizes my criticisms of the OAM/NCCAM and the White House Commission on Alternative and Complementary Medicine Policy (WHCCAMP) as unfair or reckless attacks on careful and discerning scientists of world-class abilities and renown, it is necessary for me to cite additional facts to show that this is very far from the truth. The OAM/NCCAM is widely considered \"the brainchild of Iowa Senator Tom Harkin,\" a creature of politics inspired by his personal experience with the use of bee pollen for hayfever symptoms. It was never established that there was any \"unmet research need\" to be met. Given the fact that funds available for medical research are limited, the most important consideration is to address the most pressing problems and to do so in a way that maximizes the likelihood of useful results. These principles have not been followed at the OAM/NCCAM. Numerous professional scientists, many of whom have earned legitimate stature for their work, have objected on just these grounds [16]. The NCCAM is the only division of the NIH that is oriented toward a particular class of therapeutic methods, as vague and confused a concept as \"CAM\" may be. As such, it is the only center that is oriented primarily to the needs, desires and inclinations of practitioners \u2014 whether of acupuncture, homeopathy, \"energy medicine\" or some other belief system \u2014 instead of the needs, problems and circumstances of patients. Wallace Sampson, MD, Editor of the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine and Clinical Professor of Medicine at Stanford University who taught a course there on \"alternative medicine\" for 22 years, has called the NCCAM \"a full employment program for pseudoscientists and poor quality physicians.\" [17] Funding decisions at the NCCAM reflect these assessments, as I will shortly show. There is no doubt that the NIH did not welcome the imposition on it of the OAM in November of 1991. But the response among advocates of unproven, disproven and irrational medical claims and methods was euphoric. The first acting director of the office was Stephen C. Groft, D.Pharm, whose \"friendliness towards the initiative was palpable\" according to one enthusiastic advocate [18]. But the peculiar political pedigree of the OAM soon led to problems when this advocate and others on the OAM's Ad Hoc Advisory Committee \"were never consulted\" about the appointment of its first director, Joseph Jacobs MD. To them he seemed \"too conventional in his medical orientation\" and, worse, had no proven track record of practicing or promoting aberrant methods [19]. Within a year of his appointment, Dr. Jacobs was called before a special review hearing by Senator Harkin. At this meeting on June 24, 1993, Senator Harkin's friend Berkley Bedell spoke for unhappy advocates, complaining that all the OAM had to do was to conduct \"field studies\" consisting of compiling anecdotal reports. \"When it was Jacobs' turn to testify,\" according to a report in Science magazine, Senator Harkin \"raked him over the coals\" and made it clear that the purpose of OAM was to \"investigate and validate\" irrational and aberrant therapies. Jacobs was quoted as saying that he considered these marching orders \"very na\u00efve\" as well as \"professionally insulting.\" The article observed that CAM advocates were \"eager to have the imprimatur of an NIH review\" but \"may not want the rigor.\" Dr. Jacobs responded by saying that \"As a taxpayer, I wouldn't trust what comes out of my office under a system like that.\" [20] After announcing his resignation but before actually leaving, Dr. Jacobs was faced with an additional demand in January of 1994 to put four \"alternative medicine\" activists, hand-picked by Senator Harkin, on an OAM advisory panel. According to one account the lawmaker threatened to hold up the entire NIH budget until the individuals were added [21]. These were: - Berkley Bedell, former Iowa Congressman and multimillionaire fishing tackle manufacturer, who claimed that the quack cancer remedy \"714X\" cured his prostate cancer and that a whey treatment devised by a Minnesota farmer cured his Lyme disease [22]. A friend of Senator Harkin, it was Mr. Bedell who first prevailed on the Senator to try bee pollen. - Ralph Moss, who was fired as assistant director of Public Affairs at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center for failing \"to properly discharge his most basic job responsibilities.\" [23] He subsequently wrote The Moss Reports, The Cancer Chronicles and several books that attack science-based medicine and extol unproven cancer treatments including those of Stanislaw Burzynski and others. He is still on the Cancer Advisory Panel of the NCCAM and has said that \"There is nothing inherently 'ludicrous' about guided imagery, yoga, massage, homeopathy and therapeutic touch\" in curing serious disease [24]. - Gar Hildebrand, president of the Gerson Research Organization (GRO) in San Diego which promotes the irrational \"Gerson Method\" of cancer treatment. GRO runs a Tijuana cancer clinic at which patients have been charged $9000 for a two week course of unproven care while Mr. Hildebrand lectures them, emphasizing his ties to the NIH [25]. Mr. Hildebrand says that women with ovarian cancer should not receive chemotherapy but should instead \"detoxify the body\" with dietary measures including \"oodles of plant chemicals.\" Once this is done, he says, \"these patients' immune systems become intelligent again. They stop making excess stupid white cells, and create more lymphocytes interested in more types of challenges.\" [26] Hildebrand also promotes coffee enemas, hyperbaric oxygen and other nonsensical treatments for cancer. - Frank Wiewel, head of People Against Cancer (PAC), formerly the Immunoaugmentative Therapy Patients Association. PAC is a referral organization for cancer patients that promotes irrational treatments including the discredited \"Immunoaugmentative Therapy\" devised by zoologist Lawrence Burton, PhD. PAC also promotes the ideas of Hulda Clark and other notorious cancer quacks [27]. The organization's website states that \"you are never told the truth about cancer,\" [28] a detestable falsehood designed to drive a wedge between frightened and desperate cancer victims and their doctors in order to exploit the sick. Wayne Jonas MD assumed leadership at the OAM in July of 1995, almost a year after the departure of Dr. Jacobs. Dr. Jonas is a homeopath, a believer in a discredited 18th Century mystical prescientific theory of medicine that asserts the truth of preposterous \"laws.\" One of these, \"The Law of Similars,\" from which homeopathy takes its name, asserts that substances that cause certain symptoms are effective in treating those same symptoms. Another, \"The Law of Infinitesimals,\" states that diluting a substance makes it more potent. Thus, homeopathic \"medicine\" consists of substances diluted to fantastic proportions, to the point where no molecules of the substance remain. Dr. Jonas was enamored of homeopathy as a medical student at the Bowman Gray School of Medicine in North Carolina. After suggesting that a patient with severe pneumonia be treated with homeopathy, his supervisors asked him to repeat his rotation in medicine. But even as a medical student Dr. Jonas was impervious to reason. As OAM Director he told an interviewer that \"Just as the discovery of infectious agents revolutionized our ability to care for many diseases at the turn of the century, the discovery of what happens when a homeopathic preparation is made and how it impacts the body might revolutionize our understanding of chemistry, biology and medicine.\" [29] Dr Jonas co-authored a book on homeopathy in which he makes it clear that he is certain of its effectiveness but is only doubtful about its mechanism. The pattern of nonexistent molecules \"must be stored in some way in the diluted water/alcohol mixture\" he wrote, suggesting that all manner of occult energies, imaginary \"biophotons\" or New Age quantum effects could be involved [30]. Of late, Dr. Jonas has become frustrated with homeopathy research, perhaps because of the obvious truth in one medical scientist's observation that such research is nothing more than \"a game of chance between two placebos.\" [31] Dr. Jonas has suggested that validating homeopathy \"may require a theory that incorporates subjective variables,\" [32] which is to say, how the thoughts of patients, doctors, and perhaps their next-door neighbors might influence the effects of a homeopathic remedy. This is in line with mystical beliefs in \"nonlocal effects\" caused by \"intentionality,\" or, in other words, psychic powers. This is also entirely consistent with Dr. Jonas' new position on the Scientific Advisory Committee of the paranormalism-oriented Institute for Noetic Sciences (IONS). According to IONS, Dr. Jonas \"envisions the development of protocols using gene-array procedures to examine possible genetic expression arising from CAM signals in distant healing.\" He considers it wrongheaded and obsolete that \"the current view of the body is grounded in molecular biology.\" He prefers to think that \"bodily parts [can] communicate over long distances almost instantaneously\" by means of \"nonlocal characteristics in the biological process, with widely separated parts interacting in ways that don't have obvious physical carriers.\" [33] In June of 2001 Dr. Jonas was on the Program Committee of a conference in San Diego touting the reality of UFO's, paranormalism, Qigong, Orgone Energy and other pseudoscientific claims [34]. His preoccupation with aberrant methods appears to be thoroughly ideological if not religious. At one of the hearings of the WHCCAMP, of which he is an appointed member, he stated: \" a number of groups are now getting into this field from the orthodox community, because there has been some money available. How can we go about sorting through which ones are truly going to capture the spirit of whole person health or how many are looking really at the bottom line, which is getting redder and redder by the year?\" [35] Dr. Jonas left the OAM at the end of 1998 some two months after its conversion to the NCCAM. By that time many eminent and accomplished scientists had called for its defunding, including former presidential science advisor D. Allan Bromley [36-38]. Especially shameful was the allocation about that time of $1.4 million to the work of Nicholas Gonzalez and his bizarre coffee enema and psychic hair analysis cancer treatments. Even Barrie Cassileth, PhD, Chief of the Integrative Medicine Service at Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, called Gonzalez' claims and methods \"voodoo magic silly Not scientific. Worse than not scientific. This is pure ridiculousness.\" [39] When Stephen Strauss MD became director of the NCCAM in October of 1999, many supposed that matters could hardly get any worse. Indeed, Dr. Straus' reputation was such that some dared to hope for improvement. But the new director quickly began defending the funding devoted to the work of Dr. Gonzalez [40]. It is true that under Dr. Strauss the NCCAM has also undertaken large-scale multi-center research trials on Saint John's Wort, Ginkgo and glucosamine, the results of which will likely be trustworthy. Sadly, these are unlikely to be clinically useful for reasons that I pointed out in my testimony at the September 10 hearing. Indeed, after almost ten years and hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars spent, nothing has yet come out of the OAM/NCCAM that has been shown to be clinically important. Even a definitive study to determine the effectiveness of the bee pollen that Senator Tom Harkin believes cured his hayfever has not been undertaken. But Dr. Strauss' leadership at the NCCAM is disturbing for other reasons. There is clear evidence either that he lacks scientific judgment or that ideological advocates remain firmly in control at the NCCAM. It may be a contributing factor that, as a virologist, he has no expertise in evaluating aberrant and irrational medical methods. Among dozens of smaller NCCAM research grants, for example, have been many that are wasteful, inappropriate and utterly bizarre. In 2000, for example, three grants were awarded for obvious paranormalism research into \"psychic one person to another: - 1-R01-AT-485-1 Distant Healing Efforts for AIDS by Nurses and 'Healers' Targ, Elisabeth F. [41], California Pacific Medical Center -Pacific Campus. This is a three year grant awarded on July 1, 2000 totaling nearly $663,000 [42]. - 1-R01-AT-644-1 Efficacy of Distant Healing in Glioblastoma Treatment Targ, Elisabeth F., California Pacific Medical Center-Pacific Campus. This is a four-year grant totaling nearly $823,000 [43]. - 1-R21-AT-287-1 Transfer of Neural Energy Between Human Subjects Standish, Leanna J. Bastyr University. (Dollar figures unknown) Elisabeth Targ MD, who with the first two of these grant awards scooped up nearly $1.5 million of taxpayer dollars, is head of the Complementary Medicine Research Institute of California Pacifica Medical Center in San Francisco. She is a third generation psychic believer continuing a long tradition of pursuing absurd and discredited paranormal claims. This is a tradition distinguished chiefly by fraud and self-deception [44,45]. Her father, Russell Targ, earned notoriety in the 1970's for bilking the U.S. Department of Defense on promises that \"remote viewers\" could be trained to provide on-site details of Russian military facilities by visiting them \"psychically.\" According to her father, Elisabeth was trained on a psychic power teaching machine as a young girl and was able to predict the winners of horse races and presidential elections [46]. Distinguished science writer Martin Gardner recently provided additional details about the Targs, their eccentric beliefs and NCCAM funding of them [47]. Janet Quinn, RN PhD, a Therapeutic Touch (TT) practitioner and a former student of TT's founder Dolores Krieger, is a paid consultant to Dr. Targ on the AIDS work and is recruiting additional TT practitioners to act as a \"control group\" against the main group of psi-powered \"healers.\" $500 honorariums are being paid to perform this \"work\" with a total of $20,834 allocated for it through the February 28th, 2001 budget period. TT is a mystical \"healing\" method, the premise of which was falsified by an elementary school science project [48]. The most recent exploits of its founder, Dolores Krieger, are of \"doing healing at distance\" of those killed in the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, \"calling upon the help of the angels of compassion to help the person through the terror of dying so suddenly and so horribly. working together with whatever beneficent forces I think of or who present themselves at this time.\" [49] Understandably worried about the reaction of more sensible people to her NCCAM-funded studies, Dr. Targ has announced her determination to either get positive results or leave the door open to wasting more of the taxpayers' dollars on her work with psychic powers. At a parapsychology conference entitled \"Subtle Energies and Uncharted Realms of the Mind,\" at the New Age oriented Esalen Institute in July 2000, it was reported that: Targ discussed the difficulties of doing a clinical research study on distant healing. Since the mainstream medical community is highly skeptical of Targ's research, she must be meticulous at every step in the process. In addition, she must also guard against showing a negative result, because the mainstream will take those results and attempt to discredit what Targ is trying to show. [50] Current NCCAM advisor Marilyn Schlitz, PhD, and former NCCAM advisor Beverly Rubik, as well as Dr. Targ's father Russell were among the other featured speakers at the event [51]. Dr Strauss is fully aware of and supportive of these grants to Dr. Targ. In his annual director's report given at a February 5, 2001 NCCAM Advisory Committee meeting, Dr. Straus said: Dr. Targ at the California Pacific Medical Center is studying distance healing for glioblastoma, trying to move this research forward from small trials. The study has 150 patients in a double blind RCT in which healers pray for patient recovery. Endpoints include symptoms and functional status. [52] The third grant was awarded to one of the NCCAM's own advisory board members, Leanna J. Standish: 1-R21-AT-287-1, Transfer of Neural Energy Between Human Subjects, Bastyr University. Bastyr University is an official NCCAM research center. Its website indicates that Dr. Standish, who is the school's research co-director, is joined in her psychic investigations by fellow NCCAM advisor Marilyn Schlitz PhD. [53]. Dr. Schlitz is also on the board of IONS and directs its research programs [54]. With IONS Fellow Dr. Targ, Dr. Schlitz has been conducting her own psi research at California Pacific Medical Center [55]. In addition, Dr. Schlitz is herself an astral voyager \"remote viewer\" who was praised by Russell Targ for having \"achieved the greatest statistical significance of any remote-viewing experiment so far conducted\" in exploring tourist sites in Rome from her home in Detroit MI [56]. Standish, a \"naturopathic doctor,\" is, in turn, listed as a co-researcher with Dr. Targ on grant #1-R01-AT-485-1. Another NCCAM advisor, Michael F. Cantwell MD, works with Dr. Targ as lead physician in the Health and Healing Clinic at California Pacific Medical Center. Dr. Cantwell was to be the Principal Investigator for a proposed study of Russian psychics healing children with Cerebral Palsy sponsored by the Monterey Institute for the Study of Alternative Healing Arts which the United Cerebral Palsy Research and Educational Foundation declined to fund [57]. These activities, and doubtless others obscured with more pedestrian titles, fly in the face of an exhaustive study of parapsychology by the National Research Council (NRC) conducted in the late 1980's and early 1990's. The NRC concluded that there is \"no scientific justification from research conducted over a period of 130 years for the existence of parapsychological phenomena.\" [58] Although clearly supported by Dr. Strauss, it is only fair to say that the NCCAM's interest in parapsychological research had begun earlier. These forays into mysticism disguised as science were suggested in a report issued by the OAM's Mind-Body Panel when it was cochaired MD, Jungian \"transpersonal psychologist\" Jeanne Achterberg and James S. Gordon MD who is now Chair of the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy. This report falsely asserted that: There exist many published reports of experiments in which persons were able to influence a variety of cellular and other biological systems through mental means. The target systems for these investigations have included bacteria, yeast, fungi, mobile algae, plants, protozoa, larvae, insects, chicks, mice, rats, gerbils, cats, and dogs, as well as cellular preparations (blood cells, neurons, cancer cells) and enzyme activities. In human \"target persons,\" eye movements, muscular movements, electrodermal activity, plethysmographic activity, respiration, and brain rhythms have been affected through direct mental influence. [59] All of this alleged evidence was considered and rejected by the NRC's review. Yet it is continually pointed to by dishonest promoters of paranormalism. But it may very well be that Dr. Strauss, in his heart of hearts, would agree that these and many other NCCAM-funded activities are absurd and unscientific. It may very well be that, as one journalist wrote last year: [P]rinciples aside, Straus also has to follow the mandate of Congress - and some of its, well, less-than-scientific members. NCCAM is stuck funding a 5-year, $1.4 million trial of an unusual protocol designed to treat terminal pancreatic cancer by physician Nicolas Gonzalez. The so-called Gonzalez Protocol \u2014 a hodgepodge of pancreatic enzymes, coffee enemas, and up to 150 dietary supplements a day \u2014 caught the attention of Representative Dan Burton (R-IN), who in 1998 encouraged the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to study it. Even though Straus considers the evidence just an \"aggregate of interesting anecdotes,\" he defends the trial \u2014 albeit lukewarmly. \"I'm more comfortable and find it easier to approach and fund things that already make a lot more sense to me,\" he admits. \"But the mandate here is ... to be willing to take more risks for things that are novel.\" [60] Yet the sad fact remains that these \"things that are novel,\" especially when they are given the imprimatur of the NIH, ultimately put the public at risk for the kinds of harm that I outlined in my testimony on September 10. Perhaps the most egregious example is that of Dr. Gonzalez, who had already been found guilty of medical malpractice and ordered to pay more than $2 million in 1997. Another case was then underway involving a death in which Dr. Gonzalez was ultimately found guilty again \u2014 in April of 2000 \u2014 and ordered to pay $282,000 to the husband of a woman who died under his care [61]. Yet at the urging of Congressman Burton, the NCCAM ignored these considerations and made the preposterous decision that there was good reason to suppose that Gonzalez's methods had merit. Indeed, it is exceedingly puzzling that Congressman Burton trusts American citizens to make their own medical choices when he cannot trust the professional judgments of NIH and NCI research scientists. White House Commission on Alternative and Complementary Medicine Policy (WHCCAMP) The situation with respect to the WHCCAMP is even worse. Established by President Clinton on March 7th of 2000 by Executive Order 13147 and subsequently amended, the group is charged with providing a report \"on legislative and administrative recommendations for assuring that public policy maximizes the benefits to Americans of complementary and alternative medicine.\" The commission's report is due in March of 2002, but there is little doubt that it will recommend expanded federal spending and other policy initiatives to foster irrational and aberrant methods. The WHCCAMP Chair is James S. Gordon, MD, a Georgetown University psychiatrist who has said that he found \"a whole other system of medicine operating under completely different laws\" in the1960's when he began studying traditional Chinese medicine. Then, while receiving his training in psychiatry, Dr. Gordon said, he decided that schizophrenia and other disorders \"did not seem like diseases to me [but] instead like different ways of being.\" It was at this time that he became a student of the radical British psychiatrist R. D. Laing whose \"Insanity is Sanity\" philosophy achieved great popularity in the 1960s drug counterculture [62]. Dr. Gordon appears to have become enamored of these ideas at the very time that Kingsley Hall, Laing's London \"therapeutic community\" in which the mentally ill and their therapists lived together and \u2014 among other things \u2014 indulged in LSD, was forced to close under a cloud of scandal and public complaint [63]. His thinking distorted by long-term LSD use [64], Laing himself went on to become involved in \"Primal Scream\" and \"rebirthing psychodrama\" [65] of the kind that killed a young girl in Colorado in May of 2000 and sent two therapists to jail [66]. Dr. Gordon was a follower of the late Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, the Indian mystic who amassed wealth and influence enough to take over the small town of Antelope, Oregon in the 1980's before being deported by the authorities for fraud. Dr. Gordon wrote a sympathetic book about the cult, The Golden Guru, in which he offered excuses for the Bhagwan's erratic behavior and the violence connected with the cult. Dr. Gordon also describes his own \"rebirthing\" experience at the hands of one of the Bhagwan's therapists [67]. In 1984, some followers of the Bhagwan cult were involved in deliberate poisonings of hundreds of people in Oregon [68]. In recent years, Dr. Gordon has been a collaborator of parapsychologists and Jungian mystics within the Transpersonal Psychology movement [69]. He has also become a leading advocate of alien abduction therapy and research, serving on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Program for Extraordinary Experience Research (PEER), an organization established explicitly by Harvard psychiatrist John Mack, MD, to research alien abductions [70]. Inexplicably, Dr. Gordon also involved himself in the Oklahoma bombing trial of Terry Nichols. As a psychiatrist for the defense, he submitted a letter to the court stating that Nichols was not violent and should not receive a long prison term. Dr. Gordon's opinion was apparently based entirely on letters received from Nichols [71]. Dr. Gordon is a fellow of the John E. Fetzer Institute, which funded the dishonest 1993 report published in The New England Journal of Medicine by David Eisenberg and others that claimed that a third of Americans were using \"alternative\" methods by including such categories as relaxation, imagery, massage, commercial weight loss and self-help groups. One of Gordon's many books, Manifesto For A New Medicine, is in the millenarian genre of others that predict the transformation of medical care along New Age lines. In 1994, Dr. Gordon was appointed the very first chairman of the Office of Alternative Medicine's Program Advisory Council and was a co-director of OAM's Mind-Body Panel. Through his Center for Mind-Body Medicine, which has also been funded by the Fetzer Institute, Dr. Gordon has organized a series of Comprehensive Cancer Care Conferences that have gathered together dozens of questionable practitioners as an effective lobbying force for aberrant cancer care [72]. Dr. Gordon has previous experience as a Presidential advisor, having directed a nationwide study of alternative mental health services for President Carter's Commission on Mental Health in the 1970s. In his brief 1978 report, in addition to noncontroversial mental health programs such as rape support and runaway programs, Gordon recommends the spiritual midwifery practices of \"The Farm,\" a psychedelic commune, reiterates his support for R. D. Laing's and Carl Jung's theory of psychosis as creativity (R. D. Laing is directly quoted referring to schizophrenia as \"a voyage into self of a potentially revolutionary nature\") and offers praise for the then budding holistic medicine industry [73]. Other members of the White House Commission include Dr. Jonas, whose exploits have already been considered and: - George M. Bernier, Jr. MD is the only prominent academic on the Commission. He is the former Dean of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, left that position in 1995 to accept the positions of Dean and Vice President for academic affairs at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas. He currently is the Vice President of Education at UTMB. Since his arrival, UTMB's program in Alternative and Integrative Healthcare has blossomed, offering mystical and paranormal healing techniques including Therapeutic Touch and recommending to the public the mystical writings of Deepak Chopra, Andrew Weil, Larry Dossey and Carolyn Myss [74]. The program is directed by Victor S. Sierpina, MD, a nationally prominent CAM activist [75]. and includes a faculty member, Mary Anne Hanley, RN, who is a former student of Theosophist mystic Dolores Krieger, the founder of TT [76]. Dr. Bernier was instrumental in establishing a \"Spirituality in Clinical Care\" course of study for medical and nursing students funded by the National Institute for Healthcare Research (NIHR), an evangelical Christian group associated with the John Templeton Foundation [77]. The course bibliography features not only the writings of NIHR head David B. Larson but also Healing Words by Larry Dossey MD [78], in which it is claimed that paranormal effects have been demonstrated on bacteria, sweetpeas and mice as well as humans. - Effie Poy Yew Chow, PhD, is an acupuncturist, \"Qigong Grandmaster\" and founder of the East-West Academy of Healing Arts in San Francisco [79]. Her PhD is in Education. She has connections with the NCCAM going back to the OAM when she was appointed to its first Ad Hoc Advisory Committee [80]. \"Qi\" is the traditional Chinese counterpart to psychic \"life energy,\" the \"flow\" of which is said to be modified by acupuncture and which advocates claim can be \"absorbed\" and \"emitted.\" Chow claims to cure illness and boost the psychic powers of individuals by transmitting \"qi\" to them by telephone [81]. She employs typical stage magic tricks to \"prove\" the existence of \"qi\" energy. At the Commission's September 8, 2000 meeting in San Francisco, she said that \"what we're here for\" is \"recommending policies to making a big change in the system.\" [82] Transcripts of the Commission's work show that she has a long relationship with fellow Commissioner David Bresler and with its chair Dr. Gordon [83]. - \"Dr.\" David Bresler is also an acupuncturist. Like Chow, he is not a physician but holds a PhD. He is credited by the White House with being \"one of the first contemporary American scientists to study and research acupuncture, guided imagery, and other mind/body approaches.\" But the only two published clinical trials of which he is a co-author involve acupuncture, one of which showed no benefit in asthma. Another article purported to show scientifically that the whole human body is mapped out on the ear [84]. Guided imagery is based on almost as fanciful a notion, namely, that imagining physical changes in the body can effect those changes. Thus, cancer patients are taught to imagine their tumors being destroyed. Yet there is no published evidence \u2014 zero \u2014 in support of guided imagery affording more than psychological benefits for any condition, or that such effects are superior to those offered by other interventions. Nevertheless, Bresler founded the Academy of Guided Imagery (AGI) [85]. in 1989 which now sells 150-hour \"certification\" training programs at $3495 each. Among other things, such training involves \"dialoguing with symptoms.\" Another practice is to call up an \"inner advisor,\" a kind of spirit guide that may take the form of an animal. AGI promotes audio tapes to the general public. One for \"Arthritis and Lupus,\" for example, is \"[d]esigned to help reduce rheumatoid joint inflammation, soreness, excess fluid; replace eroded bone and joint tissue; help calm overactive, misguided immune cells.\" Another, for diabetic patients, is \"[d]esigned to encourage insulin sensitivity at the cellular level; help the body metabolize food in a steady, balanced way; help repair damage to organs and tissue.\" Still another, for victims of atherosclerosis, is alleged \"to help the body restore weary heart tissue; improve cholesterol and blood pressure; dissolve arterial plaque; [and] maintain healthy arteries.\" There is no evidence that AGI's tapes exert such miraculous effects. Bresler is a credulous believer in other nonsense as well. To an Iranian faith-healer, one Ostad Hadi Parvarandeh who claimed to be in touch with the \"collective consciousness\" of the universe, Bresler wrote: \"Ostad, I have been quite amazed by the progress shown by several of my patients who have seen you, and feel that it is time to launch some serious scientific studies to carefully document whatever is happening [86]. - Xiao Ming Tian is a Beijing-trained physician-acupuncturist who runs the Academy of Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine at his Wildwood Acupuncture Center in Bethesda. There he offers acupuncture, acupressure, Chinese herbal remedies, and Qi-Gong \"treatments,\" qi-gong being the vitalistic \"energy\" medicine of the prescientific Orient [87]. Tian has been a consultant to the NIH and was involved in producing the NIH Consensus Statement on Acupuncture that deliberately excluded critics of the method. The biographical information on Tian released by the White House indicates that he received government funding for \"many research projects on the use of Chinese herbal medicine and dietary supplements,\" none of which appears to have resulted in published work available by search on PUBMED. According to the White House press release, Tian is also \"President of the American Association of Chinese Medicine,\" as well as \"Honorary Director of the China Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Vice President of The International Academy of Medical Qigong, both in Beijing, China.\" - Veronica Gutierrez is a chiropractor from Lake Stevens, Washington. She is extremely active in the World Chiropractic Alliance (WCA), sitting on its Board of Directors, serving as its Director of Programs in Public Policy, and chairing its Health Care Reform Committee and its Council on Women's Health [88]. The WCA is an organization of \"straight\" chiropractors whose allegiance is to the original doctrine of disease causation taught by chiropractic's founder, D.D. Palmer, that spinal \"subluxations\" interfere with the \"flow\" of supernatural \"innate intelligence\" and can only be corrected by chiropractic \"adjustments.\" The WCA promotes chiropractic as the ideal form of medical care for infants and children as well as for adults. It opposes routine immunizations [89]. while dismissing medical science \u2014 as \"alternative medicine\" guru Andrew Weil MD does \u2014 as good only for \"trauma care and crisis management.\" In fact, Gutierrez herself fumes that, \"If anyone still believes medical science reigns supreme, they now must say 'The Emperor wears no clothes.'\" [90] Ms. Gutierrez is also connected with the Council for Chiropractic Practice (CCP). The CCP advocates home births, chiropractic manipulation of infants for the prevention of SIDS, of children for pediatric ear infections, and lifelong \"adjustments\" for an alleged epidemic of \"subluxations\" for everyone. The CCP also claims that EEG's, surface EMG's, and thermography, as well as other unproven methods can demonstrate chiropractic \"subluxations.\" [91] Ms. Gutierrez's presence on the commission is the result of lobbying by the WCA [92], which boasts of growing political influence and maintains a presence in Washington D.C. for the purpose of exerting political influence [93]. Indeed, immediately upon Gutierrez's appointment to the commission, the WCA began mobilizing its members to testify at its meetings [94]. - Donald W. Warren is a dentist from Clinton, Arkansas who treats temporomandibular joint dysfunction and other ailments with \"dental cranial osteopathy.\" In addition, he practices \"contact reflex analysis,\" which is claimed to be a method of \"analyzing the body's structural, physical, and nutritional needs.\" This is done by pressing on various mystical points on the body while pushing and pulling on the patient's arm (or other body part). Alterations in muscle strength \u2014 the \"reflexes\" \u2014 are claimed to \"quickly and accurately uncover the root\" of any health problem. Details concerning this astonishingly irrational form of medical quackery, including the locations of the \"Master Allergy Reflexes,\" the \"Metabolic Reflex,\" and additional \"reflexes\" especially relevant for the flu season, can be found at http://www.crahealth.org (click on \"CRA and Syndromes\"). On this same website can be found Dr. Warren lengthy statement of enthusiastic belief in CRA as well as the healing powers of \"God, chiropractic, CRA-based nutrition, dentistry and osteopathy.\" [95] Dr. Warren's personal convictions concerning this curious application of stage magic are forthright, if delusional: \"In my 16 years of practicing as a dentist, I have never known any method of analysis, technique, treatment or nutritional presentation so helpful, so exact, so satisfying, and have such a high level of quality as Contact Reflex Analysis.\" [96] - Linnea Larson is a Social Worker who is Associate Director of an \"Integrative Medicine\" department of West Suburban Health Care in Oak Park, IL. She also practices Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) as well as other irrational forms of \"mind-body\" therapy [97]. Serious problems exist with respect to EMDR and its lack of validation [98]. Larson was among the faculty listed at a program in Santa Fe in October of 2000 entitled \"Integrating Culture and Complementary Medicine: Challenges to the Biomedical Paradigm.\" [99] This conference assailed the scientific biopsychosocial model of medicine from the perspective of postmodern cultural relativism. Another notable speaker was Victor Sierpina MD, the head of the University of Texas Medical Branch's alternative medicine program which has been nurtured by fellow commissioner George M. Bernier MD. - Joseph E. Pizzorno, Jr, is an \"ND\" Doctor of Naturopathy, a naturopathic midwife and the founding president of Bastyr University, a naturopathic school that was chosen by the National Center of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) to be a Center for Alternative Medicine Research. He continues to act as an advisor to the school. Pizzorno is on the \"Management Team\" of The Dove Health Alliance [100], the mission of which is \"to discover, validate, and disseminate the principles and practices of energy medicine on personal, societal and environmental levels.\" [101] Pizzorno promotes a variety of unproven and irrational claims as fact. For example, he asserts that \"The hypothesis that gluten is a causative factor in the development of schizophrenia is substantiated by epidemiological, clinical and experimental studies.\" [102] He believes that food allergies cause multiple sclerosis [103]. He says the dandelion is useful for the \"sluggish, congested, toxic liver.\" [104] He promotes kava for \"stress.\" [105] And, like Deepak Chopra, he is a proponent of the mystico-herbal practice of Ayurveda [106]. Pizzorno also believes in the bizarre \"blood type diet\" advocated by fellow naturopathic \"doctor\" Peter D'Adamo, a Bastyr graduate. Pizzorno calls it \"The Medical Breakthrough For The Ages,\" saying that it will change the practice of medicine for centuries to come and lauds D'Adamo as \"an outstanding example of the best Bastyr has to offer.\" [107] - Joseph J. Fins, MD is Director of Medical Ethics at the Cornell campus of New York Presbyterian Hospital and holds academic positions at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University. He appears to be one of only three Commission members who have not clearly established reputations as ideological advocates for irrational claims and practices. His primary interests to date have been in palliative and hospice care for the dying [108]. In his comments during meetings of the commission, Dr. Fins has betrayed more serious prejudices, saying that he was \"really struck by this notion of ancestral medicine.\" He also seems unaware of the fact that concern for the family and spiritual dimensions of patients is well within the biopsychosocial model of scientific medicine in speaking of the \"failings of allopathic medical education.\" [109] - George DeVries runs at least three different companies. American Specialty Health and Wellness sells supplements over the Internet. American Specialty Health Plans [110] and American Specialty Networks \"provide chiropractic and acupuncture managed-care services.\" Acupuncture Today calls him the \"president of one of the largest acupuncture HMOs in the nation.\" [111] DeVries'efforts seem to be devoted primarily to getting employers and insurance companies, and, it would now appear, taxpayers, to pay for unproven methods. - Sister Charlotte Rose Kerr is an acupuncturist who is said to \"integrate\" theology into her methods. This might be assumed to be Catholicism but she has taught and practiced at the Tai Sophia Institute in Columbia, Maryland since 1977 at which Qi Gong, homeopathy, food supplementation, shiatzu and \"zero balancing\" are offered [112]. Links from the Tai Sophia website include IONS, the Esalen Institute, and the Omega Institute for Holistic Studies, another New Age organization. An announcement praising Sister Kerr's appointment to commission is posted on the Tai Sophia website [113] in which it is stated that \"Dr. James S. Gordon, Director of the Center for Mind/Body Medicine in Washington, D.C., [is] a long-time friend of the Tai Sophia Institute.\" At the Commission's Draft Interim Report meeting on July 3rd of 2001, Sister Kerr said: \" we believe the body/mind has the right and power to heal itself. healing is being in right relationship with self, others, community and the cosmos.\" [114] . . . . - Dean Ornish, MD earned his reputation with his work on the management of atherosclerosis with extremely low fat vegetarian diets. But like predecessor Nathan Pritikin, Ornish's recommendations are not suitable for most people. The few small studies claimed to prove the worth of his work have also been questioned on scientific grounds. Dr. Richard Pasternak, director of preventive cardiology at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, has said that \"There's virtually no science\" in them [117]. Dr. Robert Eckel, Professor of Medicine at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver and chairman of the nutrition committee of the American Heart Association also expressed serious doubts, as did Dr. Frank Sacks, a nutrition professor at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Sacks, in trying to replicate Dr. Ornish's results with a grant from the NIH, found that it was difficult to recruit patients and few could stick with the program [118]. Fortunately, Ornish's program has been superseded by more effective forms of managing elevated blood cholesterol and the discovery of other treatable risk factors. Like Dr. Gordon, Dr. Ornish began as a devotee of an Indian guru, Sri Swami Satchidananda. He became involved with the Swami after dropping out of Rice University in 1972 in a state of suicidal depression. It was apparently during this time that he formed his beliefs about the importance of a vegetarian diet with no added salt, sugar or fat and no caffeine combined with meditation, yoga and exercise. Dr. Ornish has enthusiastically endorsed many irresponsible unscientific works by others including Larry Dossey's Healing Words [119], and psychic Judith Orloff's Second Sight\" [120]. Dr. Gordon's own Center for Mind-Body Medicine features an endorsement by Ornish as well [121]. - William Fair, MD is former Chief of Urology Services at Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. He is a disciple of Dr. Ornish to whom he turned to help with colon cancer in the mid-1990s. Dr. Fair now credits dietary measures for his own cure and claims that similar approaches are effective with prostate cancer. At the first meeting of the Commission he stated that \"I honestly think we need to change medicine. I think we need to bring these complementary and alternative medicine techniques into the practice of every doctor.\" [122] Dr. Fair is currently chairman of the clinical advisory board of Health, LLC, through which he and his son promote alternative medicine [123]. He has also worked closely with the commission chair, Dr. Gordon, in putting on a series of conferences promoting alternative medicine for cancer [124] and is on the board of Gordon's Center for Mind-Body Medicine. Drs. Fair and Gordon also sit on the editorial board of Larry Dossey's Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine which regularly features articles on paranormal healing as well as bioenergetics and shamanism. - Thomas Chappell is a businessman with a degree from Harvard Divinity School. He runs Tom's of Maine, a dietary supplement company [125] as well as a management consulting firm in Colorado called the Saltwater Institute [126]. His supplement company makes typical unsubstantiated claims to promote its products such as that Ginseng \"revitalizes an active life-style\" and that Echinacea \"supports the immune system.\" [127] - Conchita M. Paz, MD, of Las Cruces, NM is a family practitioner who appears to be interested in cultural issues in medicine. She is a member of the National Hispanic Medical Association . - Buford Rolin has been the Health Administrator of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians since 1984. He is also a member of the Alabama Public Health Advisory Board and former chairman of the National Indian Health Board (NIHB). Mr. Rolin's primary interest has understandably been with the medically undeserved communities of native Americans. But the NIHB has endorsed Indian Health Service funding for \"traditional healing,\" apparently in the belief that this form of \"holistic\" care is a more realistic expectation for native Americans [128]. Mr. Rolin has voiced similar opinions [129]. - Julia R. Scott, RN, is the President of the National Black Women's Health Project, has been active on behalf of the Children's Defense Fund and has served as an NIH consultant on African-American health issues. The appointment of the last three members of the commission appears to be a cynical attempt to enlist the support of racial minorities in the cause of legitimizing irrational and aberrant medical claims and practices. This should be seen in the context of the ideological beliefs of other commission members, including its Chair, in the notion that science is little more than a tool of cultural domination and oppression. It is a shameful attempt to dissuade groups that are in the greatest need of accessible and equitable medical treatment to be satisfied, instead, with something less than the standards of science and reason. That this recurrent theme in the \"alternative medicine\" movement could appeal to a cynical interest in cost-saving at the expense of the lives and health of the nation's elderly is particularly worrisome [130]..Former Colorado Governor Richard Lamm's assertion that Americans have \"a duty to die and get out of the way with all of our machines and artificial hearts and everything else like that\" is not one with which all Americans disagree [131]. Completely absent from the WHCCAMP are any individuals whose concern is primarily for sound science, evidence-based medicine, and the protection of the public from health fraud. It is all the more surprising given the ready availability of many individuals who have established reputations as scholars of the subject of unproven, disproven and irrational methods often subsumed under the heading of \"alternative\" and \"complementary\" medicine. That the commission was created for the purpose of advocacy is also shown by the fact that its Executive Director and Secretary are also ideological proponents of \"alternative medicine.\" The former is Stephen C. Groft, who began as the acting director of OAM at its inception. The commission's Executive Secretary, Michele Chang, is a massage therapist who has worked for Senator Tom Harkin and says that she \"help[ed] with the conception of this Commission.\" At the WHCCAMP's first meeting she expressed her belief that there is a \"need to consider hearing from people who are practicing CAM modalities in secret\" but who \"are afraid that they are going to be closed down once the authorities become involved.\" [132] Conclusion The objections of the Honorable Congressman Burton to the nature and substance of the September 10 hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging are misplaced, misinformed, and unfair. All of those who spoke at the hearing, with the exception of Mr. Braswell and Mr. Tepper, were plainly interested in drawing the distinction between health-related claims that are based in facts and reason and those that clearly are not. This is the very same standard that was applied in the 1984 Pepper Report and from which current government policies have strayed dangerously. Not only are there serious problems with DSHEA but these problems exist in a context of political institutions such as the NCCAM and the WHCCAMP that are at best tolerant of quackery and at worst tend to directly or indirectly promote it. The controversy over these and related issues is not fundamentally one between personalities or philosophies but between reason and unreason in the sphere of the marketplace for health-related products and services. I wish to acknowledge and thank consumer activist E. Patrick Curry, for his collaboration on previous presentation of some of the material included in this response [133]. - Quackery: A $10 Billion Scandal: A Report by The Chairman of The Subcommittee on Health and Long-Term Care of the Select Committee on Aging, US House of Representatives, 98th Congress, USGPO 1984. - Eisenberg DM, Kessler RC, Foster C, Norlock FE, Calkins DR, Delbanco TL. \"Unconventional medicine in the United States.

He writes that he is \"not against fighting in groups\" and that the Rajneesh's followers \"believed that the violent confrontations \u2014 even their own bad bruises and broken limbs \u2014 had been a small and necessary price to pay for the freedom they now felt from past traumas and inhibitions, for the perspective they had gained on their own sadism and masochism.\" (c) On page 114, Dr. Gordon defends the Rajneesh' s collection of 93 Rolls Royces at the Oregon commune. \"In displaying his wealth so conspicuously, in ignoring accusations of selfishness,\" writes Dr. Gordon, \"Rajneesh was mocking the preconceptions of his New World audience, who \u2014 particularly the Christians \u2014 tended to associate spirituality with poverty, modesty, charity.\" (d) On page 148, Dr. Gordon defends the Rajneesh's recruitment and exploitation of the homeless and mentally ill, saying that the guru's \"program, in spite of its inequities and exploitativeness, does seem a great improvement over what these men have been offered in city and state mental hospitals and shelters. Those who stay are functioning, useful members of a loving community. They seem to have a real opportunity to change.\" (e) In his concluding paragraphs on page 245, Dr. Gordon writes exults in Rajneesh's \"vision of a loving, cooperative community dedicated to the creation of new men and women living in harmony with their own nature and the natural world. For me, it is not finally a question of agreeing or disagreeing with Rajneesh, of praising or condemning him or his sannyasins. It is, rather, a matter of learning from him and them, of appreciating his remarkable talents and gifts and recognizing his perverse uses of them, of seeing myself in him and his sannyasins, of using his extraordinary story and strange, as yet unfinished journey as a mirror for my own.\" - Torok TJ, Tauxe RV, Wise RP, Livengood JR, R, KA, Skeels MR, JM, Foster LR., \"A large community outbreak of salmonellosis caused by intentional contamination of restaurant salad bars.\" JAMA 1997 Aug 6;278(5):389-95. - He is listed as a plenary speaker at a 1999 \"Life After Death\" conference of parapsychologists and mystics at http://www.pathwaysminneapolis.org/lifedeath.html.

David Satcher, M.D. The Surgeon General of the United States Office of the Surgeon General 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 18-66 Rockville, MD 20857 Dear As academic psychologists and other . . . professionals who specialize in the scientific evaluation of controversial and currently unsubstantiated treatments, we are writing to express our profound concerns regarding the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy. As you know, this Commission was appointed by former President William Jefferson Clinton in March of 2000 to generate recommendations regarding future governmental policies on alternative and complementary medical practices. It is our understanding that this commission will issue its formal policy recommendations sometime later this year. Before outlining our serious reservations concerning the current status of this commission, we should note that the opinions expressed in this letter are solely those of the co-signers, and do not necessarily represent the opinions of the institutions with which they are associated. We believe that our opinions are extremely well founded and are consistent with the overwhelming body of scientific evidence regarding complementary and alternative approaches to both medical and psychological disorders. At the outset, it is crucial to point out that many alternative and complementary medical practices, such as homeopathy and chelation therapy, have repeatedly been shown to be ineffective in controlled studies by independent investigators. Still other alternative and complementary medical practices have the potential to cause physical harm, and to lead individuals to forgo treatments that have been demonstrated to be effective. As a consequence, many of these practices subject the American public to considerable physical, financial, and emotional risk. For these reasons, we believe it is essential that the United States government receive the best available scientific information regarding the current status of alternative and complementary medical practices from objective researchers who have no personal or financial stake in their efficacy. Such researchers must remain open to the possibility that some presently unsubstantiated medical practices may ultimately be shown to be effective. But these researchers also must subject all novel and still largely untested claims to careful and impartial scrutiny using the best scientific methods available. It is with these considerations in mind that we wish to raise serious concerns regarding the present composition of the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy. In particular, we are deeply troubled that the Chairperson of this important commission is Dr. James S. Gordon, a psychiatrist whose expressed views regarding alternative and complementary medicine practices bespeak an extreme absence of objectivity regarding the scientific status of these practices. Moreover, Dr. Gordon's background, writings, and public statements point to a clear lack of commitment to a scientific approach regarding the causes and treatment of medical and psychological disorders. For example, shortly following his graduation from Harvard Medical School in 1967, Dr. Gordon became a major proponent of the theories of Scottish psychiatrist R.D. Laing, a fringe thinker who argued that schizophrenia and other severely disabling mental conditions not are illnesses at all, but rather \"voyages of discovery.\" According to Laing, schizophrenia is a perfectly sane response to an insane world. Gordon himself asserted that schizophrenia and related mental disorders \"did not seem like diseases to me\" and are \"instead like different ways of being.\" Indeed, during his psychiatric residency Dr. Gordon attempted to put a number of Laing's therapeutic recommendations into place on a psychiatric unit in New York City. It is crucial to emphasize that Dr. Gordon has apparently persisted in these views despite the fact that they have been convincingly discredited by psychiatric and psychological researchers. For example, an enormous body of well controlled data demonstrates that schizophrenia is a substantially genetic condition characterized by numerous pathological changes in brain structure and functioning. In addition, there is no evidence that it is scientifically useful to schizophrenia as a voyage of discovery, a view about which Dr. Gordon spoke approvingly in a 1996 interview. This view implies that administering medications to individuals with schizophrenia will often interfere with their natural healing processes. To the contrary, the research data suggest that the longer schizophrenics go untreated without medication the more their condition is likely to deteriorate. Importantly, in a 1978 report to President Carter (\"The President's Commission on Mental Health of the Special Study of Alternative Mental Health Services\"), Dr. Gordon spoke positively of a number of alternative and almost entirely untested approaches to the causes and treatment of schizophrenia. For example, in this report Dr. Gordon asserted that \"there is no reason, 'scientific' or otherwise (quotation marks in original), why a neurochemical level of analysis should be more likely to lead to the biological basis or correlates of schizophrenia than say, an analysis undertaken at the level of energy balance in the acupuncture meridians.\" This statement is deeply troubling. Even 23 years ago, there was plentiful research evidence indicating that schizophrenia was accompanied by various biochemical (e.g., neurotransmitter) abnormalities. In contrast, there has never been the slightest evidence for the existence of acupuncture meridians. It is highly scientifically improper, in our view, to imply that most or all perspectives to psychological disorders are equally valid or worthy of attention. Instead, responsible scientists must carefully ascertain the relative merits of different research approaches based on the best available evidence and offer recommendations accordingly. Personal opinions or preferences must not be allowed to come into play. Dr. Gordon's other views and endeavors are equally unsettling. For a period of time in the 1970s and 1980s, he experimented with many scientifically unsubstantiated psychotherapies, including \"rebirthing,\" as well as treatments involving various levels of violent interaction. The dangerous nature of these treatments was very recently illustrated by the tragic suffocation death of Candace Newmaker, a 10 year old girl who was subjected to rebirthing by two psychotherapists in Colorado. \"Rebirthing\" is an entirely unsubstantiated treatment that relies on the premise - which has been repeatedly refuted by well controlled scientific studies - that adults who are hypnotized or placed in an altered state of consciousness can psychologically \"relive\" the trauma of birth and free themselves of the emotional pain produced by this trauma. Dr. Gordon spoke positively of his own rebirthing experience in a book. For many years, Dr. Gordon was closely associated with (and apparently became a devotee of) the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, who endorsed such practices as Dynamic Meditation (which involved intense dancing during altered states of consciousness), primal scream therapy, and rebirthing therapy. Dr. Gordon's book, \"The Golden Guru\" contains many highly complimentary passages concerning the Bhagwan Rajneesh and his therapeutic methods. As you may know, Rajneesh took over the town of Antelope, Oregon, and bused in and exploited a number of homeless individuals in order to do so (he was finally deported for immigration fraud). Incidentally, this book also contains passages praising the therapeutic practices of [Dr. Wilhelm Reich](reich.html), a pseudoscientific theorist who propounded the use of \"Orgone Therapy\" to treat psychological and medical disorders. According to Reich, \"orgone,\" which purportedly is the energy released during the human orgasm, is the vital \"life force.\" Proponents of Reichian therapies attempt to amass orgone energy in accumulators (e.g., orgone boxes) and to heal human ailments by ensuring that affected individuals receive sufficient amounts of orgone. Dr. Gordon has continued to speak at Orgonometry conferences, which are devoted largely to discussing the scientifically discredited work of Reich and his followers. Dr. Gordon's association with the Reichians raises serious questions concerning not only his scientific judgment but also his theoretical views regarding the causes of mental and physical disorders. More recently, Dr. Gordon has defended many of the therapeutic practices of Dr. John Mack of Harvard University, a psychiatrist who advocates using hypnosis and other highly suggestive therapeutic techniques to recover purported memories of alien abductions in his clients. Mack and his followers believe that these clients' alien abduction reports are very likely to be genuine. Nevertheless, Mack and his followers neglect the substantial body of psychological research demonstrating that memory is a highly fallible and reconstructive process that can be readily shaped by therapeutic suggestion. According to Dr. Gordon, Mack \"has performed a valuable and brave service, enlarging the domain and generosity of the psychiatric enterprise.\" Moreover, Dr. Gordon is a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of John Mack's Program for Extraordinary Research (PEER), which was established primarily to investigate alien abduction reports and related phenomena. Dr. Gordon has also endorsed a number of pseudoscientific and otherwise scientifically questionable notions that are popular among \"postmodern\" thinkers. For example, in a 1996 interview he maintained that \"we're just beginning to think about how to apply some of the ways of looking at things that come out of the new physics, such as understanding the influence of the observer on the observed.\" In fact, it is widely accepted among experts in quantum physics (e.g., Dr. Victor Stenger of the University of Hawaii) that the influence of the observer on the observed (known in physics as the \"Heisenberg Uncertainly Principle\") is relevant only at the subatomic level and bears no relevance whatsoever to phenomena (e.g., medical practices) above this level. Dr. Gordon's assertion reflects a widespread and fundamental misunderstanding of modern physics and its application to alternative medicine. It is also worth noting that Dr. Gordon testified as a defense expert witness on behalf of convicted mass murderer Terry Nichols in the Oklahoma City bombing trial. During this trial, Dr. Gordon recommended that Nichols be given only a short prison sentence. According to Dr. Gordon, his reading of letters by and about Nichols convinced him that Nichols was not violent and did not pose a serious threat to society. Dr. Gordon wrote that \"it is extremely difficult to believe that he intentionally took anyone's life or indeed took part in any activity which might conceivably take someone's life.\" Aside from the fact that Dr. Gordon's views regarding Nichols are markedly at odds with those of most other experts, it is disconcerting that he rendered a strong judgment concerning Nichols' potential for violence largely on the basis of written correspondence by and about Nichols. It is well established that mental health professionals are often quite poor at predicting violence (and nonviolence), even from standardized and well researched psychological tests. These findings make Dr. Gordon's psychological inferences from written correspondence all the more problematic from a scientific perspective. Perhaps most troublesome of all from the standpoint of his Chairpersonship of the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy is the fact that [Dr. Gordon has been a longstanding and highly partial advocate for untested and unsubstantiated medical practices.](gordon2.html) We agree with Dr. Gordon that certain novel treatment practices particularly that show scientific promise be subjected to open-minded investigation. But it is essential that individuals not draw conclusions regarding the efficacy of these practices on the basis of scientifically inadequate data. In many cases, it is evident that Dr. Gordon has done just that. For example, Dr. Gordon has referred to traditional Chinese medicine as \"a whole other system of medicine operating under completely different laws.\" In fact, there is no scientific evidence for this extreme claim, which implies that Chinese and Western medicine are governed by entirely different sets of scientific principles. Moreover, this statement neglects the fact that the efficacy of many traditional Chinese medical practices (e.g., acupuncture) has been called into question in many carefully controlled studies. Dr. Gordon has also defended the efficacy of homeopathy, a bizarre medical treatment that has repeatedly been shown to be ineffective in controlled investigations. In addition, Dr. Gordon has been a leader in fostering various alternative and still unsubstantiated medical treatments for cancer. Of course, scientists are entitled to their own opinions and interpretations of research data. But we are deeply troubled by the fact that Dr. Gordon's assertions regarding the efficacy of alternative and complementary medical practices often go well beyond the available scientific evidence, and in some cases run directly counter to such evidence. Finally, it is worth noting that to our knowledge, none of the other individuals on the White House Commission has expressed skepticism concerning the efficacy of alternative and complementary medical practices. Indeed, all of these individuals appear to be either active practitioners of alternative medical techniques (e.g., acupuncture, chiropractic, herbal remedies) or strong proponents of these techniques. Some have even been key lobbyists for alternative medical practices over the years. We acknowledge that the scientific status of some of these techniques (e.g., acupuncture, certain herbal medicines) remains controversial, and we certainly encourage further controlled investigation of such techniques when merited. Nevertheless, we are disturbed that the commission does not include a single scientific expert on alternative and complementary medical practices who has expressed informed doubts regarding the efficacy of these practices. This void is especially disconcerting given that such doubts (most of which are founded on carefully collected scientific data) are widespread in the informed scientific community. For example, none of the more than 45 editorial board members of the prestigious Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine (edited by Dr. Wallace Sampson of Stanford University) was invited to serve on this commission, despite the fact that this journal is the only peer-reviewed scientific publication that provides objective scrutiny of alternative and complementary medical practices. This journal has been endorsed by the Council for Scientific Medicine, which consists of numerous distinguished scientists, including five Nobel Laureates. Many of the editorial board members of this journal have published extensively on the efficacy of novel and largely untested medical practices and would have provided an invaluable perspective on the current scientific status of alternative and complementary medicine. Their absence renders it very unlikely that the policy recommendations of the White House commission will be objective, informed by research, or representative of the broader views of the informed scientific community. In sum, it is clear that Dr. Gordon has a lengthy history of endorsing a wide variety of psychological and medical practices that are either poorly substantiated or entirely unsubstantiated, and that he has a strong commitment to the efficacy of alternative and complementary medical practices even in the absence of adequate evidence. Moreover, the other members of the presidential commission similarly appear to have a longstanding personal (and in some cases, financial) commitment to the continued viability of alternative and complementary medical practices. It is therefore crucial to emphasize that this commission cannot be regarded as an impartial scientific panel. We therefore urge you in the strongest possible terms to call for the disbanding of this commission as it presently stands and to reconstitute it with a group of respected researchers and practitioners (including recognized scientific experts in medicine, physiology, biochemistry, nutrition, psychology, research design, and statistical methods) who can provide you and others in the federal government with objective and well informed policy recommendations concerning alternative and complementary medical practices. We believe that such experts should ideally have neither a direct personal nor financial investment in the efficacy of alternative and complementary medical practices, and be capable of providing open-minded and balanced scientific evaluations of these practices. We would be more than happy to provide you and others with a list of suggested commission members upon request. We thank you very much in advance for your attention to this matter, which we hope you will agree bears extremely important implications for the health and welfare of the American public. We look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely, Scott O.

United States Senate Special Committee on Aging Hearing on Swindlers, Hucksters and Snake Oil Salesmen: The Hype and Hope of Marketing Anti-Aging Products to Seniors September 10, 2001 Prepared Statement of the Federal Trade Commission I. Introduction Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am Howard Beales, Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, of the Federal Trade Commission. I am pleased to have this opportunity to provide information concerning the Commission's efforts to ensure the truthfulness and accuracy of marketing for health products and services. My comments will focus in particular on our work to combat fraudulent claims for products marketed as treatments or cures for serious diseases, many of which are particularly prevalent among elder citizens, including cancer, heart disease, and arthritis. [ (1)](#N_1_) The mission of the Federal Trade Commission is to prevent unfair competition and to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the marketplace. As part of this mission, the Commission has a longstanding and active program to combat fraudulent and deceptive advertising claims for health products. [ (2)](#N_2_) Since the fall of 1997, the Commission has filed twenty-seven cases against companies using false or deceptive claims to market unproven products that allegedly cure such ailments as cancer, arthritis, sleep apnea, impotence, osteoporosis, or circulatory diseases. Despite these efforts, unfounded or exaggerated health claims remain common in the marketplace, and combating health fraud remains one of the Commission's top priorities. Cooperative law enforcement that focuses on marketers who promote products that jeopardize the health of users as well as those who make unfounded therapeutic claims for serious diseases is a keystone of that effort. Although aggressive law enforcement is crucial, the best consumer protection comes from preventing consumers from being deceived in the first instance. Thus, the Commission emphasizes consumer education to help consumers spot and avoid health fraud. Finally, we also work to provide businesses with the guidance necessary to avoid violating the law. We believe these efforts are important because health fraud often targets a very vulnerable segment of our population \u2014 those suffering from serious or incurable health conditions and diseases. The victims are often fearful and desperate. As one commentator observed, \"[I]t is difficult to explain, and often impossible to comprehend, the degree of suffering seen in some cancerous conditions, cases of arthritis, and certain nervous disorders.\" [ (3)](#N_3_) In such circumstances, therapeutic claims, even outrageous claims that ordinary consumers would dismiss as fraudulent, can be and are convincing enough to persuade consumers to purchase these products. In other circumstances, a number of factors, including lack of information and false beliefs about health and the causes of disease, may also contribute to a particular consumer's susceptibility to health fraud. [ (4)](#N_4_) II. Consumer Injury At the consumer level, the costs of these products and services range from a few dollars to tens of thousands of dollars for cancer treatments offered in foreign \"clinics.\" In most cases, these products and services are not covered by insurance. In addition to economic injury, some products and services can pose a serious health threat. The promise of worthless or unproven remedies can deter victims from seeking the best available treatments. In some instances, particularly in the area of cancer, marketers have even told victims that it is not necessary for them to seek conventional treatment. For example, one website for an unproven treatment told consumers: Does this mean you can cancel your date for surgery, radiation and chemotherapy? YES! After curing your cancer with this recipe it cannot come back. THIS IS NOT A TREATMENT FOR CANCER: IT IS A CURE! But if you do not wish to make your doctor angry, you could follow her or his wishes, too. Be careful not to lose ANY VITAL ANATOMICAL PARTS in surgery though, because you may need them later when you are healthy! [ (5)](#N_5_) In some patients, delaying treatment may worsen the condition. Deferred treatment is not the only risk, however; some products and services are themselves dangerous. This is a concern the Commission takes very seriously. Safety is a primary criterion the Commission uses in its case selection process, as illustrated by our recent cases against marketers of products containing comfrey, an herbal product that, when taken internally, can lead to serious liver damage. [ (6)](#N_6_) III. Law Enforcement The Federal Trade Commission, Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Postal Service, and state law enforcement and regulatory agencies all play a role in protecting consumers, especially seniors, from health fraud. Over the years, there has been a high degree of cooperation among these agencies, including the sharing of information and technical and scientific expertise as well as the coordination of law enforcement efforts. For example, to combat health fraud on the Internet, the Commission initiated Operation Cure.All, [ (7)](#N_7_) a comprehensive consumer and business education and law enforcement and regulatory initiative targeting deceptive and misleading Internet promotion of products and services as cures or treatments for serious diseases. In addition to the FTC, participants in Operation Cure.All include the Food and Drug Administration, [ (8)](#N_8_) several state attorneys general, and Health Canada. The initial phase of Operation Cure.All consisted of two Internet surfs [ (9)](#N_9_) conducted in 1997 and 1998. As a result of these surfs we found over 1600 sites world-wide making questionable claims for products marketed as treatments for heart disease, cancer, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. Of these, over 800 were located in North America, with the vast majority in the United States. To put these numbers in perspective, it took surfers only about 3 hours each to find these sites, which we believe represent only the tip of the iceberg. The results from these surfs were used to identify areas for targeted law enforcement, e.g., magnetic therapies, and, as discussed below, in our industry education efforts. This year, the Commission has filed eight cases as part of Operation Cure.All, targeting companies that market a variety of devices, herbal products, and other dietary supplements to treat or cure cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer's, diabetes and many other diseases. Among the products for which marketers made unsubstantiated health benefit claims were a DHEA hormonal supplement, St. John's Wort, various multi-herbal supplements, colloidal silver, comfrey, and a variety of electrical therapy devices. [ (10)](#N_10_) The following are illustrative of the kinds of claims that the Commission challenged in its Operation Cure.All cases this year: THIS IS NOT A TREATMENT FOR CANCER: IT IS A CURE! . . . It takes 5 days to kill the parasites that cause intestinal cancer. The cancer is then killed . . . . (herbal product) We cannot list all 650 diseases that colloidal silver is effective against but here is a list of some of the common ones: Common cold, stomach ulcers, acne, burns, shingles, arthritis, strep, tuberculosis . . .

The challenged products include Cat's Claw, [ (11)](#N_11_) shark cartilage, [ (12)](#N_12_) cetylmyristoleate (CMO), [ (13)](#N_13_) Essiac Tea, [ (14)](#N_14_) and magnetic therapies. [ (15)](#N_15_) In all these cases the companies made strong claims about treatments or cures for serious diseases with little or no evidence to support the claims. [ (16)](#N_16_) Other Commission initiatives include conducting Internet investigation training courses for more than 2000 individual law enforcement staff, including representatives of 20 countries, 30 states, and 22 federal agencies. The Commission also maintains a comprehensive consumer complaint data base, Consumer Sentinel. Complaints come into the system through telephone and mail inquiries to our Consumer Response Center as well as through our online complaint form at www.ftc.gov. Complaints are also forwarded to the system from many public and private partners. Complaint information in the system is available to over 300 law enforcement agencies. While the Internet Training Course and Consumer Sentinel cover many more areas than health fraud, these initiatives have contributed significantly to law enforcement efforts in the health area as well. For example, the Internet training we provide to health fraud investigators at federal and state agencies improves efficiency in conducting investigations of Internet companies marketing questionable products. In addition, Consumer Sentinel has become a valuable source of leads and other information about companies that may be engaged in deceptive marketing of health products. The FTC is committed to obtaining strong remedies that will adequately protect consumers against health fraud. As already noted, the provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act empower the Commission to prevent unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce [ (17)](#N_17_) and false advertisements for foods, drugs, devices, cosmetics and services. [ (18)](#N_18_) In addition to prohibiting false claims, these provisions require, in most cases, that marketing claims about the efficacy or safety of a health-related product or service must be supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence. [ (19)](#N_19_) In general, competent and reliable scientific evidence consists of tests, studies, or other scientific evidence that has been conducted and evaluated according to standards that experts in the field accept as accurate and reliable. [ (20)](#N_20_) Given the number of companies marketing health products and our limited resources, we cannot investigate and prosecute every possible case. Factors that are considered in case selection include (1) the safety of the product or service, (2) whether the product or service is being marketed as a treatment or cure for a serious disease or health condition, (3) the egregiousness of the claims, (4) the scope of the marketing and sales, and (5) the extent to which bringing a particular case will serve the Commission's industry compliance and consumer education mission. Enforcement actions can take one of two forms. The Commission can file an administrative action or it can file its action directly in federal district court. Federal district court actions are particularly appropriate where the case involves a potentially unsafe product, or when immediate injunctive relief is necessary to stop an ongoing deceptive advertising campaign or to preserve assets for consumer redress. In either case, the Commission may seek broad remedial relief. [ (21)](#N_21_) In addition to prohibiting specific deceptive product claims, Commission orders in the health area typically prohibit unsubstantiated claims for other foods, drugs, dietary supplements, devices or services. In cases where a company utilizes third party distributors, Commission orders often require the company to notify its distributors of the Commission's action and to monitor future advertising. Where appropriate, the Commission attempts to obtain the payment of consumer redress or, where redress is impractical, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains to the U.S. Treasury. Also, in appropriate cases, the Commission may order a company to undertake a specific consumer education program. For example, in the Commission's action against a company marketing a product known as Essiac Tea [ (22)](#N_22_) as a scientifically proven cancer cure, the Commission's consent order required that the company send notices to past purchasers advising them that there is no reliable evidence that Essiac Tea is effective against cancer. [ (23)](#N_23_) IV. Consumer and Business Education The Commission recognizes that the primary goal of consumer protection is to prevent consumers from being injured. For that reason, the Commission maintains a comprehensive consumer education program. Today we are releasing a publication produced with the FDA, called \"Miracle Health Claims: Add a Dose of Skepticism.\" This brochure provides specific information about the efficacy and safety of popular products as well as information about spotting and avoiding health fraud. Another brochure, \"Who Cares: Sources of Information About Health Care Products and Services,\" published jointly with the National Association of Attorneys General, informs consumers about where they can go for information about arthritis cures, alternative medicine, and other health issues, and where they can file complaints about health fraud. The Commission also works with other federal agencies, like the Administration on Aging, and organizations like the AARP, to get our health fraud messages to older audiences. The Commission also uses the Internet to distribute its consumer education messages. The Commission's Website, www.ftc.gov, provides links to reliable sources of health information, including www.healthfinder.gov, developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, and consumer education tips such as those found in \"Virtual Health Treatments Can Be Real World Deceptions.\" [ (24)](#N_24_) Our web-based consumer education material has received nearly 80,000 accesses since October 1, 2000. These materials are also available in printed form. In addition, the Commission maintains a number of \"teaser\" sites like \"Arthriticure,\" \"Virility Plus,\" and \"Nordicalite,\" which can be found using common search engines and are set up to mimic health fraud sites. When consumers attempt to order the products, however, they get a message that if the site were real, they could have been scammed. Then, most importantly, consumers are advised of the tip-offs that the site was a scam and where to turn for reliable information. The Commission's three health-related teaser sites have received over 20,000 accesses from October 1999 through August 2001. The Commission engages in an extensive industry education campaign. For example, in 1998 the Commission published \"Dietary Supplements: An Advertising Guide for Industry.\" [ (25)](#N_25_) This publication provides easy-to-understand explanations of advertising standards for the marketing of health products, along with many useful examples. In addition, Commission staff has sent more than a thousand email advisories to websites that are making questionable therapeutic claims. These emails alert website operators to the questionable nature of their claims and provide links to resources to help them determine whether they are in compliance with applicable law. Based on our random sampling of sites that have received these advisories, approximately 25% take some form of remedial action, either taking the website down or removing the questionable claims. V. Conclusion Health fraud poses a direct and immediate threat of both economic and physical injury to persons already suffering from serious conditions and diseases. The elderly are particularly vulnerable because of the high incidence of health-related problems in this age group. With thousands of marketers pushing worthless or unproven remedies, and limited enforcement resources, there is reason for concern. On the positive side, consumers now have more accurate, reliable health information available to them, through the Internet and other sources, than ever before, and consumer surveys show that consumers are using these resources in record numbers. [ (26)](#N_26_) Federal and state agencies, as well as many of our foreign counterparts, recognize the need to coordinate and share scarce resources in the battle against health fraud. As our past experience demonstrates, this cooperation is an absolutely essential ingredient of success. The Commission will continue its aggressive law enforcement and consumer and industry education program to combat health fraud, and to the extent possible, increase its efforts in this critical area of consumer protection.

William M. London, Ed.D., M.P.H.May 15, 2001Executive Order 13147 calls for the [White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy (WHCCAMP)](https://www.whccamp.hhs.gov/) make recommendations addressing: - The education and training of health care practitioners in complementary and alternative medicine - Coordinated research to increase knowledge about complementary and alternative medicine practices and products - The provision to health care professionals of reliable and useful information about complementary and alternative medicine that can be made readily accessible and understandable to the general public - Guidance for appropriate access to and delivery of complementary and alternative medicine In making these recommendations, the Committee should acknowledge that the term \"complementary and alternative medicine\" implies much more than the definition used by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM): Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) covers a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. Generally, it is defined as those treatments and healthcare practices not taught widely in medical schools, not generally used in hospitals, and not usually reimbursed by medical insurance companies. The NCCAM definition is similar to the definition of \"unconventional medicine\" in a paper by Eisenberg and others [1] who reported on a national telephone survey of adult use of methods such as relaxation techniques, massage, exercise, prayer, self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous, imagery, biofeedback, and hypnosis. This study is often misrepresented as evidence that Americans are so interested in \"complementary and alternative medicine\" that NIH funding of CAM research is needed. (The terms \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" have far more promotional value than \"unconventional.\") Many of the methods included in the Eisenberg survey are either self-care or medically establshed methods that don't fit the study's definition of \"unconventional medicine.\" [2] The study actually showed that few survey respondents used commercially promoted methods such as acupuncture, homeopathy, energy healing, megavitamin therapy, and herbal medicine. Strangely, 30% of respondents who reported use of chiropractic didn't actually see a provider of chiropractic services. The NCCAM definition has little to do with the meaning of \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" in everyday language. These words imply that such methods actually complement or serve as sensible alternatives to other methods. The \"CAM\" marketplace is dominated by products, services, and regimens that do not. The American Heritage Dictionary defines complementary as: \"1. Forming or serving as a complement; completing. 2. Supplying mutual needs or offsetting mutual lacks.\" [3] Thus, referring to something as \"complementary medicine\" implies that it completes what some other medicine does not do on its own. However, just because someone refers to a method as complementary does not mean it actually complements anything else. If a method doesn't add to the outcome, it isn't complementary; it just adds to the cost. The American Heritage Dictionary defines alternative, when used as an adjective, as: \" 1. Allowing or necessitating a choice between two or more things. 2.a Existing outside traditional or established institutions or systems: an alternative lifestyle. b. Espousing or reflecting values that are different from those of the establishment.\" [3] The NCCAM definition suggests that \"alternative\" medicine is \"alternative\" in the sense of dictionary definition 2a. To some extent this is a fair characterization. However, \"alternative\" medicine is largely \"traditional\" itself and it has become its own \"establishment.\" Promoters of \"alternative\" medicine often promote traditional systems for alleged healing. Strong reliance on tradition is one of \"alternative\" medicine's biggest problems. Tradition-bound systems resist change. Their proponents selectively seek affirming evidence while rejecting disconfirming evidence and criticism. Proponents adhere to orthodoxy. On the other hand, science/evidence-based medicine is iconoclastic. Medical practice changes over time because scientifically-based practitioners learn to discard unsafe and ineffective methods. Traditionalists and true-believers cling to unsafe and ineffective methods as a matter of faith. I am unaware of any efforts by the National Institutes of Health Office of Alternative Medicine and later by the NCCAM to identify methods promoted as \"complementary\" or \"alternative\" that should be discarded. In order to provide reliable and useful information about complementary and alternative medicine, it is necessary to identify methods that should be discarded. I ask that the WHCCAMP make recommendations to accomplish this based on [principles of consumer protection and science](http://www.ncahf.org/about/mission.html) and recognition that [health fraud and quackery](http://www.ncahf.org/pp/definitions.html) constitute a public health scandal [4]. Much has been written about the \"medical establishment\" and its institutions and systems of delivering medical care. I think it is fair to note the existence of the \"'alternative' medical establishment\" which includes promoters, practitioners, organizations, foundations, retail businesses, wholesale businesses, politicians, the NCCAM, the WHCCAMP, and other institutions. The \"alternative\" medical establishment has even extended its reach into medical schools, other professional schools, colleges and universities, hospitals, and insurance plans. In so doing, alternativists have increased their power and, in effect, invalidated the NCCAM definition of complementary and alternative medicine. \"Alternative\" medicine is alternative in the sense of espousing or reflecting different values. The science-based medical establishment insists that health products and services be proved safe and effective\u2014with proponents bearing the burden of proof\u2014before promoting them. Alternativists often value hunches, clinical impressions, subjectivity, anecdotes, reports of best cases, legends, and so-called \"other ways of knowing,\" as sufficient \"proof\" to justify their promotional efforts. They tend not to value efforts to identify sources of clinical illusions and to reduce the problems of systematic and nonsystematic errors leading to faulty conclusions. Alternativists also value different credentials and standards of practice than most consumers expect. Many \"alternative\" credentials and standards of practice do not require professional accountability. I believe the WHCCAMP should note that this poses a problem for consumers. Drs. Marcia Angell and Jerome P. Kassirer, former editors of The New England Journal of Medicine, have pointed out: There cannot be two kinds of medicine-conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work [5]. Medical alternatives can be classified into three categories: genuine, experimental, and questionable [6,7]. - Genuine alternatives are backed by sufficient scientific evidence showing that the potential for benefit exceeds the potential for harm to specific populations for specific intended purposes. Genuine alternatives or genuinely complementary methods tend not to require the justification of labels like \"alternative\" or \"complementary\" in marketing. - Experimental methods are unproven, but are studied responsibly with extra care given to the rights of study participants and protecting participants from exploitation. It is reasonable for taxpayers to expect that their financial support will be used to study promising rather than implausible methods. But many taxpayers don't realize that alternativists do not espouse such values. Alternativists have no problem with taxpayers supporting the study of implausible methods. Remarkably, NCCAM is currently funding a study of an \"alternative\" protocol involving enzyme supplements and coffee enemas in the treatment of people with pancreatic cancer. The protocol is implausible [8]. It had been used on a Hodgkin's lymphoma patient who died. Last year a jury found that the patient was 51% responsible for her harm. The jury said that the patient was \"negligent\" in letting the physician treat her and for foregoing the standard care her original doctors had recommended [9]. - Questionable methods are those fthat are unproven but lack a scientifically plausible rationale. Some of these are still promoted even after repeated failures in scientific testing. Such methods aren't just unproven; they are\u2014for practical purposes\u2014disproved. The most implausible questionable methods are legitimately described as dubious or quack. According to a usage dictionary, \"alternative\" may suggest adequacy for some purpose and/or \"compulsion to choose.\" [10] Questionable and dubious methods are not adequate for their intended purpose, and consumers should not feel compelled to choose them. It is unavoidable for responsible healthcare professionals to use unproven methods in caring for patients. We will never have all the answers to address the complexities of human health problems. Clinical judgment and innovation will always be an essential part of the art of delivering healthcare. However, responsible healthcare professionals do not promote the use of unproven methods. The promotion of unproven methods through such methods as advertising and publicity is objectionable because it is deceptive. It violates the ethical principles of veracity and nonmaleficence (the general duty of \"first do no harm\"). Consumers want alternatives, but they want genuine alternatives. Many promoters of \"alternative\" medicine exploit this by calling for \"freedom of choice\" for consumers. What these promoters really want is freedom from accountability to consumers. They support the concept of caveat emptor (\"let the buyer beware\") and oppose the concept of caveat vendor (\"let the seller beware\"). Caveat vendor provides a rationale for consumer protection laws to compensate for the disadvantageous bargaining position consumers have in the health marketplace. It is difficult to evaluate claims for health products and services. People are especially vulnerable to mistaken perception and deception when they feel threats to their well-being and are desperate for answers. It is important to protect consumers from both intentional and unintentional deception. And it is also important to preserve true freedom of choice. Thus, the motto of The National Council Against Health Fraud is: \"Enhancing freedom of choice through reliable information.\" Recommendations NCAHF urges the Commission to enhance freedom of choice by recognizing the need to identify health fraud and quackery masquerading as \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" medicine. In line with the four topics you are charged to address: - The education and training of health care practitioners must address principles of consumer protection and science. Health care practitioners must learn to recognize quackery/health fraud associated with \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" medicine. - WHCCAMP should promote opportunities for research to increase knowledge about quackery/health fraud as a public-health problem associated with the \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" medicine marketplace [4]. - WHCCAMP should declare that it is misleading to use the terms \"complementary\" and \"alternative\" to refer to questionable, unproven, and disproved methods. Reliable and useful information must be grounded in principles of consumer protection and science. - WHCCAMP should recommend that appropriate access and delivery of healthcare be based on principles of consumer protection and science.

HEPATORENAL FAILURE FOLLOWS HYDRAZINE SULFATE CANCER TREATMENT A 55-year old man with maxillary sinus carcinoma died of hepatorenal failure after taking, for the first four months following diagnosis, hydrazine sulfate according a regimen recommended on the Kathy Keeton website. He had previously declined standard therapies. A report of the case was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine (133:877-880;2000). The authors noted that analogues of hydrazine sulfate were previously established as toxic to the liver. Hydrazine sulfate is an unapproved cancer treatment that has been popularized by the Syracuse Cancer Research Institute. On December 14th, nine days following the publication date of the case report, the Institute's website continued to claim: \"Hydrazine sulfate has been demonstrated to produce only few and transient side effects.\" Kathy Keeton was vice-chairman and chief operating officer of Penthouse magazine, which has promoted hydrazine sulfate and other dubious cancer treatments. Appearing on The Montel Williams Show, Keeton attributed her survival beyond six weeks after receiving a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer to taking hydrazine sulfate. Several months later, on September 19, 1997 she died during surgery to remove tumors from her upper digestive system. See: <http://www.acsh.org/publications/priorities/1004/hydrazine.html>. COMMUNITY WATER FLUORIDATION EFFORTS SUCCESSFUL IN NOVEMBER'S ELECTIONS Michael W. Easley, DDS, MPH, Director National Center for Fluoridation Policy & Research Although it is the only public health measure routinely subjected to voter referenda, community water fluoridation was adopted successfully in a number of American cities during the November 2000 general election. In spite of intense opposition by small groups of local antifluoride zealots, cities approving fluoridation included San Antonio, Texas; Las Vegas-Clark County, Nevada; Salt City-County, Leavenworth, Kansas; and North Attleboro, Massachusetts. The total population that will be served by fluoridated water systems as a result of the election is estimated to be 3,957,079. Despite the significant efforts of health professionals, pubic health officials, and community groups, fluoridation efforts were temporarily stymied by election losses in Spokane, Washington, and 13 other smaller communities. The total population that will be denied the benefits of fluoridation because of the election losses is estimated to be 366,347. Community water fluoridation was recently featured in the Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health in America as the safest, most effective, and most cost-effective public health measure to prevent dental decay in all Americans and to reduce the oral health disparities experienced by some segments of American society. In addition, it recently was termed one of the Ten Greatest Public Health Achievements in the Twentieth Century by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. PROBE INVESTIGATES GONZALEZ CANCER TREATMENT A special double issue (Nov. 1-Dec. 1, 2000) of PROBE, veteran science writer David Zimmerman's monthly newsletter on science, media, policy and health, focuses primarily on Nicholas James Gonzalez, MD, who promotes dubious methods of cancer management including the use of a radionics device for hair testing, animal gland extracts, coffee enemas, diet, and dietary supplements. PROBE discusses findings about Dr. Gonzalez by the Office of Professional Medical Conduct of the New York State Department of Health, successful plaintiffs against Dr. Gonzalez in lawsuits, assessments of his methods, his supporters, and National Cancer Institute funding to study his methods.

HEALTH REPORTING BY 60 MINUTES REFEREED In a study by the American Council on Science and Health, each of 97 obtainable transcripts of health stories that aired from 1978 to 1995 on CBS Television's 60 Minutes was reviewed and evaluated for accuracy of reporting by three or more experts. Errors of inattention to evidence and of imprudence were common. Reporting accuracy was judged only fair, on average. Among the segments receiving the best evaluation scores were: a 1994 segment that debunked \"facilitated communication\" for autism; a 1991 segment that refuted Scientology's objections to Prozac; reports about pharmaceutical companies mishandling information about adverse effects of drugs in 1982 (Selacryn) and 1983 (Oraflex); and a 1978 segment that exposed a dubious cancer clinic in Murietta Hot Springs, California. Poor scores were given to segments that promoted: removal of mercury-amalgam fillings to treat outlook and visualization to cure cancer (1987); cartilage\" against \"cell therapy,\" human growth hormone for longevity (1993).

Technology 7:539-552;2000.] PRIVATE REGULATION MODELS PROPOSED FOR HERBAL PRODUCTS Writing in the August/September 2000 issue of Policy Review (pp. 15-25), Hoover Institution fellow Henry I. Miller, M.D. and freelance writer David Longtin make a strong case in their paper \"Death by Dietary Supplement\" that in the U.S. \"[r]egulation of the herbal supplement industry is so lax, and some of the products so dangerous, that a public health catastrophe seems inevitable.\" The Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act of 1994 virtually exempted herbal remedies from government oversight. Although FDA can restrict the sale of an herbal product when it receives well-documented reports of health problems associated with it, the congressional General Accounting Office has found inadequacy in the FDA's monitoring system and adverse reaction reports. While manufacturers of drug products are required to report side effects, the makers of herbal products make adverse reaction reports voluntarily. \"This is rather like the IRS asking taxpayers to voluntarily provide information on their own underreporting of income\" explain Miller and Longtin. While critical of the current laissez-faire regulatory model of herbal products sold as supplements in the U.S., the authors are also critical of FDA having \"an absolute monopoly over regulation, a situation that can produce delays, increased expense, and inefficiency.\" Dr. Miller, who was an FDA official from 1979 to 1994, has an insider's view of how \"[g]overnment monopolies can foster abuses by bureaucrats.\" Thus, Miller and Longtin examine other models of regulation: (1) a private monopoly organization to review and certify new products; (2) supplement manufacturers contracting with competing private entities to perform certifications; (3) voluntary contracting with a not-for-profit organization similar to Underwriter's Laboratories (UL) and its competitors which certify more than 16,500 types of products, many of which, like mechanical parts, present inherent hazards; (4) a nonprofit organization modeled after the California Crop Improvement Association which provides a voluntary quality assurance program for plant seeds sold to agricultural producers or growers; (5) the European Union model of medical device regulation which relies on competing private entities to perform certifications and which has resulted in approval of devices that \"takes perhaps half as long as it does in the United Statesapparently without compromising safety;\" Miller & Longtin suggest that voluntary, extragovernmental regulation can give consumers informed choice among competing products and give makers of herbal products who participate protection against liability. Miller discusses the UL model applied to additional products regulated by FDA in his book To America's Health: A Proposal to Reform the Food and Drug Administration (Stanford CA: Hoover Institution Press, 2000.) Comment: Dr. Miller told NCAHF President William M. London that in proposing extragovernmental regulation based on the UL model, he calls for higher standards of product quality than the model proposed in NCAHF's 1995 Position Paper on Herbal Remedies. ADVERSE EVENTS DUE TO TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE Based on responses by eleven hundred medical and nonmedical practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Australia to a survey mailed by the Health Insurance Commission of the Australian Federal Government, a team of researchers led by Alan Bensoussan of the Research Unit for Complementary Medicine at the University of Western Sydney estimated that \"approximately 1 adverse occurred for every 8 to 9 months of full-time [TCM] practice, or for every 633 consultations.\" Most (79%) adverse events reported were attributable to acupuncture. The most common adverse events associated with acupuncture were fainting during treatment, increased pain, nausea/vomiting. Less common were pneumothorax and convulsions. Adverse events attributed to Chinese Herbal Medicine, possibly interacting with pharmaceutical drugs, included 19 deaths reported by practitioners. More common were gastrointestinal symptoms, fainting and dizziness, significant skin reactions, central nervous system effects, liver toxicity, and kidney toxicity. The 30% response rate of medical practitioners and 50% response rate for nonmedical practitioners sent surveys are limitations of the study. The authors acknowledge that practitioners may have underreported adverse events. [Risks associated with the practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Archives of Family Medicine 9:1071-1078;2000.] Comment: The authors \"hypothesize that TCM causes significantly fewer adverse reactions than does Western medicine [pharmaceuticals].\" The hypothesis may be reasonable, but it is problematic in this paper because the authors did not attempt to weigh potential for harm against potential for benefit from different types of treatments or consider possible differences in severity of medical problems of patients with different medical conditions. In a recent review of acupuncture studies on pain, which is the major complaint of U.S. consumers who seek acupuncture, researchers from the Complementary Medicine Program at the University of Maryland School of Medicine concluded that \"there is limited evidence that acupuncture is more effective than no treatment for chronic pain; and inconclusive evidence that acupuncture is more effective than placebo, sham acupuncture or standard care.\" [Berman EJ, Hadhazy VA, Jadad AR et al. Is acupuncture effective for the treatment of chronic pain? A systematic areview. Pain 86(3):217-225;2000.] CHRISTIAN BROS. AGREE TO STOP SELLING LAETRILE Christian Brothers Contracting Corporation of Whitestone, New York and its president, Jason Vale, signed a consent decree entered in November 2000 to stop manufacturing, processing, and distributing its amygdalin products referred to as Laetrile, Vitamin B-17, or apricot kernels. The company's Web site had made unsubstantiated claims for the products in curing, mitigating, treating, and preventing cancer. (See FDA Talk Paper T00-62, November 17, 2000). In 1999 a US magistrate found that Christian Brothers and Vale unlawfully used America Online's network and trademark in sending unsolicited bulk e-mails promoting sales of apple and apricot seeds as anticancer agents. The ruling entitled AOL to recover damages of $631,585. [See 98 Civ 8959 (DAB)(HPB) at http://www.nylj.com/links/aol.html.] SPLENDID DEVICE (AKA \"BLACK BOX\") QUACKERY - Title: Quack! Tales of Medical Fraud from the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices. - Author: Bob McCoy - Publisher: Santa Monica Press, 2000. 240 pp. $19.95. - Reviewed by William Jarvis. Most readers will immediately recognize the name of Bob McCoy, curator of the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices which is located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. McCoy, a natural-born story teller, has combined his extensive historical knowledge of medical devices with his pleasing narrative style and has written the best book I have ever seen on the fascinating field of black box quackery. The book contains numerous reprints of original advertisements for the devices, plus current photos posed by McCoy and his helpers-as McCoy states on the cover, it is \"Profusely Illustrated\" (an example of McCoy's penchant for showmanship). McCoy's book both entertains and educates its readers as it provides insight into the nature of quackery itself and then explores different kinds of devices: mechanical, magnetic, electrical, radionic, radium, rays, psychological, sensory, for beauty and for sexual enhancement. Reading about quack devices historically has the disarming quality of making the quackery seem blatantly obvious and the people involved seem silly, when it was not so easy for many people to tell the difference at the time the events were taking place. The reality that people can still be fooled by the seeming logic and rationale that attends the promotion of black box devices is attested to by the fact that many of the theories behind the old time devices have been revived in the name of alternative medicine and similar devices are being sold today. For instance, I regularly see ads for an electro-muscle stimulator (EMS) device on television that promises great \"abs\" and shows a model hooked up to electrodes and her tummy muscles twitching with each electrical jolt. As McCoy reports, EMS devices have been prosecuted by the FDA as recently as in 1999, yet the ads continue. EMS devices are not the only quack devices to have a contemporary manifestation. Other dubious devices that flourish today include magnets for health purposes, radionics devices, lights that allege to benefit health, violet ray producers, negative ion generators, penis enlargers, and many more. Readers with common sense abilities should learn how to spot a contemporary quack device as they learn how people have been fooled in the past-and recognize that the same promotions are being aimed at the same human vulnerabilities today. One of quackery's age-old ploys is to encourage \"open-mindedness\" toward off-beat ideas. My retort has long been to warn of \"empty-mindedness\"-which means to have failed to learn from history. McCoy's book provides the substance that people need to fill the mental voids to which quacks continue to appeal. This splendid book belongs in the library of every health-conscious consumer. ALTERNATIVE HEALTH PRACTITIONERS ENDORSE NEW NATURAL HEALTH LABOR ORGANIZATION The largest network of Complementary and Alternative Medicine practitioners in America announces they have formed a strategic association with the newly formed International Union for the Natural Health, Complementary & Alternative Medicine Professions (IUNH). The 20,000 members of The National Complementary & Alternative Medicine Network (N-CAM) will be encouraged to support the goals and mission of IUNH. N-CAM has contracts with a wide range of practitioners. These practitioners contract with N-CAM to provide reduced fees for their clients. These consist of large organizations that want to offer alternative benefits to their employees or members. In return IUNH will encourage union members to support the practices of N-CAM members. It will also give IUNH members access to N-CAM's provider network. \"Associate memberships\" will be offered to N-CAM. IUNH previously announced their agreement with the International Massage Association in June and the creation of the IUNH Look for the Union Doctor (TM) program in July. (International Union for the Natural Health. This story appeared on http://www.individual.com August 10, 2000) DUTCH QUACKBUSTER CHOOSES BIGGEST QUACKS OF THE 20TH CENTURY Cornelis Moerman (1893-1988), who invented an anti-cancer diet based on experiments with carrier-pigeons, heads the list of the twenty biggest quacks of the twentieth century announced by C. N. M. Renckens, the chair of VtdK, the Dutch Union Against Quackery at an antiquackery symposium in Utrecht on October 14th. The names on Renckens's list are familiar to Dutch people, but are not well known in the United States. See: http://www.dds.nl/~antikwak/. The Moerman diet consisted of fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, non-refined cereals, leguminous plants and dairy-products. Moerman also recommended supplemental vitamins and minerals. Forbidden were meat, fish, fowl, coffee, tea and water. Moerman, a doctor who practiced nearly 50 years, was very aggressive against his colleagues. He organized support in the parliament. The late Linus Pauling praised him. Moerman received 30 out of a maximum 37 points in the scoring system Dr. Renckens used for rating quackiness. The scoring system illustrates the complexity of quackery as societal and public health problem. Criteria and Scoring Used by Dr. Renckens (Slightly Modified) A. Level of education - uneducated: 1 point - low or intermediate level of education: 2 points - medically trained (= doctor or pharmacist): 3 points B. Character of the therapy - pseudo-medical (e.g. phytotherapy): 1 point - paranormal: 2 points - supernatural/absurd: 3 points C. Inflicted damage - only financial: 1 point - physical harm: 2 points - mortal victims: 3 points D. Aggression against regular medicine - absent: 1 point - moderate: 2 points - strong: 3 points E. Duration of career - less than 5 years: 1 point - 5-10 years: 2 points - 10-20 years: 3 points - more than 20 years: 4 points F. Material gains - could live from the practice: 1 point - earned well: 2 points - became rich: 3 points G. Condemnations - Doctors: - no disciplinary measures: 1 point - disciplinary measures taken: 2 points - suspensions and/or punished - by criminal law-authorities: 3 points - Non-doctors - some: 1 point - frequent: 2 points - imprisonment: 3 points H. Indications for swindling - none: 1 point - perhaps: 2 points - certainly: 3 points I. Publications - none: 1 point - few: 2 points - many: 3 points J. Followers - none: 1 point - few (e.g. only relatives): 2 points - many: 3 points K. Support from politicians - no: 1 point - maybe: 2 points - certainly: 3 points L. Degree of impudence of the claims - cure of innocent problems (e.g. baldness): 1 point - cure of serious disease (e.g. atherosclerosis): 2 points - cure of fatal diseases (e.g. cancer): 3 points Comments by Dr. Renckens Some of the second thoughts others and I had were as follows. - Regarding criterion E: this is advantageous for retired quacks, who completed their career. Still-active quacks having started only recently can never score the 4 points. It is also advantageous for quacks that have become old and continued for a long time. - Regarding criterion G: It is not always publicly known when a doctor has had a disciplinary punishment by the GMC, which until recently acted behind closed doors. The nondoctors, condemned by the judge of the criminal law, have always been more in the spotlight and here have an 'advantage' over the doctors. - Regarding criterion H: we have actually always tried to keep the intention of practitioners out of our definition of quackery as it is hardly possible to make sure if they have been honest in their propaganda. It might be better to delete this criterion.

The Internet is a powerful tool both for promoting quackery and for exposing it. I'll begin by telling you all about the important work of Dr. John Renner, who became president of our National Council Against Health Fraud in 1998 after serving as a member of our Board of Directors since the mid-1980s. When Dr. Renner died on September 2, 2000, following emergency heart surgery, we lost one of our most dedicated and influential advocates for patients and opponents of medical renegades and rascals. (\"Medical renegades and rascals\" is how he sometimes referred to the promoters of health misinformation, fraud, and quackery.) Dr. Renner's expertise was in the field of family and community medicine. He found a number of ways to reach out to families and communities. For example he debunked quack claims as a columnist for a daily newspaper, The Kansas City Star. His book, Health Smarts, is a collection of his columns. He also started the Consumer Health Information Research Institute, which served as a resource for consumers, reporters, and health insurers. I don't think anyone else ever devoted as much in the way of personal financial resources to fighting quackery as John Renner did. He once said that he spent more than $300,000, including money from his retirement accounts [1]. Dr. Renner was special in how generous he was with his time. He was responsive to patients who called him with questions about a wide range of alleged healing methods. He appeared on numerous radio and television programs. He led reporters through so-called \"health food\" stores and \"holistic health\" shows, to expose the different types of quackery on display. He also posed as a patient and visited suspected quacks in order to gather evidence of health fraud and abuse. As recently noted by Dr. William Jarvis, the founding president of The National Council Against Health Fraud: One of [John's} greatest ruses was to disguise himself as a vulnerable invalid (bandaged head and body in a wheelchair) and to attend 'Natural Health Conventions,' which are really showplaces for marketing quackery. John would roll up to premier quacks and engage them in conversation. He once completely fooled the King of the Quacks. A circle of devotees was talking on the floor with John in the midst of the action. When the Quack King put his hand on John's shoulder during the conversation, John, in a voice that denoted great adulation, stated 'You touched me! You are the first doctor who has touched me! Thank you! Thank you!' The adulation flattered the Quack King and raised his immediate status to a notch above his competitors. Although obviously ambivalent about having more contact with this rather strange patient, he straightened up to strut the superiority John had just conferred upon him [1] On another occasion, at a \"Natural Health Convention,\" after John's wheelchair attendant left him, two quacks got into a fight over who was going to fleece him first. As Dr. Renner told a San Diego Union reporter: One was into colonics and wanted to give me an enema; the other was a garlic salesman. They never even asked what I had. Later I told people I had a yeast infection. One guy wanted to draw my blood. He offered a 'show special': $900 worth of tests for only $600. All he wanted was my Medicare number.\" [2] (Medicare is the federal health insurance program in the United States for persons 65 years of age of older and for certain disabled younger persons.) In recent years, Dr. Renner visited health shows of various types that operate in cyberspace. He was unsurpassed in spending time on the Internet evaluating the accuracy of health-related Web sites. As part of his job as chief medical officer of [Health Scout](http://www.healthscout.com/), he wrote a weekly website review column called \"Stars and Stinkers.\" He gave four stars to the best sites and four stinkers to the worst. It was important to Dr. Renner to strive for fairness in his reviews. He made sure he rated each site in terms of predefined criteria: credibility, readability, navigability, usefulness, and quality of links. He didn't want his biases to affect the ratings. Once he gave a good evaluation to the Web site of an organization that he and I both thought was too sympathetic to quacks. Although he didn't support the organization's work, he also recognized that the organization was careful to avoid posting health misinformation. According to Dr. Renner's criteria, the site deserved a positive rating. By adhering to his rating criteria, Dr. Renner maintained the credibility that he built over many years as a leader in the field of patient education. As Dr. Jarvis wrote: \"When John Renner's big heart stopped . . . America lost a national treasure.\" I think if Dr. Renner could have made it here, he would appreciate as much as I do something that is special about talking to Dutch people about quackery. It has to do with English word origins. It turns out that every American activist against quackery knows at least one Dutch word very well. I think you know what word I'm referring to. My dictionary of English word origins states that there are two words 'quack.' [3] One, of course, denotes the call of a duck (\"quack, quack\") and originated as an imitation of the sound of itself. The other word 'quack' helps me to focus my feelings of outrage and I hope it does the same for you. My dictionary says it was borrowed from the early modern Dutch word quacksalver, a compound formed from quacken meaning 'chatter' or 'prattle' and salf, the Dutch relative of the English salve. The dictionary says that quacksalver etymologically denoted 'someone who prattles on or boasts about the efficacy of his remedies.' I have no problem with anyone prattling on or boasting about the efficacy of remedies when there is sufficient scientific evidence to support the claims of efficacy. And I don't object to the use of unproven treatments per se as part of the art of caring, comfort, and cure, particularly when there is a rational basis for using the unproven treatments. But the word \"quack\" is fitting for those who can't present sufficient scientific evidence to back up their boasts about efficacy, especially in light of concerns about safety and the ethical principles of nonmaleficence (or first, do no harm) and veracity (or truth-telling). In the college textbook Consumer Health: A Guide to Intelligent Decisions, Dr. Jarvis wrote: Why should a critter as cute and harmless-looking as a duck be used to symbolize the vicious social menace of quackery? A vulture would seem to be more appropriate. But vultures actually wait until death occurs before engaging their targets. Thus, their conduct is too benign to symbolize quackery, which preys on the weak, the helpless, and the desperate. Other birds of prey behave more like that of quacks, but the bald eagle, which is a national symbol [in the United States], would not be suitable for derision. An ostrich might be appropriate, because of its reputation for hiding its head in the sand, thus symbolizing the denial often seen in both quacks and their victims [4] But Dr. Jarvis concludes that considering the origin of the word quack: \"The duck personifies quackery because it makes a lot of noise about nothing.\" [Note: the duck has not caught on as a symbol of quackery in Holland.] In 1984, a subcommittee of the United States House of Representatives Select Committee on Aging issued a report called Quackery: A $10 Billion Scandal [5], which recognized the noise made by quacks as a social menace. The report detailed numerous fraudulent endeavours including (a) clinics inside and outside the United States that provide bogus treatments for chronic and terminally ill patients using diet, drugs, and enemas for arthritis, cancer, heart disease, and other ailments; (b) foundations that encourage the use of unproven remedies; and (3) phony healers who use a religious healing image or claim powers generated by Satan or witchcraft. By 1991, our Congress lost sight of quackery both as a social menace and as a concept. It gave the methods promoted by quacks a new respectability. Largely due to the efforts of a Senator Tom Harkin, who believes taking bee pollen cured his hay fever [6] and who was influenced by Berkeley Bedell, a former congressman who believed that drinking milk from cow udders injected with his blood had caused symptoms of Lyme disease to disappear [7]. Congress mandated the creation of a so-called Office of Unconventional Medicine within the prestigious National Institutes of Health. In 1998 Congress passed legislation signed by President Clinton that transformed the Office into the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine with a $50 million budget and created a White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy. According to the National Center, \"CAM covers a broad range of healing philosophies (schools of thought), approaches, and therapies that mainstream Western (conventional) medicine does not commonly use, accept, study, understand, or make available.\" [8] This definition, of course, covers all the dubious treatments that the 1984 report associated with quackery. The advisory boards to the Office and National Center have included promoters of unproven methods referred to euphemistically as \"complementary and alternative.\" For almost ten years now, the United States government has provided funds for basic and applied research to study methods that fit the official definitions of \"complementary\" and \"alternative.\" However, it remains to be seen whether funded studies will demonstrate that any of these methods are valuable. Even if some eventually prove useful, that is unlikely to outweigh the publicity bonanza Congress has given to irrational methods. Remarkably, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine even has funds available for research on practices such as so-called \"energy healing,\" homeopathy, and therapeutic prayer, for which it acknowledges there is no plausible biomedical explanation of effect. The program that funds this research is called the Frontier Medicine Research Program [9]. Homeopathy is more than 200 years old, but our government calls it \"frontier medicine\" and worthy of funding. Meanwhile, I know of no federal funding program to support the study of quackery as a public health problem. The American Public Health Association has an interest group on \"Alternative & Complementary Health Practices,\" but none on combating quackery. A medical society has invited a graphologist to present a workshop at its business meeting in May on \"The Medical Implications and Uses of Handwriting Analysis.\" The program announcement indicated: \"Handwriting analysis is available for a $20 charge payable at the door.\" [10] In American universities, proponents of postmodernist doctrine, who reject the notion that scientific methods are needed to separate fact from fiction in healthcare, and who celebrate personal subjectivity, refer to pseudoscientific and superstitious approaches to healthcare as \"alternative\" and \"complementary.\" Many medical schools and other schools that train health professionals offers courses that take uncritical approaches to discussing methods of healing that allegedly involve manipulation of a mystical \"life force\" distinct from physical forces that operate according to the laws of chemistry and physics. One exception is Stanford University's medical school where Dr. Wallace Sampson, one of the founders of The National Council Against Health Fraud, has taught a course for many years on medical pseudoscience. Dr. Sampson is the editor-in-chief of [The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine](http://www.quackwatch.com/04ConsumerEducation/sram.html), the only journal I know that is devoted to skeptical inquiry about \"alternative\" medicine. The large, influential American Cancer Society has published science-based reports on more than 70 questionable methods of cancer management with help from its Committee on Questionable Methods. In the mid-1990s the committee's name changed to the Committee on Alternative and Complementary Methods, implying that such methods have earned legitimacy. Drs. Marcia Angell and Jerome P. Kassirer, former editors of The New England Journal of Medicine have pointed out: \"There cannot be two kinds of medicine-conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work.\" [11] A judgment that a treatment is efficacious depends on quality scientific evidence. Quacks are good at convincing people that such evidence exists when it doesn't or convincing people to accept substandard evidence. I have proposed that alternatives be classified into three categories: genuine, experimental, and questionable [12]. Genuine alternatives are backed by sufficient scientific evidence showing that the potential for benefit exceeds the potential for harm to specific populations. Experimental methods are unproven, but are studied responsibly with special care given to seeking informed consent from study participants and protecting them from exploitation. Questionable methods are those for which scientific evidence is insufficient to support the claims made by proponents. Perhaps there should be a fourth category of plausible alternatives for which it is not clear whether the proven benefits outweigh the risks when used as intended. Estrogen replacement therapy for postmenopausal women might belong in this fourth category. Everyone wants alternatives\u2014genuine alternatives. Quacks exploit this by calling for \"freedom of choice\" for consumers. What quacks really want is freedom from accountability to consumers. They support the concept of caveat emptor, \"let the buyer beware,\" but they have a problem with the concept of caveat vendor, \"let the seller beware.\" Caveat vendor provides a rationale for consumer protection laws to compensate for the disadvantageous bargaining position consumers have in the health marketplace. It is difficult to evaluate claims for health products and services. We are vulnerable to mistaken perception and deception especially when we feel threats to our well-being and when we are desperate for answers. It is important to protect consumers from both intentional and unintentional deception. And it is also important to preserve true freedom of choice. Thus, the motto of the National Council against Health Fraud is: \"Enhancing freedom of choice through reliable information.\" Most people who seek questionable alternatives also seek genuine alternatives when available. Thus, many quacks promote questionable alternatives as \"complementary\" methods The word \"complementary\" means \"serving to fill out or complete\" or \"mutually supplying each other's lack.\" But a method is genuinely complementary only if it adds to the outcome and not just to the overhead and other costs that get passed on to consumers or third-party payers. Scientific evidence is needed to demonstrate whether an alleged \"complementary\" method really adds to the outcome. Promoters of questionable complementary methods lack this evidence, but they like to take credit for any positive effects experienced by the patient. Many assign blame for any negative effects to the evidence-based treatments their patients take. The promotion of questionable complementary and alternative methods\u2014methods that supposedly treat the real, underlying causes of disease and unwellness\u2014is big business in the United States. - Telephone solicitations mislead consumers into buying alleged arthritis remedies, weight-loss plans, sexual aids, baldness cures, and other health and nutrition products in order to claim \"valuable\" prizes that turn out to be worthless. - Multilevel marketing schemes for dietary supplements, diet plans, homeopathic products, and other health-related products convince many consumers to become \"independent distributors\" who use the products and, in turn, become distributors to others. Dr. Stephen Barrett, the most famous opponent of quackery in the United States opertaes [MLM Watch](http://www.mlmwatch.org/), which reports on the activities of these operations. Dr. Barrett has examined promotional materials for more than 100 of these network marketing companies (as they are also known). Every one of them has made false and deceptive claims. The products that have motivational value such as multivitamins are invariably overpriced and usually not needed. Those promoted as remedies are either bogus, unproven, or intended for conditions that are unsuitable for self-medication. - Best-selling health books promote inaccurate information regarding health products and services. Some authors and other health hucksters have had their own radio and television programs. - So-called \"human interest stories\" in newspapers, magazines, and on broadcast news and \"infotainment\" programs often mislead consumers by presenting quackery uncritically. These stories emphasize testimonials by satisfied customers rather than scientific considerations. - Radio and television talk shows give frequent exposure to promoters of quackery, but limited opportunities for opponents of quackery to present their views. Opponents of quackery are used to having editors cut out most of their criticisms and having producers lie to them about how much time they would be given to speak. - Supermarkets, pharmacies, discount stores, and \"health food\" stores promote a wide range of nostrums as \"dietary supplements.\" A recent federal law permits claims of effects on body structure or function, but not claims of effects on disease states. The distinction the law makes is murky. Quacks have taken advantage. - Misleading claims for mail-order products are made in magazine and newspaper ads, direct mail offers, television commercials - And now we have the problem of uninvited e-mail. Such e-mail is called spam. When you get spam, you should never reply even to ask to have your name removed from the e-mail list. This will only confirm for the spammer that your address is active. You shouldn't trust Web sites that promise to remove your name from spam lists either. Spam costs recipients in terms of lost time, money, productivity, and equipment damage. It costs the e-mailers little to send millions of people advertisements for quackery. They need a small percent of recipients to reply in order to profit. A group that originated in the U.S. to oppose spam is called CAUCE, the [Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email](http://www.euro.cauce.org/). EuroCAUCE is its European branch. They cost nothing to join. On his award-winning [Quackwatch Web site](http://www.quackwatch.com/), Dr. Stephen Barrett describes how an overzealous promoter of apricot seeds for cancer was successfully sued after violating the membership agreement of the online service America Online by sending spam. He and and his company were penalized $631,585. I met the apricot seed pitchman three years ago when we were both scheduled to appear on a television show. I saw his medical records. He does have a kidney cancer and his doctor advised him to have the cancerous kidney removed. Instead he has turned to apricot pits and other methods he learned about in his church. Some Internet sites seduce unwary consumers with claims for \"miraculous\" health products; others make deceptive attacks against benign products and established public health measures. Consumers taken in by health scares on Web sites spread the scares to family, friends, and associates by e-mail. Here are three examples of influential health scares on the Internet: - Web sites have featured the headline: \"Canola Oil\" Deadly for the Human Body.\" - An Internet article claimed the artificial sweetener aspartame causes lupus, multiple sclerosis, and other diseases. That article misrepresented the views of reputable professional organizations. - Web sites have exaggerated and falsely claimed risks of various vaccinations. Dr. Ed Friedlander, a pathologist, looked at the references cited on several of these and has concluded that the references don't support the claims made. Dr. Friedlander discusses these misrepresentations on his own Web site and in a paper to be published in the next issue of The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine, the only journal devoted to skeptical inquiry about aberrant approaches to healthcare promoted as alternative. Dr. Friedlander's paper is part of a symposium that Dr. William Jarvis and I edited on \"'Alternative' Public Health Threats\"\u2014what many \"alternative\" medicine promoters misrepresent as widespread health problems. (The other papers in the symposium address community water fluoridation, amalgam dental fillings, multiple chemical sensitivity, and chiropractic subluxations-all of which are promoted by quacks to undermine people's confidence in regular health care.) There is enormous potential for using the Internet to fight quackery. Through Quackwatch, you can join a very active Health Fraud Discussion List to send and receive e-mail to participants. The National Council Against Health Fraud also offers [Consumer Health Digest](https://www.ncahf.org/digest/index.html) (a free electronic newsletter) in addition to its print newsletter for subscribers and council members. The electronic newsletter reports, in part, on news identified by participants in the Health Fraud Discussion List. We expect this new offering to help us attract new members and keep our old members. We need to inspire more members to get involved with our task forces on various special interest areas related to quackery. We need to start new task forces. I believe that, as we grow, we will get more favorable publicity for mitigating the harmful impact of quackery. Much of our success will depend on how effectively we promote the principles of consumer protection law and science by harnessing (a word that American quacks like to use to inspire their followers) the power of the Internet.

[Hide Full Content](#twenty-eight-thousand-six-hundred-twenty-eight) [NCAHF Fact Sheet on Naturopathy](https://quackwatch.org/ncahf/articles/j-n/naturo/) The term \"naturopathy\" was coined by John H. Scheel in 1895 in New York. Naturopath is an Anglicized version of the term physician coined by Hippocrates from the root word physikos \u2014 the Greek word for \"nature.\" This was to denote that \"every practitioner of medicine was to be skilled in Nature and must strive to know what man is in relation to food, drink, occupation and which effect each of these has upon the other.\" [1] Hippocrates meant to displace the idea that disease and healing were dispensed by the gods (i.e., supernatural forces).

The term \"naturopathy\" was coined by John H. Scheel in 1895 in New York. Naturopath is an Anglicized version of the term physician coined by Hippocrates from the root word physikos \u2014 the Greek word for \"nature.\" This was to denote that \"every practitioner of medicine was to be skilled in Nature and must strive to know what man is in relation to food, drink, occupation and which effect each of these has upon the other.\" [1] Hippocrates meant to displace the idea that disease and healing were dispensed by the gods (i.e., supernatural forces). [2] Naturopaths claim to be the \"true inheritors of the Hippocratic tradition in medicine,\" [3] but no link exists that would connect naturopathy to Hippocrates. Naturopathy has its roots in the Central European health spas such as that of Father Sebastian Kneipp's \"water cure.\" Kneipp's program was separate from the earlier American hydrotherapy practices based upon the ideas of Vincent Priessnitz. Priessnitz hydropaths rejected drugs, bleeding, blistering, cupping, etc., and emphasized prevention through healthy habits and self-care. Encouraging self-reliance worked against the establishment of a guild of practitioners, and these ideas were eventually incorporated into regular preventive medicine [4]. Kneipp water societies were established after the heyday of American hydrotherapy, but did draw upon the ideas of Priessnitz. They were also influenced by the popular ideas of Sylvester Graham, John Harvey Kellogg, MD, and others. A committee of Kneipp practitioners met in 1900 to broaden their practices to include all natural methods of healing. In 1902, German \"Dr.\" Benedict Lust (1872-1945) purchased the term \"naturopath\" from John Scheel, formed the Naturopathic Society of America, and disbanded the Kneipp Societies. He also founded the American School of Naturopathy in New York [5]. Lust listed ND, DO, DC, and MD after his name. His MD was alleged to be from a homeopathic and eclectic medical college, but on the witness stand he was apparently unable to prove that he had graduated. He claimed to have osteopathic licensure in New Jersey. He was convicted of practicing medicine without a license in New York [6]. Naturopathy is also considered by some to be an heir of the Thomsonian, eclectic, and homeopathic movements \u2014 all of which opposed medical doctors and science-based medicine. In 1903, the Supreme Court of North Carolina was first to legally recognize naturopathy as a separate and distinct healing profession. Ten states (AK, AZ, CT, FL, HI, MT, NH, NV, OR, WA) and the District of Columbia license naturopaths. Florida does not issue new licenses but grandfathered existing NDs in 1985. Based upon a controversial court ruling, Idaho permits NDs to practice as long as they don't prescribe drugs or engage in procedures specifically assigned by law to medical doctors. Utah issues no new licenses but allowed those who were in the process of obtaining licenses in 1981 (when the practice act expired) to obtain and practice with Oregon licenses. Beliefs and Practices Naturopathy's attention to prevention by lifestyle, self-care, and conservative healing methods appears on the surface to be much like Preventive Medicine, an established medical specialty. However, its jabs at the \"allopathic\" straw man is typical of anti-science practice guilds. Allopathy (allos \"opposite\" pathos \"suffering\") was devised by Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), a German physician who created homeopathy. Hahnemann rejected the harsh medical practices of the era which included bleeding, purging, vomiting and the administration of highly toxic drugs. These practices were based on the ancient Greek humoral theory which attributed disease to an imbalance of four humors (i.e., blood, phlegm, and black and yellow bile) and four bodily conditions (i.e, hot, cold, wet and dry) that corresponded to four elements (earth, air, fire, and water). Physicians attempted to balance the humors by treating symptoms with \"opposites.\" For instance, fever (hot) was believed due to excess blood because patients were flush; therefore, balance was sought by blood-letting in order to \"cool\" the patient. Although medicine never accepted the label of allopathy, antimedical groups continue to misrepresent physicians as allopaths who merely suppress the symptoms of disease rather than treat their true causes. This apparently is to make differences between standard and \"alternative\" medicine appear based upon conflicting ideologies rather than scientific pragmatism. Medical writers often refer to medical doctors as \"allopaths\" but their use of the term reflects an alternate definition of allopathy: \"a system of medical practice making use of all measures proved of value in treatment of disease.\" [7] This definition is inconsistent with the root words \"allos\" and \"pathos.\" The duplicity of the term aids those who wish to misrepresent medicine as ideologically allopathic, i.e., interested only in symptom suppression. The absurdity of this idea can be seen in the use of antibiotics, immunization, and other medical procedures that deal with the causal factors of disease. Nonmedical practitioners, including many NDs reject the idea that germs per se cause disease. They believe that vitalistic forces are ultimately responsible. Vitalism is \"a doctrine that the functions of a living organism are due to a vital principle distinct from physicochemical forces\" [8] \u2014 which denotes a paranormal are generally not only nonscientific, but antiscientific because they abhor the reductionism (v. holism), materialism (v. etherealism) and mechanistic (v. mystical) causal processes of science. Its belief in Vitalism (Vis Medicatrix Naturae) can be seen in its over-riding tendency to overstate the body's self-healing power, and the beneficence of \"natural\" remedies (eg, whole herbs alleged to be superior to drugs extracted from them). Orthodox medicine assumes that the world is chaotic, mechanistic. We believe in the Vital Force which has inherent organization, is intelligent and intelligible. Chiropractors have adjustments, Acupuncturists have needles, we have Vis Medicatrix Naturae. Our way is to research the mystery and beauty of the life force, in which we have faith. Our power and our responsibility is to bring the life force into the light [9]. Naturopathy is an ideologic, not a scientific, system. Science is a community characterized by competence, openmindedness, critical analysis, objectivity, reproducible results, and social responsibility. Ideological systems fall short in all of these important areas. Competence is the most important attribute of a health care provider. The practice of medicine is not a right but a privilege that should be granted only to highly competent and trustworthy individuals. Like airline pilots, licensed health care providers can hold the lives of strangers in their hands. In real life, things sometimes go wrong. When they do, people have a right to look for blame. Reasonable, responsible health care providers need to be protected from undeserved retribution. NDs lack medical competence. No ND school or practitioner has contributed to the body of scientific knowledge that guides health care worldwide. Among ideologists, an ability to verbalize the ideology and engage in \"conversational medicine\" generally substitutes for competence. Although they are fond of accusing their detractors of being closedminded, it is the minds of ideologists that are open only to evidence and ideas which support their views of reality. Ideologists do not engage in critical analysis, but seek to affirm their faiths by accentuating positive experiences and rationalizing negative outcomes. Subjective experience is deemed the ultimate proof and scientific objectivity is denigrated as insensitive. Established research methodology is often scorned. The use of control groups is considered immoral because control subjects are denied the experimental treatment. Double-blinding of observers is ignored in spite of the historical lessons scientists have learned from the pitfalls of non-blinded clinical observations. Ideologists rarely conduct studies with published protocols clear enough to enable replication. Even when the research methods are specified, replication is seldom, if ever, done. Ideological guilds lobby for laws which protect them from legal accountability. Such so-called \"medical freedom laws\" protect the practitioners of non-standard medicine, not consumers. NDs do not want to have to prove that their procedures are safe and effective. Instead, they substitute rhetoric for evidence. \"Natural\" is equated with proof of safety, and testimonials and unsubstantiated claims that \"it works\" are substituted for proof of efficacy. Naturopathy is eclectic (practitioners select whatever he/she personally likes from a cacophony of philosophically-based procedures), and empirical (practiced by subjective clinical experience). Due to the lack of scientific effort on the part of naturopaths, it is difficult to assess their value. Naturopaths present testimonials while opponents supply reports of harm- unfortunately, both are anecdotal and provide only a partial view. This leaves only the philosophy of naturopathy and the validity of the methods they employ for an evaluation of the guild. Appeal Naturopathy's appeal lies in its claim to be \"natural, preventive and holistic.\" These are fine accolades, but have no substantive meaning in operational terms. No matter how appealing its rhetoric, naturopathy must ultimately be judged by what it does and its results. A review of the curricula of accredited naturopathic schools shows that their courses of study include a mixture of medical discards (eg, colonics, water therapies, herbalism), pseudosciences (eg, acutherapy, homeopathy, gravity guidance, hair analysis for nutritional assessment, cleansing-at least one college offers preceptorships at Mexico border clinics which traffic in cancer quackery), and modalities expropriated from biomedicine (eg, nutritional counseling, hypnosis, natural childbirth, psychological counseling). An important difference is that at medical schools these topics are likely taught by more a qualified faculty, and applied with greater restraint by better trained and more rational practitioners. Much financial support for naturopathic education comes from the health foods industry, herbal trade associations, homeopathic suppliers, and other's who disdain consumer protection law and science. Risks to Patients Because patients must rely upon clinical interpretations by their doctors for explanations of their health status, such judgments should be based upon sound science, not ideology. Naturopathic practices result in needless, avoidable harm. Risks naturopathy poses to patients include: - Failure to act prudently in the presence of adverse reactions to their procedures due to a misguided belief in the \"healing crisis\" - Complications of natural childbirth - Discouragement of childhood immunizations - Delay in, or diversion from, proper medical care for patients afflicted with life-threatening conditions for which there are effective medical interventions available. - Questionable uses of herbs, drugs, and/or megavitamin therapy. Many naturopaths advance unfounded claims for herbal remedies. Included are such false ideas as: - Herbs can't harm, only help - Natural herbs are superior to standardized medications which have been approved by the FDA - The Doctrine of Signatures is meaningful as a guide to selecting the \"correct\" herbal remedy. The basis for nature cure is found in the notion that the body innately knows what is best for it. Disease symptoms should not be suppressed because they represent the body's natural healing processes. Although selective examples may be cited to support the idea, it cannot be applied as universally as naturopaths believe. More dangerous is the corollary belief in the so-called healing crisis which holds that adverse reactions associated with their practices (herbal remedies, fasting, colonics, etc.) are due to \"toxins\" being expelled; and, that the worse such adverse symptoms are, the worse would have been the future disease(s) being prevented. This false belief allows a naturopath to assert that the patient is \"getting better\" if they feel good, bad, or indifferent. Such advice led to the death of a 35-year-old Herbalife salesman, Bivian Lee. Lee had recently retired from the New Orleans Saints NFL team. He was in good health according to a life insurance physical six-months before his death. Lee read advice by Stanley Bass, ND, DC, PhC (Philosopher of Chiropractic) that adverse symptoms should be expected and welcomed. According to Bass, ill-feelings were due to the body's \"re-tracing\" and The toxins being discarded are saving you from more serious disease which will result if you keep them in your body too much longer-possibly hepatitis, kidney disorders, blood disease, heart disease, arthritis, nerve degenerations or even cancer-depending upon your hereditary or structural weaknesses. Be happy you're paying your bills now in an easy payment plan. With some, colds which haven't appeared for a long time may occur, or even fevers. THIS IS NATURE'S WAY OF HOUSECLEANING. DON'T-but DON'T try to stop these symptoms ...These symptoms are part of a curing process, and don't try to cure a cure. Those who have lived worse lives and poisoned themselves more will experience more severe symptoms... Headaches may occur at the beginning; fever and/or colds may appear; the skin may break out; there may be a short interval of bowel sluggishness, occasional diarrhea, feelings of tiredness and weakness, disinclination to exercise, nervousness, irritability, negativity or mental depression, frequent urination, etc.... REALIZE DEEPLY that your body is becoming younger and healthier every day because you are throwing off more and more wastes which would eventually have brought pain, disease and suffering. Those who have the worst symptom \u2014 reactions and follow through to their successful termination are thus avoiding some of the worst diseases which would eventually have developed had they continued their careless eating habits [10]. The notion that adverse symptoms should be disregarded or rejoiced about most likely caused Lee to ignore serious symptoms of cardiac myopathy. When Lee blacked-out, his wife discovered his condition and made an appointment for him to see a physician. Sadly, Lee died in front of his seven-year-old daughter before the appointment could be kept. The Herbalife company paid his widow a substantial (undisclosed) out-of-court settlement rather than defend its failure to control such misinformation. Factions Naturopathy has at least two major factions. The most politically active is the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP), which is made up primarily of graduates of Bastyr University (Seattle) and the National College of Naturopathic Medicine (Portland, OR). A naturopathic degree program at the Southwest College (Scottsdale, AZ) may now also be included. Graduates of these schools control the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education, an accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Office of Education. Another group is the American Naturopathic Medical Association (ANMA), founded in 1982 in Portland, Oregon [11]. The ANMA is composed of practitioners from a variety of nonaccredited programs including correspondence schools. A third organization, the American Naturopathic Association (ANA) has recently appeared on the scene. It is located in Washington, DC and claims to have been founded by Benedict Lust in 1896, and incorporated in 1919 [12]. Reform Efforts In NCAHF's view, current efforts to reform naturopathy are misguided for the most part, although there are individuals who envision an acceptable model. The misguided reform effort has focused upon eliminating diploma mill degree holders from licensure and practice. To help accomplish this, the Council of Naturopathic Medical Education was formed and eventually recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as the official accreditation agency for naturopathic training. On the surface, such an effort seems legitimate. The problem is that the accredited naturopathic schools teach invalid medical practices. NCAHF has been in contact with reformer naturopaths (RNDs) who are leaders in a reform movement. They understand that NCAHF's objection to the recognition of naturopathy is based upon its traditional antiscience orientation. RNDs say that they hope to remove this objection and make naturopathy into an acceptable health care system. Their view of an ideal ND would be sufficiently trained in diagnosis and screening to serve as a primary entry health care provider practicing general medicine with an emphasis upon teaching healthful lifestyles, managing minor illnesses, natural childbirth, personal counseling, and so forth. Rather than automatically opposing drugs and surgery, they say, naturopathy would simply have a different emphasis. RNDs would teach appropriate lifestyle changes that are safe and effective alternatives to drugs. For instance, weight-loss and exercise would be used as an alternative to medication for high blood pressure. If it were found not to be working for an individual patient, he or she would be referred to a regular physician. RNDs believe that there is a selective patient population of people willing to make the extra effort required who would utilize naturopathic services. Naturopathic training would emphasize patient screening and practitioners would collaborate with MDs to whom more serious problems would be referred. Counter to their tradition as \"drugless practitioners,\" reformers say that the idealized ND might even prescribe some medications. RNDs say that they prefer to use herbal remedies, but acknowledge that these would have to meet scientific standards of safety and effectiveness. RNDs would apply contemporary medical standards to validate their practices and would open themselves to peer review by MDs. RNDs would rely upon the standard scientific medical literature for its knowledge base. RNDs would abandon homeopathy, iridology, reflexology, and other sectarian or pseudomedical practices. Recognizing the propensity for naturopathy to attract sociopaths, the profession would work to set a higher standard for self-discipline than is presently done with conventional medicine. RNDs see the present dearth of family practitioners, its appeal to a growing health promotion-minded public willing to work at lifestyle changes, the high cost of high tech health care, and the high cost of medical education as favorable to their marketing strategy. RNDs would encourage immunization, pasteurization, fluoridation, and other proven public health measures. What the reformers have in mind sounds something like nurse practitioners, midwifery, barefoot doctor, and physician assistants, all rolled into a single role. This vision presents naturopathy, not as an \"alternative\" form of health care, but as filling a gap that has been left by the evolution of highly specialized, high-tech medicine. It would provide a low cost, low-technology brand of health care. Whether this is a pipe-dream or a realistic model from which a useful profession could emerge from the ranks of present-day naturopathy with its unorthodox traditions remains to be seen. NCAHF is not aware of a visible effort to make this dream a reality. If it were to become a reality, could and would AMA-approved medical schools also offer to train these low-tech medical generalists? Several RNDs say that it can be done. NCAHF's president, William Jarvis, has advised these reformers to demonstrate by developing a model program in one or more of the states that presently license NDs and approve Naturopathic Medical Education. It may take a generation to accomplish, but once shown to be a responsible profession working within mainstream health care, naturopathy would have arrived and would grow rapidly. NCAHF has told RNDs that, just as it has done in the case of affiliating with a chiropractic reform organization, it would be willing to help build a bridge for RNDs to enter mainstream health care if they approached their practices objectively, and were open to careful scrutiny from the consumer protection perspective. As we have suggested to chiropractic reformers, RND's may find it advantageous to change the name of their profession to make it easier to purge itself of the incorrigible quackery rampant within their profession.

Deviant providers often convince their patients that an oppressive and corrupted bureaucracy is keeping the treatment off the market. Even the language \"declared...by the Federal Government\" rather than \"determined on the basis of evidence\" is prejudicial. This bill is a charlatan's dream because it entices patients to sign away their rights. By fulfilling the duty to warn, quacks will be getting the same kind of protection the tobacco industry got with warning labels. After a consumer realizes he has been harmed, he has little chance of redress because of having been warned. Are Our Legislators Up To Their Jobs? NCAHF finds it incredible that our Senators and Representatives are willing to sell out to quackery by introducing and promoting such legislation. Americans are disgusted with Congress for selling itself to special interest groups, but the Congress sinks to a new low when it jeopardizes the health of the public by putting quacks on a par with responsible medicine. If these legislators plead ignorance, they are incompetent to serve. If they deny that their legislation indemnifies quackery, let them show how their law protects the public from delusional crank health care providers who truly believe that their nostrums have value, ideological types who base their practices upon the sectarian teachings of gurus, or psychopaths described by Dr. Robert Hare: Psychopaths are \"social predators who charm, manipulate, and ruthlessly plow their way through life, leaving a broad trail of broken hearts, shattered expectations, and empty wallets. Completely lacking in conscience and in feelings for others, they selfishly take what they want and do what they please, violating social norms and expectations without the slightest sense of guilt or regret. Their bewildered victims desperately ask, 'Who are these people?' 'What makes them the way they are?' 'How can we protect ourselves? [1] Most of the characters that Hare describes in his book are criminals. Some are infamous serial murderers. This is because a great deal of his research was done in prisons. But Hare has stated that not all prisoners are psychopaths, and not all psychopaths are in prison. He says, \"You find psychopaths in all professions. He's the shyster lawyer, the physician always on the verge of losing his license, the businessman with a string of deals where his partners always lose out.\" [2] The new research indicates the slippery ease with which psychopaths lie, twist language, and manipulate and destroy people in pursuit of their own ends is associated with brain function that differs from that of normal people. The psychopath shows a facile use of language, but the defect leaves him oblivious to the emotional meaning of the words he speaks and hears. \"The con man understands what he is saying at the intellectual level, but when he uses words they don't carry the same emotional baggage for him as they do for other people.\" South Dakota Senator Tom Daschle, and Oregon Congressman Peter DeFazio are the prime movers behind the ill-conceived \"Access to Medical Treatment Act.\" DeFazio states in a letter to The Wall Street Journal(6/23/97) that: The case of Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski is a prominent example of why we need FDA reform. During Dr. Burzynski's trial, his critically ill patients were faced with the loss of access to his experimental drug, antineoplastons. Many of us in Congress found the government's conduct and handling of this case to be heavy-handed and costly. In fact, it is the subject of an ongoing congressional investigation. Americans should not have to fear that the government will take away their access to alternative therapies. DeFazio goes on to say that this is one reason why he introduced the Access to Medical Treatment Act. A letter from William London appeared in the same column rightly pointing out that \"people don't choose an unapproved treatment unless marketing efforts lead them to believe that it can make them well.\" And that \"The utility of freedom of choice depends upon reliable information.\" Accompanying DeFazio's letter was a testimonial from Ted Wadman of Corvallis, Oregon, who states that his \"12-year-old son has a brain tumor that has shrunk by 70% in volume over the past two years while on Dr. Burzynski's treatment.\" What Mr. Wadman doesn't acknowledge is that his son's brain tumor may have shrunk whether or not he had been on antineoplastons. Some of the problems involved in evaluating the effectiveness of any remedy on brain tumors are that (1) their irregular shapes can cause their apparent size to vary considerably even from day to day on CT scans depending upon the \"cut\" and contrast load; (2) cystic tumors may nearly disappear if they happen to drain; (3) patients with lower grade tumors tend to survive for long periods of time in any case. Since the survival curve for any population of cancer patients is skewed (ie, resembles a toboggan run that is steep at first, lessens in gradient, and then trails way out), any clinic that treats a large number of cancer patients is bound to have a number of long term survivors. Understanding this, cancer specialists know that the presence of a few long term survivors cannot prove the value of any remedy-only randomized, controlled clinical trials can provide the evidence that is needed. This is what the case against Burzynski is about. He has failed to test his antineoplastons choosing instead to market them based upon testimonials. Anyone intelligent enough to serve in the U.S. Congress should be smart enough to understand why testimonials are unreliable, and why randomized, double-blind clinical trials are needed to establish the value of a treatment. Previous congresses recognized this fact and wrote these requirements into law. Is DeFazio's inability to grasp these fundamental realities an indication of the \"dumbing down\" of congress? NCAHF wonders if Daschle or DeFazio have communicated with the medical scientists among their constituencies for their input on the wisdom of this kind of legislation. Or, whether they believe that evidence-based medicine is the proper standard for the nation? Are they willing to admit that they are representing the antiscience, anticonsumer protection factions in their constituencies? Do they not realize that true believers do not need such legislation? People who are alienated from standard medicine will attend the quacks with or without such a law. The people in need of protection are the unsuspecting patients who seek nonscientific health care for themselves and their children who will seek redress when things go badly. They will then discover that the law protects the provider, not the consumer; that they were operating at their own risk. Most are surprised to learn that nonscientific health care provider is not held to the same standards as are physicians, but only to those of others of their guild. For instance, when an Oregon woman, who at the time resided in what is now DeFazio's district, fractured a vertebra, she went to a chiropractor for the back pain. He failed to diagnose the fracture and manipulated her spine. The failure to put her in a cast resulted in severe bone-spurring that became the source of perpetual pain and dysfunction. When she sued the chiro, she lost. The reason: other chiros testified that their colleague had delivered care appropriate for a chiro. The court ruled that she had chosen to seek chiro care, and had gotten what she bargained for. Chiros are held to chiro standards, not medical standards of care [3]. Sick people deserve better than to have to sort through a maze of alternatives that include both legitimate medicine and quackery. Incredibly, in little more than a decade, Congress has gone from indignation over quackery to tacit endorsement. In 1983, following a national survey of over 1,300 consumer affairs and law enforcement offices, U.S. Senate Committee on Aging reported that \"quackery and medical related frauds\" was first among the ten most harmful frauds directed against the elderly. In 1984, a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee chaired by Claude Pepper (D-Fla) which had independently arrived at the same finding, culminated an intensive four-year study of quackery and its impact upon the elderly [4]. The Pepper Committee estimated that the elderly were spending at least $10 billion per year, and that the nation as a whole was probably wasting $25 billion, on quackery. Most shocking, was the estimate that the amount expended exceeded by several magnitudes the $3.8 billion spent annually for all health research at the National Institutes of Health [5]. In 1987, Louis Harris and Associates reported on a national sample telephone survey of American adults to determine the use of questionable health care products for fifteen treatment areas (figure 2). The study found that 26.6% of the American public (est. 46 million) used one or more questionable health care treatments, and 21% (est. 38 million) had used a questionable health care product during the past year [6]. The events that changed the picture appear to be the emphasis President Clinton put on developing a national health care financing program early in his administration. The likelihood that third-party payers would write the checks under government guidelines mobilized nonmedical providers to become organized and to lobby for inclusion. At the same time, political insiders such as Senators Tom Harkin and Orrin Hatch were working on behalf of off-beat health care. Harkin managed to have established the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine, and Hatch managed to pass the 1994 Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act. In 1993, the New England Journal of Medicine reported that the use of unconventional medicine was far higher than previously thought. This time the numbers were deemed as something worth cashing in on. Why did people react this way? Because managed care entrepreneurers had taken over medicine and were imposing commercial rather than professional values on the situation (see: \"Professionalism versus Commercialism\" NCAHF Newsletter, July-August, 1997). The public has been confused by all of this, but people know that they are unhappy with the new health care. Ironically, they may interpret the language of \"access to medical treatment\" as making more available the health care being denied by tight-fisted HMOs, when what is really happening is a substitution of questionable alternative and complementary health care for the real thing.

The law, which took effect in 1973, called for payment for the treatment of \"subluxations demonstrated by x-rays to exist.\" [1] A New York Times editorial called the enactment of Medicare coverage \"the most shocking victory for special-interest lobbyists\" and added that \"the scientific basis of the chiropractic cult is highly dubious.\" [2] A few weeks after the law was passed, Doyl Taylor, head of the AMA Department of Investigation, told me that when chiropractic inclusion appeared inevitable, the \"subluxation\" language was inserted with the hope of preventing chiropractors from actually being paid.

In 1972, in response to vigorous lobbying by chiropractors, Congress enacted a law providing for limited coverage of chiropractic services under Medicare. The law, which took effect in 1973, called for payment for the treatment of \"subluxations demonstrated by x-rays to exist.\" [1] A New York Times editorial called the enactment of Medicare coverage \"the most shocking victory for special-interest lobbyists\" and added that \"the scientific basis of the chiropractic cult is highly dubious.\" [2] A few weeks after the law was passed, Doyl Taylor, head of the AMA Department of Investigation, told me that when chiropractic inclusion appeared inevitable, the \"subluxation\" language was inserted with the hope of preventing chiropractors from actually being paid. The idea's originator thought that since chiropractic's traditional \"subluxations\" were visible only to chiropractors, this provision would sabotage their coverage. After the law was passed, however, two things happened to enable payment. First, chiropractors held a consensus conference that redefined \"subluxations\" to include common findings that others could see. Second, according to Taylor, the government officials responsible for interpreting the new law \"decided that Congress intended chiropractors to be paid for something.\" The regulators then defined subluxation as \"an incomplete dislocation, off-centering, misalignment, fixation, or abnormal spacing of the vertebrae demonstrable . . . to individuals trained in the reading of x-rays.\" and stipulated that the \"primary diagnosis\" must be a subluxation. Subluxation \"Defined\" The consensus conference, held in Houston in November 1972, resulted in the following statement: A subluxation is the alteration of the normal dynamics, anatomical or physiological relationships of contiguous articular structures. In evaluation of this complex phenomenon, we find that it has-or may have-biomechanical, pathophysiological, clinical, radiologic, and other manifestations [3]. The American Chiropractic Association included the Houston \"definition\" its Basic Chiropractic Procedural Manual, the first edition of which was issued in 1973. The book noted: Through the years there have been numerous concepts within the chiropractic profession of what constitutes a subluxation. Each of these has had its own rationale and each has had certain validity that has been a contribution to our understanding of this complex phenomenon. The advent of chiropractic inclusion in Medicare has brought the absolute necessity for a uniform methods of describing, documenting, and reporting spinal subluxations so that those who will administer the law will not be confused by the present lack of uniformity and differences in reporting terminology, to our detriment [4]. The manual also noted that the conferees had assembled to concur upon a definition that would be \"agreeable to all chiropractors while understandable to nonchiropractors; would encompass our understanding so that we would not have improper limitations on us, but would be simple enough for lay interpretation.\" The resultant \"definition, several pages long, described the supposed radiologic manifestations of 18 types which \"gross displacements\" are evident. Some are fancy names for the minor degenerative changes that occur as people age; they often have nothing to do with a patient's symptoms and are not changed by chiropractic treatment. Some, as acknowledged by the Houston conferees, are not even visible on x-ray films. Labeling them \"subluxations\" was simply a device to get paid. In the early 1960s, when the National Association of Letter Carriers Health Plan included chiropractic, it received claims for treatment of cancer, heart disease, mumps, mental retardation, and many other questionable conditions. In 1964, chiropractors were asked to justify such claims by sending x-ray evidence of spinal problems. They submitted hundreds, all of which supposedly showed subluxations. When chiropractic officials were assembled to review them, however, [they were unable to point out a single subluxation](../../01General/nalc.html) [5]. Following this incident, the plan stopped covering chiropractic services. Referring to these events as an \"unfortunate debacle which almost destroyed chiropractic credibility in Washington,\" the 1973 Basic Chiropractic Procedural Manual cautioned, in italics, \"The subluxations must be perfectly obvious and indisputable.\" [4] These strategic comments were omitted from revised versions of the manual published in 1977, 1980, and 1984. The Inspector General's Report A 1986 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Inspector General (OIG) revealed that chiropractic manipulation had been the ninth most frequently billed procedure under Medicare Part B during 1983. The report was based on telephone discussions with 145 out of 200 chiropractors randomly selected from lists provided by insurance carriers. The report noted: The Medicare Carriers Manual . . . presents a system for classifying subluxations . . . and a system for relating various symptoms to a particular area of the spine. The manual also lists examples of conditions for which manual manipulation of the spine is not an appropriate treatment. Some critics have suggested that this system has provided a blueprint for chiropractors to work backward to identify the appropriate location of a subluxation for billing purposes, as opposed to treating and billing for a subluxation which has been identified on an x-ray [6]. Sections III and IV of the OIG report were especially critical: | | A Conspiracy of Silence? The OIG investigators concluded that the Medicare x-ray requirement \"is not corrently well enforced, may be unenforceable, and is highly conducive to abuse.\" Noting that chiropractors were lobbying to remove the x-ray requirement for justifying their services, the report warned that the financial impact of such a law would be great. Chiropractors finally got their wish in 1997, when Congress quietly amended the law to permit payment for subluxations diagnosed by other means \u2014 a policy scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2000. Chiropractors responding to a 1995 American Chiropractic Association Survey reported an average gross 1996 income of $228,236, with 8% from Medicare Part B and 1% from Medicare HMOs, which would add up to about $20,500 per chiropractor [7]. Since 1973, Medicare has paid billions of dollars for treating chiropractic \"subluxations.\" Yet, as far as I can tell, neither Congress nor the American media have investigated what these dollars have bought.
