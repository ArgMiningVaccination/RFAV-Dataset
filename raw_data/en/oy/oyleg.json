Robertson, Chief Operations Officer of Suzuki Motor of America, Inc., along with copies of its balance sheets: \"As you know, American Suzuki Motor Corporation (ASM C) filed Chapter 11 Bankruptcy on November 5, 2012. At that time, ASMC announced its withdrawal from the U.S. market for new automotive sales. ASMC alsoannounced its plan to sell its remaining assets to a buyer approved by the Bankruptcy Court and that the buyer would assume all vehicle warranties. Additionally, ASMC announced that the buyer would purchase ASMC'smotorcycle/ATV and marine divisions, and would continue those businesses. Recently, Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC) in Japan est ablished a new U.S. entity to purchase all of the assets from ASMC, and to serve as the new authorized distributor of Suzuki products in the U.S. The new entity is Suzuki Motor of America, Inc. (SMAI) . As noted, SMAI will not distribute or sell new automobiles in the U.S. SMAI, however, will honor all warranties on all vehicles, and will continue to distribute motorcycle, ATV andmarine products, which will be sold and serviced through authorized and licensed dealers in Louisiana. SMAI has now registered with the Secretary of State to do business in Louisiana.Although SMAI will not distribute new motor vehicle in continental U.S. including Louisiana, we understand that a motor vehicle distributor license may be required for SMAI to authorize dealers to offer Suzuki automobilewarranty service and parts to consumers in Louisiana. For this reason, we are submitting SMAI's application for a motor vehicle distributor license, along with what we believe to be all required documentation. Enclosed with this letter you will find such documentation, including a Table of Contents identifying the corresponding Tab for each document. Also, SMAI respectfully requests that it not be required to post the $1,000,000 bond sometimes imposed in connection with the issuance of motor vehicle distributor licenses. It is our understanding that this requirement sometimes is suspended at the discretion of the Executive Director and/or the Commission, and in fact such bondwas not required for ASMC, SMAI's predecessor distributor of Suzuki automobiles. SMAI will not be wholesalingor distributing any new motor vehicles in Louisiana, and it is not asking any dealer continuing with service and parts sales to maintain wholesale foorlines or construc t new or remodeled facilities. We respectfully submit that there is no reason to required such a bond from SMAI given its very limited motor vehicle activity (service andparts only), and that such a bond would be a financial burden for the company. LMVC.03.11.13.#1Please note that SMAI is submitting under separate cove r its completed application for a license to distribute Suzuki motorcycle, ATV and marine products. We are subm itting these applications under separate cover in order to avoid any possible delay of one license in the event there is a delay in processing the other. Once distributor license have been approved, SMAI will proceed with application for its representatives in Louisiana as may be required. Please mail SMAI's recreational vehicle distributor license to the following: Suzuki Motor America, Inc. 3251 E. Imperial Hwy, #GRD Lic. Brea, California 92821-6795 If you have any questions regarding this application or t he supplemental information provided, please feel free to contact Tracy Earle at tracy.earle@suz.com or call 714-996-7040 ext 2215. For additional assistance, you also may contact Bob Alsip at robert.asop@suz.com or at 714-996-7040 ext 2315.\" At this time, the Chairman opened the floor for Patricia R.
