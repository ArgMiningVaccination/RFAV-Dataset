Inside Back Cover11 Santa Clara University Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Santa Clara University is a comprehen - sive Jesuit, Catholic university with more than 8,800 students. Founded in 1851 by the Society of Jesus, California's oldest operating higher education institution offers a rigorous undergraduate curriculum in arts and sciences, business, and engineering, plus nationally recognized graduate and professional programs in business, law, engineering, education, counseling psychology, pastoral ministries, and theology. The University boasts a diverse community of scholars offering a values-oriented curriculum characterized by small class sizes and a dedication to educating students for competence, conscience, and compassion. The traditions of Jesuit education\u2014educating the whole person for a life of service\u2014run deep in all of its curricular and co-curricular programs. Santa Clara University is perennially ranked among the top comprehensive universities by U.S. News & World Report and has one of the highest graduation rates for undergraduate students among all comprehensive universities. The University has a national reputation for its undergraduate program that features a distinctive core curriculum, an integrated learning environment, and research opportunities for undergraduate students. The University was established as Santa Clara College on the site of the Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds, the eighth of the original 21 California missions. The college originally oper - ated as a preparatory school and did not offer collegiate courses until 1853. Following the Civil War, enrollment increased, and by 1875 the size of the student body was 275. One-third of the students were enrolled in the collegiate division; the remainder attended the college's preparatory and high school departments. Santa Clara experienced slow and steady growth during its first 60 years, becoming the University of Santa Clara in 1912, when the schools of engineering and law were added. In 1925, the high school was separated from the University and took the name of Bellarmine College Preparatory in 1928. The Leavey School of Business opened in 1926, and within a decade, became one of the first business schools in the country to receive national accreditation. For 110 years, Santa Clara was an all-male school. In the fall of 1961, women were accepted as undergraduates, and Santa Clara became the first coeducational Catholic university in California. The decision resulted in an admissions explosion\u2014from 1,500 students to more than 5,000. The size of the faculty tripled, and the University began the largest building program in school history, building eight residence halls, a student union, and an athletic stadium. In the early 1970s, the Board of T rustees voted to limit the size of the undergraduate population, an action that was intended to preserve the character and ensure the quality of the University for generations to come. In 1985, the University adopted \"Santa Clara University\" as its official name.2 SANT A CLARA UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITY VISION, MISSION, AND FUNDAMENTAL VALUES Santa Clara University has adopted three directional statements to describe the kind of university it aspires to become (Strategic Vision), its core purpose and the constituencies it serves (University Mission), and the beliefs that guide its actions (Fundamental Values). Strategic Vision Santa Clara University will educate citizens and leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion, and cultivate knowledge and faith to build a more humane, just, and sustainable world. University Mission The University pursues its vision by creating an academic community that educates the whole person within the Jesuit, Catholic tradition, making student learning our central focus, continuously improving our curriculum and co-curriculum, strengthening our schol - arship and creative work, and serving the communities of which we are a part in Silicon Valley and around the world. Student learning takes place at the undergraduate and graduate level in an educational environment that integrates rigorous inquiry and scholarship, creative imagination, reflective engagement with society, and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world. As an academic community, we expand the boundaries of knowledge and insight through teaching, research, artistic expression, and other forms of scholarship. It is primarily through discovering, communicating, and applying knowledge that we exercise our institu-tional responsibility as a voice of reason and conscience in society. We offer challenging academic programs and demonstrate a commitment to the devel - opment of: U ndergraduate students who seek an education with a strong humanistic orientation in a primarily residential setting G raduate students, many of them working professionals in Silicon Valley, who seek advanced degree programs that prepare them to make significant contributions to their fields In addition to these core programs, we also provide a variety of continuing education and professional development opportunities for non-matriculated students. Fundamental Values The University is committed to these core values, which guide us in carrying out our mission and realizing our vision: Academic Excellence. We seek an uncompromising standard of excellence in teaching, learning, creativity, and scholarship within and across disciplines. Search for Truth, Goodness, and Beauty . We prize scholarship and creative work that advance human understanding, improve teaching and learning, and add to the betterment of society by illuminating the most significant problems of the day and exploring the endur - ing mysteries of life. In this search, our commitment to academic freedom is unwavering. Engaged Learning. We strive to integrate academic reflection and direct experience in the classroom and the community, especially to understand and improve the lives of those with the least education, power, and wealth.SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY 3 Commitment to Students. As teachers and scholars, mentors and facilitators, we endeavor to educate the whole person. We nurture and challenge students\u2014intellectually, spiritually, aesthetically, morally, socially, and physically\u2014preparing them for leadership and service to the common good in their professional, civic, and personal lives. Service to Others . We promote throughout the University a culture of service\u2014service not only to those who study and work at Santa Clara but also to society in general and to its most disadvantaged members as we work with and for others to build a more humane, just, faith-filled, and sustainable world. Community and Diversity . We cherish our diverse and inclusive community of students, faculty, staff, administrators, and alumni, a community that is enriched by people of differ - ent backgrounds, respectful of the dignity of all its members, enlivened by open communi - cation, and caring and just toward others. Jesuit Distinctiveness. We treasure our Jesuit heritage and tradition, which incorporates all of these core values. This tradition gives expression to our Jesuit educational mission and Catholic identity while also welcoming and respecting other religious and philosophical traditions, promoting the dialogue between faith and culture, and valuing opportunities to deepen religious beliefs. ACADEMIC PROGRAMS Santa Clara University offers undergraduate degrees leading to the bachelor of arts (B.A.), bachelor of science (B.S.), and bachelor of science in commerce.

The Department of Education focuses on preparing teachers and administrators for public and Catholic schools. It offers programs in teacher preparation leading to credentials (i.e., California preliminary multiple-subject and single- subject teaching credentials, and California Clear credential) and the master of arts in teaching (MAT) degree. Its programs in educational administration prepare public K-12 administra - tors (i.e., the Preliminary California Administrative Services credential and the California Clear Administrative Services credential), and Catholic school leaders through the certifi - cate program in Catholic School Leadership. The department also offers a M.A. program in interdisciplinary education (with emphases in curriculum and instruction; science, technol - ogy, environmental education, and mathematics (STEEM); and educational administra - tion. The departments of Education and Counseling Psychology jointly offer the certificate program in Alternative and Correctional Education. The Department of Counseling Psychology offers two degree programs: M.A. in counseling psychology and M.A. in coun - seling. The M.A. in counseling psychology can lead to state licensure for marriage and family therapists and/or licensed professional clinical counselors. The department includes emphasis programs in health, correctional, and Latino counseling. The Jesuit School of Theology (JST) is one of only two Jesuit theological centers in the United States operated by the Society of Jesus, as the order of Catholic priests is known. It is one of only two Jesuit theological centers in the country that offer three ecclesiastical degrees certified by the Vatican Congregation for Catholic Education, and it also offers four advanced theological degrees certified by the Association of Theological Schools. In addi - tion, JST offers a spiritual renewal program for clergy, religious, and lay people, and conducts an annual Instituto Hispano that offers a certificate program to advance Hispanic leadership in the pastoral life of the church. CENTERS OF DISTINCTION Santa Clara University has three Centers of Distinction that serve as major points of interaction between the University and local and global communities. Each center focuses on a theme that is central to Santa Clara's distinctive mission as a Jesuit university and offers an educational environment integrating rigorous inquiry and scholarship, creative imagina - tion, reflective engagement with society, and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world. Each center engages faculty and students from different disciplines as well as experts and leaders from the community through speakers, conferences, workshops, and experiential learning opportunities. Center for Science, Technology, and Society The mission of the Center for Science, Technology, and Society is to accelerate global, innovation-based entrepreneurship in service to humanity. Through an array of programs including its signature Global Social Benefit Incubator (GSBI), the Center engages an international network of business, investment capital, and technical resources to build the capacity of social enterprises around the world. As a Center of Distinction at Santa Clara University, the Center leverages its programs to inspire faculty and students with real- world case studies, distinctive curricula, and unique research opportunities, advancing the University's vision of creating a more just, humane, and sustainable world. More information can be found at www.scu.edu/socialbenefit.SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY 5 Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education The Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education promotes and enhances the distinctively Jesuit, Catholic tradition of education at Santa Clara University, with a view toward serving students, faculty, staff, and through them the larger community, both local and global. The Ignatian Center achieves this mission chiefly through four signature programs: Bannan Institutes provide yearlong thematic programs including academic events and scholarly activities that further the Jesuit, Catholic character of the University Community-based learning places over 1,200 students each year with community partners, frequently in connection with an academic course Immersion programs offer students, during academic breaks, the opportunity to experience local, domestic, and international communities with little access to wealth, power, and privilege Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius provide opportunities for members of the community to encounter the spiritual sources of the Jesuit tradition Through these four programs, the Ignatian Center aspires to be recognized throughout Silicon Valley and beyond as providing leadership for the integration of faith, justice, and the intellectual life. Markkula Center for Applied Ethics The Markkula Center for Applied Ethics is one of the preeminent centers for research and dialogue on ethical issues in critical areas of American life. The center works with faculty, staff, students, community leaders, and the public to address ethical issues more effectively in teaching, research, and action. The center's focus areas are business, health care and biotechnology, character education, government, global leadership, technology, and emerging issues in ethics. Articles, cases, briefings, and dialogue in all fields of applied ethics are available through the center. FACULTY Santa Clara University's emphasis on a community of scholars and integrated education attracts faculty members who are as committed to students' intellectual and moral develop - ment as they are to pursuing their own scholarship. The University's 516 full-time faculty members include Fulbright professors, nationally recognized authors and poets, ground - breaking scientists, and distinguished economic theorists. STUDENT BODY Santa Clara University has a student population of 8,519, with about 5,250 undergraduate students and 3,269 graduate students. The undergraduate population has a male-to-female ratio of 50-to-50, and about 43 percent of undergraduate students identify themselves as persons of color. About 62 percent of undergraduates are from California, with the others coming from throughout the United States and 40 foreign countries. Seventy-nine percent of undergraduate students receive some kind of financial aid\u2014scholarships, grants, or loans. More than half of the undergraduate population lives in University housing, with 95 percent of freshmen and 73 percent of sophomores living on campus. Students experi - ence an average class size of 23, with 37 percent of classes having fewer than 20 students and only 1.2 percent of classes having 50 or more students. The student-to-faculty ratio is 12.56-to-1.6 SANT A CLARA UNIVERSITY The University's commitment to learning is expressed in the fact that 94 percent of freshman students advance to the sophomore year, and the percentage of Santa Clara students who graduate is among the highest in the country. The four-year graduation rate for entering freshmen is 77 percent, with a five-year graduation rate of 84.6 percent and a six-year graduation rate of 85 percent. ALUMNI Santa Clara University has over 94,000 alumni living in all 50 states and almost 100 foreign countries. More than half of the alumni live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where many are leaders in business, law, engineering, academia, and public service. CAMPUS The University is located on a 106-acre campus in the city of Santa Clara near the southern end of the San Francisco Bay in one of the world's greatest cultural centers. More than 50 buildings on campus house 15 student residences, a main library, a law library, two student centers, the de Saisset Museum, extensive performing arts and athletic facilities, and a recreation and fitness center. Santa Clara's campus has the advantage of being located in Silicon Valley\u2014a region known for its extraordinary visionaries, who have designed and created some of the most significant scientific and technological advances of our age. Silicon Valley is more than a place, it is a mindset, and home to more than 2 million residents and 6,600 science- and technology-related companies (not including San Francisco, which is located just an hour away). Santa Clara's campus is well known for its beauty and mission-style architecture. Newly opened in 2013, the brick-paved Abby Sobrato Mall leads visitors from the University's main entrance to the heart of campus\u2014the Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds. The roses and palm and olive trees of the Mission Gardens surround the historic Mission Church, which was restored in 1928. The adjacent Adobe Lodge is the oldest building on campus. In 1981, it was restored to its 1822 decor. Academic Facilities Amidst all this beauty and history are modern, world-class academic facilities. Students study and thrive in places such as the Joanne E. Harrington Learning Commons, Sobrato Family Technology Center, and Orradre Library where individuals and groups can study in an inviting, light-filled, and open environment. Notably, the library features an Auto - mated Retrieval System, a high-density storage area where up to 900,000 books and other publications can be stored and retrieved using robotic-assisted technology. Another example of Santa Clara's excellent academic facilities is Lucas Hall, home of the Leavey School of Business. This modern 85,000-square-foot building houses classrooms, meeting rooms, offices, study spaces, and a caf\u00e9. Classrooms are equipped with state-of- the-art videoconferencing equipment as well as a multi-platform system to record faculty lectures for later review by students. Vari Hall (formerly Arts & Sciences), adjacent to Lucas Hall, is home to the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics as well as academic departments, classrooms, and a 2,200-square-foot digital television studio, regarded as among the best studios found on any campus nationwide.SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY 7 Located near Vari Hall (formerly Arts & Sciences) is the Schott Admission and Enrollment Services Building, a welcome center for campus visitors and home to several University departments. Opened in 2012, the lobby of this green-certified structure includes technology- infused exhibits that illustrate Santa Clara's Jesuit mission. Among other green features on campus are two solar-powered homes built in 2007 and 2009 for the U.S. Department of Energy's Solar Decathlon. Both homes now serve as laboratories for solar and sustainability technologies. Student Life Santa Clara has 10 on-campus residence halls, most with traditional double rooms and large common bathrooms; others with suite arrangements conducive to more informal liv - ing. Juniors and seniors can apply for townhouse-style living in the 138-unit University Villas across from the main campus. Opened in 2012, Graham Hall is Santa Clara's newest residence hall. The environmentally friendly building boasts 96 mini-suites, lounges, full kitchens, and laundry facilities for every eight-room \"neighborhood.\" In addition, the resi - dence hall has two classrooms, a small theater, outdoor barbecue and picnic areas, and a large courtyard. The Robert F. Benson Memorial Center serves as a hub for campus life. The Benson Center offers dining services and houses the campus bookstore, the campus post office, and meeting rooms. The University's main dining hall, The Marketplace, resembles an upscale food court with numerous stations and options. For a more informal experience, The Bronco is the Benson Center's late-night venue, serving beverages and pub-style food. Another hot-spot for student life, the Paul L. Locatelli, S.J., Student Activity Center, includes a 6,000 square-foot gathering hall with a high ceiling that can accommodate dances and concerts as well as pre- and post-game activities. Designed with environmental sensitivity, the building is energy efficient and has daytime lighting controls and motion sensors to maximize use of natural light. For fitness-minded students, the Pat Malley Fitness and Recreation Center features a 9,500-square-foot weight training and cardiovascular exercise room, three basketball courts, a swimming pool, and other facilities to support the recreational and fitness needs of the campus community. The campus includes many locations for quiet reflection such as the St. Clare Garden, which features plants and flowers arranged into five groups to portray the stages of the saint's life. For campus members who want a more hands-on relationship with nature, the Forge Garden, SCU's half-acre organic garden, serves as a campus space for course research, service learning, and sustainable food production. Athletics and the Arts The importance of athletics to the University is evident everywhere on campus. Among the newest additions to Santa Clara's athletics facilities is the Stephen Schott Stadium , home field for the men's baseball team, which features batting cages, a clubhouse, conces - sions stands, and seating for 1,500 fans. Across the street from the stadium is Bellomy Field\u2014eight acres of well-lit, grassy field space used for club and intramural sports such as rugby and field hockey. Adjacent to Bellomy Field is the well-appointed women's softball field, which opened in 2013. Other athletic venues on campus include the 6,400-seat Buck Shaw Stadium, home to the men's and women's soccer programs; and the Leavey Event Center, the University's premier basketball facility. Over the years, the Leavey Event Center has hosted nine West Coast Conference Basketball Championships.8 SANT A CLARA UNIVERSITY The University recognizes the arts as an equally important part of life at Santa Clara University. The de Saisset Museum , the University's accredited museum of art and history, presents changing art exhibitions throughout the year and serves as the caretaker of the University's California History Collection, which includes artifacts from the Native American, Mission, and early Santa Clara College periods. SCU Presents represents the University's commitment to the performing arts on campus, which include performances at venues such as the Louis B. Mayer Theatre, the Fess Parker Studio Theatre, and the Music Recital Hall . The Mayer Theatre is Santa Clara University's premier theatrical venue, housing 500 intimate seats in either a flexible proscenium or thrust-stage setting. The Fess Parker Studio Theatre has no fixed stage or seating. Its black-box design, complete with movable catwalks, provides flexibility in an experimental setting. The 250-seat Music Recital Hall provides a contemporary setting where students, faculty, and guest artists offer a variety of performances.92 The Santa Clara Undergraduate Program Santa Clara University is committed to the education of the whole person in the Jesuit and Catholic tradition with a vision of developing men and women to be leaders of compe - tence, conscience, and compassion. The Santa Clara undergraduate program is designed for students who seek an integrated education with a strong humanistic orientation in a pri - marily residential setting. An integrated education is one that encourages students to seek connections between differing ways of knowing and being in the world, between different forms of knowledge within established disciplines, and between new knowledge and that which preceded it. Santa Clara's concept of the \"whole person\" inevitably embraces our social nature. When he inaugurated Santa Clara's sesquicentennial year in 2000, Father Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, then superior general of the Society of Jesus, noted that \"Tomorrow's 'whole person' cannot be whole without an educated awareness of society and culture with which to contribute socially, generously, in the real world.\" Affirming that the Jesuit educational standard must always \"educate the whole person of solidarity in the real world,\" he explained: \"Students, in the course of their formation, must let the gritty reality of this world into their lives, so they can learn to feel it, think about it critically, respond to its suffering, and engage in it constructively. They should learn to perceive, think, judge, choose, and act for the rights of others, especially the disadvantaged and the oppressed.\" Since then, Santa Clara University has revised the Core Curriculum, begun implementing a new strategic plan, extended the impact of our Centers of Excellence, and enhanced our co-curricular programs, all with the goal of educating \"the whole person of solidarity in the real world.\" The Santa Clara undergraduate program offers a curriculum and other learning experi - ences whose content and pattern combine the acquisition and creation of knowledge with the quest for meaning and purpose. The learning environment encourages students to make connections across the Core Curriculum, the academic major and elective courses. It helps students relate their classroom learning with out-of-classroom learning through community-based education, Residential Learning Communities, student organizations, athletics and recreation, and other experiences. In a more general way, the undergraduate program nurtures students' ability to knit the intellectual, social, moral, spiritual, creative, and behavioral aspects of life into a coherent and meaningful whole. Santa Clara University offers undergraduate degrees leading to the bachelor of arts, bach - elor of science, and bachelor of science in commerce with majors in 50 fields. The College of Arts and Sciences offers majors in ancient studies, anthropology, art history, biochemistry, biology, chemistry, classical languages and literatures (Greek and/or Latin), classical studies, communication, computer science, economics, engineering physics, English, environmental science, environmental studies, ethnic studies, French and Francophone studies, German studies, history, individual studies, Italian studies, liberal studies, mathematics, music, philosophy, physics, political science, psychology, public health science, religious studies, sociology, Spanish studies, studio art, theatre arts, and women's and gender studies. The 10 THE SANT A CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM college also houses the graduate program in pastoral ministries, through which it offers the master of arts degree in catechetics, pastoral liturgy, spirituality, and liturgical music. The Leavey School of Business offers majors in accounting, accounting and information systems, economics, finance, management, marketing, and management information systems. The School of Engineering offers majors in bioengineering, civil engineering, computer science and engineering, electrical engineering, general engineering, mechanical engineering, and Web design and engineering. A wide range of departmental and school minors, emphases in majors, and concentra - tions in degree programs are available to enhance the major field of study for students. Consistent with the commitment to an integrated educational experience, interdisciplinary minors are offered in Arabic, Islamic, and Middle Eastern studies; Asian studies; medieval and Renaissance studies; musical theatre; retail studies; science, technology, and society; and urban education. THE SANTA CLARA CORE CURRICULUM A university expresses its most basic values in its Core Curriculum that is part of an undergraduate education required of all students. Santa Clara's Core Curriculum explicitly integrates three traditions of higher education. As a Catholic university, it is rooted in the tradition of pursuing an understanding of God through the free exercise of reason. As a Jesuit university, it promotes a humanistic education that leads toward an ethical engagement with the world. As a comprehensive American university committed to liberal education, Santa Clara seeks to prepare its students for intelligent, responsible, and creative citizenship. Reflecting these traditions, the Core Curriculum provides every undergraduate with the common learning that all students need to become leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion. The distinctiveness of a Santa Clara education emerges in the Core Curriculum, both in its sense of purpose rooted in the University's traditions and in its commitment to a breadth of learning that complements and supports all majors. The Core Curriculum opens students to the study and practice of the arts, humanities, mathematics, technology, natural sciences, and social sciences. It educates students for interdisciplinary understanding and ethically informed participation in civic life. Opportunities for experiential learning foster the development of compassion and atten- tion to the ways human suffering can be alleviated. Reflecting the University's founding mission, the Core Curriculum includes a disciplined and critical reflection on the religious dimensions of human existence. In addition, because the Core Curriculum continually highlights the critical and compelling questions facing individuals and communities, the Cor e Curriculum supports students both in making professional career choices and in discerning their larger vocation\u2014their life's purpose in the world. Learning Goals: What will students learn in the Core Curriculum? Because a liberal education in the Jesuit tradition is oriented toward particular ends, the Core Curriculum affirms a set of central learning goals. These goals are divided among three broad categories\u2014Knowledge, Habits of Mind and Heart, and Engagement with the World. Knowledge To be prepared for well-informed engagement in society, students must comprehend the forces that have shaped the world they have inherited and the ways the world is interpreted THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 11 and understood. They must also understand how they might transform the world for the better. The Core Curriculum deepens students' knowledge of the ideas and ways of knowing that emerge from the arts, humanities, and natural and social sciences. Global Cultures: The intertwined development of global ideas, institutions, religions, and cultures, including Western cultures Arts and Humanities : The production, interpretation, and social influence of the fine and performing arts, history, languages, literatures, philosophy, and religion Scientific Inquiry : The principles of scientific inquiry and how they are applied in the natural and social sciences Science and Technology: The formative influences, dynamics, social impacts, and ethical consequences of scientific and technological development Diversity: Diverse human experiences, identities, and cultures within local and global societies, especially as formed by relations of power and privilege Civic Life: The roles, rights, and responsibilities of citizens and institutions in societies and in the world Habits of Mind and Heart To contribute to a rapidly changing, complex, and interdependent world, students must develop ways of thinking, feeling, and acting that allow them to educate themselves for the rest of their lives with passion and purpose. By attending to the cognitive and affective dimensions of human experience, the Core Curriculum enables students to think more deeply, imagine more freely, and communicate more clearly. Critical Thinking: The ability to identify, reflect upon, evaluate, integrate, and apply different types of information and knowledge to form independent judgments Mathematics and Quantitative Reasoning: Analytical and logical thinking and the habit of drawing conclusions based on quantitative information Complexity: An approach to understanding the world that appreciates ambiguity and nuance as well as clarity and precision Ethical Reasoning: Drawing on ethical traditions to assess the consequences of indi - vidual and institutional decisions Religious Reflection: Questioning and clarifying beliefs through critical inquiry into faith and the religious dimensions of human existence Communication: Interacting effectively with different audiences, especially through writing, speech, and a second language Engagement with the World To engage with the world in meaningful ways, students need opportunities to explore and refine self-knowledge in relation to others. The Core Curriculum enhances students' understanding of the integrity of their own lives and the dignity inherent in the lives of others, especially the impoverished, suffering, and marginalized. Perspective: Seeking out the experience of different cultures and people, striving to view the world through their eyes Collaboration: The capacity to collaborate intellectually and creatively with diverse people Social Justice: Developing a disciplined sensibility toward the causes of human suffering and misery, and a sense of responsibility for addressing them Civic Engagement: Addressing major contemporary social issues, including environ- mental sustainability and peaceful resolution of conflict, by participating actively as an informed citizen of society and the world12 THE SANT A CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The Curriculum: What courses will students take in the Core Curriculum? Each course in the Core Curriculum addresses at least three of the learning goals listed above. Students have multiple opportunities to encounter, practice, and master each learn - ing goal. In addition, specific learning objectives for each area of the Core Curriculum have been developed by faculty Core Curriculum committees. These learning objectives are asso - ciated with particular learning goals and describe the knowledge, skills, and values students will be able to demonstrate after completing the courses in the Core Curriculum. The learn - ing objectives are posted on the Core Curriculum website and published annually in the Core Curriculum Guide. The structure of the Core features two phases of coursework designed to foster develop - mental learning and curricular coherence. The first phase, Foundations, consists of courses normally taken in the first year, introducing students to the processes and expectations for university-level education: Critical Thinking & Writing (CTW), Cultures & Ideas (C&I), a second language, mathematics, and the first course in the Religion, Theology & Culture (RTC) sequence. This phase helps students begin to set their own goals for learn - ing, preparing them to make thoughtful choices in the Core Curriculum, their majors, and co-curricular activities. The second phase, Explorations, includes courses that expand students' understanding of a broad range of knowledge and abilities needed for effective participation in contemporary life. Each student will take courses in ethics, civic engagement, diversity, arts, social science, natural science, and science, technology, and society, and they will take additional courses in the Cultures & Ideas and Religion, Theology & Culture sequences. Many Explorations courses overlap with courses in students' majors. The Core Curriculum also includes Integrations that help students make connections among courses in the Core Curriculum and between the Core Curriculum and their majors. Integrations usually are not additional courses. Rather, they are components of other courses. One Integrations course includes an experiential learning element oriented toward issues of social justice. One course involves an advanced writing component. Students also link a set of Core Curriculum, major, and/or elective courses into an interdisciplinary Pathway. Pathways foster integrative, intentional learning, providing opportunities for undergraduate research, complementing the majors, and encouraging the application of knowledge in the world. Pathways focus on a wide range of themes including American studies; applied ethics; beauty; children, family, and society; cinema studies; democracy; design thinking; the digital age; food, hunger, poverty, and the environment; gender, globalization, and empire; gender, sexuality, and the body; global health; human rights in a global world; Islamic studies; justice and the arts; law and social justice; leading people, organizations, and social change; paradigm shifts; politics and religion; public policy; race, place, and social inequalities; sustainability; values in science and technology; and vocation. Student progress through the structure of the Core Curriculum is not strictly sequential, from Foundations through Explorations to Integrations. While some courses (e.g., Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2; Cultures & Ideas 1, 2, and 3; and Religion, Theology & Culture 1, 2, and 3) must be taken in sequence, all students have the opportunity to dis - cover other sequences that are best for their individual undergraduate experience. At the same time, all students engage in coursework designed to help them achieve the shared set of learning objectives for each component of the Core Curriculum. Furthermore, the Experiential Learning for Social Justice, Advanced Writing, and Pathways components of the Core Curriculum help students experience requirements not only as individual courses but as related educational activities that help structure and integrate their entire experience of university study.THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 13 The Core Curriculum Guide provides more detailed information about each component of the Core Curriculum, the learning goals and objectives associated with each component, and the courses from which students may choose. An online version is available at www.scu.edu/core. The Core Curriculum and the College of Arts and Sciences Students in the College of Arts and Sciences should consult Chapter 3 for the require - ments for their majors. There are no additional college-wide requirements beyond the requirements for the Undergraduate Core Curriculum. The Core Curriculum and the Leavey School of Business Leavey School of Business requirements determine how students in the business school satisfy some Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements\u2014some Core Curriculum requirements must be fulfilled with specific courses. Students in the Leavey School of Business should consult Chapter 4 for the complete list of requirements for the majors and the school. The Core Curriculum Guide provides additional information. The Core Curriculum and the School of Engineering Students in the School of Engineering satisfy their mathematics and natural science requirement with courses required by their majors; their second language requirement is met by Santa Clara's entrance requirements. Some sections of Core courses in Social Science, Diversity, Cultures & Ideas 3, and Religion, Theology & Culture 2 and 3 will allow engi - neering students to satisfy two requirements with one course, with the understanding that other coursework for their majors will complete the acquisition of knowledge and skills required in the Core. Engineering students will complete their Pathways with three courses. Core Curriculum Policies A single course may satisfy only one Core requirement with the following exceptions: Some students satisfy some requirements with more than one course, each of which par - tially completes the requirement. Those courses are identified in CourseAvail as \"xxxPAR\" because they \"partially\" fulfill a requirement. Engineering students may satisfy more than one requirement with one course when the course has been approved for those Core require - ments. All students may satisfy major requirements with Core courses when the courses are approved for both the major and the Core. All students may satisfy Integrations require - ments with courses that satisfy other Core and major requirements when the courses are approved for the Integrations requirements as well as for the other Core and major requirements. Many courses offered through the study abroad program are pre-approved to fulfill Core Curriculum requirements. Neither the first nor third level Core Curriculum requirement in Religion, Theology & Culture can be fulfilled with a study abroad course. Transfer Credit and the Core Curriculum T wo sets of rules for awarding transfer credit for Core areas are in place, one for students admitted as freshmen and another for transfer students. All students must satisfy the following Core requirements at Santa Clara University: Civic Engagement; Science, Technology & Society; a minimum of two Religion, Theology & Culture courses; Advanced Writing; Experiential Learning for Social Justice; and Pathways.14 THE SANT A CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Students admitted as freshmen must also satisfy Critical Thinking & Writing and Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2 with courses completed at Santa Clara University. In contrast, students admitted as transfers are encouraged to complete these courses before their first quarter at Santa Clara. For transfer students only, transfer credit for Critical Thinking & Writing may include exemptions granted at other schools and credit granted through Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate test scores. Information about possible substitutions for Critical Thinking & Writing and Cultures & Ideas courses is available in the Registrar's Office. T ransfer students who enter the University with fewer than 44 units must take all three Religion, Theology & Culture courses in the required sequence. Students matriculating with 44 or more units of transferable college credit, which does not include any Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate test credit, complete two courses from any two of the following three categories, in any order: Religion, Theology & Culture 1, 2, or 3. However, all students except Religious Studies majors and minors must complete 88 units before enrolling in Religion, Theology & Culture 3 courses. T ransfer students must declare their Pathways by the end of their third quarter at SCU. T ransfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with fewer than 44 units must take four courses to fulfill the Pathways require - ment. T ransfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with more than 44 units must take three courses to fulfill the Pathways requirement. All transfer students in the School of Engineering must take three courses to fulfill the Pathways requirement. More detailed Pathway guidelines are available at www.scu.edu/Pathways. Students who transfer to Santa Clara University should consult Chapters 7 and 8 as well as the chapters relevant to their school or college. RESIDENTIAL LEARNING COMMUNITIES Residential Learning Communities were established to foster integrated education within a community of scholars. By creating a culture in which students connect their aca - demic experiences with their social and residential ones, the learning communities enhance the education of the whole person and deepen the connection between learning and living as responsible members of a community. All entering first-year students, whether or not they live on campus, become members of one of eight theme-based Residential Learning Communities. Nonresident first-year students are given access to the residence hall in which their learning community is located so that they can participate fully in its programs. Students take at least one Core Foundations sequence in common with others in their learning community, enriching coursework and promoting the formation of study groups. Students also interact directly with faculty and staff and participate in theme-based co-curricular and extracurricular activities both on and off campus. Residential Learning Communities are primarily two-year communities, but some offer the opportunity for students to remain throughout their undergraduate careers. UNIVERSITY HONORS PROGRAM The University Honors Program provides a learning experience appropriate to students of exceptional academic talent and imagination. The program offers small seminar-style classes, especially in courses fulfilling the Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements. Admission to the University Honors Program is by invitation or application and considers the student's academic record, standardized test scores, recommendations, and any other information the student might provide about interests, goals, or experiences.THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 15 The program is organized as two distinct but related levels open to undergraduate stu- dents from arts and sciences, business, and engineering. Level I of the program accepts first-year students for a curriculum organized around courses that satisfy Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements applying to students in every field. The University Honors Program requires that all participants maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 or higher, and Level I participants must successfully complete a minimum of six pro - gram courses within the first six quarters of enrollment. Most participants complete Level I during their first year. Unless exempted by the director, Level I participants must fulfill specific Foundations courses in the Core Curriculum\u2014Critical Thinking & Writing, Cultures & Ideas, and Religion, Theology & Culture\u2014through special class sections arranged by the program. Participants are also strongly urged to satisfy Core Curriculum requirements such as mathematics, ethics, social sciences, natural sciences, advanced writ-ing, and advanced Religion, Theology & Culture with Honors Program sections. Participants in Level I normally continue to Level II, in which they complete a mini- mum of four additional program courses including a senior thesis or project. Students who have completed 32 or more units but not more than 88 units at Santa Clara may apply to enter Level II by contacting the Honors Program Office. Students joining the program at Level II complete six program courses including the thesis or senior project. Some Level II courses, while not limited to program participants, offer academic opportunities especially suitable for them. For both continuing and new participants, the thesis usually grows out of a regular or independent study course taken in conjunction with the participant's major, minor, or Pathway. Successful completion of the program at Level II becomes part of a student's permanent record and appears on academic transcripts issued by the University. Honors Program students have the opportunity to participate in the Honors Advisory Council. The University Honors Program is allied with the Office of Student Fellowships, which helps prepare students to compete for nationally competitive graduate fellowships such as Rhodes, Marshall, Fulbright, Mitchell, Goldwater, Udall, Jack Kent Cooke, and Gates Cambridge. A competitive annual award permits one Honors Program student to spend his or her junior year at Mansfield College, Oxford University. For information about courses offered through the University Honors Program, see Chapter 6, Interdisciplinary Minors and Other Programs of Study. LEAD SCHOLARS PROGRAM The LEAD (Leadership, Excellence, and Academic Development) Scholars Program provides for selected first-generation University students a smooth transition to life at Santa Clara. Participation in the program is by invitation. The LEAD Scholars P rogram forms a community of undergraduate peers and faculty dedicated to rigorous academic achiev ement and student leadership. LEAD Scholars have the opportunity to participate in the LEAD Council, a leadership group that provides programs, events, and other opportunities to serve the needs of the LEAD community. The program involves support as well as challenge throughout the four years, with a special emphasis on the first-year experience. The LEAD Scholars Program is committed to fostering an atmosphere of successful scholarship, com-munity engagement, and service. Social and academic programs include seminars, academic advising and support, peer mentoring, team building, and outreach to families. All LEAD scholars participate in LEAD Week, which is scheduled for the week immediately preceding the beginning of the fall term.16 THE SANT A CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM STUDY ABROAD Santa Clara University aspires to create a learning community that promotes compe - tence, conscience, and compassion among students with a mandate to pursue scholarly understanding and constructive engagement with the world. The mission of SCU Study Abroad is inspired by the challenge offered by martyred Salvadoran Jesuit Ignacio Ellacuria: We, as an intellectual community, must analyze causes; use imagination and creativity together to discover remedies; communicate to our public a consciousness that inspires the freedom of self-determination; educate professionals with a conscience, who will be immediate instruments of transformation; and continually hone an educational institute that is academically excellent and ethically oriented. Undergraduate students can choose from nearly 200 SCU Study Abroad opportunities in over 50 locations. Credits earned from all approved SCU Study Abroad programs can fulfill major and minor requirements with the approval of the chairperson of the depart - ment, Core requirements with the approval of the Director of the Core Curriculum, or serve as elective credit. DOMESTIC PUBLIC SECTOR STUDIES PROGRAMS The Public Sector Studies Program at Santa Clara University offers an introduction to the areas traditionally known as public policy, public administration, public affairs, and urban planning. It is designed to provide a closer look at the creation, implementation, and analysis of public policies, and the operation of government, public, and nonprofit organi - zations. The program also provides an excellent foundation for those who would like to pursue graduate studies in public policy or public administration and an alternative perspective for students who wish to pursue public law. Opportunities for Firsthand Study Through the Public Sector Studies program in the Department of Political Science, students have the opportunity to participate in public sector internships, the Washington Semester Program, and the Panetta Institute's Congressional Internship program. These programs offer preparation and training for students interested in working at the city, county, state, or federal level of government, in a public agency or nonprofit organization, or considering graduate-level studies in related fields. Internships Perhaps the best way to understand is by doing\u2014students participating in public sector internships not only observe what happens in the \"real world,\" but they are able to take part as well, gaining invaluable experience and knowledge. Placements in public sector intern - ships have included the San Jose mayor's and City Council members' offices, district offices of members of Congress and the California Legislature, government relations departments of high-tech corporations, public law offices including the Santa Clara county Public Defender and District Attorney, political campaigns, and nonprofit organizations. Many students end their internships with excellent employment prospects.THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 17 The Washington Semester Program In the Washington Semester Program, students combine coursework taken at American University with hands-on experience via internships. In the past, SCU students have interned at the White House, the Justice Department, the FBI, interest groups, broadcast news stations, various nonprofit organizations, and offices of members of the U.S. House of Representatives. The Washington Semester Program offers students the opportunity to live, study, and work in our nation's capital for one semester along with students from other U.S. states and from countries abroad. Numerous programs of study are available, including American Politics, Public Law, U.S. Foreign Policy, International Environment and Development, Economic Policy, Journalism, International Business and T rade, Peace and Conflict Resolution, and Contemporary Islam. Several programs include a three-week international travel component along with study in Washington. Students participating in the Washington Semester Program earn 22.5 to 24 quarter credits for one semester of study. Grades and units received at American University will count toward the student's SCU grade point average and course requirements for the department and the University when appropriate. The Panetta Institute's Congressional Internship Program The Leon and Sylvia Panetta Institute for Public Policy at California State University, Monterey Bay, founded by Santa Clara political science alumnus Leon Panetta, offers an opportunity for students to gain an inside look at the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government and Washington politics. This Congressional internship begins with a two-week course at California State University, Monterey Bay, where students work directly with seasoned veterans examining the legislative process and its functions. The remaining two-and-a-half months of the internship are spent in Washington, D.C. working on Capitol Hill in the office of a member of the California Congressional delegation. One exceptional Santa Clara University student is chosen each year for this fully subsidized internship. Eligibility To be eligible to participate in one of these Public Sector Studies Programs, students must have completed at least 88 quarter units of credit by the date that the program of study begins, must not be on academic or disciplinary probation, and must be in good financial standing with the University. Students must also meet grade point average and other eligi-bility requirements for the specific program.

SCU Presents Arts for Social Justice is a collaborative and interdisciplinary initiative whose mission is to raise awareness about critical issues addressing the human condition. Through a wide variety of art forms, the initiative fosters dialogue and action within the University and local community. SCU Presents also encourages and supports the creative expression of Silicon Valley artists by providing performance venues for local arts organizations. The Future Teachers Project The Future Teachers Project (FTP), formerly known as the Eastside Future Teachers Project, works with students from traditionally underrepresented groups throughout Silicon Valley and the greater Bay Area who are interested in becoming teachers. Through innovative outreach and support programs, the goal is to develop leaders who will make an immediate impact on their communities. FTP scholars are generally recruited during high school and, once at SCU, are considered for the FTP scholarship. These funds may contribute to undergraduate studies and the credential program. FTP is administered by the Liberal Studies Program. ANTHROPOLOGY 21 DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY Professor Emeritus: George D. Westermark Professors: Mary Elaine Hegland, Gullette, Mythri Jegathesan, Lee Panich The Department of Anthropology offers a degree program leading to the bachelor of science in anthropology. A solid undergraduate foundation in anthropology secures the analytical skills needed to undertake professional degrees in anthropology, business, law, public health, social services, or provides a foundation for embarking on a number of other professional careers. The department also offers a minor, several emphases, and an honors thesis option. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling the Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of science degree, students majoring in anthropology must complete the following departmental requirements: ANTH 1, 2, 3 SOCI 1 ANTH 50 or ENVS 50 or POLI 50 ANTH 110, 112, 114, 198 F ive upper-division courses selected from the following four categories: biological (ANTH regional (ANTH 180-189). At least three of the four categories must be represented in the student's selection. An intr oductory statistics course S ix anthropology seminars Emphasis Programs in Anthropology Anthropology majors have the option of completing a special emphasis program to complement their majors. The emphasis is not a narrow specialization but reflects compe - tence in the subfields of the discipline. Completion of a special emphasis program will be noted on student transcripts with the approval of the department chair. The emphasis in applied anthropology prepares students to use anthropological knowl- edge to address critical human issues in careers outside academia through coursework and related internships, students will gain a better understanding of how anthropological knowl - edge and skills can be used in occupations related to health and medicine, international development, environment, government, business, education, immigration, and poverty. The emphasis in archaeology focuses on a deeper understanding of the human past and how it is studied. This is a possible course of study for majors with an interest in employ - ment in cultural resource management or graduate study in archaeology. The biological emphasis provides in-depth training in the field of biological anthropology. Students will acquire intellectual breadth and depth with regard to the interdisciplinary nature of anthro - pology and the biological and cultural interactions that have influenced human evolution and modern human diversity.22 COLLEGE OF AR TS AND SCIENCES REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must fulfill the following requirements for a minor in anthropology: ANTH 1 or 2 ANTH 3 O ne additional lower-division anthropology course ANTH 110 T wo approved upper-division anthropology courses F our anthropology seminars LOWER-DIVISION COURSES 1.

Morris, Andrea Pappas Assistant Professors: Karen Fraser, Takeshi Moro, Ryan Reynolds, Tobias W offord Senior Lecturer: Francisco \"Pancho\" JimenezLecturers: Renee Billingslea, Julie Hughes The Department of Art and Art History offers a degree program leading to the bachelor of arts in two undergraduate majors, art history and studio art, with courses in both disci - plines fostering a thorough understanding of the history and practice of art. Department faculty encourage interdisciplinary connections with the Santa Clara com - munity through course offerings that fulfill a wide range of College and Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements, as well as courses through the University Honors Program. ART HISTORY The art history major at Santa Clara is distinguished by excellent teaching and mentor - ing, challenging coursework, and opportunities for study abroad, peer educating, and stu - dent internships at local and Bay Area institutions. Moreover, we support, in conjunction with our fully accredited campus museum, Explore with Me, a docent-training program for our students. Advanced art history majors are encouraged to participate in our annual Art History Symposium and the Art History Research Paper Competition. The art history major features numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth to better understand the meanings and purposes of the visual arts, including its historic develop - ment, roles in society, and relationships to other fields in the humanities. Students learn to think critically and communicate clearly about works of art. The art history major develops the following skills: knowledge acquisition, critical thinking, analysis of visual and textual sources, advanced research and writing skills, and sophisticated oral presentations. These intellectual skills enable art history majors to pursue a diversity of interests in a wide spec - trum of fields and professions, including graduate work in art history. STUDIO ART Studio art majors develop comprehensive skills that help prepare them for graduate study or careers in either the fine or commercial arts. Faculty members emphasize the devel - opment of conceptual and technical competence, as well as critical analysis of the student's own work and that of others. By graduation, every student develops a body of original art - work to be exhibited in a senior show in the department gallery. Students are required to articulate an artist's statement reflecting their own engagement with the creative process, in conjunction with their senior show. Studio art majors take three art history courses and are encouraged to take one or more courses in 20th-century or contemporary art. The studio seminar is highly recom - mended for all studio art majors and should be taken in the third year when possible. At the end of each year, students are encouraged to submit their work to the Annual Student Art Exhibit, which is judged by an outside professional in the field of art. The department also oversees merit-based scholarships, which are usually given to outstanding students with junior status.ART AND ART HISTORY 29 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJORS In addition to fulfilling the Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in art history (ARTH) or studio art (ARTS) must complete the following departmental requirements: Major in Art History Students must complete 15 courses (13 ARTH and 2 ARTS): F our courses selected from the ARTH 20 series (ARTH 21-27) AR TH 100 (preferably at the end of sophomore year) AR TH 196 (capstone seminar) is required in senior year T wo lower- or upper-division ARTS courses F ive upper-division ARTH courses (no more than three may be taken abroad) T wo additional lower- or upper-division ARTH courses Note: Only 4 units of ARTH 93/193, may count toward the major.

Brunauer, Amelia Fuller ( Clare Boothe Luce Professor ), Amy M. Shachter, Steven W . Suljak Assistant Professors: Paul E. Abbyad, Grace Stokes, Korin E. Wheeler Senior Lecturer: Steven L. FedderLecturers: Geoffrey Dafforn, Stephen Reaney The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry offers three baccalaureate degrees: the bachelor of science in chemistry, the bachelor of science in biochemistry, and the bachelor of arts in chemistry. The curriculum is accredited by the American Chemical Society (ACS), the professional organization for chemistry. The program prepares students for further work in chemistry or biochemistry, either in graduate school or as professional chemists. In addi - tion, a chemistry or biochemistry degree is excellent preparation for careers in medicine, dentistry, law, engineering, business, and teaching. A minor in chemistry is also available. All bachelor of science degrees provide graduates with the background necessary to begin a career in chemistry or biochemistry at industrial and governmental laboratories, for admission to institutions offering graduate degrees in chemistry and biochemistry, and for admission to medical and dental schools as well as other professional programs in the health professions. The chemistry major provides equal training in all the disciplines in chemistry, and the biochemistry major combines training in chemistry with additional coursework in cell and molecular biology. The bachelor of science-ACS certified degrees meet all recom - mended standards for chemists and biochemists as mandated by the ACS. The bachelor of arts degree allows students the most freedom in choosing electives, and therefore is an excellent program for pre-medical or pre-teaching students. Students with a strong interest in the liberal arts or who wish to pursue subjects outside the standard science curriculum will benefit from this degree. The bachelor of arts degree can be effectively com - bined with a pre-law or business curriculum to provide excellent preparation for law or business careers in the technology sector. Undergraduate research is a critical component of our degrees and most of our majors conduct research in collaboration with faculty mentors. Research in the department has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund, the Dreyfus Foundation, and the Research Corporation.

The D emocratic Muse: Public Art in Athens and the United States This course will compare and contrast the function of publicly funded art in the two most celebrated Western democracies, classi - cal Athens and the United States. After ex-ploring the \"meaning\" of the Parthenon, students will discuss the civic role and the - matic significance of important (and usually controversial) examples of Greek and Ameri - can public art and examine what they have to say about imperialism war, religion, gen - der, and economic policy. In what way can the arts promote a civil society? How is art \"good\" for democracy, and vice versa? Should a democracy fund the arts, and if so, how? (5 units) 188. Justice: Ancient and Modern This course explores classical Greek concepts of justice both abstracted in philosophy and dramas and as practiced in the classical courtroom.

Dodson, Emile McAnany Professors: Laura Ellingson, Charles H. Raphael, Paul A. Soukup, (Pedro Arrupe, S.J. Professor and ( Ridder/ San Jose ) Assistant Professors: Justin Boren, Sreela SarkarSenior Lecturers: Barbara Kelley, Gordon YoungLecturers: Katherine Heintz, Andrew W. Ishak The Department of Communication offers a program of studies leading to a bachelor of arts in communication. The major prepares students for a wide variety of graduate studies and for careers in the communication industry. An academic minor is also available. Students explore the theories, research methods, responsibilities, institutional structures, and effects of mass communication, interpersonal communication, and computer-mediated commu - nication. The major also integrates theory with practice. We help students to apply their knowledge of the communication process to create their own speeches, films, television programs, journalism, Web content, and communication and marketing campaigns. Many of our students go directly to work in these fields after graduation. Because the communication field requires students to have a broad liberal arts education, students integrate courses in the Department of Communication with courses in other departments. Often, students complete a minor or take a number of courses in related dis-ciplines. To encourage students to explore global studies, the department accepts up to two approved study abroad courses toward completion of the communication course require - ments, usually as upper-division electives. All junior and senior students are encouraged to complete an internship at an off-campus media organization or other communication-related institution. Internships may be counted for course credit as a department elective. In their senior years, all communication majors synthesize their learning in the department by completing a scholarly thesis (on any aspect of communication) or an applied capstone project (in journalism, digital filmmaking, or public relations). Theses and capstone projects, which typically embody students' most advanced work, are suitable for submission as part of applications for graduate school and jobs. Students interested in communication, including nonmajors, enjoy a wealth of co- curricular opportunities. All students are encouraged to participate in one of the student-run campus media, including the student newspaper, radio station, and yearbook. Practicum courses allow students to gain academic credit for working in student media. Santa Clara Debate, one of the oldest forensic programs in continuous operation on the West Coast, provides a challenging and rigorous co-curricular activity designed to develop public speak - ing skills, critical thinking, and public policy analysis. Policy debate participants are eligible to apply for merit scholarships. All courses taken to fulfill requirements for the major or minor must be four or five units and must be taken for a letter grade, not on a pass/no pass basis. Practicum courses, numbered 190 through 195, do not count toward fulfillment of the communication major or minor.70 COLLEGE OF AR TS AND SCIENCES REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in communication must complete the following depart - mental requirements: COMM 1 COMM 2 or 2GL 30 COMM 40 or 40EL T wo upper-division communication theory courses (signified by the letter \"A\" in the course number) O ne upper-division communication applied course (signified by the letter \"B\" in the course number) T wo additional approved elective upper-division communication courses COMM 110 COMM 111 or 111G COMM 196 or 197 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must fulfill the following requirements for a minor in communication: COMM 1 or 2 T wo approved upper-division communication courses Thr ee additional approved communication courses (any combination of upper-division or lower-division courses) LOWER-DIVISION COURSES 1.

Field (Department Chair and Michel and Mary Orradre Professor), John M. Heineke, Kris J. Mitchener ( Robert and Susan Finocchio Linda Kamas, As one of the social sciences, economics studies how the choices we make as individu - als\u2014as consumers and producers, as savers and investors, as managers and employees, as citizens and voters\u2014combine to determine how society uses its scarce resources to produce and distribute goods and services. This practical discipline provides insights into important issues such as the determinants of wealth and poverty; unemployment, inflation, interna - tional trade, and economic growth; and success and failure in the marketplace. The rigor - ous, systematic analysis that the study of economics brings to bear on these and other real-world issues provides excellent preparation for careers in both the private and the public sectors, as well as for graduate study in economics, business, public policy, and law. Eco-nomics graduates pursue varied careers in business, law, banking and finance, government service, education, and private consulting. Students considering graduate study in econom - ics leading to a master's or doctoral degree are strongly encouraged to meet with their advisor as early as possible to plan an appropriate course of study.

W ater Resources L&L Worldwide, rivers are now so overtapped that they discharge little or no water to the sea for months at a time. As water levels in aquifers are declining, while water is still flowing freely and cheaply from our taps, we are wondering how much fresh water is available and how to best manage it. This course covers the fundamental concepts and analyses in hydrology and water resources management, such as runoff, flow in aqui - fers, snowmelt, evaporation, and infiltration. Using these concepts and basic physical and chemical principles, we will investigate issues of water cycling, use and abuse, pollution, and conservation. Interactions between water and human societies, ecosystems, agri-culture, natural resources, and climate are explored through domestic and internation - al case studies. The concepts are reinforced through indoor and outdoor laboratory ex-ercises. Laboratory 30 hours. Prerequisites: ENVS 21 or 23, or by permission of instructor . (5 units) 165. Climate Science and Solutions Students will gain an in-depth understand - ing of the physical processes involved in cli - mate change, as well as its socioeconomic consequences. The course also explores the strengths and weaknesses of policies and other tools used to mitigate or adapt to cli - mate change. Prerequisite: ENVS 23 or by permission of instructor. (5 units) 185. Garbology This class follows the path of our waste products as they are landfilled, burned, treat - ed, recycled, reused, dumped on minority communities, or shipped abroad. Building on basic chemical and biological principles, we explore the ultimate fate of organic and inorganic waste. We look to the past and to other societies to better understand how we got to this throw-away society and what we can learn from past practices and other cul-tures. We explore sustainable solutions in-cluding new efforts to reduce our waste such as \"extended producer responsibility,\" 114 COLLEGE OF AR TS AND SCIENCES design-for-disassembly, green chemistry, and zero waste. Students will also learn how to utilize the \"life cycle analysis\" approach as a basis for those daily decisions such as paper versus plastic. Prerequisite: ENVS 23. (5 units) 195.

Lai, Anna Sampaio Assistant Professor: Anthony Hazard The Ethnic Studies Program provides a critical analysis of historical and contemporary formations of race, ethnicity, class, and gender. In the pursuit of social justice, it challenges dominant views of racial and ethnic groups that lead to inequalities. Ethnic studies focuses on the roles and experiences of African Americans, Asian/Pacific Islander Americans, Latinas/Latinos, and Native Americans within the framework of the United States and within trans-national frameworks. As an academic program, ethnic studies fosters interdisciplinary inquiry. The faculty comprise a community of expert scholars of critical race and ethnic studies, while serving as teachers, mentors, and role models for undergraduate students. Ethnic studies strives to make connections between University learning, racial and ethnic communities, and social change, and encourages a reflective engagement with society and a commitment to fashion - ing a more humane and just world. The Ethnic Studies Program serves as a resource for students, faculty, and staff across the University who are interested in examining race and ethnicity and its intersections with class, gender, citizenship, and nationality. The program offers both a companion major and a minor in ethnic studies: a student must declare a primary major in another discipline as well as companion major in ethnic studies. The companion major is designed to complement a student's primary major by broadening the field of study to include an academic focus on race/ethnicity. It enhances a student's employ - ment opportunities in business, education, law, medicine, social work, and government. For those considering graduate school, the companion major and minor provide a foundation for graduate studies particularly for those who seek to become university professors and researchers with a specialization in a variety of issues and policies impacting U.S. racial and ethnic communities. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling Undergraduate Core Curriculum and primary major require- ments, students with a companion major in ethnic studies must complete the following requirements: ETHN 5 T wo courses from ETHN 10, 20, 30, 40 O ne of the following breadth electives: ANTH 86, 90; DANC 62; ENGL 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 69; ETHN 35, 36, 50, 51, 55, 60, 65, 70, 95, 96; MUSC 20; RSOC 88; THTR 14, 65 F our upper-division courses from ETHN 112, 120, 121, 122, 123, 125, 126, 134, 135, 141, 142, 149, 152, 153, 154, 155, 157, 160, 161, 162, 178, 185, 197, 198, 199 Thr ee upper-division courses 175; 161, 189116 COLLEGE OF AR TS AND SCIENCES Capstone r equirement including two courses: - A methods course in the primar y major - ETHN 198 or 199, a community internship, creative project, or directed reading in which the student simultaneously works on a research paper or project under the direction of an ethnic studies core or affiliated faculty.

(4 units) 55. C ross-Racial Electoral Politics Examination of the historical and contem-porary political movements among the major minority groups in the United States since the 1960s. The origins and goals of the Black Power movement, the Chicano/a movement, the Asian-American movement, and the Native American movement will be focused on during the quarter. Each of these movements embodies similar and different trails with regard to their respective group's quest for political power and elected repre - sentation. Due to contemporary immigra - tion trends, Latinos and Asian Americans have challenged the black-white paradigm that has traditionally defined U.S. racial politics in local- and state-level politics. The result, in some instances, has been interracial competition and conflict at these levels. The necessary elements needed to build and to sustain multiracial coalitions along with what the political future holds for these mi - nority groups will be addressed. Also listed as POLI 55.

African-American Independent Filmmakers This class provides an in-depth analysis and historical overview of independent African-American filmmakers who made significant contributions to the genre of film. We will examine how African-American filmmakers used film as a medium to heighten the con - sciousness of their audience, combat nega-tive stereotypes, give voice to marginalized or underrepresented groups, and raise social awareness about issues affecting their diverse communities. Using film and text, we will read, discuss, and write about paradigms that lead to inequity and injustice. Specifi - cally, we will examine the intersection of gender, race, and class, and note how these dynamics are illustrated in the cinema of African Americans. We will also understand how African-American filmmakers were able to rise above adversity and hone and sustain their art, while confronting their myriad op-pressions. (4 units) 96. R ace, Class, and Culture through Film Explores how filmmakers who are concerned about racism portray the politics, history, and culture of people of African descent. Ex - amines how this medium can humanize sub - jects who are often objectified and exploited and give voice to communities whose per-spectives and opinions have been historically excluded from mainstream discourses. Con - siders how films can interrogate the physical, ETHNIC STUDIES 119 cultural, and sometimes, psychological bru - tality of racist practices, as well as the ways that racism intersects with other forms of marginalization related to class, gender, sex - uality, and citizenship. The content, produc - tion, and distribution of these cinematic portraits illuminate the political philoso -phies, hybrid cultures, and emancipating collective action of black communities. Inte - grates students in faculty research by involv- ing students in a documentary film project about the relationship between the social movements for African liberation and black power. (4 units) UPPER-DIVISION COURSES 112.

Latina/o I mmigrant Detention and Incorporation in the Age of T errorism This class will examine shifts in immigration politics with specific focus on the largest population of immigrants in the U.S., namely Latinas/os. In the course of this ex - amination, we will pay particular attention to changes occurring after 1996 and the in - creasing scrutiny of both documented and 120 COLLEGE OF AR TS AND SCIENCES undocumented immigrants that has led to surges in the numbers of immigrants de- tained, apprehended, incarcerated, and de-ported. We will be mindful of the gendered, class, and racialized dynamics at work in the development and execution of new immi-gration policy, and we will examine the effect of these shifts on concepts of citizenship. In the end, the course will compel students to consider the moral, political, and legal impli - cations of an immigration policy focused disproportionately on enforcement and challenge them to find comprehensive alter - natives. (5 units) 129. M exican Popular Catholicism and Gender From the perspective of the sociology of reli - gion, this course contextualizes the lives of Chicanas/Mexicanas in Mexican popular Catholic tradition, practices, and belief system with particular attention to race, class, gender, and sexuality. This course repositions femi - nist analysis from a brief acknowledgement of the influence of Mexican popular Cathol - icism in the lives of Chicanas/Mexicanas to a much more encompassing critical analysis of exactly how Catholicism influences women's everyday experiences. Through the use of case studies and secondary research, students will explore the creative and complex ways Chicanas/Mexicanas participate in the workforce, in politics, in public life, and at home as people of faith.

The H istory of Hip Hop As Chuck D of Public Enemy once said, \"Rap both dictates and reflects.\" This course will examine the historical contexts and dia - sporic flows that have shaped (and been shaped by) one the most important cultural forms on the planet. We will examine the multicultural roots/routes of rap and hip hop from its West African bardic traditions to Caribbean and African-American oral tra - ditions; study the development of rap as a musical genre extending from soul, funk, and disco styles; analyze the musical and ver-bal traits of rap music as exemplary of an urban street/hip hop aesthetic; discuss its influence on musical technology (i.e., sam - pling) and cultural influences in the mainstream; investigate concepts of authen - ticity as well as philosophical and political ideologies; review controversies and debates concerning rap music's articulations of race, gender, and sexuality; and examine the glob - al impact of hip hop culture. Musical exam - ples and video documentaries will be used in conjunction with class lectures, discussion, and presentations by guest artists. (5 units) 134. B lack Social Movements Black social movements consistently chal - lenge the marginalization of communities of African descent. In the process of contesting the legitimacy and consequences of physical terror, economic exploitation, and cultural misappropriation endured by their commu - nities, social movements throughout the African diaspora have created many of the philosophies, repertoires of collective action, and aesthetic traditions that lay at the core of our understanding, and imagination, of black life and political dissent. Students will closely examine the work of two historical social movements in the African diaspora\u2014Black Power and African Liberation\u2014which envisioned freedom, justice, and self-deter - mination for black communities. Students will learn about the ideas, tactics, and lega - cies of these movements by conducting in - terviews with Black Power and African Liberation activists. In addition, students will evaluate the work of black social move - ments that are currently organizing in their communities. Through research, readings, and class discussions, students will interro-gate both the iconography and vilification of black social movements and their impact on race and politics in the present day. (5 units) 135. African A mericans in Postwar Film This course examines the presence of African Americans in mainstream Hollywood films during the postwar period. How did Holly - wood representations of African Americans change after World War II? What shifts and continuities occurred during the postwar ETHNIC STUDIES 121 period? And how did those changes reflect the ebbs and flows of civil rights activism through the 1970s? The goal of this course is to gain a deeper understanding of broader social and historical change by engaging the politics of race through a core aspect of American popular culture. Also listed as HIST 185. (5 units) 141. A sian-American Women An examination of Asian-American women from a historical and contemporary frame - work within U.S. society. Focuses on the struggle for identity and adjustment in the first generation and the conflicts with subse-quent generations of Asian-American women.

Also listed as WGST 111. (5 units) 142. A sian-American Communities An examination of selected topics affecting Asian Americans in the United States. Issues include the changing nature of communi - ties, community institutions, anti-Asian vio - lence, occupational glass ceilings, higher education, political mobilization, gender re - lations, identity formation, and the new patterns of Asian immigration. (5 units) 149. C ivil Rights and Anti-Colonial Movements This course examines the connections be-tween two historical developments often treated separately: the U.S. civil rights strug - gle and African anti-colonial movements. By placing these two movements in a transna - tional framework, the course explores the global challenge to the racialized world order of the 19th and early 20th century. How did the civil rights struggle gain momentum in the aftermath of World War II? What was the longer history and role of \"black nation-alism\" and Pan-Africanism in the transna - tional struggle? What were the connections between the civil rights movement and con -temporary independence movements in Africa and Asia? One of the central goals of the course is to show how we can expand our understanding of U.S. history by reaching beyond the interaction between the U.S. government and other nation-states to ex - amine political and cultural change. Also listed as HIST 153. (5 units) 150. U rban Education and Multiculturalism This course takes a critical multicultural ap - proach to understanding urban education, encouraging a connection between theory and personal experience and observations. With a focus on schools in large urban con - texts, this course centralizes the experiences of low-income, students of color. Race and class will be two critical lenses with which we will examine (1) the historical context of educational inequality, (2) current issues of educational inequity, and (3) the movement towards educational justice. Students should leave the course with a stronger understand - ing of the social and historical foundations of U.S. education. (5 units) 152. M ultiracial Identities This course focuses on multiracial identity constructs in African-American and Asian-American literature. Using journey as a met-aphor, the course seeks to define \"movement\" and \"place\" in contexts where physical, spiri - tual, voluntary, or forced journeys contrib - ute to the transformative possibilities of race, class, gender, and identity.

Activities, self- reflection, lecture, and discussion will be used to explore student identity, the history of higher education, college access and reten-tion, campus climate, and student develop-ment. Also listed as WGST 114. (5 units) 158. R ace, Gender, and Politics in the News Journalism aims to serve democracy by in - forming the public about important issues, lifting up seldom-heard voices, and encour-aging participation by all. This course exam - ines the news media's role in the political sphere as part of an increasingly diverse soci - ety. How do the news media influence our perception about race and gender, particu - larly in the political realm? How well do journalists report on policies that influence people differentially according to race or gender? Prepare to participate with your whole self in an exploration of these ques-tions and more. Also listed as COMM 168A and WGST 117. (5 units)159.

D ocumentary Making for Social Justice This creative course provides students the opportunity to write, dissect, and produce their own 10-minute documentaries that are committed to social justice. In addition to producing their own films, students will ex - amine how documentary filmmakers use film as a medium to heighten the conscious - ness of their audience, combat negative ste - reotypes, give voice to marginalized or underrepresented groups, and raise social awareness about issues affecting their diverse communities. Reading film as \"text\"\u2014com-plete with their own arguments, aesthetic concerns, social, political, and historical in - fluences\u2014we will understand how docu-mentaries are used to illumine disparities or confront issues of inequity and injustice. Specifically, we will examine the intersection of gender, race, class, spirituality, and sexual - ity, and note how these dynamics function in film to enlighten our global community. Writers in this course will be moved from idea to script and, ultimately, film. (5 units) 161. C reating Diverse College-Going Communities In this course, students will develop an un - derstanding of diversity issues in college ac - cess, reflect on their own experiences, utilize this knowledge to develop workshop curric-ulum to enhance college-going, and then implement this curriculum in high school classrooms as a community-based learning opportunity. This course introduces stu-dents to the background of colleges and uni - versities in the United States, (including history, institutional types, and diverse stu-dent representation), then explores the many factors that influence college access and ex - periences in college (including class, race, gender, first generation college student sta-tus, financial aid and admissions processes). ETHNIC STUDIES 123 Students will reflect on their own college ap- plication and selection process and their ex - periences in college. Using this knowledge, students will engage in community-based learning (CBL) in which they provide col-lege-related tutoring, mentoring, and work-shops for high school students. (5 units) 162. Div ersity and the Media This course focuses on the complex, chang - ing, dynamic, and powerful relationships between dominant and underrepresented groups in society, the mass media, and broader social contexts; and discusses media representations of social groups, contexts of media production, and media use among underrepresented groups. The concepts of hegemony, power, social construction, and intersectionality are vital for understanding these relationships, and vital for the course. The course connects to the field of cultural studies in that it focuses on the everyday uses of symbolic forms and aims to make stu - dents aware of, and sensitive to, some of the dynamics connected with media images, symbolic power, and the production of meaning in today's world. Students are en - couraged to formulate, question, and put into context, their own versions of reality. Also listed as COMM 121A. (5 units) 164.

R ace and World War II World War II stands as one of the most ex-plosive moments in U.S. and global history in the 20th century because of the myriad ways the conflict influenced the postwar world. The United States emerged from the war as the premiere global superpower in terms of combined military, diplomatic, and financial supremacy. However, the United States found itself under increased scrutiny due to its history and maintenance of struc - tural or institutionalized racism. In the midst of military and ideological conflict against the Nazi regime in Germany, and addressing the claims of civil rights and anti-colonial activists, the United States became a com-posite site of the tensions that defined a democratic society struggling with ongoing racism. This reading seminar explores these tensions, which were exacerbated by the rise of anti-racist perspectives in the anthropo - logical and biological sciences just preceding the war. The assigned readings and discus - sions engage these phenomena in order to properly explore the significance of \"race\" in the World War II era. Also listed as HIST 178. (5 units) 185.

The H aitian Revolution in World History and Memory Between 1789 and 1804, the French Carib - bean colony of Saint-Domingue was the site of the most profound and violent realization of the revolutionary spirit sweeping the At - lantic in the \"age of democratic revolutions.\" This era is usually associated with the French and American revolutions, both key events in the history of democracy and the rhetori - cal development of human rights as an agen-da in the West. However, both stopped short of the most radical realization of the prom - ises of the age of Enlightenment, particularly with regard to slavery and the racial discrim - ination that went along with it. The slave revolt on Saint-Domingue and the Haitian revolution, by contrast, witnessed the fullest realization of these promises in the form of the only successful slave revolt in human his - tory. The events on Hispaniola took place at the nexus of world historical forces of global - ization through commerce, cross-cultural encounter, racial mixing, and the dispersal of radical Enlightenment ideas and their real - ization in the form of revolution. As a result of the powerful currents of human history that flowed through the region, the Haitian revolution has proved to be an enduring source of both fear and creativity in the his - tory of race relations, slavery, and abolition, and the forging of a new world identity for the descendants of the once enslaved popu - lations of the island.

(1-5 units)MODERN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES 153 DEPARTMENT OF MODERN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES Professor Emeritus: Victor B. Vari Professors: Rose Marie Beebe, Francisco Jim\u00e9nez (Fay Boyle Professor), Catherine R. Montfort, Associate The Department of Modern Languages and Literatures offers courses in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, as well as degree programs leading to the bachelor of arts in French and Francophone Studies, German Studies, Italian Studies, or Spanish Studies. Honors programs are available for French and German majors. In addition, the department offers minors in French and Francophone studies, German studies, Italian studies, Japanese studies, and Spanish studies. The courses are designed to help students achieve proficiency in both the oral and written language and to provide them with an understanding of the experiences, values, and traditions of those peoples whose languages are studied. Courses range from beginning language to linguistics, from an introduction to literary texts to advanced courses in literature and culture. All courses are open to any student with the requisite preparation. A few courses in literature and culture offered by the department are taught in English and are open to all students. Some of these courses may be used as credit toward a major or minor in French and Francophone studies, a major or minor in German studies, or a minor in Japanese studies. However, these courses in English will not fulfill the Undergraduate Core Curriculum foreign language requirement. Students may fulfill their second language Core Curriculum requirement by successfully completing a proficiency examination in a modern foreign language at the level for their program of study. Students who have never studied the language in which they wish to enroll, or who have studied that language for one year in high school, should register for Elementary Language 1. Those who wish to continue in a language that they have studied for two years in high school should enter Elementary Language 2. Students with three or more years of study in a single language, those who wish to continue language study beyond the second language requirement, or those who feel following the formula would place them in a higher- or lower-level course than their background warrants should consult a member of the appro - priate language faculty for placement advice. Students having the necessary proficiency, as demonstrated by an interview with a member of the language faculty, may enroll in higher-numbered courses than those of the placement formula. Once proficiency has been estab - lished, lower-division students may enroll in upper-division courses with the permission of the instructor. Such courses will be counted as fulfilling major or minor requirements. Courses numbered 1 through 102 are not open to challenge; for courses numbered above 102, consult the individual listing. For more information about placement and/or proficiency, please visit the department's website. Study abroad is a valuable enhancement of the undergraduate experience and is particularly recommended for students pursuing a major or minor in a foreign language. Both the Office of International Programs and the student's foreign language advisor should be consulted to ensure appropriate integration of the work done abroad into the student's program of study.154 COLLEGE OF AR TS AND SCIENCES REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJORS In addition to fulfilling Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in modern languages and literatures must complete the following departmental requirements for their specific major: Major in French and Francophone Studies FREN 100 and 101, or depar tment-approved substitutes A t least one course in French or Francophone literature R emaining electives in French or Francophone studies to total 40 quarter upper- division units chosen with the approval of the student's major advisor.

Felt, S.J., William J. Prior Professors: Philip J. Kain, Michael MeyerAssociate Professors: Christopher B. Kulp, Scott LaBarge, Lawrence Parent, Mark A. Ravizza, S.J., Shannon Vallor ( Department Chair) Lecturers: Brian Buckley, Erick Ramirez, Justin Remhof The Department of Philosophy offers a degree program leading to the bachelor of arts in philosophy. Philosophy inquires directly into the relation of human beings to the world: what we are, how we know, what values are, how we live. Worth pursuing for its own sake, philosophical inquiry also promotes analytical thinking and precise expression and, thus, is excellent undergraduate preparation for a number of professional careers, such as law, government, writing, social work, and computer programming. To qualify for honors in philosophy, the major ordinarily must have a 3.5 grade point average in philosophy courses and complete PHIL 197 with a grade of A- or better. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in philosophy must complete the following departmental requirements: T wo lower-division courses from PHIL 2-10, 11A, 12A, 60-89 P HIL 25 or 27 P HIL 51, 52, 53, and 90 T wo courses from different historical periods: PHIL 131 (ancient), PHIL 132 (medieval), PHIL 133 (modern), and PHIL 135, 136, 137, 139 (contemporary), or PHIL 134, 139 O ne course from PHIL 120-129 O ne course from PHIL 125 or 140-149 F our additional upper-division courses from PHIL 109-199 Emphasis in Pre-Law The pre-law emphasis in philosophy is intended to help provide the skills of analytic reasoning and conceptual investigation necessary for the study of law. Philosophical research hones the techniques of careful argumentation and logically disciplined reasoning essential to the legal analysis of cases and statutes. Also, emphasis on ethics courses will help prepare students for the study and analysis of normative issues. The pre-law emphasis may be taken as part of a philosophy major or minor. Requirements for the pre-law emphasis include: O ne course from PHIL 25, 27, 29, or 152 O ne course from PHIL 111, 113, 114, or 154 O ne course from PHIL 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 80, 109, 110, 112, 114, 115, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 129, 136, or 142 T wo additional courses from those in the three lists abovePHILOSOPHY 185 Emphasis in Ethics The ethics emphasis in philosophy is intended to provide students with a broad under - standing of ethical theory and the conceptual analysis of moral problems, including matters of social justice central to the Jesuit educational mission, and thus with the ability to reflect on their own ethical decisions and on their role as morally responsible members of the human community. The ethics emphasis may be taken as part of the philosophy major or minor.

The undergraduate major program in physics is appropriate preparation for graduate study in physics, astronomy and astrophysics, biophysics, environmental science, geological science and geophysics, medical physics and medicine, patent law, oceanography, and other fields. The engineering physics major is particularly appropriate for the applied science student who intends to do research and development, and/or attend graduate school in physics, applied physics, or various engineering disciplines. The engineering physics major covers a broad spectrum of courses in mathematics, engineering, and physics. This program empha-sizes, to a greater extent than the traditional engineering major, the physics fundamentals that are applicable to new technologies as well as to the more established ones. Research in the department currently is funded by the National Science Foundation, NASA, Research Corporation, and the Department of Energy. Majors in physics and engi - neering physics participate in faculty research projects through PHYS 198 (Undergraduate Physics Research). Advanced students also have opportunities for part-time employment assisting faculty in laboratory and related teaching activities. A student whose GPA is below a 2.5 must obtain approval from the department chair to declare a Physics or Engineering Physics major.

The department introduces students to the analysis of political behavior, values, institutions, and governments. It also offers preparation for various graduate and professional studies and for careers in public service. The department makes available opportunities to participate in a variety of programs that combine practical field experience and academic credit. It assists students in arranging academic credit for internships in local politics. Students may work for government agen - cies, legislative or judicial bodies, political parties, or politically related groups. The depart - ment regularly offers courses that combine local internships with classroom work. On the national level, Santa Clara is a member school of American University's Washington, D.C., program, in which students receive credit for internships and intensive seminars at the nation's capital. Santa Clara also participates in the Panetta Institute's Congressional Intern-ship Program, which fully subsidizes students who study and intern with the California Congressional delegation on Capitol Hill. On the international level, the department encourages student participation in the numerous University-operated and approved study abroad programs, especially those with internships. See the Domestic Public Sector Studies Programs section in Chapter 2 for additional details on public sector programs.

Stephens The Public Health Program in the College of Arts and Sciences offers the bachelor of science degree in public health science. The program also offers a minor degree in public health, and manages the Global Health Pathway of the University Core. The public health science (PHS) major is an interdisciplinary degree focused on the health of human populations and individuals. Students will gain a solid foundation in biol - ogy and chemistry to understand the functioning of the human body in health and disease. The major further explores the influences of environmental and social factors on human health through required and elective public health courses, as well as relevant courses in the social sciences and humanities. Through the senior capstone and mandatory internship, PHS majors engage in health-focused service and research projects that apply their educa - tion to real-world public health problems, and integrate learning across disciplines. Students are encouraged to study abroad to gain perspective on global health issues. Public health science majors will be well-prepared for careers, graduate education, or professional training in public health or health-related professions, including medicine and nursing. There are many career options in the field of public health, including healthcare administration, planning, and public policy; epidemiology and disease surveillance; clinical research and clinical trials management; health-related education and social work; health and science communication; and basic research. Students intending to pursue a medical degree, or post-graduate training in other health- related professions, should contact the University pre-health advisor to discuss prerequisites for admission to such programs. Many require a full year of physics coursework (e.g., PHYS 11-13 or 31-33) and completion of the organic chemistry series (CHEM 33) in addition to the requirements for the public health science major.

Associate Professors: Jerald R. Enos, Kimberly M. Hill, David J. Popalisky, Michael Zampelli, S.J. ( Karyn Connell, Pauline Locsin-Kanter, Patt Ness The Department of Theatre and Dance celebrates the creativity of the human spirit, offering a well-rounded education that leads to a bachelor of arts degree in theatre arts with emphases in either theatre or dance. The department also offers minors in theatre, dance, and musical theater (an interdisciplinary minor offered in collaboration with the Depart-ment of Music). The program emphasizes academic rigor, artistic discipline, and creative expression. All students work closely with faculty and staff mentors. Majors fulfill all requirements set forth by the Undergraduate Core Curriculum, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Department of Theatre and Dance. Theatre and dance are distinct but related areas of emphasis. While each has its own set of disciplinary standards and academic requirements, students in each emphasis share some common courses (e.g., Introduction to Performance Collaboration, Defining the Performing Artist, etc.) The theatre emphasis offers coordinated courses in acting, design, theatre history, dramatic literature, technical production, directing, and playwriting. Students with this emphasis will have a broad foundation in theatrical practice and may choose to focus their study in any of the aforementioned areas. The dance emphasis focuses on modern dance and choreography and provides additional training in ballet and jazz. Majors, in either emphasis, will complete their program with a senior project that demonstrates their proficiency in a chosen area. All students are encouraged to be creative in taking responsibility for their undergradu - ate education, working with advisors and mentors to plan programs that marry courses in their focus areas to other disciplines. Since courses in theatre and dance provide students with invaluable experience in collaboration, critical thinking, organizational management and effective communication skills, they may profitably combine a major in theatre arts with a major (or minor) in almost any other discipline\u2014especially, English, music, com - munication, art, psychology, political science, history, or business. Students also combine their theatre arts major with various education credential programs. A degree in theatre arts prepares students for a variety of career options. Some students pursue graduate study in specialized focus areas so as to become professional theatre or dance artists and teachers. Others pursue careers in professional theatre or dance companies immediately after graduation. Still others venture into the world of film, television, arts administration, education, and religious ministry. Many have used their performing arts experience to pursue careers in law, medicine, management, marketing and development. The performance season, sponsored by the department, includes four faculty-directed plays and two dance concerts, in addition to student-directed plays and dance recitals. Par - ticipation in these productions is open to all members of the University community\u2014stu - dents, faculty, and staff. Guest artists periodically direct, design, choreograph, and/or perform in productions with SCU students.250 COLLEGE OF AR TS AND SCIENCES REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling Undergraduate Core Curriculum and College of Arts and Sciences requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in theatre arts must complete the following departmental requirements: Emphasis in Theatre THTR 9, 10, 20, and 30 THTR 41A, 42B O ne course from THTR 31, 32, 33 THTR 185 O ne course from THTR 110, 112, 113, 116, 117, 118, 161, 167 DANC 159 or 189 Thr ee approved 5-unit upper-division theatre or dance electives 4 units of THTR 39/139 S enior Project may be fulfilled by one of the following courses: THTR 192, 195, 196, 197 (*see description below) Emphasis in Dance THTR 9, 10 and 30 DANC 42 or 45 (pr erequisite DANC 41 or 44 or permission of instructor) DANC 48 (pr erequisite DANC 47 or permission on instructor) O ne course from the third discipline not yet taken (modern, ballet or jazz) at level I, II or III DANC 67 DANC 49 DANC 143 and 146 T wo courses from DANC 140, 141, 142, 145, 147, or 148 DANC 162 or 166 DANC 159 or 189 2 units of THTR 39/139 S enior Project may be fulfilled by one of the following courses: DANC 192 or 193 (*see description below) *Senior Project: The Senior Project provides majors with the opportunity to demon - strate their progress in meeting the learning objectives established by the department.

Areas of inquiry include the participation of women in social and cultural production; the construction of gender and its role as a constitutive element of social, political, economic, and legal structures; feminist theory, and the development of ideas about femininities, masculinities, and sexualities. Gender is exam - ined as it intersects with class, sexuality, ethnicity, disability, age, and nationality. The pro - gram organizes several public events throughout the year focused on gender issues, including lectures, symposia, films, and informal gatherings. Many of these programs are produced in collaboration with other academic departments, student groups, and the University's cen - ters of distinction. The Women's and Gender Studies Program provides an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to understanding the social and cultural constructions of gender that shape the experiences of women and men in society. The curriculum offers a solid foundation in women's and gender studies, facilitating graduate study and careers involving gender justice concerns and preparing students for leadership roles in diverse workplaces and communi - ties.

Belotti (W.M. Keck Foundation Professor), Alexander J. Field (Department Chair and Michel and Mary Orradre Professor), John M. Heineke, Kris J. Mitchener (Robert and Susan Finocchio Professor), Associate Linda Kamas, As one of the social sciences, economics studies how the choices we make as individu - als\u2014as consumers and producers, as savers and investors, as managers and employees, as citizens and voters\u2014combine to determine how society uses its scarce resources to produce and distribute goods and services. This practical discipline provides insights into important issues such as the determinants of wealth and poverty; unemployment, inflation, interna - tional trade, and economic growth; and success and failure in the marketplace. The rigorous, systematic analysis that the study of economics brings to bear on these and other real-world issues provides excellent preparation for careers in both the private and the public sectors, as well as for graduate study in economics, business, public policy, and law. Economics graduates pursue varied careers in business, law, banking and finance, government service, education, and private consulting. Students considering graduate study in economics leading to a master's or doctoral degree are strongly encouraged to meet with their advisor as early as possible to plan an appropriate course of study.284 LEA VEY SCHOOL OF BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling Undergraduate Core Curriculum and Leavey School of Business requirements for the bachelor of science in commerce degree, students majoring in economics must complete the following departmental requirements: ECON 41 and 42 (satisfies OMIS 41 r equirement in the Leavey School of Business core.)

This program is open to electrical engineer - ing majors with an approved grade point average in electrical engineering, mathematics, and physics courses. Under the combined degree program, an undergraduate student begins taking courses required for a master's degree before completing the requirements for the bachelor's degree and typically completes the requirements for a master of science in electri - cal engineering within a year of obtaining the bachelor's degree. Undergraduate students interested in the combined degree program are required to apply for the program between February of their junior year and December of their senior year. Students in this program will receive their bachelor's degree after satisfying the full undergraduate degree requirements. To earn the master's degree, students must fulfill all the requirements for the degree, including the completion of 45 units of coursework beyond that applied to their bachelor's degree. No course can be used to satisfy requirements for both the bachelor's degree and the master's degree. However, completion of 10 or more units of coursework in electrical engineering taken for the master's degree satisfies the pro - fessional development requirement of the undergraduate program. The program of studies for the master's degree may include up to 20 units of electrical engineering upper-division elective coursework excluding ELEN 188 and 189. These undergraduate units can count toward a master's degree only if a grade of \"B\" or better is earned. Students who do not complete the combined degree program within six years of entering the University will automatically be transferred to the regular master's degree pro - gram. Although six years is the maximum timeframe for completing the combined degree, full-time students enrolling in February of their junior year normally complete both degrees within five years.

Musical theatre is prominent in America as art, entertainment, social commentary, and civic engagement; it therefore plays a part in Jesuit education of the whole person for the service of others. The objectives of this program include entry-level proficiency for a career in performance, enhancement in teaching, or further training in graduate school; audition techniques; performance of acting, singing, and theatrical dance; and knowledge of the cultural history and various forms of musical theatre. The student may pursue and declare one of two tracks: American musical theatre or lyric theatre (opera/operetta).

It demands a blend of analytical and creative skills. The minor in retail studies offered by the Retail Management Institute is an excellent immersion experience that prepares students for a diverse set of careers including e-commerce, buying, merchandising, planning and allocation, digital marketing, and supply chain management. The program is open to all University undergraduates. Students entering the retail studies minor continue to major in their field of interest and receive their bachelor's degree in that field. Business majors get an opportunity to focus their studies and discover an exciting industry in which to build their passions. For many business majors, broad business theories develop deeper meaning as they are applied specifically to the retail industry. Innovations in Internet retailing and e-commerce provide great opportunities for MIS majors and students inter - ested in computer science. Retailing is at the forefront of trends in digital and mobile mar - keting, and social media. This provides a fertile ground for arts and science students to leverage their unique background. One of the most valuable and unique aspects of the retail studies minor is participation in an internship during the summer after the junior year. This immersion experience gives students insight into the retail industry and potential careers that are available. Students acquire experience through a full-time, 10-week paid or nonpaid internship at internationally recognized retailers such as the Gap, HUGO BOSS, Williams-Sonoma, Phillips-Van Heusen, and Nordstrom. A wide variety of internships meet diverse student interests and needs. The minor is composed of a set of core courses and either a strategic multichannel or online and digital retailing option based on the interests of the individual student. The core courses include a multichannel retailing class in the spring quarter of their junior year and a two-quarter advanced retail seminar in the fall and winter quarters of their senior year. The core classes cover topics such as digital marketing, branding, product development, category management, negotiation, social media business analytics, supply chain management, e-commerce, and pricing and promotion analysis. Nonbusiness majors are encouraged to apply for admission to the program during their freshman or sophomore year to allow time to integrate their course of study in retailing with the requirements in their major field. Business students who have completed the lower-division requirements can enter the program as late as their junior year. Students are admit - ted into the minor based on multiple criteria including a minimum GPA, proven analytical skills, and the ability to blend analytical and creative thinking.

Yet many people compartmentalize science, technology, and society as if they were three separate and distinct domains of human experience, rather than understanding them as mutually interpenetrating and reciprocally shaping each other. The science, tech - nology, and society minor seeks to cultivate a richer understanding of these three domains to foster scientific and technological leadership and citizenship in our contemporary world. Students are required to select one of three emphasis areas: information technology and society, science and technology for the common good, or science communication. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in science, technology, and society: F our classes in one of the three emphasis areas (information technology and society, science and technology for the common good, or science communication) Thr ee additional classes approved as undergraduate science, technology, and society courses Students must also attend or volunteer at four symposia, colloquia, or public events sponsored by the Center for Science, Technology, and Society, and write brief critical summaries for a pass/no-pass evaluation by the minor advisor.INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 377 Information Technology and Society Emphasis These classes address the role of computers, the Internet, and information technologies in modern society, and the transformative mutual influences in the relationships between society and these technologies.

Second, the minor focuses on societal problems such as poverty, crime, and prejudice, and how these issues impact today's youth and fami - lies. Through the urban education minor, students will critically evaluate the modern social challenges facing teachers and policymakers who struggle daily with how to strengthen the educational experience for children. This minor is recommended for students from diverse majors who are interested in careers that involve working directly with children and families from multicultural and multifaceted backgrounds. Students majoring in liberal studies may not minor in urban education. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in urban education: POLI 1 or HIST 96A or HIST 96B LBST 70, 106, 138, 198A/B PSY C 134 PSY C 185 or PSYC 172INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 379 OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY AEROSPACE STUDIES Professor: Lieutenant Colonel Douglas Lomsdalen (Chair) Assistant Professor: Captain Nicholas Carnovale Santa Clara University has an agreement with San Jose State University permitting Santa Clara students to enroll in a program leading to a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force (USAF). The Air Force Reserve Officer T raining Corps (AFROTC) program offers a high-quality educational experience for college students in Air Force orga - nization, history, officer skills, leadership and management, and national security policy and issues. Classes are offered on the San Jose State University campus. Integral to the curriculum are mandatory leadership laboratories. These weekly two- hour experiences provide a dynamic environment in which cadets develop leadership and management skills by planning, organizing, directing, and coordinating exercises. Physical fitness is also an important component to our training program, students/cadets are expected to meet twice a week (2 hours) to participate in group physical conditioning. LOWER-DIVISION COURSES AERO 1A. and B. F oundations of the U.S. Air Force AERO 1A and 1B introduces students to the United States Air Force and encourages par-ticipation in Air Force Reserve Officer T raining Corps.

INTERNATIONAL STUDIES Associate Provost for International Programs: Susan M. Popko The minors in International Business and International Studies offer students from all majors the opportunity to develop an international component in their undergraduate edu - cation. Both minors offer the opportunity to incorporate academic work completed during study abroad with coursework on campus. MINOR IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Director: John Toppel The minor in international business is designed to educate students in a broad range of management and business skills in a global context. The program includes coursework in language, social science, and international business and is open to all undergraduate stu - dents. The minor provides students with an understanding of the social, economic, and political context of international business, the language communication skills, and the busi - ness skills to be effective managers in a global marketplace. Students are encouraged to participate in a study abroad program or internship to complement this minor.INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 383 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Area Studies Emphasis Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in international business: Foreign Language O ne course from ARAB 23, CHIN 23, FREN 100, GERM 100, ITAL 100, JAPN 23, SPAN 23 Students who feel that they already have the required level of language competency must demonstrate such by completing one of the above (or a more advanced 100 or 101 level course).

Popko Students who pursue the International Studies Minor may examine themes or trends in globalization or intercultural communication or utilize the minor to add a global dimension or context to their major. The minor offers students the opportunity to pursue one of two emphases: the Area Studies emphasis in which students concentrate their coursework on selected geographic areas (Africa, Europe, or Latin America,); or the Thematic emphasis in which students concentrate their coursework on themes related to international or cross-cultural studies. The Area Studies emphasis may include a focus on Africa, Europe, or Latin America. The Area Studies emphases with a focus on Europe or Latin America each offer an interdis - ciplinary introduction to the cultures, languages, politics, and global challenges facing the region. The Area Studies emphasis with a focus on Africa also includes study of the African diaspora and related issues of slavery, colonialism, and globalization. The Thematic emphasis offers students the opportunity to examine broad international issues that transcend a single nation or geographic area. In the Thematic emphasis, the student has the opportunity to focus on a topic such as: poverty and development, global health, international law, international human rights, peace and conflict resolution, cross-cultural communication, international social justice in the arts, technology and globaliza - tion, the global dimensions of natural and physical sciences, diplomacy, gender and society, etc. Such subjects require systematic approaches distinct from the examination of single-nation or area studies. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR For the minor in international studies, students must complete the equivalent of four foundation courses plus an emphasis in either area studies or a theme as follows: Foundation Courses Foreign Language: T wo upper-division courses in a foreign language related to the chosen Area Studies or Thematic emphasis or the equivalent, as demonstrated through successful examination through the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures. Social Science: T wo relevant courses in anthropology, communication, political sci - ence, or sociology; one of which must be ANTH 3, 107A, SOCI 134. Capstone Course: A minimum of 20 hours in a class, academic internship, or community-based learning experience abroad. The course must include academic oversight and assessment.

Students develop their own themes and present a detailed proposal to the International Studies Committee for approval usually no later than the first quarter of their junior year. Students planning to incorporate academic work from a study abroad program should obtain approval prior to departure. SCU STUDY ABROAD Santa Clara University's SCU Study Abroad programs develop academic understanding alongside personal reflection and deep engagement in the local culture. Approved programs grow out of and extend the on-campus curriculum. During their first two years at Santa Clara, students build a foundation for the academic work they will pursue abroad. Students are encouraged to work with their academic advisor early to plan for study abroad, and to explore their goals with SCU Study Abroad staff in the Global Engagement Office. In addition, approved programs offer students opportunities to integrate with the host culture and to approach the country in which they reside for a semester as a local. Many programs allow students to pursue independent research, attend classes with local students, participate in service projects, or gain work experience through internships abroad which, in turn, can serve as a basis for senior capstone projects. Santa Clara is committed to encour - aging access to study abroad for underrepresented students, from underrepresented aca - demic disciplines, and in traditionally underrepresented geographic destinations. Therefore, students from all majors are eligible to apply to study abroad and students from the sciences and other underrepresented disciplines, in particular, are encouraged to apply. Likewise, Santa Clara students are strongly encouraged to pursue opportunities in traditionally under - represented geographic areas of the world.386 INTERDISCIPLINAR Y MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY SCU Study Abroad values diversity and inclusion and encourages students from all backgrounds to apply for study abroad. SCU Study Abroad is a privilege. The application process is competitive. Qualified undergraduate students are strongly encouraged to study abroad for a summer, quarter, or semester in a country and academic environment that will enrich their overall college expe - rience, contribute positively to the life of the University, and engender responsible participa-tion in a global, multicultural society. The selection process is designed to offer study abroad opportunities to those qualified students who have intentionally selected programs that will significantly advance their academic, personal, and professional goals. Credit earned on SCU Study Abroad counts toward the graduation requirement and with appropriate approval may fulfill major, minor, and Core requirements. Grades are calculated into the Santa Clara University GPA and all credit and grades appear on the Santa Clara University transcript. The University is committed to offering equal access to study abroad opportunities and therefore extends all available financial aid to students to support SCU Study Abroad. To apply for study abroad, students must be admitted to degree status at the University. Normally, students apply for study abroad 6 to 8 months prior to participation. Applica - tions are reviewed by the Global Engagement Office with faculty and staff from throughout the university. The Office reserves the right to redirect students to alternate programs due to institutional considerations. Students must have completed a minimum of 88 quarter units by the start of the academic program abroad. Normally, students participate in SCU Study Abroad during their junior or senior year. Sophomores with extenuating academic circum - stances may request an exception to the eligibility policy. Students must declare their major with the Office of the Registrar prior to submitting their Petition to SCU Study Abroad. A GPA of 2.75 is required to apply for off-campus study; the GPA requirement for individual programs may be higher. Students are expected to meet or exceed Santa Clara's requirements and that of their proposed program. The selection process may be competitive and mini - mally qualified students may not be approved. Priority admission may be given to appli - cants for Santa Clara's own programs, including exchanges. Students on academic or disciplinary probation are eligible to apply for study abroad, but probation must be cleared by the start of the program off-campus. The SCU Study Abroad application process is a two-step process and participation is contingent upon approval by the individual program, as well as the Santa Clara's Global Engagement Office. In addition, participation is contingent upon satisfactory completion of all program prerequisites and related courses, as well as satisfactory academic progress toward the student's major. Students who earn a grade of \"D\" or \"F\" in any course in the term preceding their pro - gram may become ineligible for off-campus study. Students must clear any outstanding balances with the Bursar's Office in accordance with the Bursar's Office payment schedule (see www.scu.edu/bursar/payment/) to remain eligible for participation. The University does not approve study in countries for which the U.S. Department of State (DOS) has declared a T ravel Warning (see www.scu.edu/studyabroad/safety/). Matriculated students who study abroad while withdrawn from the University are ineligible for financial aid and scholarships. Withdrawn students may be eligible to receive a maximum of 10 units of elective credit toward the graduation requirement, in keeping with the University's policy on transfer credit. No credit earned while withdrawn from the University may count toward a student's major, minor, or Core; students must receive approval through the on-campus application process to receive full major, minor, or Core credit for study abroad. Students should con - sult the policies governing units taken at other institutions in Chapter 8, Academic and Administrative Policies and Regulations.INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 387 SCU Study Abroad offers mandatory pre-departure orientation and re-entry meetings for all study abroad participants and provides resources related to health and safety, which are also available on the SCU Study Abroad website at www.scu.edu/studyabroad/.

(4 units each quarter)390 INTERDISCIPLINAR Y MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY MILITARY SCIENCE PROGRAM Professor: Lieutenant Major John Tiedeman (Director) Assistant Professor: Captain Alberto Frias The Military Science Program offers classes open to all Santa Clara students and the Bronco Battalion, an Army Reserve Officer T raining Corps (ROTC) battalion of cadets from Santa Clara University, Stanford University, and San Jose State University. The Military Science Program is designed to develop management skills and leadership abilities for suc-cessful careers in both the corporate world and the military. Students who complete the ROTC program are eligible for appointment and commissioning as officers in the Army Reserve. Reserve commissions are tendered in all basic branches of the Army. A board of officers determines the branch in which students are commissioned based on their prefer - ence, leadership potential, academic background, and the needs of the service. The military science core curriculum consists of six lower-division classes in the ROTC Basic Course and seven upper-division courses in the ROTC Advanced Course. Cadets may take a summer course (MILS 24) in lieu of the six lower-division courses. The professional military education of ROTC cadets consists of two components: a baccalaureate degree from Santa Clara University (or one of the cross-enrolled universities) and at least one undergraduate course from each of five designated fields of study. Prior to commissioning, cadets must take at least one course in military history. The curriculum is divided into ROTC Basic Course requirements and ROTC Advanced Course requirements. To proceed to the ROTC Advanced Course classes, students must complete either the six required ROTC Basic Course classes or attend a summer class at Fort Knox, Kentucky. The director of the Military Science Program must approve exceptions to this progression. ROTC Basic Course Requirements The ROTC Basic Course, Fundamentals of Leadership and Management, includes the first-year and second-year courses (MILS 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, and 23) designed for beginning students who want to qualify for entry into the ROTC Advanced course and for those students who may want to try military science without obligations. A student can also qualify for entry in the ROTC Advanced Course by completing the summer training camp (MILS 24). ROTC Advanced Course Requirements The ROTC Advanced Course, Advanced Leadership and Management, consists of the third-year and fourth-year courses (MILS 131, 132, 133, 134, 141, 142, and 143) open to students who have completed or earned placement credit for the ROTC Basic Course. Students must complete all courses numbered greater than MILS 130, to include MILS 134, a six-week Leader Development and Assessment Course during the summer, in sequence, unless otherwise approved by the professor of military science. The ROTC Advanced Course qualifies students for commissions as officers in the U.S. Army. Students who do not desire to compete for a commission as an officer in the Army may take these courses for academic credit with approval by the professor of military science. Leadership Laboratories Leadership laboratories, held weekly for three hours, are required of all students. Perfor - mance during lab periods is reflected in the student's course grade.

(3 units)394 INTERDISCIPLINAR Y MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY PRE-HEALTH SCIENCES Advisor: Steven L. Fedder Santa Clara University has an excellent reputation for preparing students for careers in the health sciences. Most incoming students tend to be focused on either allopathic medi - cine or dentistry, but a much broader spectrum of careers can be equally or more attractive including osteopathic medicine, physical therapy, optometry, pharmacy, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, public health professional, and others. A Santa Clara education provides ample opportunity to acquire the academic foundations in natural science required by med - ical schools, and its broad liberal arts Core Curriculum also serves to develop the commu - nication, personal interaction, and analytical skills needed both during medical school and in one's subsequent medical practice. Although Santa Clara does not have a pre-med major, the courses prescribed by the Council of Education of the American Medical Association can be incorporated into several academic majors. Most medical schools require: O ne year of general chemistry (CHEM 11, 12, and 13) O ne year of organic chemistry (CHEM 31, 32, and 33) O ne year of biology (BIOL 21, 24, and 25) O ne year of physics (PHYS 11, 12, and 13 or PHYS 31, 32, and 33) O ne year of mathematics, typically calculus (MATH 11 and 12), and a statistics course In addition, many students become more skilled and competitive by enrolling in two or three upper-division science courses, often but not exclusively in biochemistry, genetics, and human physiology, which are helpful in preparing for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). The combination of Core Curriculum requirements with the University's focus on community involvement and issues of diversity will prepare students well for the newly revised MCAT 2015, with its greater emphasis on social, economic, and psychological determinants of health. The choice of academic major is much less important than com - pleting the coursework above; however, many pre-health students select a natural science major such as biology, biochemistry, chemistry, or public health science. Students should thoroughly examine the Pre-Health Advising website at www.scu.edu/cas/prehealth, and should maintain regular contact with the pre-health sciences advisor throughout the under - graduate years for assistance with adjustment to college academic rigor and social life; an appreciation of the wide array of available health care careers; assistance with the balance between academics, social life, work, health community volunteering, and internships; and assistance with the relevant entrance examinations and application to graduate health science programs.INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 395 PRE-LAW Advisors: Brian Buckley, Lawrence Nelson, Terri Peretti, Susan Frisbie, Diana Morlang, Stefanus Hendrianto S.J. Santa Clara University provides a wide range of opportunities for undergraduates to build a strong pre-law foundation. Early in their undergraduate program, pre-law students should consult not only with their major advisor but also with one of the designated pre-law advisors. Consultation with a pre-law advisor familiarizes the student with the rigors of law school, the practice of law, the burden of law school debt, and the means to best secure employment as an attorney. Advisors will help formulate a program to prepare students for the complexity of the application process, including preparation for the Law School Admis-sion Test (LSAT). There is no specific major or curriculum required to qualify for law school admission. Successful law school applicants come from majors as diverse as anthropology, philosophy, communication, political science, physics, English, history, biology, and eco - nomics. Be advised, however, that preparation for the LSAT is aided by courses that deepen reading comprehension and promote logical reasoning. Overall, law school admissions offi - cers recommend undergraduate preparation in a major that demands discipline, analytical ability, research skills, close reading of texts, creativity, verbal skills, and precision in written and oral work. The departments of Philosophy and Political Science offer a pre-law empha - sis within the major (in philosophy, it is also available within the minor). Elective courses also provide valuable training and breadth of academic and analytical experience. Some elective courses strengthen specific abilities, while others provide perspective on legal issues and topics. Possible electives include, but are not limited to, the following: COMMUNICATION COURSES COMM 20. Public SpeakingCOMM 170A. Communication Law ECONOMICS COURSES ECON 126.

Voice I: Voice, Speech, and Presentation Skills PRE-TEACHING Director: Carol Ann Gittens Santa Clara University is accredited by the California Commission on Teacher Creden - tialing to offer professional preparation for prospective elementary school, middle school, and senior high school teachers. The Department of Education in the School of Education and Counseling Psychology offers graduate programs for the multiple-subject credential for elementary grades and the single-subject credential for secondary grades, both with a cross-cultural language and academic development emphasis. The teaching credential program at SCU is combined with a Masters of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree. Students interested in teaching should consider completing an interdisciplinary minor in urban education offered through the College of Arts and Sciences. The Future Teachers Project (FTP), formerly known as the Eastside Future Teachers Project, works with students from traditionally underrepresented groups throughout Sili - con Valley and the greater Bay Area, who are interested in becoming teachers. Through innovative outreach and support programs, the goal is to develop leaders who will make an immediate impact on their communities. FTP scholars are generally recruited during high school and once at SCU, are considered for the FTP scholarship, which contributes to undergraduate studies and the credential/MAT program. The FTP is managed through the Liberal Studies Program.INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 397 Preparation for Multiple-Subject Credential Students interested in a career in elementary school teaching should fulfill the require - ments of the liberal studies major with a pre-teaching emphasis in the College of Arts and Sciences. Those requirements can be found in Chapter 3, College of Arts and Sciences. Students must demonstrate the subject matter competency component for the multiple-subject credential by passing the California Subject Examination for Teachers (CSET) for Multiple Subjects. While students may sit for the examination whether or not they majored in liberal studies, both the examination and the liberal studies degree requirements are closely aligned with the state of California's elementary curriculum framework. Therefore, Santa Clara strongly recommends that students interested in being elementary school teach - ers major in liberal studies. An undergraduate minor in urban education is recommended for those students electing not to complete the liberal studies major. Students must also demonstrate basic educational skills by completing the Writing Skills exam that can be added to the CSET or by passing the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST). Preparation for Single-Subject Credential Students interested in a career in secondary school teaching in a particular subject matter area should fulfill the requirements of the academic major of their intended teaching specialization. California teaching credentials are available in the following subject areas: agriculture, art, biological sciences, business, chemistry, English, geosciences, health science, home economics, industrial and technology education, mathematics, music, physical e ducation, physics, general sciences, social science, world language (E nglish language devel - opment), and world languages other than English. Students must demonstrate specific sub - ject matter competency by passing the CSET in the subject area they desire to teach. Completing an undergraduate major in this subject area is not required but it is highly recommended. An undergraduate minor in urban education is also recommended. S tudents must also demonstrate basic educational skills by passing the CBEST. Selected California state credential coursework or examination requirements may be waived by successful completion of one or more specific undergraduate courses on the pro-visions and principles of the United States Constitution, such as POLI 1, HIST 96A, or HIST 96B. Requirements for Multiple-Subject and Single-Subject Credentials The minimum for the multiple-subject or single-subject teaching creden- tial include: A bachelor 's degree in a subject area from an accredited institution D emonstrated knowledge of the United States Constitution by completion of under - graduate coursework or passage of an approved examination D emonstrated basic educational skills (see sections above for specific program re - quirements) Completion of an appr oved program of professional education, including field expe - rience achieved through student teaching or internship Completion of a state-appr oved subject matter preparation program or passage of the CSET, a subject-area competency examination, in the area one plans to teach F or multiple-subject credential candidates only: Demonstrated knowledge of the various methods of teaching reading by passing the Reading Instruction Competence Assessment (RICA) examination398 INTERDISCIPLINAR Y MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY Fifth-Year Teaching Credential Program The multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential can be completed as part of the Masters of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program. This program requires a fifth year of study following the bachelor's degree and qualifies the student for a preliminary teaching creden - tial. The MAT program includes graduate coursework in educational foundations, curricu - lum design, teaching methods, and supervised student teaching. Students seeking additional information regarding the MAT program with a multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential should contact the Graduate Department of Education in the School of Education and Counseling Psychology.3997 Admission of Undergraduate Students Santa Clara University is a selective admission university that admits new students based on past performance and potential for future academic success and contribution to the campus community consistent with the mission and Jesuit tradition of the University.

Students who want to declare an academic minor must obtain the approval of the department chair or program director of the intended minor and submit a Program Petition form to the Drahmann Center. Some minors may require an application process and are limited based on space available. To be awarded a minor, a student must complete all requirements of the minor as prescribed. Requirements for a minor are binding and must be completed before a degree will be awarded. If a student decides to drop a minor, he or she must submit a Program Petition form to the Drahmann Center. Second Bachelor's Degree A student may earn a second bachelor's degree at Santa Clara University, but may not duplicate a degree (i.e., bachelor of arts, bachelor of science in a natural science, bachelor of science in a social science, bachelor of science in commerce, bachelor of science in engi - neering). Students whose first degree is from Santa Clara and who are interested in pursuing 406 A CADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS a second bachelor's degree concurrently or without interruption must have an academic record showing a strong probability of success and a proposed program of study for the second degree that fulfills the degree requirements in effect at their original date of matricu - lation. At least half of the units for the second degree must be in addition to those required for the first degree and must be completed through a Santa Clara program. Approval to pursue a second bachelor's degree must be granted by the Dean of Academic Support Services and filed with the Office of the Registrar. If a student is returning to the University after an absence, he or she must meet the criteria outlined above, but is subject to the degree requirements in effect at the time of re-entry. Approval from the Dean of Academic Support Services is required to resume studies for a second degree after an absence. Students whose first degree is from an institution other than Santa Clara must submit a formal application for admission to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. The applica - tion must specify that the second degree will not duplicate any other degree. Students admitted for a second bachelor's degree are subject to the degree requirements in effect at the time of admission. At least half the units required for the second bachelor's degree must be earned through a Santa Clara program. Graduation with Honors Candidates for a bachelor's degree with a grade point average between 3.50 and 3.69 graduate cum laude (with honors); candidates with a grade point average between 3.70 and 3.89 graduate magna cum laude (with high honors); and candidates with a grade point average of 3.90 or higher graduate summa cum laude (with highest honors). Awarding of honors is based on all graded undergraduate courses attempted at Santa Clara University and courses taken elsewhere that are counted toward the fulfillment of a student's degree. Honors will not be awarded above those merited by the student's record at Santa Clara. An indication of honors at graduation contained in the commencement program is unof - ficial. The final determination will be made after a review of all completed undergraduate courses counted toward the degree. Participation in Commencement To participate in commencement, candidates for a bachelor's degree must have com - pleted all degree requirements (or must have 10 or fewer units to complete) and a minimum overall grade point average of 2.0 as well as in all courses in their academic major(s) and academic minor(s). Candidates must clearly demonstrate that all course work will be com - pleted either summer or fall of 2015 and must have completed and submitted a Candidacy Petition for the Bachelor's Degree form to the Office of the Registrar. ACADEMIC PROGRAM POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Course Numbering and Course Credits Lower-division courses are numbered 1 through 99, and upper-division courses are numbered 100 through 199. In the College of Arts and Sciences and the Leavey School of Business, most lower-division courses carry 4 units of academic credit and most upper-division courses carry 5 units of academic credit. In the School of Engineering, unit values for courses vary according to the number of hours in class per week.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 407 Credit Unit Policy Academic work at Santa Clara University is measured by credit unit. A unit of credit represents that amount of time and effort both within and outside of formal settings that a student devotes to a particular class. At the undergraduate level, one unit of credit represents approximately three hours of work per week per term by the student, including time engaged in class and time committed to class preparation, studying, and assigned projects. A unit of credit for laboratory courses, independent study, internships, practica, and study abroad is awarded on the same basis as for a lecture course: one unit of credit repre - sents approximately three hours of work per week per term by the student. At the graduate level, course credit is determined by the college or school and is consis - tent with practices in the disciplines. Change of Academic Major A change of major within the same school or college requires the approval of the relevant department chair or program director. Students wishing to change their academic major within a school must submit a Program Petition form to the Drahmann Center. Change of School Entering freshmen are admitted to the University and to a specific school based on the preference indicated on their admission application. Students wishing to change schools within the University may not apply for such a change until the end of their first year of attendance. Changes between schools may be limited by the availability of space within the school and the specific academic major. Students wishing to change schools must meet the admit - tance criteria of the school and complete the application process specified by that school. Upon acceptance by the school, the student must submit a completed Program Petition form to the Drahmann Center. Repetition of Courses Students may only repeat a course in which they have received a grade of less than \"C-.\" In such cases, the grades of both the original and the repeated course are included in the calculation of the student's grade point average, but units are awarded toward graduation only once for each course passed. Certain courses, such as special topics courses and perfor - mance courses, are repeatable, and students will receive a grade and units for each successful completion. Students should consult the chair of the department in which the course is offered to confirm that a given course may be repeated for credit. Independent Study Students may pursue independent study through directed reading, directed research, internships, practica, or cooperative education. To qualify, a student must have demon - strated a sufficient knowledge of the academic discipline involved to make independent study both possible and beneficial. No more than 20 units of independent study may be used to satisfy graduation requirements, and no more than 5 units of independent study may be taken per term. Students must enroll for the term in which the independent study occurs. Directed reading and directed research are limited to upper-division students who undertake a research project or other well-defined study beyond the scope of a regular course under the supervision of a faculty member. Such work should be comparable to that required for courses of equivalent unit value.408 A CADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Students can obtain practical learning experience through internships, cooperative edu- cation, and practica. Internships and cooperative education are approved work experiences in a non-classroom environment in industry, government, or other setting, generally avail - able only to upper-division students. Students who enroll in an internship or cooperative education experience for academic credit must fulfill specified academic requirements in addition to the responsibilities expected by the organization hosting the internship or coop - erative education experience. Practica provide practical experience in a discipline-specific field experience or an approved University program activity, such as participation on the school newspaper. Practica are generally available only to upper-division students, but some practicum experiences are available to lower-division students who meet specified eligibility criteria. Students wishing to enroll in an independent study course must initiate the request for independent study with the appropriate faculty member, or with the Career Center for cooperative education experiences. The appropriate form, with the required materials and other approvals, must be submitted to the Drahmann Center for final approval prior to registering for the course. Challenging Courses Students may challenge certain courses to satisfy specific subject requirements for gradu- ation. A student may petition to challenge any course listed in the Undergraduate Bulletin except those involving laboratory, studio, or specialized group work and those whose descriptions in the catalog are followed by the letters NCX. No more than one course may be challenged each term. Although course requirements may be fulfilled by challenging a course, a successful challenge neither earns units toward the total needed for graduation nor contributes to the fulfillment of the residency requirements. In order to be eligible to challenge a course, a student must have completed at least one term at Santa Clara, have a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.3, and receive per - mission of the faculty member and the chair of the department in which the course is offered. Only currently enrolled students are eligible to challenge a course. To challenge a course, the student takes a special examination on the material covered by that course and meets any additional requirements specified by the department chair. Challenge examinations are arranged by the department chair, after the student files a Peti-tion for Credit by Examination with the Office of the Registrar and pays the applicable fee. Undergraduate Class Attendance Policy Students are responsible for completing all course requirements as set forth by the instructor. Class attendance expectations and consequences for absences from class are left to the discretion of individual instructors subject to restrictions imposed by law, including, but not limited to, policies associated with the Americans with Disabilities Act As Amended (ADAAA) and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) (see below). The instructor's policies will be communicated clearly in writing. Students are accountable for all course assignments, whether or not the assignments were announced during an absence, and for meeting assigned deadlines, even when the deadline falls on the day a student is absent from class. For details on grading, see the Grading Policies and Regulations section in this chapter.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 409 In certain situations involving unavoidable absence, students may be offered the oppor - tunity to make up a missed assignment/activity or to complete an alternative assignment, unless the design of the course offers no opportunity for in-class work to be made up. These include both foreseen and unforeseen documented and verified situations such as: S erious personal illness D eath of immediate family member P articipation in significant religious observances P articipation in events or activities as official representatives of Santa Clara University In cases of unforeseen, unavoidable absence, students should contact the instructor as soon as possible. Under certain circumstances, the Cowell Center or the Office of Student Life may contact the instructor on behalf of the student. In cases of foreseen absence due to significant religious observances or official representa - tion of the University in events, students should discuss the conflict with the instructor well in advance of the absence in order to determine possible alternate arrangements. Class attendance expectations and consequences for absence are left to the discretion of individual instructors. Instructors may require documentation from the appropriate University per - sonnel regarding the reason for the intended absence. Title IX and ADAAA The ADAAA requires that the University ensure that all students have equal access to academic and University programs. Students with particular disabilities who are registered with the Disabilities Resources Office may be qualified to receive an accommodation that includes flexibility in class attendance. The federal Department of Education has issued a clarification of laws associated with Title IX and class attendance. To be in compliance with Title IX, a school must offer appropriate accommodation to a student whose absence is related to pregnancy or childbirth for as long as the student's doctor deems the absence to be medically necessary. See \"Supporting the Academic Success of Pregnant and Parenting Students Under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,\" U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, June 2013. Final Examinations A cumulative final examination, if given in a course, must be given on the date and time scheduled by the Office of the Registrar. If the final examination is a take-home exam, it may not be due before the scheduled final examination time. Exceptions to this policy require approval of the department chair and dean. REGISTRATION POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Enrollment and Registration for Classes Students must be officially registered for all classes in accordance with the regulations, procedures, and dates in the Schedule of Classes. Registration is subject to full payment of tuition, room and board charges, and other fees associated with enrollment. The University reserves the right to deny registration to any student for reasonable cause. A student's eligi - bility to register for classes is subject to the clearance of any holds on the student's record for academic, financial, student conduct, or other reasons. Santa Clara students may not be concurrently enrolled at another college or university except for extraordinary reasons with the approval of the Drahmann Center.410 A CADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Students register for classes via University eCampus during the time assigned by the Office of the Registrar. Students who do not complete registration during the initial registration period may do so during the published late registration period for the term. Initial registration for a term or class additions are not accepted after the last day of the late registration period. During the first week of each term, students may add and drop classes in accordance with the procedures established by the Office of the Registrar. During the first, second, third, and fourth weeks of the term, a student may drop a class without receiving a mark of \"W\" for the class on their academic record. From the fifth week to the end of the seventh week of the term, a student may drop a class and receive a mark of \"W\" for the class on their academic record. Students may not drop classes after the last day of the seventh week of the term. Students who do not complete a course and do not drop the class in accordance with the required procedures will receive an appropriate grade in the class. Students who have not earned 44 units, including transfer credit, may be subject to administrative withdrawal from upper-division courses. This restriction does not apply to upper-division foreign language courses for which a student has demonstrated sufficient proficiency or to engineering courses in the major program. Students may not sit in a class without formally enrolling in the class. Sitting in a class or obtaining an instructor's signature on an add form does not constitute enrollment. Students who do not attend the first day of a class are subject to administrative cancella- tion of their enrollment in that class in order to make space available to other students. A student who must miss the first day of a class and wishes to remain in the course should contact the instructor in advance. No student who misses the first day of a class should assume that they have been dropped from the course. Students are responsible for checking the status of their enrollment in all courses prior to the end of the late registration period. Unit Overload Students may enroll for no more than 19 units unless they are in the University Honors Program, their cumulative grade point average at Santa Clara is at least 3.3, or they have upper-division status and obtain approval from the Drahmann Center. One 2-unit course or two 1-unit courses are not counted as overload units. Students who meet the criteria above will not be permitted to register for more than 25 units without approval of the Dean of Academic Support Services. Students may register for courses that result in overload units only during the late registration period. See the website of the Office of the Registrar for registration schedules. Auditing Courses Students admitted to degree status at Santa Clara may audit one course in addition to their regular course load in a term. A maximum of three courses may be audited during a student's academic career. Permission to audit a course will be given only at the end of the late registration period and only if space is available in the class. No credit is assigned for an audited course, but the successful completion of an audit will be indicated on a student's transcript by the notation \"AUD.\" Administrative Cancellation of Course Enrollment Students who enroll in a course for which they are not eligible are subject to administra - tive cancellation of their enrollment in that course. Prior to the end of the late registration period, an instructor may notify the University registrar to drop freshmen who registered in upper-division courses, to drop students who have not satisfied the prerequisites for the course, or to drop students lacking the instructor permission required for certain courses.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 411 Withdrawal from the University Students who wish to withdraw from the University must do so by the last day of classes, and must complete a withdrawal survey, appropriate forms, and an exit interview in the Drahmann Center. If the formal requirements for withdrawal are met, the student's registra - tion will be canceled without further academic penalty. Students who leave the University during a quarter without withdrawing in accordance with the required procedures will receive an appropriate grade in all courses in which they were registered and are not eligible for a refund of tuition or other fees. Students who withdraw from the University are responsible for any outstanding finan - cial obligations with the University. Students who used deferred payment plans or student loans during their attendance at the University must clear their financial obligations with the Financial Aid Office and the Bursar's Office. Students who have unpaid bills or other unsettled financial obligations with the University will not receive academic transcripts or be eligible for re-enrollment until they have cleared all such obligations. Withdrawal for Health Reasons Students may experience an illness, injury, or psychological condition that significantly impairs their ability to function successfully or safely in their role as students. In these instances, the Policy for Withdrawal for Health Reasons allows time away from the University for treatment and recovery until functioning is restored to a level that will enable the student to return to the University. The purpose of this policy is to set forth the procedures for student withdrawals from the University for reasons of health and/or safety. The University has designated four categories relating to withdrawal. They differ according to who initiates the action, whether it is voluntary or not, and the re-enrollment procedures. The vice provost for student life or designee, in consultation with the appropriate mental and medical health professionals and other staff as deemed necessary, is responsible for the implementation of this policy as stated in the Student Handbook. Re-enrollment at the University A student who withdrew from the University is eligible to re-enroll without special permission under the following conditions: The student left the U niversity in good academic standing The student has no outstanding financial obligations with the U niversity The student plans to r eturn to the same college or school at the University The student is r eturning within five years of the date of their withdrawal Students who do not meet the conditions above must seek permission to re-enroll from the Dean of Academic Support Services. Re-enrolling students are subject to degree and curriculum requirements in the Undergraduate Bulletin in effect at the time of re-entry. Students wishing to re-enroll must notify the Office of the Registrar in writing of their intent to return using the Returning Student form and should consult with a University advisor in the Drahmann Center to review their academic plans. Students on leave who have attended another college or university are only permitted to transfer in a maximum of 10 units of elective credit and are required to forward to the Office of the Registrar an offi - cial transcript of all work completed during their absence.412 A CADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS GRADING POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Grading Grades are assigned by the instructor to reflect the quality of a student's work. The University uses the following grades: GoodC: AdequateD: Barely PassingF: Not PassingP: PassNP: No Pass The grades A, B, C, and D may be modified by (+) or (-) suffixes, except that the grade of A may not be modified by a (+) suffix. Grade point values per unit are assigned as follows: A = 4.0 A- = 3.7B+ = 3.3B = 1.3D = 1.0D- = 0.7F = 0 Unit credit, but not grade point credit, is awarded when the grade of \"P\" is assigned. Unit credit is not awarded when the grade of \"NP\" is assigned. The University also uses the following marks for which no unit credit or grade point value is granted: I: Incomplete N: Continuing workNS: No Pass (P/NP) A grade of \"P\" signifies that the quality of work done is equivalent to a letter grade of \"C\" or higher, while a grade of \"NP\" denotes work at the level of \"C-\" or lower. A maximum of six courses taken under the pass/no pass option in which the student receives a mark of \"P\" can be used to fulfill the unit requirements for graduation.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 413 Some courses are offered only on a pass/no pass basis. If a graded option is not available, a course can satisfy Core, major, and/or minor requirements. A student with junior or senior standing and a declared major may choose to take an elective course on a pass/no pass basis. Students may enroll in only one elective course on a pass/no pass basis per quarter. Students may choose the pass/no pass option for a class through the end of the fourth week of classes, but may not change the grading option after that date. Incomplete (I) The mark of \"I\" (incomplete) may be assigned by the instructor when a student does not complete some essential portion of the assigned work in a class because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the student's control. The unfinished work must be completed and given to the course instructor within three weeks of the beginning of classes in the next scheduled term (not the student's next term of enrollment), excluding summer session, unless extraordinary circumstances require an extension. A request for an extension must be submitted in writing by the instructor and approved by the University Registrar within the original three-week period. Extensions shall not be for longer than two academic quarters after the mark of \"I\" was assigned, excluding summer session. An incomplete that has not been completed within the specified deadline or has not received an approved extension will be converted to a grade of \"F .\" Continuing Work (N) The mark of \"N\" (continuing work) may be assigned by an instructor when course requirements span more than one term. When the course requirements are completed, the instructor assigns a standard grade. A student may not graduate and receive a degree with a mark of \"N\" on their academic record. No Show (NS) The mark of \"NS\" (No Show) may be assigned by an instructor when a student never attends a class and does not drop the class. A mark of \"NS\" cannot be changed to any other grade or mark after it is assigned by the instructor. A mark of \"NS\" is included in the stu - dent's academic record and appears on the student's transcript, but is not included in the calculation of the student's grade point average. No adjustment in tuition will result from the awarding of a mark of \"NS\" in a class. Audit (AUD) The mark of \"AUD\" is assigned when a student enrolls in a class on an audit basis. A mark of \"AUD\" cannot be changed to any other grade. Withdrawn (W) The mark of \"W\" is assigned by the Office of the Registrar when a student completes the formal requirements for dropping a class or withdrawing from the University. A mark of \"W\" cannot be changed to any other grade or mark. A mark of \"W\" is included in the student's academic record and appears on the student's transcript, but is not included in the calculation of the student's grade point average. Grade Point Average A student's grade point average is determined by multiplying each grade point value by the number of quarter units assigned to the course, adding these grade point units from all courses taken, and dividing this sum by the total number of quarter units for which letter 414 A CADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS grades were reported. Grade reports are posted at the end of each quarter and indicate both the grade point average earned by the student during the quarter and the cumulative grade point average earned by the student for all courses completed to that point. Grades earned in courses in SCU-operated or SCU-affiliated study abroad or domestic study programs are included in the calculation of a student's grade point average. Grades earned in courses at other institutions accepted for transfer credit are not included in the calculation of a student's grade point average, but will be considered when determining honors at graduation. Evaluation of Progress Grades are available at the end of the term via University eCampus. Faculty members are expected to apprise students of their course progress at reasonable intervals. Some measure - ments of progress should take place in time to enable students to make reasonable decisions with respect to the fourth-week and seventh-week withdrawal deadlines. Change of Grade Only the faculty member responsible for a course may assign grades. All grades become final when they have been assigned and reported to the Office of the Registrar. A faculty member may report a correction of a final grade to the Office of the Registrar only if a cleri-cal or procedural error was made in assigning, transmitting, or recording the original grade. A grade may not be changed as a result of re-evaluation, re-examination, or the submission of additional work after the term ends. Any grade change must have the approval of the department chair and the associate dean of the student's school or college. No grade may be changed after one year. Student Appeals of Grades Grades are not negotiable. There should be no questioning of a faculty member's aca - demic judgment on a grade. In registering for a class, students implicitly agree to allow the faculty member to make a qualitative judgment of their command of the subject matter, which will be expressed as a letter grade. Any questioning or appeal of a grade should there - fore be limited to procedure, e.g., to computational errors or failures to follow grading poli - cies set forth in the syllabi. Any system of grade-appeal should protect the rights of faculty members as well as the rights of students. The results of any system of grade-appeal should not be binding upon the faculty member. Any decision to initiate a change of grade should remain the faculty mem - ber's. Any procedural complaint regarding a change of grade must be initiated within four weeks of the beginning of the next scheduled term, not including summer session. A student with a complaint must first discuss the matter with the faculty member. If the matter is not resolved at this level, the student may then take the matter to the chairperson of the department involved. The chairperson will discuss the case with the faculty member and may recommend that the faculty member review the grade. Upon the request of the student, the dean will proceed in similar fashion. Should the student request it, the dean will pass the matter on to the provost. This process of review gives the chairperson, dean, and provost the right to discuss the matter with the faculty member, and if they think it appropriate, request that the faculty member review the grade. Any recommendations made will not be binding upon the fac - ulty member against whom the complaint is lodged. The decision to change a grade remains with the faculty member.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 415 ACADEMIC STANDING AND STUDENT CLASSIFICATION Student Classification The University only admits students to its undergraduate degree programs on a full-time basis. Students who have not been admitted to degree status at the University may register for classes in accordance with the policies and regulations outlined in the section of this chapter covering non-degree students. The classification of students is determined by the number of quarter units completed with passing grades. Lower-division students are considered freshmen if they have com - pleted fewer than 44 units and sophomores when they have completed at least 44 units but fewer than 88 units. Upper-division students are considered juniors when they have com - pleted at least 88 units but fewer than 131 units and seniors when they have completed at least 131 units. If a student is enrolled for 12 or more units in a given term, they have full-time status for academic purposes. Students enrolled for less than 12 units have part-time status for that term and may not qualify for all University activities and benefits, such as eligibility for financial aid, on-campus housing, and intercollegiate athletic competition. Continuing enrollment at the University in part-time status requires approval by the Dean of Academic Support Services. Academic Standing To be in good academic standing at the University, a student must normally be enrolled for 12 or more units, must maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 based on all courses taken at Santa Clara, and must have completed at least a minimum number of units as specified below. Failure to meet these requirements may result in academic proba - tion or disqualification from future registration at the University. Students in their last term of enrollment before completing a degree may be classified as a full-time student when enrolled for less than 12 units. Academic Probation Students at Santa Clara are subject to academic probation if their cumulative grade point average is lower than 2.0 based on all courses taken at Santa Clara. Students are also subject to academic probation if they fail to make satisfactory progress toward their degree as defined below: Completing at least 36 quar ter units in the previous three quarters of residency or Completing at least 36 quar ter units by the end of the third quarter of residency Completing at least 76 quar ter units by the end of the sixth quarter of residency Completing at least 115 quar ter units by the end of the ninth quarter of residency Completing at least 160 quar ter units by the end of the 12th quarter of residency416 A CADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Academic Disqualification Students are subject to disqualification from further registration at the University for any of the following: R emaining on academic probation for more than two consecutive quarters without improvement F ailing to maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 or Completing fe wer than 30 quarter units by the end of the third quarter of residency Completing fe wer than 64 quarter units by the end of the sixth quarter of residency Completing fe wer than 100 quarter units by the end of the ninth quarter of residency Completing fe wer than 150 quarter units by the end of the 12th quarter of residency Reinstatement to the University Reinstatement to the University after disqualification is rarely permitted and requires favorable action by the Dean of Academic Support Services in consultation with the dean of the student's college or school. Requests for reinstatement are made to the Dean of Academic Support Services and must include a description of any activities during the period of disqualification that would indicate that an improved academic performance can be expected in the future. A student generally may not apply for reinstatement within a year of the date of disqualification. The request for reinstatement will be considered only if the student's academic deficiencies can be corrected within a reasonable time. ACADEMIC CREDIT EVALUATION Santa Clara awards credit based on the Advanced Placement Program, the International Baccalaureate Program, courses completed at other colleges and universities, and courses completed in University-approved study abroad and domestic study programs using the criteria outlined herein. Students may not take a course for credit for which they have received advanced placement, International Baccalaureate, or transfer credit. Credit is not awarded for the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP). Advanced Placement Credit Santa Clara participates in the Advanced Placement Program to recognize college-level academic achievement prior to matriculation and to encourage students to pursue advanced studies in their areas of interest. Credit or placement is determined by the appropriate department based on review of the student's Advanced Placement scores, sometimes in the context of supplemental departmental examinations. Students will be notified of advanced placement credit upon matriculation at the University. The following chart indicates the subject examination, required scores, and Santa Clara credit granted through the Advanced Placement tests. Courses waived will always satisfy relevant requirements in the major of the department that offers the course. However, only some courses waived will satisfy requirements in the Core Curriculum. Courses waived by AP test scores, when relevant, may satisfy Second Language, Mathe- matics, Natural Science, and Social Science requirements in the Core Curriculum. No other undergraduate Core requirement can be satisfied with AP test scores.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 417 Final decisions on academic credit for some AP scores are made individually by the appropriate academic department in consultation with the University Registrar.

International Baccalaureate Santa Clara University recognizes the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program for admission and advanced placement. The following chart indicates the subject examination, required scores, and Santa Clara credit granted through the International Baccalaureate higher level tests. Courses waived will always satisfy relevant requirements in the major of the department that offers the course. However, only some courses waived will satisfy requirements in the Core Curriculum. Courses waived by IB scores, when relevant, may satisfy Arts, Second Language, Mathematics, Natural Science, and Social Science requirements in the Core Curriculum.

T ransfer students who enter the University with fewer than 44 units must take all three Religion, Theology & Culture courses in the required sequence. Students matriculating with 44 or more units of transferable college credit, which does not include any Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate test credit, must complete two courses, in any order, from any two of the following three categories: Religion, Theology & Culture 1, 2, or 3. However, all students except Religious Studies majors and minors must complete 88 units before enrolling in Religion, Theology & Culture 3 courses.

Students who transfer to Santa Clara University should consult Chapters 4 and 8 as well as the chapters relevant to their school or college.420 A CADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Units Taken at Other Institutions Credit is awarded for coursework completed at other colleges and universities subject to certain limitations. Courses from accredited institutions are generally transferable if they are similar in nature to courses listed in the Santa Clara University Undergraduate Bulletin. Courses from California community colleges are also generally transferable under the same conditions and if designated as transferable to the University of California. Courses of a trade or technical nature do not transfer. Courses from colleges not accredited, trade schools, extension programs, or correspondence programs do not transfer. T ransfer students can receive credit for coursework completed at other colleges and universities prior to matriculation at Santa Clara for no more than half of the total number of quarter units required for the specific Santa Clara degree. After enrolling at Santa Clara, students can receive credit for coursework completed at other colleges and universities for no more than 10 quarter units of free electives, subject to the limitation that no more than half of the total number of quarter units required for a Santa Clara degree can be earned at another institu-tion. T ransfer credit earned after initial enrollment at Santa Clara may not be used to fulfill Undergraduate Core Curriculum, college or school, department, or program requirements. T ransfer credit for all coursework completed at other colleges and universities requires approval from the Office of the Registrar and the chair of the department offering the equivalent Santa Clara course. The student must have earned a grade of \"C\" or better in a course for transfer credit to be granted. Courses taken on a pass/no pass or credit/no credit basis are not accepted as transfer credit. Grades for units earned at other institutions are not included in a student's Santa Clara academic history or in the calculation of the Santa Clara grade point average. Study Abroad and Domestic Study Programs Units and grades earned for coursework in University-operated study abroad programs, University-affiliated study abroad programs, University study abroad exchange programs, and University-affiliated domestic study programs are included in a student's Santa Clara academic history. Units earned in approved study abroad and domestic study programs may be used to fulfill Undergraduate Core Curriculum, college or school, department, or pro - gram requirements subject to prior approval by the appropriate dean's office, department chair, or program director. However, such units do not satisfy the University residency requirement. Grades earned in approved study abroad and domestic study programs are included in the calculation of the Santa Clara grade point average. Units earned for coursework in study abroad and domestic study programs not operated by or affiliated with the University are accepted only as transfer credit and are subject to the policies governing units taken at other institutions. The second-level Core Curriculum requirement in Religion, Theology & Culture can be fulfilled with a pre-approved study abroad course. The third-level Core Curriculum requirement in Religion, Theology & Culture cannot be fulfilled with a study abroad course.

Students are expected to do their own work and to cite any sources they use. A student who is guilty of a dishonest act in an examination, paper, or other work required for a course, or who assists others in such an act, may, at the discretion of the instructor, receive a grade of \"F\" for the course. In addition, a student found guilty of a dishonest act may be subject to sanctions, up to and including dismissal from the University, as a result of the student judicial process as described in the Student Handbook. A student who violates copyright laws, including those covering the copying of software programs, or who knowingly alters official academic records from this or any other institution is subject to similar disciplinary action. Academic Integrity Protocol Allegations within the Context of a Course These procedures are intended to protect the integrity of the instructional program and of student academic achievement. Any member of the Santa Clara University community with a suspicion or evidence of academic dishonesty of some kind as described in the Stu - dent Conduct Code (e.g., plagiarism, falsification of data, misrepresentation of research, or the use of prohibited materials during an examination, and other acts generally understood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context) may initiate an allegation of student academic dishonesty. The following describes procedures for resolution by due process. If the allegation arises within the context of a course or academic assignment, its resolu - tion begins with the instructor responsible for that course or assignment, who informs the student of the suspicion. If the instructor judges on the basis of available evidence that an academic violation has occurred, the instructor applies an academic sanction and notifies the student of the reason for the academic sanction. The instructor decides on the severity of the academic sanction (e.g., refusal to accept an assignment, \"F\" on the particular assign - ment, or \"F\" for the entire course). The instructor will report in writing to the department chair and the Office of Student Life what violation of academic integrity has occurred and what academic sanction has been applied. The Office of Student Life will pursue the matter as a violation of the Student Conduct Code through the University judicial process. This process is not intended to limit academic freedom. Appeal Process for Academic Sanctions If, after discussion with the instructor concerning the academic sanction applied, the student wants to challenge the instructor's decision, the student will contact the chair of the department in which the course is offered. If the instructor is the department chair, then the appeal is made to the dean of the school or college in which the course is offered or his/her designate, and the dean or designate refers the case to the chair of a closely related department. The department chair hearing the appeal has the option to convene an ad hoc panel if he or she believes that the complexity of the case warrants doing so. The student suspected of committing academic dishonesty has the right to bring a support person whose only role is to accompany the student to the hearing. The panel will include two full-time faculty members from the department in which the course was offered, one full-time faculty mem - ber from a closely related department, and two students who are trained student judicial board members. Staff in the Office of Student Life will arrange for the participation of the student panel members. The charge of the panel is to study all previously considered and ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 423 newly developed evidence, review statements of all parties concerned, interview all parties concerned, and make a recommendation to the department chair. The parties involved have the right to file an objection to the appointment of a particular faculty member or student to the ad hoc panel. This objection must be based upon a belief that the named faculty member or student is unable to conduct an impartial evaluation and therefore will not review the case in an impartial manner. The objection is filed with the chair hearing the appeal who will make a ruling on this objection. If necessary, the chair will then appoint a different faculty member or student. After reviewing all relevant materials and information, including the recommendation of the ad hoc panel when one is convened, the department chair will consider all evidence available, confer with all parties concerned, inform all parties of her or his recommendation regarding the alleged violation, and report the recommendation to the student and the Office of Student Life. However, final responsibility for assigning grades remains with the instructor of the course. Decisions may only be appealed to one level above the instructor. All proceedings are intended to be confidential. If the student wishes to withdraw from the course, the instructor's approval is required for the withdrawal process. The instructor may refuse to approve of the withdrawal and may assign an appropriate grade. University Judicial Process When the Office of Student Life receives the report, the assistant dean will meet with the student to discuss the relevance of the violation to the Student Conduct Code. Whether further judicial sanctions are applied or not, the report of academic dishonesty will remain on file in the Office of Student Life for the remainder of the student's enrollment at Santa Clara University. The student involved has the right to include a statement as part of these files. If it is ruled that the student committed an academic integrity violation, the Office of Student Life will administer a judicial sanction that would range from a letter of warning to expulsion from the University. The severity of the judicial sanction depends on the sever - ity of the circumstances, including the student's judicial history and previous academic integrity violations. Allegations Outside a Course If the allegation involves a situation outside the context of a course, resolution begins with the Office of Student Life. The assistant dean will confer with all parties concerned. After hearing all evidence and conducting further investigation as needed, the assistant dean will either hear the case or refer it to a judicial board in accordance with the University Judicial Process. The outcome of the hearing will be communicated to those involved. PATENT POLICY For information on the University's Patent Policy, contact the Office of Research Initiatives at www.scu.edu/provost/research.424 A CADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS CLERY ACT In accordance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, Santa Clara University annually collects information about campus crimes and other reportable incidents as defined by the law. Information presented in com - pliance with this act is made available to assist current and potential students and employees in making informed decisions regarding their attendance or employment at the University. These reports and other information about the law are available on the Campus Safety website. It is the policy of Santa Clara University that the campus community will be informed on a timely basis of all reports of crime and other information affecting the security of our campus and the personal safety of our students, faculty, staff, and guests. COMMUNICATION BY THE UNIVERSITY TO UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS The University will communicate with undergraduate students through a variety of formats. Information that is sent to undergraduate students from the University via their campus mailbox, local address, or their Santa Clara email address is considered official communication and should be treated as such. Students are asked to check their campus mailbox and their Santa Clara email account on a daily basis, and are responsible for reading and responding to the information they receive from the University. The University urges undergraduate students to use their Santa Clara email address as their primary email; students who will not be checking that address regularly should forward their email to their preferred email account. CONSENSUAL RELATIONS BETWEEN EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS In addition to prohibiting sexual harassment under the Policy on Unlawful Harassment and Unlawful Discrimination, the University prohibits any consensual dating, romantic, or sexual relationship between an employee and a student over whom that employee has any instr uctional, supervisory, advising, or evaluative responsibility. Such a relationship is fraught with problems, including the potential for exploitation, favoritism, and conflict of interest. The appearance of impropriety or unfairness may also adversely affect the learning and work environment for other students and employees. This policy applies to faculty, staff, and student employees. Employees who violate this policy are subject to sanctions for misconduct under the policies of the Faculty Handbook, Staff Policy Manual, or Student Employment Handbook, as appropriate to their employment status. Employees or students with questions about this policy should contact the Office of Affirmative Action or the Department of Human Resources. DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE AND SCHOOL PROGRAM It is the goal of Santa Clara University to maintain a drug-free workplace and campus. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, and/or use of controlled substances or the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of alcohol is prohibited on the Santa Clara University campus, in the workplace, or as part of any of the University's activi - ties. This includes the unlawful use of controlled substances or alcohol in the workplace even if it does not result in impaired job performance or in unacceptable conduct.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 425 The unlawful presence of any controlled substance or alcohol in the workplace and campus itself is prohibited. The workplace and campus are presumed to include all Santa Clara premises where the activities of the University are conducted. Violations will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employ - ment for faculty and staff or expulsion of students. A disciplinary action may also include the completion of an appropriate rehabilitation program. Violations may also be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. The program information is distributed on an annual basis to all faculty, staff, and stu - dents. New staff employees are given a copy at New Employee Orientation. New faculty employees are given a copy at New Faculty Orientation. The program is reviewed at least biennially by the Office of Student Life, Affirmative Action Office, and the Department of Human Resources. STUDENT RECORDS AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) protects the confiden - tiality of the University records of Santa Clara University students. A student is any person who attends or has attended a class, which includes courses taken through videoconference, satellite, Internet, or other electronic and telecommunication technologies, and for whom the institution maintains education records.

Certain courses, such as special topics courses and performance courses, are repeatable, and students will receive a grade and units for each successful completion. Evaluation All students enrolled at Santa Clara University are evaluated for satisfactory academic progress at the end of each quarter after the Office of Registrar has released official grades. Definitions of Satisfactory Academic Progress Financial Aid Eligible Students are eligible for financial aid as long as they are enrolled in classes and they fall into one following categories: S tudents with no satisfactory academic progress issues at all S tudents who have appealed successfully and have successfully completed their warning/probation period of enrollmentTUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID 441 S tudents who have successfully completed their warning/probation period of enrollment and are following their academic plan S tudents who have met satisfactory academic progress after being ineligible Financial Aid Warning The failure to make satisfactory academic progress.

Financial aid eligibility will be placed on probation, if this does not occur. Warning status may not be appealed. Financial Aid Probation The failure to make satisfactory academic progress after a warning period. The student is eligible to appeal. If the appeal is approved, the student can continue financial eligibility for another period of enrollment under a suspended probationary status. Students may also choose not to appeal and attempt to regain financial aid eligibility by meeting satisfactory academic progress while paying out-of-pocket (without any financial aid). Financial Aid Suspended The failure to make satisfactory academic progress, but the student appealed their pro - bationary status and was financial aid eligible for the period designated in the granted appeal.Financial Aid Ineligible The failure to make satisfactory academic progress (this status also applies to appeals that are not approved). The student is not eligible for financial aid until cumulative satisfactory academic progress standards are met. The student may not appeal. Appeal Process There may be extenuating circumstances encountered by a student that may affect his/ her ability to be academically successful during an enrollment period. These circumstances include personal injury or illness that occurs during an enrollment period; death of an immediate family member or legal guardian during an enrollment period; or other docu - mented circumstances that were unexpected in nature and beyond control of the student. In these cases, cumulative grade point average or completion rate may decline resulting in the student not meeting the minimum qualitative and quantitative standards previously described. If the student wishes to appeal the suspension from financial aid eligibility, a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal form must be submitted to the Financial Aid Office. If the stu - dent is able to meet the Satisfactory Academic Progress policy within one enrollment term, the financial aid administrator and the Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Rein - statement Contract needs to state the minimum grade point average and the number of credit hours that a student must obtain in order to be compliant at the next assessment period. A review will be done at the end of the quarter to insure that the student is meeting the terms of the contract. If the student is not meeting those terms, further eligibility for aid is canceled immediately. Note: Before filing an appeal for reinstatement of financial aid, it is important that the student meet with an academic advisor and/or visits the Drahmann Advising and Learning Resource Center in order to explore ways of eliminating deficiencies and to establish a realistic plan towards graduation.442 TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID Appeal Denials Students whose appeal was not approved will receive information regarding other alternatives available to them. Some options include: Continue enr ollment at Santa Clara University without any financial assistance. Continue enr ollment at Santa Clara University with the assistance of a private loan; the Financial Aid Office can assist the student with additional information about these loans. W ithdraw from Santa Clara University to make up a portion or all of the deficient units at another institution. IMPORTANT: The student will have to file an additional appeal to have aid reinstated once s/he has completed the required units and demonstrated the ability to continue at Santa Clara University without incurring additional deficiencies. Loss of Eligibility A student who has lost eligibility to participate in federal, state, and University aid pro - grams for reasons of academic progress can regain that eligibility only by enrolling at Santa Clara University at his/her own expense. The mere passage of time will not restore eligibility to a student who has lost eligibility for failure to make satisfactory academic progress. Stu-dents who have been dismissed from Santa Clara University for academic reasons, but who are subsequently re-admitted are not automatically eligible to participate in federal, state, or institutional aid programs and will be placed on financial aid warning. Re-admission deci - sions are separate from funding decisions. Regaining Eligibility Students who failed to meet satisfactory academic progress and who choose to enroll without financial aid may request a review of their academic record after any term in which they are enrolled without the receipt of financial aid. If the standards are met at the time of review, eligibility may be regained for subsequent terms of enrollment in the academic year.

The total amount of tuition remission for the academic year cannot exceed the annual tuition rate for that year. Students with private scholarships should contact the donor for prior approval to use funds for study abroad or domestic study programs. Students from other colleges and universities enrolled in Santa Clara University study abroad programs are not eligible for Santa Clara University financial aid.TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID 443 Veterans and Veterans' Dependents Assistance Santa Clara University has been certified by the Department of Veterans Affairs as quali - fied to enroll students under applicable federal legislation and regulations, including Chap - ter 35 (child of a deceased or 100 percent disabled veteran, widow of any person who died in the service or died of a service-connected disability, or wife of a veteran with a 100 per- cent service-connected disability), Chapter 31 (rehabilitation), Chapter 30/1606 (active duty Montgomery G.I. Bill), and Chapter 33 (Post 9/11 GI Bill). Individuals interested in attending under any of the veteran's assistance programs should contact the Veterans Administration and the University Office of the Registrar. CANCELLATION OF FINANCIAL AID AND RETURN OF FUNDS Students who withdraw from the University and who have federal financial aid are subject to the federal regulations applicable to the return of Title IV funds. These regulations assume that a student earns his or her financial aid based on the period of time he or she remains enrolled during a term. A student is obligated to return all unearned federal financial aid funds governed under Title IV other than those earned under the college work -study program. Unearned financial aid is the amount of disbursed Title IV that exceeds the amount of Title IV aid earned in accordance with the federal guidelines. During the first 60 percent of the term, a student earns Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time he or she remains enrolled. That is, the percentage of time during the term that the student remains enrolled is the percentage of disbursable aid for that period that the student has earned. A student who withdraws after the 60 percent point of the enrollment term earns all Title IV aid disbursed for the period. The amount of tuition and other charges owed by the student plays no role in determining the amount of Title IV funds to which a withdrawn student is entitled. All funds must be returned to federal programs before funds are returned to state or University financial aid programs or to the student. The return of funds allocation will be made in the following order for students who have received Federal Title IV assistance: U nsubsidized William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan F ederal Direct PLUS Loan T eacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grant S ubsidized William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan F ederal Perkins Loan O ther federal and state financial aid, private grants, and scholarships F ederal Supplemental Opportunity Grant U niversity grants and scholarships F ederal Pell Grant444 TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID STUDENT VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION The United States Department of Education requires all institutions disbursing federal financial aid funds to verify the accuracy of the information students and their families submit as a basis for the award of aid. Santa Clara University complies with this requirement by participating in the Federal Quality Assurance Program. Each year, a percentage of stu - dents receiving federal financial aid funds are randomly selected for verification of the infor - mation on which their awards were based. Students selected for verification may be required to submit additional documents and verify information, such as household size and number of family members enrolled in college. The University reserves the right to request similar information for verification purposes for any student awarded aid and to verify the atten-dance of other children in college. Information collected may result in changes to a financial aid award and, in some cases, the repayment of funds already received. Failure to comply with the request for this information will result in the cancellation of financial aid funds. BILLING AND PAYMENT PROCEDURES STUDENT ACCOUNTS AND BILLING Students assume responsibility for all costs incurred as a result of enrollment at Santa Clara University and agree to abide by applicable University policies and procedures. Students may designate a third party (e.g., parent, family member, spouse) to be an authorized payer for their student account. That individual is authorized to access the stu - dent's billing statements and to make payments on the student's behalf. However, it is still the student's responsibility to make sure all financial obligations are completed by the pub - lished deadlines. Once authorization is completed, the authorized payer will be sent notifi - cation on the login process via the email address provided by the student. Authorized payers do not have access to any other student account information via this website. Students receive monthly bills electronically via a third-party vendor that are accessible through University eCampus. A billing notification will be sent to the student's University email address and to the email address of any payer authorized by the student. Students may also forward their billing statements electronically to any third party they authorize for remittance. Information on a student's account cannot be provided to any third party payer unless a completed Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act form authorizing its release by the student is on file with the University. Students are obligated to pay the applicable tuition and fees associated with their enroll - ment status by the published term payment deadline. Students enrolling after the initial payment deadline may be required to pre-pay for their enrollment. Registered students who do not withdraw formally from the University are responsible for all tuition and fees assessed to their account as well as any penalty charges incurred for nonpayment. Nonattendance does not relieve the student of his or her obligation to pay tuition and fees.TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID 445 PAYMENT METHODS Santa Clara University offers a variety of payment methods to students and their parents to assist with their financial obligations. Payment by Electronic Check A student or authorized payer may make online payments by authorizing a fund transfer directly from their personal checking or savings account through a third-party website accessible via the University eCampus system. The payer is able to make electronic check payments online without incurring a transaction fee. Payment by Mail Payments for student account charges are accepted by mail utilizing the University's cash management service lockbox. The payer should download a copy of the student's billing statement, enclose it with a personal or cashier's check payable to: Santa Clara University, and mail both to Santa Clara University Bursar's Office, P .O. Box 742657, Los Angeles, CA 90074-2657. Payment in Person Payments for student account charges may be made in person by cash or check only at the Enrollment Services Center located in the Admissions and Enrollment Services Building. The Office is not able to accept any electronic form of payment, including debit or credit cards. However, there are computer kiosks located in the Walsh Administration Building for the convenience of students and their payers who wish to make electronic payments. EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTIONS For students and their families wishing to spread payments over a period of time, the University offers term payment plans, which are available through the online billing system via eCampus. There is a modest fixed fee to enroll in these plans, but no interest is charged during the payment term. Information about these plans is available on the Bursar's Office website. DELINQUENT PAYMENTS If all charges on a student's account have not been cleared by payment, financial aid, or loan disbursement, a late payment fee will be assessed to the student's account and a hold will be placed on the student's record. A hold on a student's record prevents the release of transcripts or diplomas, prevents access to any registration services, and may limit access to other University services. Students who have unpaid accounts at the University or who defer payment without approval are subject to dismissal from the University. All unpaid balances will accrue 10 percent interest per annum on the balance remaining from the date of default in accordance with California state law. Delinquent student accounts may be reported to one or more of the major credit bureaus and may be forwarded to an outside collection agency or an attorney for assistance in recov - ering the debt owed to the University. The student is responsible for all costs incurred to collect outstanding debt, including but not limited to accrued interest, late fees, court costs, collection fees, and attorney fees. All outstanding bills and costs of collection incurred by the University must be paid in full prior to a student re-enrolling at the University.446 TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID BILLING DISPUTES If a student believes there is an error on his or her billing statement, a written explanation should be forwarded to: Santa Clara University, Bursar's Office, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053-0615. The Bursar's Office must receive written correspondence within 60 days from the billing statement date on which the error appeared.
