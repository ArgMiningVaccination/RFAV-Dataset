To Request an Action Plan to Address Night Sweats [Click Here](requestactionplan.asp) Night sweats have many potential causes, however what follows are the basic mechanics. Night sweats have many potential causes, however what follows are the basic mechanics. Lack of Kidney/Adrenal System function can lead to inadequate raw materials necessary for the production of hormones, thus leading to night sweats. Two basic aspects of the Kidney/Adrenal System are \"yin\" and \"yang.\" Hormones can have more yin or more yang properties. For example, estrogen (which helps to prepare the body for and maintain pregnancy) may have more yang properties and progesterone (which helps prepare the uterus for receiving and nourishing a fertilized egg) may have more yin properties. Hormone balance (therefore Kidney yin and yang balance) is critical for normal body temperature. When such hormones slip out of balance, many symptoms, including night sweats, may result. The yin may become deficient, causing the yang to \"rise\" to the surface of the body at night (the most yin time of the day), causing an intense sensation of heat and possibly perspiration. As you can see with this particular health imbalance, there is an underlying cause. The key to success in treating these problems lies in addressing the underlying issue described above to eliminate the problem over the long term.

Artificial hormones have been associated with an increase in cancer in your reproductive organs and having your organs removed is not the ideal way to address this natural process of menopause. Transitioning from being fertile and of child bearing age to being post menopausal and continuing to lead an active and energetic life is a natural process of aging. Buying into the notion that it is normal to have hormonal imbalances and you need to be on medication for this imbalance is not rational and if you address the underlying imbalance, it is also not necessary.
