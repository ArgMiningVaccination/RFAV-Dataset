East Coast fever (ECF) and Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) are two high priority diseases impacting cattle health and productivity and are a major constraint on cattle productivity and create vulnerabilities for smallholder farmers in developing countries. The objective of this international project is to characterize the bovine immune response at the molecular level in an effort to aid and accelerate the development of vaccine technology for ECF and FMC, which significantly impact smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. This project will develop an important new technology - MHC tetramers - for evaluation of cattle T-cell immune response to these two critical diseases. This novel strategy will provide important basic information on the molecular recognition events in the mmune response of cattle to these two diseases. Broader Impacts: The molecular immunological information gained in this project will aid in accelerating the evaluation of the immune response to natural infections and vaccination and will provide a foundation of knowledge and tools for vaccine development in general. In the long term, this project will enhance global cattle health through the dissemination of improved infection and vaccine assessment technologies. The long-term impacts of these efforts on developing countries are anticipated to include reduced vulnerability of smallholder farmers to agricultural resource losses due to animal disease, i.e. negative impacts on cattle productivity, morbidity and mortality. Additional impacts include establishing international research collaborations between faculty and students at an undergraduate and EPSCoR institution (The University of Vermont) with both governmental and non-governmental partners. An important component of this includes the transfer of cutting-edge technologies via North-South collaborations and capacity building. This research collaboration also integrates a broader goal to enhance young scientist research training and pre- and post-veterinary education opportunities by strengthening partnerships between academic, federal, and international scientists to address global animal health issues of national importance for the United States and developing countries including those of sub-Saharan Africa.

An international team of scientists from the United States, Nairobi, Kenya, and Copenhagen, Demark completed a collaborative research program to examine the use of new technologies in immunology with the goal of accelerating vaccine development for two critical cattle diseases that impact smaller holder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. East Coast Fever and Foot-and-Mouth disease are two economically important diseases of cattle that constrain cattle productivity and create vulnerabilities for smallholder farmers in developing countries. Cattle, and especially dairy cattle, are an important agricultural resource to smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa providing a source of animal protein to farm families, as well as increased market opportunities through local sales. In this project we established technologies that can be used to improve cattle vaccine assessment. The first technoology is a prediction tool that is used to identify potential antigens from pathogen protein sequences. The antigenic protein sequences from the pathogens are identified based on their predicted ability to bind specific molecules expressed in the cattle host. The cattle molecules that bind these antigens are know as MHC molecules and are expressed on the surface of cells. These MHC molecules are critical to determining the specificity of the immune response to infection or vaccination. The second technology is an experimental laboratory assay system that identifies the binding affinity and stability of antigenic protein fragments to specific MHC molecules. Data from this assay system can be used to inform the mathematical prediction algorithms for the prediction tool or can be used to inform antigen selection for cattle immune response studies. The third technology is MHC tetramer molecules. These tetramer molecules are composed of synthetic cattle MHC molecules bound to protein fragments from pathogens. We have synthesized 15 of the synthetic MHC molecules and bound them to predicted antigens from the pathogens that cause East Coast Fever and Food and Mouth Disease. These synthetic molecules were used to evaluate the specificity of the immune response among cattle vaccinated against East Coast Fever and Food and Mouth Disease. Our research identified individual antigenic protein fragments that generate an immune response to either the East Coast Fever parasite or Food and Mouth Disease virus. By completing this research we have advanced our understanding of how cattle respond to pathogens and how specific proteins may stimulate an immune response in indiivdual cattle. Our research has advanced vaccine assessment technologies for cattle. Our research establishes a set of technologies that can be used to improve our understanding of cattle immune system function, accelerate vaccine development efforts and ultimately improve global cattle health. The benefits of improved global cattle health include reduced vulnerability of smallholder farmers to agricultural resource losses due to animal disease. The technologies developed in this research can be used for any number of cattle diseases and can be applied to other livestock species.
