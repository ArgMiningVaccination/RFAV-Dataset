Carolina Ana Aznar, President SLU Madrid Faculty Senate: Update on Madrid Campus a. Madrid: campus founded 1967, cam pus of over 100 faculty. Pressing issue would like to address the lack of a ranking system. Spain does not have tenure; they are asking for ranks to reflect experience that will help recognize their roles and responsibilities. AAUP suggests remote campuses have parallel structures and systems as the home b. National Agency for Quality Assessment and Accreditation of Spain (ANECA), this is a process to accredit colleges and universities and their faculty in Spain. The criteria include: 60% research, 30% teachi ng, 8% academic and professional training, 2% other experiences. At least 60% of faculty at colleges and universities need to be accredited. Because of the current assessment, this is one way to help simplify the process. They have been working with Paul Vita and Miriam Joseph to identify the processes needed for establishing ranks within the Madrid campus. Some areas within the Madrid campus will not become accredited. They are asking for support from the FS at SLU -main campus. Q&A: 5. Faculty Affairs will introduce the recommendations and process . From Miriam Joseph: This is something that can happen and is about assigning initial ranks to those who want ranks at the Madrid campus. SLU -main campus will work out the procedures with Provost Lewis. As appropr iate, there will be some articulation of which departments may be involved. 6. Faculty Manual Amendments: Miriam Joseph a. Can view proposed amendments at: https://www.slu.edu/provo st/policies/faculty - manual/index.php b. There will be 2 Open Fora: Feb 24th 4-5pm and Feb 25th, 5-6pm c. Committee Members: Miriam Joseph (Chair), Ruth Evans, Terry Tomazic, Julie Birkenmaier (FSEC Appointed), Amber Johnson (FSEC Appointed), Jane 3 McHowat (SOM), Danielle Uy (General Counsel), Michael Lewis (previous participant) d. Qualtrics Survey for feedback closes March 4, 2021 and summaries of feedback and amendment changes will be presented during the March 9, 2021 Faculty Senate meeting. e. Summary of A mendments under consideration: III.D.2. - Clarifies eligibility of non -tenure track faculty up for promotion early; III.H.7 - Addresses selection and evaluation of administrators by providing some clarity to variations in appointments of certain roles of ad min/exec positions that are subject to the approval of Jesuit Provincial and/or the Archbishop; III.H.12.b - Clears up any confusion about time on FMLA counting for faculty tenure time period; III.I.2 Annual Review - The amendment will add that evaluators should provide annual written and timely feedback to faculty with direction on how faculty can provide response comments and document the process of the review itself. The Faculty Senate's Academic Affairs Committee is conducting an extensive survey about the annual review process within departments and colleges that may result in future Manual amendments about the process. III.I.3 Midpoint review - This amendment provides a structure for faculty to ask for extensions for mid -point reviews if they have pr eviously been granted an extension of their tenure clock prior to the completion of their midpoint review. New Addition to the Faculty Manual to III.I.3 adding third year review of non -tenure track faculty. This will establish a process to review faculty i n their third year of employment, separate from their annual review, to help provide feedback about their progress and accomplishments. This will not be optional and provide a scheduled review to provide guidance about their progression towards promotion. Q&A: Q: Will the annual review process should be transparent and with a clear timeline every year regardless of any pool for adjustment to base salary? A: Yes, agreed. Q: Can you please comment on how these changes impact NTT faculty within the SOM? A: SOM are already expected to have mid -point reviews. This has not routinely occurred in the SOM Q: Can \"Center\" be added to the list Department, College, or School? Or perhaps some catch all phrase like \"or analogous unit...\" A: This applies to where facu lty have their academic appointments. Miriam will follow -up about this. Q: Regarding the proposed amendment for administrative positions \u2014can a Jesuit be automatically appointed to an administrative position? Does this open the door for other positions to be added to the list of exceptions? A: No. Certain appointments have to follow the faculty manual and the only exceptions are those discussed. Q: Are there provisions or processes that prevent faculty from providing comments about administrators who are being considered for removal from their administrative roles? A: The manual does not address that and personnel issues are more complex, but Miriam Joseph will add the concern to a list. 4 7. Senate Budget and Finance Committee : Theo Alexander a. Committee had its 3rd meeting of President's Finance group held on Jan 25 , 2021. There is more transparency of data sharing within the group , noting the need for confidentiality . b. Tuition -revenue : decrease is about half of what was budgeted, and other sour ces of income continue to trend downwards, still uncertai n what the post -pandemic influence on the overall budget will be . During f iscal year 2022, re -instating previous cuts will further place the budget into a deficit. Q&A : Q: D oes greater transparency mean the administration has responded to some of the Budget and Finance Committee's questions from a year ago? A: Yes, there will still be a need for more granular data. The level of data that has been shared suggests faculty are being engaged to help und erstand the university budget and help solve problems and plan ahead. 8. Update on COVID -19 and the vaccine: Rachel Charney and Terri Rebmann a. Data dashboard suggest that campus infection rates are doing well. Quarantine housing capacity has decreased as th e number of persons under investigation have increased. It is unclear if each individual has COVID -19 symptoms or symptoms of an infection similar to COVID -19. b. SLU has been approved as a vaccine provider. University is waiting for supply from the state to be able to distribute. Current plans will allow them to distribute vaccines within 3 -days of receiving vaccine doses and they will apply the current state vaccination phase and tier eligibility to schedule appointments. The State has prioritized larger vac cine distribution events over larger ones which has limited overall supply. Q&A: Q: What is the s tate prioritization plan ? A: Open to anyone who is currently eligible . State plans have shifted to deploy vaccines for more larger vaccination sites. Q: Where is SLU within the current tiers? A: Everyone fits under a different phase or tier outside of those who work within healthcare centers or other high priority groups by occupation . The general teaching faculty are not eligible for vaccination (excl uded from the k -12 classification) unless they fall within some of the other phases and tiers such as having a high -risk designation . Q: What is the process to register SLU faculty, staff, and students? A: SLU will u se similar registration systems to ide ntify those who are eligible . They will complete information and offered an appointment date and time . Q: Will f amily members become eligible? A: This may become an option but currently they are not. Q: What have been challenges with vaccine supply in M O? 5 A: After reports about MO having one of the lowest vaccination rates has caused the state to try to increase vaccination distribution to larger -mass vaccination sites such as healthcare centers as well as mass community sites. 9. Provost Mike Lewis, Follow Up on Faculty Teaching and Work Loads Q: How can we ensure workload policies are not seen as penalties? Can there be supplemental pay? A: Question/comment was taken under advisement as a suggestion. Q: Will there be a recording for the townhalls with the Provost on work load policies ? A: The links will be posted to the Provost's website. Q: If someone has to teach more for a few years, how can they get back to doing excellent research afterwards? It looks like a one -way road. A: This should be d iscussed, there is not a clear answer at this time. Workloads should be assigned with a high degree of fidelity. Q: How do we balance current inequities in research and teaching? Is this the current struggle or tension? A: Those are the main inequities t he workload policy changes will help to address. 10. Reports from Senate Standing Committees: No Reports from: Governance Committee (Wynne Moskop and Kathy Kienstra) a. Academic Affairs Committee (Sally Beth Lyon and Sherry Bicklein): On February 2, 2021, Mike Lewis was invited to discuss committee's charge and indicated support for long -term contracts for non -tenure track faculty and encouraged obtaining broader support for these measures. The committee is developing a survey to help understand various perspe ctives on the issue. Reviewing survey data about annual reviews. R eviewing best practices on annual review process. b. Compensation and Fringe Benefits Committee (Chris Sebelski): Continue to be involved meeting with the Provost Office, CFO, and President to discuss internal inequities and re -instituting merit dollars and other benefits removed during the pandemic. They continue to search for best practices to re -instate these benefits and maximize budgetary constraints. 11.

SOM: Two updates: 1) working with faculty affairs and professional development to implement the AAMC recommendations.
