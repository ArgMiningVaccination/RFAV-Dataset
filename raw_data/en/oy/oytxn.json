Section 4.1 Plan premium As a member of our plan, you pay a monthly plan premium. The table below shows the monthly plan premium amount for each region we serve. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 11 Chapter 1 Getting started as a member County Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) Member Premium County Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Premium York $34 Section 4.2 Monthly Medicare Part B Premium Many members are required to pay other Medicare premiums In addition to paying the monthly plan premium, you must continue paying your Medicare premiums to remain a member of the plan. This includes your premium for Part B. It may also include a premium for Part A which affects members who aren't eligible for premium free Part A. Section 4. 3 Part D Late Enrollment Penalty Some members are required to pay a Part D late enrollment penalty . The Part D late enrollment penalty is an addit ional premium that must be paid for Part D coverage if at any time after your initial enrollment period is over , there is a period of 63 days or more in a row when you did not have Part D or other creditable prescription drug coverage. \"Creditable prescrip tion drug coverage\" is coverage that meets Medicare's minimum standards since it is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare's standard prescription drug coverage. The cost of the late enrollment penalty depends on how long you went without Part D or other creditable prescription drug coverage. You will have to pay this penalty for as long as you have Part D coverage. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 12 Chapter 1 Getting started as a member The Part D late enrollment penalty is added to your monthly premium. When you first enroll in Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) , we let you know the amount of the penalty. You will not have to pay it if: You receive \"Extra Help\" from Medicare to pay for your prescription drugs. You have gone less than 63 days in a row without credi table coverage. You have had creditable drug coverage through another source such as a former employer, union, TRICARE, or Department of Veterans Affairs. Your insurer or your human resources department will tell you each year if your drug coverage is creditable coverage. This information may be sent to you in a letter or included in a newsletter from the plan. Keep this information, because you may need it if you join a Medicare drug plan later. o Note: Any notice must state that you had \"credi table\" prescription drug cover age that is expected to pay as much as Medicare's standard prescription drug plan pays. o Note: The following are not creditable prescription drug coverage: prescription drug discount cards, free clinics, and drug discount websites. Medicare determines the amount of the penalty. Here is how it works: If you went 63 days or more without Part D or other creditable prescription drug coverage after you were first eligible to enroll in Part D, the plan will count the number of full months that you did not have coverage. The penalty is 1% for every month that you did not have creditable coverage. For example, if you go 14 months without coverage, the penalty will be 14%. Then Medicare determines the amount of the average monthly premium for Medicare drug plans in t he nation from the previous year. For 2023, this average premium amount is $32.74. To calculate your monthly penalty, you multiply the penalty percentage and the average monthly premium and then round it to the nearest 10 cents. In the example here it woul d be 14% times $32.74, which equals $4.5836. This rounds to $4.58. This amount would be added to the monthly premium for someone with a Part D late enrollment penalty . There are three important things to note about this monthly Part D late enrollment penal ty: First, the penalty may change each year , because the average monthly premium can change each year. Second, you will continue to pay a penalty every month for as long as you are enrolled in a plan that has Medicare Part D drug benefits, even if you cha nge plans. Third, if you are under 65 and currently receiving Medicare benefits, the Part D late enrollment penalty will reset when you turn 65. After age 65, your Part D late enrollment 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 13 Chapter 1 Getting started as a member penalty will be based only on the months that you don't have coverage after your initial enrollment period for aging into Medicare. If you disagree about your Part D late enrollment penalty, you or your representative can ask for a review. Generally, you must request this review within 60 days from the date on the first letter you receive stating you have to pay a late enrollment penalty. However, if you were paying a penalty before joining our plan, you may not have another chance to request a review of that late enrollment penalty. Section 4. 4 Income Related Monthl y Adjustment Amount Some members may be required to pay an extra charge, known as the Part D Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount, also known as IRMAA. The extra charge is figured out using your modified adjusted gross income as reported on your IRS ta x return from 2 years ago. If this amount is above a certain amount, you'll pay the standard premium amount and the additional IRMAA. For more information on the extra amount you may have to pay based on your income, visit https://www.medicare.gov/drug- coverage -part-d/costs -for-medicare- drug- coverage/monthly- premium -for-drug-plans . If you have to pay an extra amount, Social Security, not your Medicare plan, will send you a letter telling you what that extra amount will be. The extra amount will be withheld from your Social Security, Railroad Retirement Board, or Office of Personnel Management benefit check , no matter how you usually pay your plan premium, unless your monthly benefit isn't enough to cover the extra amount owed. If your benefit check isn't enough to cover the extra amount , you will get a bill from Medicare . You must pay the extra amount to the government. It cannot be paid with your monthly plan premium. If you do not pay the extra amount , you will be disenrolled from the plan and lose prescription drug coverage. If you disagree about paying an extra amount, you can ask Social Security to review the decision. To find out more about how to do this, contact Social Security at 1- 800-772-1213 (TTY 1- 800- 325-0778). SECTION 5 More information about your m onthly premium Section 5.1 There are several ways you can pay your plan premium There are four ways you can pay your plan premium.

To set up monthly payments by automatic withdrawal, please call Member Services or register at www.GeisingerGold.com to use our online bill payment service. Changing the way you pay your premium.

To change your payment method for your premium please contact Member Services. What to do if you are having trouble paying your plan premium Your plan premium is due in our office by the 1 st day of the month in which you were enrolled. If we h ave not received your payment by the 1st day of the month in which you were enrolled, we will send you a monthly invoice of the premium amounts that are due to help you keep your account up to date. If you are having trouble paying your premium on time, please contact Member Services to see if we can direct you to programs that will help with your costs. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 15 Chapter 1 Getting started as a member Section 5.2 Can we change your monthly plan premium during the year? No. We are not allowed to change the amount we charge for the plan's mont hly plan premium during the year. If the monthly plan premium changes for next year we will tell you in September and the change will take effect on January 1. However, in some cases the part of the premium that you have to pay can change during the year. This happens if you become eligible for the \"Extra Help\" program or if you lose your eligibility for the \"Extra Help\" program during the year. If a member qualifies for \"Extra Help\" with their prescription drug costs, the \"Extra Help\" program will pay part of the member's monthly plan premium. A member who loses their eligibility during the year will need to start paying their full monthly premium. You can find out more about the \"Extra Help\" program in Chapter 2, Section 7. SECTION 6 Keeping your plan membership record up to date Your membership record has information from your enrollment form, including your address and telephone number. It shows your specific plan coverage. The doctors, hospitals, pharmacists, and other providers in the plan's network need to have correct information about you. These network providers use your membership record to know what services and drugs are covered and the cost -sharing amounts for you . Because of this, it is very important that you help us keep your information up to date.

SECTION 7 How other insurance works with our plan Other insurance Medicare requires that we collect information from you about any other medical or drug insurance coverage that you have. That's because we must coordinate any other coverage you have with your benefits under our plan. This is called Coordination of Benefit s. Once each year, we will send you a letter that lists any other medical or drug insurance coverage that we know about. Please read over this information carefully. If it is correct, you don't need to do anything. If the information is incorrect, or if you have other coverage that is not listed, please call Member Services. You may need to give your plan member ID number to your other insurers (once you have confirmed their identity) so your bills are paid correctly and on time. When you have other insurance (like employer group health coverage), there are rules set by Medicare that decide whether our plan or your other insurance pays first. The insurance that pays first is called the \"primary payer\" and pays up to the limits of its coverage. The one that pays second, called the \"secondary payer,\" only pays if there are costs left uncovered by the primary coverage. The secondary payer may not pay all of the uncovered costs. If you have other insurance, tell your doctor, hospital, and pharmacy. These rules ap ply for employer or union group health plan coverage: If you have retiree coverage, Medicare pays first. If your group health plan coverage is based on your or a family member's current employment, who pays first depends on your age, the number of people employed by your employer, and whether you have Medicare based on age, disability, or End- Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 17 Chapter 1 Getting started as a member o If you're under 65 and disabled and you or your family member is still working, your group health plan pays first if the employer has 100 or more employees or at least one employer in a multiple employer plan that has more than 100 employees. o If you're over 65 and you or your spouse is still working, your group health plan pays first if the employer has 20 or more employees or at least one employer in a multiple employer plan that has more than 20 employees. If you have Medicare because of ESRD, your group health plan will pay first for the first 30 months after you become eligible for Medicare . These types of coverage usually pay first for services related to each type: No-fault insurance (including automobile insurance) Liability (including automobile insurance) Black lung benefits Workers' compensation Medicaid and TRICARE never pay first for Medicare -covered services. They only pay after Medicare, employer group health plans, and/or Medigap have paid.

Geisinger Gold Pharmacy Member Services will assist you with this process. Please call us at 1 -800-988-4861 within 15 days of paying the cost sharing amount that you believe may be incorrect. You may be asked to provide us with documentation about your eligibility for \"Extra Help\" and the pharmacy receipt for the amount in question. Geisinger Gold Pharmacy Member Services will work with you, Medicare, and your pharmacy to assess if you have paid incorrect cost sharing. When we r eceive the evidence showing your copayment level, we will update our system so that you can pay the correct copayment when you get your next prescription at the pharmacy. If you overpay your copayment, we will reimburse you. Either we will forward a check to you in the amount of your overpayment , or we will offset future copayments. If the pharmacy hasn't collected a copayment from you and is carrying your copayment as a debt owed by you, we may make the payment directly to the pharmacy. If a state paid on your behalf, we may make payment directly to the state. Please contact Member Services if you have questions. Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program The Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program provides manufacturer discounts on brand name drugs to Part D m embers who have reached the coverage gap and are not receiving \"Extra Help.\" For brand name drugs, the 70% discount provided by manufacturers excludes any dispensing fee for costs in the coverage gap. Members pay 25% of the negotiated price and a portion of the dispensing fee for brand name drugs. If you reach the coverage gap, we will automatically apply the discount when your pharmacy bills you for your prescription and your Part D Explanation of Benefits (Part D EOB) will show any discount provided.

CHAPTER 3 : Using the plan for your medical services 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 40 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services SECTION 1 Things to know about getting your medical care as a member of our plan This chapter explains what you need to know about using the plan to get your medical care covered. It gives definitions of terms and explains the rules you will need to follow to get the medical treatments, services, equipment, prescription drugs, and other medical care that are covered by the plan. For the details on what medical care is covered by our plan and how much you pay when you get this care, use the benefits chart in the next chapter, Chapter 4 ( Medical Benefits Chart, what is covered and what you pay ). Section 1.1 What are \"network providers\" and \"covered services\"? \"Providers\" are doctors and other health care professionals licensed by the state to provide medical services and care. The term \"providers\" also includes hospitals and other health care facilities. \"Network providers\" are the doctors and other health care profession als, medical groups, hospitals, and other health care facilities that have an agreement with us to accept our payment and your cost -sharing amount as payment in full. We have arranged for these providers to deliver covered services to members in our plan. The providers in our network bill us directly for care they give you. When you see a network provider, you pay only your share of the cost for their services. \"Covered services\" include all the medical care, health care services, supplies equipment , and P rescription Drugs that are covered by our plan. Your covered services for medical care are listed in the benefits chart in Chapter 4. Your covered services for prescription drugs are discussed in Chapter 5. Section 1.2 Basic rules for getting your medical care covered by the plan As a Medicare health plan, Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) must cover all services covered by Original Medicare and must follow Original Medicare's coverage rules. Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) will generally co ver your medical care as long as: The care you receive is included in the plan's Medical Benefits Chart (this chart is in Chapter 4 of this document ). The care you receive is considered medically necessary . \"Medically necessary\" means that the services, su pplies, equipment , or drugs are needed for the prevention, diagnosis , or treatment of your medical condition and meet accepted standards of medical practice. You have a network primary care provider (a PCP) who is providing and overseeing your care. As a member of our plan, you must choose a network PCP (for more information about this, see Section 2.1 in this chapter). 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 41 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services You must receive your care from a network provider (for more information about this, see Section 2 in this chapter). In most cases, care you receive from an out -of- network provider (a provider who is not part of our plan's network) will not be covered. This means that you will have to pay the provider in full for the services furnished. Here are three exceptions: o The plan covers emergency care or urgently needed services that you get from an out-of-network provider. For more information about this, and to see what emergency or urgently needed services means, see Section 3 in this chapter. o If you need medical care t hat Medicare requires our plan to cover but there are no specialists in our network that provide this care , you can get this care from an out - of-network provider at the same cost sharing you normally pay in- network. Authorization must be obtained from our plan prior to seeking care. In this situation, you will pay the same as you would pay if you got the care from a network provider. For information about getting approval to see an out -of-network doctor, see Section 2.3 in this chapter. o The plan covers kidney dialysis services that you get at a Medicare -certified dialysis facility when you are temporarily outside the plan's service area or when your provider for this service is temporarily unavailable or inaccessible . The cost sharing you pay the plan for dialysis can never exceed the cost sharing in Original Medicare. If you are outside the plan's service area and obtain the dialysis from a provider that is outside the plan's network, your cost sharing cannot exceed the cost sharing you pay in- network. H owever, if your usual in- network provider for dialysis is temporarily unavailable and you choose to obtain services inside the service area from a provider outside the plan's network the cost sharing for the dialysis may be higher. SECTION 2 Use providers in the plan's network to get your medical care Section 2.1 You must choose a Primary Care Provider (PCP) to provide and oversee your medical care What is a \"PCP\" and what does the PCP do for you? When you become a member of our plan, you must choose a netw ork provider to be your Primary Care Provider (PCP). Your PCP is a physician who meets state requirements and is trained to give you routine medical care. You will get your routine or basic care from your PCP. Your PCP will also coordinate the rest of the covered services you get as a member of our plan. Your PCP will provide most of your care and will help you arrange or coordinate the rest of the covered services you get as a member of our plan. This includes x- rays, laboratory tests, therapies, care from doctors who are specialists, hospital admissions, and follow -up care. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 42 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services \"Coordinating\" your services includes checking or consulting with other network providers about your care and how your care is progressing. In some cases, your PCP will need to get prior authorization (prior approval) from us. Since your PCP will provide and coordinate your medical care, you should have all of your past medical records sent to your PCP's office. Chapter 8 Section 1.4 tells you how we will protect the privacy of your medi cal records and personal health information. How do you choose your PCP? Upon enrollment, you can choose a PCP by selecting a PCP listed in the Provider Directory or by obtaining assistance from Member Services. Changing your PCP You may change your PCP for any reason, at any time. Also, it's possible that your PCP might leave our plan's network of providers and you would have to find a new PCP. To change your PCP, call Member Services. When you call, be sure to tell Member Servic es if you are seeing specialists or getting other covered services that needed your PCP's approval (such as home health services , durable medical equipment (DME) or podiatry routine foot care services ). Member Services will help make sure that you can cont inue with the specialty care and other services you have been getting when you change your PCP. They will also check to be sure the PCP you want to switch to is accepting new patients. Member Services will change your membership record to show the name of your new PCP and tell you when the change to your new PCP will take effect. They will send you a new membership card that shows your new PCP office unless the change of your PCP is within the same primary care office. Section 2. 2 How to get care from speci alists and other network providers A specialist is a doctor who provides health care services for a specific disease or part of the body. There are many kinds of specialists. Here are a few examples: Oncologists care for patients with cancer. Cardiologists care for patients with heart conditions. Orthopedists care for patients with certain bone, joint, or muscle conditions. When your PCP thinks that you need specialized treatment, he/she will recommend that you see a plan specialist or certain other providers. Your PCP will help you arrange or coordinate covered services you get from other plan providers. For some types of services and care, your provider may need to get approval in advance from our plan (this is called \"prior authorization\"). S ervices that need prior authorization are identified in the Benefits Chart in Chapter 4, Section 2.1 by statements in bold italics . You are responsible for making sure that your provider has obtained prior authorization from the plan before you receive any care or services that require it. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 43 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services What if a specialist or another network provider leaves our plan? We may make changes to the hospitals, doctors, and specialists (providers) that are part of your plan during the year. If your doctor or specialist leaves your plan you have certain rights and protections that are summarized below: Even though our network of providers may change during the year, Medicare requires that we furnish you with uninterrupted access to qualified doctors and specialists. We will ma ke a good faith effort to provide you with at least 30 days' notice that your provider is leaving our plan so that you have time to select a new provider. We will assist you in selecting a new qualified provider to continue managing your health care needs. If you are undergoing medical treatment , we will work with you to ensure that the medically necessary treatment you are receiving is not interrupted. If our network does not have a qualified specialist for a plan- covered service, we must cover that service at in -network cost sharing. Authorizat ion must be obtained from the plan prior to seeking this type of out -of-network care. If you find out your doctor or specialist is leaving your plan, please contact us so we can assist you in finding a new provider to manage your care. If you believe we ha ve not furnished you with a qualified provider to replace your previous provider , or that your care is not being appropriately managed, you have the right to file a quality -of-care complaint to the QIO, a quality -of-care grievance to the plan, or both. Ple ase see Chapter 9. Section 2. 3 How to get care from out -of-network providers In certain situations, it may be necessary for you to obtain care outside of the plan's network. You do not need permission from the plan (called prior authorization) to seek out -of-network emergency or urgently needed services, but for all other types of care, you are responsible for making sure that prior authorization has been obtained before you receive out -of-network care. Except for emergency and urgently needed services, we will not pay for out -of-network care you receive without first obtaining prior authorization. To ask for prior authorization, please call the Member Services phone number listed on the back of your Geisinger Gold membership card. Our plan covers emergency care or urgently needed services that you obtain from an out-of-network provider. For more information about this, and to see what emergency or urgently needed services means, see Section 3 in this chapter. You do not need prior authorization to seek emergency or urgently needed services out -of-network. If you get emergency or urgently needed services out -of-network, your cost is the same cost you would pay in- network for the same service. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 44 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services If you need medical care that Medicare requires our plan to cover and an in -network provider cannot provide this care, you can get this care from an out -of-network provider. Authorization must be obt ained from the plan prior to seeking this type of out -of-network care. In this situation, you will pay the same as you would pay if you got the care from a network provider. Kidney dialysis services that you get at a Medicare -certified dialysis facility wh en you are temporarily outside the plan's service area. Routine and Medicare -covered eyewear (prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses) benefits may be obtained out -of-network. Prior authorization to go out -of-network for eyewear is not necessary. Supplem ental dental benefits, up to your plan's allowed benefit maximum, can be provided by a participating provider OR any licensed dentist. For more information, see your new 2023 member ID card or contact Member Services. SECTION 3 How to get services when you have an emergency or urgent need for care or during a disa ster Section 3.1 Getting care if you have a medical emergency What is a \"medical emergency\" and what should you do if you have one? A \"medical emergency\" is when you, or any other prudent layperson with an average knowledge of health and medicine, believe that you have medical symptoms that require immediate medical attention to prevent your loss of life (and, if you are a pregnant woman, loss of an unborn child), loss of a limb or function of a lim b, or loss of or serious impairment to a bodily function. The medical symptoms may be an illness, injury, severe pain, or a medical condition that is quickly getting worse. If you have a medical emergency: Get help as quickly as possible. Call 911 for help or go to the nearest emergency room or hospital. Call for an ambulance if you need it. You do not need to get approval first from your PCP. You do not need to use a network doctor. You may get covered emergency medical care whenever you need it, anywhere in the United States or its territories , and from any provider with an appropriate state license even if they are not part of our network. As soon as possible, make sure that our plan has been told about your emergency. We need to follow up on your emergency care. You or someone else should call to tell us about your emergency care, usually within 48 hours. The number to call is on the back of your Geisinger Gold membership card. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 45 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services What is covered if you have a medical emergency? Our plan covers ambulance services in situations where getting to the emergency room in any other way could endanger your health. We also cover medical services during the emergency. The doctors who are giving you emergency care will decide when your condition is stable and the medical emergency is over. After the emergency is over you are entitled to follow -up care to be sure your condition continues to be stable. Your doctors will continue to treat you until your doctors contact us and make plans for additional care. Your follow -up care will be covered by our plan. If your emergency care is provided by out -of-network providers, we will try to arrange for network pr oviders to take over your care as soon as your medical condition and the circumstances allow. What if it wasn't a medical emergency? Sometimes it can be hard to know if you have a medical emergency. For example, you might go in for emergency care - thinki ng that your health is in serious danger - and the doctor may say that it wasn't a medical emergency after all. If it turns out that it was not an emergency, as long as you reasonably thought your health was in serious danger, we will cover your care. However, after the doctor has said that it was not an emergency, we will cover additional care only if you get the additional care in one of these two ways: You go to a network provider to get the additional care. - or - T he additional care you get is considered \"urgently needed services \" and you follow the rules for getting this urgent ly needed services (for more information about this, see Section 3.2 below). Section 3.2 Getting care when you have an urgent need for services What are \"urgently needed services \"? An urgently needed service is a non- emergency situation requiring immediate medical care , but given your circumstances, it is not possible or not reasonable to obtain these services from a network provider. The plan must cover urgently needed services provided out -of-network. Some examples of urgently needed services are 1) a severe sore throat that occurs over the weekend or 2) an unforeseen flare- up of a known condition when you are temporarily outside the service area. If you are in the plan's service area and have an urgent need for services, you should contact your PCP's office first, if possible. Many primary care providers reserve some time each day to see patients with an urgent need for services. Even after hours, your PCP may be able to assis t you, 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 46 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services or may be able to direct you to a partnering in- network provider who is on call for urgent after - hours services. You may also call our 24- hour nurse line, Tel -a-nurse, for assistance at 877- 543- 5061. If your PCP and other network providers are unava ilable or inaccessible, our plan will cover urgently needed services that you receive at an urgent care center or from an out -of- network provider. Our plan covers worldwide emergency and urgent care services outside the United States under the following ci rcumstances : If an urgent need for medical services occurs while you are traveling outside the United States, your Geisinger Gold Worldwide Emergency/Urgent Coverage benefit will cover urgently needed services you receive outside of the United States and its territories. Coverage is limited to services that would be classified as urgently needed services had you received them inside the United States, up to a combined Worldwide Emergency/Urgent Coverage benefit limit of $100,000 per year. Our plan does not cover non -emergency/non- urgent services if you receive the care outside of the United States . For more information , please see the Worldwide e mergency/ urgent coverage section of the Benefit Chart in Chapter 4 or contact Member Services. Section 3.3 Getting care during a disaster If the Governor of your state, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, or the President of the United States declares a state of disaster or emergency in your geographic area, you are still entitled to care from your p lan. Please visit the following website: www.GeisingerGold.com for information on how to obtain needed care during a disaster . If you cannot use a network provider during a disaster, your plan will allow you to obtain care from out -of-network providers at in -network cost sharing. If you cannot use a network pharmacy during a disaster, you may be able to fill your prescription drugs at an out -of-network pharmacy. Please see Chapter 5, Section 2.5 for more information. SECTION 4 What if you are billed directly for the full cost of your services? Section 4.1 You can ask us to pay our share of the cost of covered services If you have paid more than your plan cost -sharing for covered services, or if you have received a bill for the full cost of covered medical services, go to Chapter 7 ( Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services or drugs ) for information about what to do. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 47 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services Section 4. 2 If services are not covered by our plan, you must pay the full cost Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) covers all medical ly necessary services as listed in the Medical Benefits Chart in Chapter 4 of this document. If you receive services not covere d by our plan or services obtained out -of-network and were not authorized, you are responsible for paying the full cost of services . For covered services that have a benefit limitation, you also pay the full cost of any services you get after you have use d up your benefit for that type of covered service . Costs you have paid once a benefit limit has been reached will not count toward your out -of-pocket maximum. SECTION 5 How are your medical services covered when you are in a \"clinical research study\"? Section 5.1 What is a \"clinical research study\"? A clinical research study (also called a \"clinical trial\") is a way that doctors and scientists test new types of medical care, like how well a new cancer drug works. Certain clinical research studie s are approved by Medicare. Clinical research studies approved by Medicare typically request volunteers to participate in the study. Once Medicare approves the study, and you express interest, someone who works on the study will contact you to explain mor e about the study and see if you meet the requirements set by the scientists who are running the study. You can participate in the study as long as you meet the requirements for the study and you have a full understanding and acceptance of what is involved if you participate in the study. If you participate in a Medicare -approved study, Original Medicare pays most of the costs for the covered services you receive as part of the study. If you tell us that you are in a qualified clinical trial, then you are only responsible for the in- network cost sharing for th e services in that trial . If you paid more, for example, if you already paid the Original Medicare cost -sharing amount, we will reimburse the difference between what you paid and the in- network cost sha ring. However , you will need to provide documentation to show us how much you paid. When you are in a clinical research study, you may stay enrolled in our plan and continue to get the rest of your care (the care that is not related to the study) through our plan. If you want to participate in a ny Medicare- approved clinical research study, you do not need to tell us or to get approval from us or your PCP. The providers that deliver your care as part of the clinical research study do not need to be part of our plan's network of providers. Although you do not need to get our plan's permission to be in a clinical research study, we encourage you to notify us in advance when you choose to participate in Medicare- qualified clinical trials. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 48 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services If you participate in a study that Medicare has not approved, you will be responsible for paying all costs for your participation in the study . Section 5.2 When you participate in a clinical research study, who pays for what? Once you join a Medicare -approved clinical research study, Original Medicare covers the routine items and services you receive as part of the study, including: Room and board for a hospital stay that Medicare would pay for even if you weren't in a study. An operation or other medical procedure if it is part of the research study. Treatment of side effects and complications of the new care. After Medicare has paid its share of the cost for these services, our plan will pay the difference between the cost sharing in Original Medicare and your in -network cost sharing as a member of our plan. This means you will pay the same amount for the services you receive as part of the study as you would if you received these services from our plan. However , you are required to submit documentation showing how much cost sharing you paid. Please see Chapter 7 for more information for submitting requests for payments. Here's an example of how the cost sharing works: Let's say that you have a lab test that costs $100 as part of the research study. Let's also say that your share of the costs for this test is $20 under Original Medicare, but the test would be $10 under our plan's benefits. In this case, Original Medicare would pay $80 for the test and you would pay the $20 copay required under Original Medicare . You would then notify your plan that you received a qualified clinical trial service and submit documentation such as a provider bill to the plan. The plan would then directly pay you $10. Th erefore, your net payment is $10, the same amount you would pay under our plan's benefits. Please note that in order to receive payment from your plan, you must submit documentation to your plan such as a provider bill. When you are part of a clinical research study, neither Medicare nor our plan will pay for any of the following: Generally, Medicare will not pay for the new item or service that the study is testing unless Medicare would cover the item or service even if you were not in a study. Items or services provided only to collect data, and not used in your direct health care. For example, Medicare woul d not pay for monthly CT scans done as part of the study if your medical condition would normally require only one CT scan. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 49 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services Do you want to know more? You can get more information about joining a clinical research study by visiting the Medicare website to r ead or download the publication \"Medicare and Clinical Research Studies .\" (The publication is available at: www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/02226- Medicare- and-Clinical -Research - 1- 800-MEDICARE (1 -800-633-4227) , 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users should call 1- 877-486-2048. SECTION 6 Rules for getting care in a \"religious non -medical health care institution\" Section 6.1 What is a religious non- medical health care institution? A religious non- medical health care institution is a facility that provides care for a condition that would ordinarily be treated in a hospital or skilled nursing facility. If getting care in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility is against a member's religious beliefs, we will instead provide coverage for care in a religious non- medical health care institution. This benefit is provided only for Part A inpatient services (non- medical health care services). Section 6.2 Receiving Care from a Religious Non- Medical Health Care Institution To get care from a religious non- medical health care institution, you must sign a legal document that says you are conscientiously opposed to getting medical treatment that is \"non- excepted.\" \"Non -excepted\" medical care or treatment is any medical care or treatment that is voluntary and not required by any federal, state, or local law. \"Excepted\" medical treatment is medical care or treatment that you get that is not voluntary or is required under federal, state, or local law. To be covered by our plan, the care you get from a religious non- medical health care institution must meet the following conditions: The facility providing the care must be certified by Medicare. Our plan' s coverage of services you receive is limited to non- religious aspects of care. If you get services from this institution that are provided to you in a facility, the following conditions apply: o You must have a medical condition that would allow you to rece ive covered services for inpatient hospital care or skilled nursing facility care. o - and - you must get approval in advance from our plan before you are admitted to the facility or your stay will not be covered. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 50 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services o Original Medicare inpatient hospital coverag e limits apply. o For more information about our plan's coverage of services, please see the Medical Benefit Chart in Chapter 4. SECTION 7 Rules for ownership of durable medical equipment Section 7.1 Will you own the durable medical equipment after making a certain number of payments under our plan? Durable medical equipment (DME) includes items such as oxygen equipment and supplies, wheelchairs, walkers, powered mattress systems, crutches, diabetic supplies, speech generating devices, IV infusion pumps, nebulizers, and hospital beds ordered by a provider for use in the home. The member always owns certain items, such as prosthetics. In this section, we dis cuss other types of DME that you must rent. In Original Medicare, people who rent certain types of DME own the equipment after paying copayment s for the item for 13 months. As a member of Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) , however, you usually will not acquire ownership of rented DME items no matter how many copayments you make for the item while a member of our plan, even if you made up to 12 consecutive payments for the DME item under Original Medicare before you joined our plan. Under certain limited circumstances we will transfer ownership of the DME item to you. Call member services for more information. There are certain types of DME that are not eligible for conversion from rental to member ownership, including but not limited to: oxygen, ventilators and power mobility. Before converting an equipment rental to member ownership, we may need documentation from your provider stating that you continue to use the equipment and that it is still medically necessary. For more information about rent to own DME and which network DME suppliers offer a rent to own option, please call Member Services. If you choose a DME supplier who does the rent to own option, after the rental period is over and you become the owner, you may be r esponsible for part of the cost to have the equipment serviced. Please note that accessories and supplies used on, in, or with the DME item are not included in the 13- month rental payment cap. You continue to be responsible for cost sharing on these associ ated items and supplies purchased for you. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 51 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services What happens to payments you made for durable medical equipment if you switch to Original Medicare? If you did not acquire ownership of the DME item while in our plan, you will have to make 13 new consecutive payments after you switch to Original Medicare in order to own the item. The payments made while enrolled in our plan do not count. Example 1: Y ou made 12 or fewer consecutive payments for the item in Original Medicare and then joined our plan . The payments you made in Original Medicare do not count. Example 2: You made 12 or fewer consecutive payments for the item in Original Medicare and then joined our plan. You were in our plan but did not obtain ownership while in our plan. You then go back to Original Medicare. You will have to make 13 consecutive new payments to own the item once you join Original Medicare again. All previous payments (whether to our plan or to Original Medicare) do not count. Section 7 .2 Rules for oxygen equipment, supplies, and maintenance What oxygen benefits are you entitled to? If you qualify for Medicare oxygen equipment coverage Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) will cover : Rental of oxygen equipment Delivery of oxygen a nd oxygen contents Tubing and related oxygen accessories for the delivery of oxygen and oxygen contents Maintenance and repairs of oxygen equipment If you leave Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) or no longer medically require oxygen equipment, then the oxygen equipment must be returned. What happens if you leave our plan and return to Original Medicare? Original Medicare requires an oxygen supplier to provide you services for five years. During the first 36 months you rent the equipment. The remaining 24 months the supplier provides the equipment and maintenance (you are still responsible for the cost sharing for oxygen). After five years you may choose to stay with the same company or go to another company. At this point, the five -year cycle begins again, even if you remain with the same company, requiring you to pay co st sharing for the first 36 months. If you join or leave our plan, the five -year cycle starts over. CHAPTER 4 : Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 53 Chapter 4 Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) SECTION 1 Understanding your out -of-pocket costs for covered services This chapter provides a Medical Benefits Chart that list s your covered services and shows how much you will pay for each covered service as a member of Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) . Later in this chapter, you can find information about medical services that are not covered. It also explains limits on certain services. Section 1.1 Types of out -of-pocket costs you may pay for your covered services To understand the payment information we give you in this chapter, you need to know about the types of out -of-pocket costs you may pay for your covered services. A \"copayment\" is the fixed amount you pay each time you receive certain medical services . You pay a copayment at the time you get the medical service . (The Medical Benefits Chart in Section 2 tells you more about your copayments.) \"Coinsurance\" is the percent age you pay of the total cost of certain medical services . You pay a coinsura nce at the time you get the medical service. (The Medical Benefits Chart in Section 2 tells you more about your coinsurance.) Most people who qualify for Medicaid or for the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) program should never pay deductibles, copayme nts or coinsurance. Be sure to show your proof of Medicaid or QMB eligibility to your provider , if applicable . Section 1. 2 What is the most you will pay for Medicare Part A and Part B covered medical services? Because you are enrolled in a Medicare Advanta ge Plan, there is a limit on the total amount you have to pay out -of-pocket each year for in -network medical services that are covered under Medicare Part A and Part B . This limit is called the maximum out- of-pocket (MOOP) amount for medical services. For calendar year 202 3 this amount is $4,900. The amounts you pay for copayments and coinsurance for in -network covered services count toward this maximum out -of-pocket amount . The amounts you pay for your plan premiums and for your Part D prescr iption drugs do not count toward your maximum out -of-pocket amount . In addition, amounts you pay for some services do not count toward your maximum out -of-pocket amount. These services are marked with an asterisk in the Medical Benefits Chart. If you reach the maximum out -of-pocket amount of $4,900, you will not have to pay any out -of-pocket costs for the rest of the year for in -network covered Part A and Part B services. However, you must continue to pay your plan premium and the Medicare Part B premium ( unless your Part B premium is paid for you by Medicaid or another third party) . 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 54 Chapter 4 Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) Section 1. 3 Our plan does not allow providers to \"balance bill\" you As a member of Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) , an important protection for you is that you only have to pay your cost-sharing amount when you get services covered by our plan. Providers may not add additional separate charges , called \"balance billing.\" This pr otection applies even if we pay the provider less than the provider charges for a service and even if there is a dispute and we don't pay certain provider charges. Here is how this protection works. If your cost sharing is a copayment (a set amount of dollars, for example, $15.00), then you pay only that amount for any covered services f rom a network provider. If your cost sharing is a coinsurance (a percentage of the total charges), then you never pay more than that percentage. However, your cost depends on which type of provider you see: o If you receive the covered services from a netwo rk provider, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the plan's reimbursement rate ( as determined in the contract between the provider and the plan) . o If you receive the covered services from an out -of-network provider who participates with Medica re, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment rate for participating providers . (Remember, the plan covers services from out -of-network providers only in certain situations, such as when you get an authorization from the plan or for emergencies or urgently needed services .) o If you receive the covered services from an out -of-network provider who does not participate with Medicare , you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment rate for non -participating pr oviders. (Remember, the plan covers services from out -of-network providers only in certain situations, such as when you get an authorization from the plan or for emergencies or urgently needed services .) If you believe a provider has \"balance billed\" you, call Member Services . SECTION 2 Use the Medical Benefits Chart to find out what is covered and how much you will pay Section 2.1 Your medical benefits and costs as a member of the plan The Medical Benefits Chart on the following pages lists the services G eisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) covers and what you pay out -of-pocket for each service . Part D prescription drug coverage is in Chapter 5. The services listed in the Medical Benefits Chart are covered only when the following coverage requirements a re met: 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 55 Chapter 4 Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) Your Medicare covered services must be provided according to the coverage guidelines established by Medicare. Your services (including medical care, services, supplies, equipment , and Part B prescription drugs ) must be medically necessary. \"Medically necessary\" means that the services, supplies, or drugs are needed for the prevention, diagnosis , or treatment of your medical condition and meet accepted standards of medical practice. You receive your care from a networ k provider. In most cases, care you receive from an out-of-network provider will not be covered unless it is emergent or urgent care or unless your plan or a network provider has given you an authorization. This means that you will have to pay the provider in full for the services furnished. You have a primary care provider (a PCP) who is providing and overseeing your care. Some of the services listed in the Medical Benefits Chart are covered only if your doctor or other network provider gets approval in advance (sometimes called \"prior authorization\") from us. Covered services that need approval in advance are marked in the Medical Benefits Chart bold italics . In addition, the following services not listed in the Benefits Chart require prior authorization: o Biofeedback Training We may also charge you \"administrative fees\" for missed appointments or for not paying your required cost sharing at the time of service. Call Member Services if you have questions regarding these administrative fees. Other important things to know about our coverage: Like all Medicare health plans, we cover everything that Original Medicare covers. For some of these benefits, you pay more in our plan than you would in Original Medicare. For others, you pay less.

For all preventive services that are covered at no cost under Original Medicare, we also cover the service at no cost to you. However, if you also are treated or monitored for an existing medical c ondition during the visit when you receive the preventive service, a copayment will apply for the care received for the existing medical condition. If Medicare adds coverage for any new services during 2023, either Medicare or our plan will cover those ser vices.

Please see Chapter 4 for Medicare Part B drug benefits and hospice drug benefits. Section 1. 1 Basic rules for the plan's Part D drug coverage The plan will generally cover your drugs as long as you follow these basic rules: You must have a provider (a doctor, dentist , or other prescriber) write you a prescription which must be valid under applicable state law. Your prescriber must not be on Medicare's Exclusion or Preclusion Lists . You generally must use a network pharmacy to fill your prescription. (See Section 2, Fi ll your prescriptions at a network pharmacy or through the plan's mail -order service ). Your drug must be on the plan's List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) (we call it the \"Drug List\" for short). (See Section 3, Your drugs need to be on the plan's \"Drug List \"). Your drug must be used for a medically accepted indication. A \" medically accepted indication \" is a use of the drug that is either approved by the Food and Drug Administration or supported by certain reference books. (See Section 3 for more information about a medically accepted indication.) SECTION 2 Fill your prescription at a network pharmacy or through the plan's mail -order service Section 2.1 Use a network pharmacy In most cases, your prescriptions are covered only if they are filled at the plan's network pharmacies. (See Section 2.5 for information about when we would cover prescriptions filled at out -of-network pharmacies.) A network pharmacy is a pharmacy that has a contract with the plan to provide your covered prescription drugs. The term \"covered drugs\" means all of the Part D prescription drugs that are on the plan's Drug List. Section 2.2 Network pharmacies How do you find a network pharmacy in your area? To find a network pharmacy, you can look in your Provider Directory, visit our website (www.GeisingerGold.com ), and/ or call Pharmacy Member Services . 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 101 Chapter 5 Using the plan's coverage for Part D prescription drugs You may go to any of our network pharmacies. What if the pharmacy you have been using leaves the network? If the pharmacy you have been using leaves the plan's network, you will have to find a new pharmacy that is in the network. To find another pharmacy in your area, you can get help from Pharmacy Member Services or use the Provider Directory. You ca n also find information on our website at www.GeisingerGold.com . What if you need a specialized pharmacy? Some prescriptions must be filled at a specialized pharmacy. Specialized pharmacies include: Pharmacies that supply drugs for home infusion therapy. P lease refer to your Provider Directory to find a home infusion pharmacy provider in your area or you can get help from Member Services. Pharmacies that supply drugs for residents of a long- term care (LTC) facility. Usually, a LTC facility (such as a nursing home) has its own pharmacy. If you have any difficulty accessing your Part D benefits in an LTC facility, please contact Pharmacy Member Services. Pharmacies that serve the Indian Health Service / Tribal / Urban Indian Health Program (not available in Puerto Rico). Except in emergencies, only Native Americans or Alaska Natives have access to these pharmacies in our network. Pharmacies that dispense drugs that are restricted by the FDA to certain locations or that require special handling, provider coordination, or education on their use. ( Note: This scenario should happen rarely.) To locate a specialized pharmacy, look in your Provider Directory or call Member Services . Section 2.3 Using the plan's mail -order service For certain kinds of drugs, you can use the plan's network mail -order service. Generally, the drugs provided through mail order are drugs that you take on a regular basis, for a chronic or long- term medical condition. The drugs that are not available through the plan's mail -order service are marked with \"NM\" in our Drug List. Our plan's mail -order service allows you to order up to a 100- day supply . To get information about filling your prescriptions by mail -order please call the Geisinger Mail Order Pharmacy at 1 -844-878-5562 or Pharmacy Member Services at 1 -800-988-4861. Usually , a mail -order pharmacy order will be delivered to you in no more than 10 days. However, sometimes your mail -order may be delayed. If this occurs, Geisinger Gold will 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 102 Chapter 5 Using the plan's coverage for Part D prescription drugs coordinate with your retail pharmacis t and mail order facility to see that you receive necessary medications. If your mail -order pharmacy order is delayed, please call Pharmacy Member Services. New prescriptions the pharmacy receives directly from your doctor's office. After the pharmacy receives a prescription from a health care provider, it will contact you to see if you want the medication filled immediately or at a later time. It is important that you respond each time you are contacted by the pharmacy, to let them know whether to ship, delay, or stop the new prescription. Refills on mail- order prescriptions. For refills of your drugs, you have the option to sign up for an automatic refill program . Under this program we will start to process your next refill automatically when our records show you should be close to running out of your drug. The pharmacy will contact you prior to shipping each refill to make sure you need more medication, and you ca n cancel scheduled refills if you have enough of your medication or if your medication has changed. If you choose not to use our auto- refill program but still want the mail- order pharmacy to send you your prescription, please contact your mail- order pharm acy 21 days before you r current prescription will run out. This will ensure your order is shipped to you in time. To opt out of our program t hat automatically prepares mail- order refills, please contact us by calling the Geisinger Mail Order Pharmacy at 1 -844-878-5562 or Pharmacy Member Services at 1 -800-988-4861. If you receive a refill automatically by mail that you do not want, you may be eligible for a refund. Section 2.4 How can you get a long- term supply of drugs? When you get a long- term supply of drugs, your cost sharing may be lower. The plan offers two ways to get a long- term supply (also called an \"extended supply\" ) of \"maintenance\" drugs on our plan's Drug List. ( Maintenance drugs are drugs that you take on a regular basis, for a chronic or long- term medical condition.) 1. Some retail pharmacies in our network allow you to get a long- term supply of maintenance drugs Your Provider Directory tells you which pharmacies in our network can give you a long- term supply of maintenance drugs. You can also call Pharmacy Member Services for more information. 2. You may also receive maintenance drugs through our mail -order program. Please see Section 2.3 for more information. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 103 Chapter 5 Using the plan's coverage for Part D prescription drugs Section 2.5 When can you use a pharmacy that is not in the plan's network? Your prescription may be covered in certain situations Generally, we cover drugs filled at an out -of-network pharmacy only when you are not able to use a network pharmacy. To help you, we have network pharmacies outside of our se rvice area where you can get your prescriptions filled as a member of our plan. Please check first with Pharmacy Member Services to see if there is a network pharmacy nearby. You will most likely be required to pay the difference between what you pay for t he drug at the out -of-network pharmacy and the cost that we would cover at an in -network pharmacy. Here are the circumstances when we would cover prescriptions filled at an out -of-network pharmacy: If you are unable to get a covered drug in a timely manner within our service area, because there are no network pharmacies within a reasonable driving distance that provide 24- hour service. If you are trying to fill a covered prescription drug that is not regularly stocked at an eligible network retail or mail order pharmacy (these drugs include orphan drugs or other specialty pharmaceuticals). Getting your prescription drugs in a disaster or emergency. If the Governor, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, or the President of the United States declares a disaster or emergency in your local area, the usual rules for obtaining your prescription drugs may change for a short time. Contact Geisinger Gold if you had to leave your home without your drugs, or your drugs have been damaged or lost because of the emergency or disaster. The number to call is on the back of your Geisinger Gold membership card. If you can't reasonably get to a network pharmacy, we can help you get drugs during an emergency or disaster at an out -of-network pharmacy at the in- network cost sharing rate. How do you ask for reimbursement from the plan? If you must use an out -of-network pharmacy, you will generally have to pay the full cost (rather than your normal cost share) at the time you fill your prescription. You can ask us to reimburse you for our share of the cost. (Chapter 7, Section 2.1 explains how to ask the plan to pay you back.) 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 104 Chapter 5 Using the plan's coverage for Part D prescription drugs SECTION 3 Your drugs need to be on the plan's \"Drug List\" Section 3.1 The \"Drug List\" tells which Part D drugs are covered The plan has a \"List of Covered Drugs (Formulary).\" In this Evidence of Coverage , we call it the \"Drug List\" for short. The drugs on this list are selected by the plan with the help of a team of doctors and pharmacists. The list meets Medicare's requirements and has been approved by Medicare . The drugs on the Drug List are only those covered under Medicare Part D. We will generally cover a drug on the plan's Drug List as long as you follow the coverage rules explained in this chapter and the use of the drug is a medically accepted indication. A \"m edically accepted indication\" is a use of the drug that is either : Approved by the Food and Dr ug Administration for the diagnosis or condition for which it is being prescribed. -- or -- S upported by certain references, such as the American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information and the DRUGDEX Information System . The Drug List includes brand name drugs, generic drugs, and biosimil ars. A brand name drug is a prescription drug that is sold under a trademarked name owned by the drug manufacturer. Brand name drugs that are more complex than typical drugs (for example, drugs that are based on a protein) are called biological products. On the drug list, when we refer to \"drugs,\" this could mean a drug or a biological product. A generic drug is a prescription drug that has the same active ingredients as the brand name drug. Since biological products are more complex than typical drugs, instead of having a generic form, they have alternatives that are called biosimilars. Generall y, generics and biosimilars work just as well as the brand name drug or biological product and usually cost less. There are generic drug substitutes or biosimilar alternatives available for many brand name drugs and some biological products . What is not on the Drug List? The plan does not cover all prescription drugs. In some cases, the law does not allow any Medicare plan to cover certain types of drugs (for more information about this, see Section 7.1 in this chapter). 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 105 Chapter 5 Using the plan's coverage for Part D prescription drugs In other cases, we have decided not to include a particular drug on the Drug List . In some cases , you may be able to obtain a drug that is not on the drug list. For more information , please see Chapter 9 . Section 3.2 There are six \"cost -sharing tiers\" for drugs on the Drug List Every drug on the plan's Drug List is in one of six cost-sharing tiers. In ge neral, the higher the cost-sharing tier, the higher your cost for the drug: Cost Sharing Tier 1 includes Preferred Generic drugs. This is the lowest cost sharing tier. Cost Sharing Tier 2 includes Generic drugs. Cost Sharing Tier 3 includes Preferred Brand drugs and some select insulins . Cost Sharing Tier 4 includes Non- Preferred Brand drugs , some generic drugs and some select insulins . Cost Sharing Tier 5 includes Specialty Tier drugs and has 33% coinsurance. Generally, this is the highest cost sharing tier. Cost Sharing Tier 6 includes Specific Vaccines. Vaccines in this tier are available with no cost sharing. To find out which cost -sharing tier your drug is in, look it up in the plan's Drug List. The amount you pay for drugs in each cost -sharing tier is shown in Chapter 6 ( What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs ). Section 3.3 How can you find out if a specific drug is on the Drug List? You have three ways to find out: 1. Check the most recent Drug List we sent you in the mail . 2. Visit the plan's website (www.GeisingerGold.com ). The Drug List on the website is always the most current. 3. Call Pharmacy Member Services to find out if a particular drug is on the plan's Drug List or to ask for a copy of the list. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 106 Chapter 5 Using the plan's coverage for Part D prescription drugs SECTION 4 There are restrictions on coverage for some drugs Section 4.1 Why do some drugs have restrictions? For certain prescription drugs, special rules restrict how and when the plan covers them. A team of doctors and ph armacists developed these rules to encourage you and your provider to use drugs in the most effective ways. To find out if any of these restrictions apply to a drug you take or want to take, check the Drug List. If a safe, lower -cost drug will work just as well medically as a higher -cost drug, the plan's rules are designed to encourage you and your provider to use that lower -cost option. Please note that sometimes a drug may appear more than once on our drug list. This is because the same drugs can differ based on the strength, amount, or form of the drug prescribed by your health care provider , and different restrictions or cost sharing may apply to the different versions of the drug ( for instance, 10 mg versus 100 mg; one per day versus two per day; tablet versus liquid). Section 4.2 What kinds of restrictions? The sections below tell you more about the types of restrictions we use for certain drugs. If there is a restriction for your drug, it us ually means that you or your provider will have to take extra steps in order for us to cover the drug. Contact Pharmacy Member Services to learn what you or your provider would need to do to get coverage for the drug. If you want us to waive the restrictio n for you, you will need to use the coverage decision process and ask us to make an exception. We may or may not agree to waive the restriction for you. (See Chapter 9) Restricting brand name drugs when a generic version is available Generally, a \"generi c\" drug works the same as a brand name drug and usually costs less. When a generic version of a brand name drug is available, our network pharmacies will provide you the generic version instead of the brand name drug . However, if your provider has told us the medical reason that neither the generic drug nor other covered generic drugs that treat the same condition will work for you, then we will cover the brand name drug. (Your share of the cost may be greater for the brand name drug than for the generic dr ug.) Getting plan approval in advance For certain drugs, you or your provider need to get approval from the plan before we will agree to cover the drug for you. This is called \" prior authorization .\" This is put in place to ensure medication safety and help guide appropriate use of certain drugs. If you do not get this approval, your drug might not be covered by the plan. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 107 Chapter 5 Using the plan's coverage for Part D prescription drugs Trying a different drug first This requirement encourages you to try less costly but usually just as effective drugs before the plan covers another drug. For example, if Drug A and Drug B treat the same medical condition, the plan may require you to try Drug A first. If Drug A does not work for you, the plan will then cover Drug B. This requirement to try a different drug first is called \" step therapy .\" Quantity limits For certain drugs, we limit how much of a drug you can get each time you fill your prescription. For example, if it is normally considered safe to take only one pill per day for a certain drug, we may limit coverage for your prescription to no more than one pill per day. Section 4.3 Hepatitis C Treatment at a Center of Excellence (COE) Members with Hepatitis C are encouraged to visit a Center of Excellence for treatment. A COE is a group of licensed physicians who share a hospital or medical center in order to provide high quality specialty healthcare for chronic conditions. Physicians located in the COE demonstrate best practices by using clinically proven health care management techniques as evidenced by their exceptional cure rates following treatment, high adherence rates for medication and excellent patient satisfaction scores. Geisinger Gold currently has four COE facilities that focus on treatment of Hepatitis C. Hep atitis C viral infection can be a chronic condition where scarring can damage the liver over time. Questions may be directed to the Pharmacy Customer Service Team at 800 -988-4861. SECTION 5 What if one of your drugs is not covered in the way you'd like it to be covered? Section 5.1 There are things you can do if your drug is not covered in the way you'd like it to be covered There are situations where there is a prescription drug you are taking , or one that you and your provider think you should be taking t hat is not on our formulary or is on our formulary with restrictions . For example: The drug might not be covered at all. Or maybe a generic version of the drug is covered but the brand name version you want to take is not covered. The drug is covered, but there are extra rules or restrictions on coverage for that drug, a s explained in Section 4. The drug is covered, but it is in a cost -sharing tier that makes your cost sharing more expensive than you think it should be . 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 108 Chapter 5 Using the plan's coverage for Part D prescription drugs There are things you can do if your drug is not covered in the way that you'd like it to be covered. If your drug is not on the Drug List or if your drug is restricted, go to Section 5.2 to learn what you can do. If your drug is in a cost -sharing tier that makes your cost more expensive tha n you think it should be, go to Section 5.3 to learn what you can do. Section 5.2 What can you do if your drug is not on the Drug List or if the drug is restricted in some way? If your drug is not on the Drug List or is restricted, here are options : You may be able to get a temporary supply of the drug You can change to another drug. You can request an exception and ask the plan to cover the drug or remove restrictions from the drug. You may be able to get a temporary supply Under certain circumstances, the plan must provide a temporary supply of a drug that you are already taking . This temporary supply gives you time to talk with your provider about the change in coverage and de cide what to do. To be eligible for a temporary supply, the drug you have been taking must no longer be on the plan's Drug List OR is now restricted in some way . If you are a new member, we will cover a temporary supply of your drug during the first 90 days of your membership in the plan. If you were in the plan last year, we will cover a temporary supply of your drug during the first 90 days of the calendar year. This temporary supply will be for a maximum of a 30- day supply. If your prescription is written for fewer days, we will allow multiple fills to provide up to a maximum of a 30 - day supply of medication. The prescription must be filled at a network pharmacy. (Please note that the long- term care pharmacy may provide the drug in smaller amounts at a time to prevent waste.) For those members who have been in the plan for more than 90 days and reside in a long- term care facility and need a supply right away: We will cover one 31- day emergency supply of a particular drug, or less if your prescription is written for fewer days. This is in addition to the above temporary supply. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 109 Chapter 5 Using the plan's coverage for Part D prescription drugs For level of care changes, early refill restrictions will not be used to limit access to a Member's Part D benefit. Members changing from one treatment setting to another (e.g. hospital to LTC facility, or hospital to home), admitted or discharged from a long- term care facil ity or experiencing similar level of care changes may obtain a refill upon admission or discharge. For questions about a temporary supply, call Pharmacy Member Services . During the time when you are using a temporary supply of a drug, you should talk with your provider to decide what to do when your temporary supply runs out. You have two options: 1) You can change to another drug Talk with your provider about whether there is a different drug covered by the plan that may work just as well for you. You ca n call Pharmacy Member Services to ask for a list of covered drugs that treat the same medical condition. This list can help your provider find a covered drug that might work for you. 2) You can ask for an exception You and your provider can ask the plan to make an exception and cover the drug in the way you would like it covered. If your provider says that you have medical reasons that justify asking us for an exception, your provider can help you request an exception. For example, you can ask the plan to cover a drug even though it is not on the plan's Drug List. Or you can ask the plan to make an exception and cover the drug without restrictions. If you and your provider want to ask for an exception, Chapter 9, Section 6.4 tells you what to do. It e xplains the procedures and deadlines that have been set by Medicare to make sure your request is handled promptly and fairly. Section 5.3 What can you do if your drug is in a cost -sharing tier you think is too high? If your drug is in a cost-sharing tier you think is too high, here are things you can do: You can change to another drug If your drug is in a cost -sharing tier you think is too high, talk to your provider. There may be a different drug in a lower cost -sharing tier that might work just as well f or you. Call Pharmacy Member Services to ask for a list of covered drugs that treat the same medical condition. This list can help your provider find a covered drug that might work for you. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 110 Chapter 5 Using the plan's coverage for Part D prescription drugs You can ask for an exception You and your provider can ask the plan to make an exception in the cost -sharing tier for the drug so that you pay less for it. If your provider says that you have medical reasons that justify asking us for an exception, your provider can help you request an exception to the rule. If you and your provider want to ask for an exception, Chapter 9, Section 6.4 tells what to do . It explains the procedures and deadlines that have been set by Medicare to make sure your request is handled promptly and fair ly. Drugs in our Tier 5 (Specialty Tier) are not eligible for this type of exception. We do not lower the cost -sharing amount for drugs in this tier . SECTION 6 What if your coverage changes for one of your drugs? Section 6.1 The Drug List can change during the year Most of the changes in drug coverage happen at the beginning of each year (January 1). However, during the year, the plan can make some changes to the Drug List. For example, the plan might: Add or remove drugs from the Drug List . Move a drug to a higher or lower cost -sharing tier. Add or remove a restriction on coverage for a drug . Replace a brand name drug with a generic drug. We must follow Medicare requirements before we change the plan's Drug List. Section 6.2 What happens if coverage chang es for a drug you are taking? Information on changes to drug coverage When changes to the Drug List occur, we post information on our website about those changes. We also update our online Drug List on a regularly scheduled basis . Below we point out the times that you would get direct notice if changes were made to a drug that you are taking. Changes to your drug coverage that affect you during the current plan year A new generic drug replaces a brand name drug on the Drug List (or we change the cost-sharing tier or add new restrictions to the brand name drug or both ) 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 111 Chapter 5 Using the plan's coverage for Part D prescription drugs o We may immediately remove a brand name drug on our Drug List if we are replacing it with a new ly approved generic version of the same drug. The generic drug will appear on the same or lower cost -sharing tier and with the same or fewer restrictions. We may decide to keep the brand name drug on our Drug List, but immediately move it to a higher cost- sharing tier or add new restrictions or both when the new generic is added. o We may not tell you in advance before we make that change\u2014 even if you are currently taking the brand name drug. If you are taking the brand name drug at the time we make the change, we will provide you with information about the specific change(s). This will also in clude information on the steps you may take to request an exception to cover the brand name drug. You may not get this notice before we make the change. o You or your prescriber can ask us to make an exception and continue to cover the brand name drug for you. For information on how to ask for an exception, see Chapter 9. Unsafe drugs and other drugs on the Drug List that are withdrawn from the market o Sometimes a drug may be deemed unsafe or taken off the market for another reason. If this happens, we may immediately remove the drug from the Drug List. If you are taking that drug, we will tell you right away. o Your prescriber will also know about this change and can work with you to find another drug for your condition. Other changes to drugs on the Drug List o We may make other changes once the year has started that affect drugs you are taking. For example, we might add a generic drug that is not new to the market to replace a brand name d rug on the Drug List or change the cost -sharing tier or add new restrictions to the brand name drug or both. We also might make changes based on FDA boxed warnings or new clinical guidelines recognized by Medicare. o For these changes, we must give you at l east 30 days' advance notice of the change or give you notice of the change and a 30- day refill of the drug you are taking at a network pharmacy. o After you receive notice of the change, you should work with your prescriber to switch to a different drug that we cover or to satisfy any new restrictions on the drug you are taking. o You or your prescriber can ask us to make an exception and continue to cover the drug for you. For information on how to ask for an exception, see Chapter 9. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 112 Chapter 5 Using the plan's coverage for Part D prescription drugs Changes to the Drug List that do not affect you during this plan year We may make certain changes to the Drug List that are not described above. In these cases, the change will not apply to you if you are taking the drug when the change is made; however, these changes will likely affect you starting January 1 of the next plan year if you stay in the same plan. In general, changes that will not aff ect you during the current plan year are: We move your drug into a higher cost -sharing tier. We put a new restriction on the use of your drug. We remove your drug from the Drug List. If any of these changes happen for a drug you are taking (except for market withdrawal, a generic drug replacing a brand name drug, or other change noted in the sections above), then the change won't affect your use or what you pay as your share of the cos t until January 1 of the next year. Until that date, you probably won't see any increase in your payments or any added restrictions to your use of the drug. We will not tell you about these types of changes directly during the current plan year. You will need to check the Drug List for the next plan year (when the list is available during the open enrollment period) to see if there are any changes to the drugs you are taking that will impact you during the next plan year. SECTION 7 What types of drugs are not covered by the plan? Section 7.1 Types of drugs we do not cover This section tells you what kinds of prescription drugs are \"excluded.\" This means Medicare does not pay for these drugs. If you get drugs that are excluded, you must pay for them yoursel f. If you appeal and the requested drug is found not to be excluded under Part D, we will pa y for or cover it. (For information about appealing a decision, go to Chapter 9.) Here are three general rules about drugs that Medicare drug plans will not cover under Part D: Our plan's Part D drug coverage cannot cover a drug that would be covered under Medicare Part A or Part B. Our plan cannot cover a drug purchased outside the United States or its territories. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 113 Chapter 5 Using the plan's coverage for Part D prescription drugs Our plan usually cannot cover off -label use. \"Off -label use\" is any use of the drug other than those indicated on a drug's label as approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Coverage for \"off -label use\" is allowed only when the use is supported by certain reference s, such as the American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information and the DRUGDEX Information System . In addition, by law, the following categories of drugs are not covered by Medicare drug plans: Non-prescription drugs (also called over -the-counter drugs) Drugs used to promote fertility Drugs used for the relief of cough or cold symptoms Drugs used for cosmetic purposes or to promote hair growth Prescription vitamins and mineral products, except prenatal vitamins and fluoride preparations Drugs used for the treatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction Drugs used for treatment of anorexia, weight loss, or weight gain Outpatient drugs for which the manufacturer seeks to require that associated tests or monitoring services be purchased exclusively from the manufa cturer as a condition of sale In addition, if you are receiving \"Extra Help\" to pay for your prescriptions, the \"Extra Help\" program will not pay for the drugs not normally covered. However, if you have drug coverage through Medicaid, your state Medicaid p rogram may cover some prescription drugs not normally covered in a Medicare drug plan. Please contact your state Medicaid program to determine what drug coverage may be available to you. (You can find phone numbers and contact information for Medicaid in C hapter 2, Section 6.) SECTION 8 Filling a prescription Section 8.1 Provide your membership information To fill your prescription, provide your plan membership information, which can be found on your membership card, at the network pharmacy you choose. The network pharmacy will automatically bill the plan for our share of your drug cost. You will need to pay the pharmacy your share of the cost when you pick up your prescription. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 114 Chapter 5 Using the plan's coverage for Part D prescription drugs Section 8.2 What if you don't have your membership information with you? If you don't have your plan membership information with you when you fill your prescription, you or the pharmacy can call the plan to get the necessary information. If the pharmacy is not able to get the necessary information, you may have to pay the full cost of the prescription when you pick it up. (You can then ask us to reimburse you for our share. See Chapter 7, Section 2 for information about how to ask the plan for reimbursement.) SECTION 9 Part D drug coverage in special situations Section 9.1 What if you' re in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility for a stay that is covered by the plan? If you are admitted to a hospital or to a skilled nursing facility for a stay covered by the plan, we will generally cover the cost of your prescription drugs during your stay. Once you leave the hospital or skilled nursing facility, the plan will cover your prescription drugs as long as the drugs meet all of our rules for coverage described in this Cha pter. Section 9.2 What if you're a resident in a long- term care (LTC) facility? Usually, a long- term care (LTC) facility (such as a nursing home) has its own pharmacy or uses a pharmacy that supplies drugs for all of its residents. If you are a resident of a LTC facility, you may get your prescription drugs through the facility's pharmacy or the one it uses, as long as it is part of our network. Check your Provider Directory to find out if your LTC facility's pharmacy or the one that it uses is part of our network. If it isn't, or if you need more information or assistance, please contact Pharmacy Member Services . If you are in an LTC facility, we must ensure that you are able to routinely receive your Part D benefits through our network of LTC pharmacies. What if you're a resident in a long- term care (LTC) facility and need a drug that is not on our Drug List or is restricted in some way? Please refer to Section 5.2 about a temporary or emergency supply. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 115 Chapter 5 Using the plan's coverage for Part D prescription drugs Section 9.3 What if you're also getting drug coverage from an employer or retiree group plan? If you currently have other prescription drug coverage through your (or your spouse's) employe r or retiree group , please contact that group's benefits administrator. He or she can help you determine how your current prescription drug coverage will work with our plan. In general, if you have employee or retiree group coverage, the drug coverage you get from us will be secondary to your group coverage. That means your group coverage would pay first. Special note about 'creditable coverage': Each year your employer or retiree group should send you a notice that tells if your prescription drug coverage for the next calendar year is \"creditable.\" If the coverage from the group plan is \" creditable,\" it means that the plan has drug coverage that is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare's standard prescription drug coverage. Keep th is notice about creditable coverage, because you may need it later. If you enroll in a Medicare plan that includes Part D drug coverage, you may need this notice to show that you have maintained creditable coverage. If you didn't get the creditable coverag e notice, request a copy from your employer or retiree plan's benefits administrator or the employer or union. Section 9.4 What if you're in Medicare- certified hospice? Hospice and our plan do not cover the same drug at the same time. If you are enrolled in Medicare hospice and require certain drugs (e.g., anti -nausea, laxative, pain medication or antianxiety drugs) that are not covered by your hospice because it is unrelated to your terminal illness and related conditions, our plan must receive notificati on from either the prescriber or your hospice provider that the drug is unrelated before our plan can cover the drug. To prevent delays in receiving these drugs that should be covered by our plan, ask your hospice provider or prescriber to provide notifica tion before your prescription is filled. In the event you either revoke your hospice election or are discharged from hospice, our plan should cover your drugs as explained in this document. To prevent any delays at a pharmacy when your Medicare hospice be nefit ends, bring documentation to the pharmacy to verify your revocation or discharge. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 116 Chapter 5 Using the plan's coverage for Part D prescription drugs SECTION 1 0 Programs on drug safety and managing medications Section 1 0.1 Programs to help members use drugs safely We conduct drug use reviews for our members to help make sure that they are getting safe and appropriate care. We do a review each time you fill a prescription. We also review our records on a regular basis. During these reviews, we look for potential problems such as: Possible medication errors Drugs tha t may not be necessary because you are taking another drug to treat the same condition Drugs that may not be safe or appropriate because of your age or gender Certain combinations of drugs that could harm you if taken at the same time Prescriptions for dru gs that have ingredients you are allergic to Possible errors in the amount (dosage) of a drug you are taking Unsafe amounts of opioid pain medications If we see a possible problem in your use of medications, we will work with your provider to correct the problem. Section 10.2 Drug Management Program (DMP) to help members safely use their opioid medications We have a program that helps make sure members safely use prescription opioids and other frequently abused medications. This program is call ed a Drug Management Program (DMP). If you use opioid medications that you get from several doctors or pharmacies, or if you had a recent opioid overdose, we may talk to your doctors to make sure your use of opioid medications is appropriate and medically necessary. Working with your doctors, if we decide your use of prescription opioid or benzodiazepine medications is not safe, we may limit how you can get those medications. If we place you in our DMP, the limitations may be: Requiring you to get all your prescriptions for opioid or benzodiazepine medications from a certain pharmacy (ies) Requiring you to get all your prescriptions for opioid or benzodiazepine medications from a certain doctor (s) Limiting the amount of opioid or benzodiazepine medications we will cover for you 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 117 Chapter 5 Using the plan's coverage for Part D prescription drugs If we plan on limiting how you may get these medications or how much you can get, we will send you a letter in advance. The letter will explain the limitations we think should apply to you. You will have an opportunity to tell us which doctors or pharmacies you prefer to use, and about any other information you think is important for us to know . After you've had the opportunity to respond, if we decide to limit your coverage for these medications, we will send you another letter confirming the limitation. If you think we made a mistake or you disagree with our determination or with the limitation, you and your prescriber have the right to appeal. If you appeal, we will review your case and give you a decision. If we continue to deny any part of your request related to the limitations that apply to your access to medications, we will automatically send your case to an independent reviewer outside of our plan. See Chapter 9 for information about how to ask for an appeal. You will not be placed in our DMP if you have certain medical conditions, such as active cancer - related pain or sickle cell disease, you are receiving hospice, palliative, or end- of-life care, or live in a long- term care facility. Section 1 0.3 Medication Ther apy Management (MTM) program to help members manage their medications We have a program that can help our members with complex health needs . Our program is called a Medication Therapy Management (MTM) program. This program is voluntary and free. A team of pharmacists and doctors developed the program for us to help make sure that our members get the most benefit from the drugs they take. Some members who take medications for different medical conditions and have high drug costs or are in a DMP to help memb ers use their opioids safely, may be able to get services through an MTM program. A pharmacist or other health professional will give you a comprehensive review of all your medications. During the review, you can talk about your medications, your costs, and any problems or questions you have about your prescription and over -the-counter medications. You'll get a written summary which has a recommended to- do list that includes steps you should take to get the best results from your medications. You'll also ge t a medication list that will include all the medications you're taking, how much you take, and when and why you take them. In addition, members in the MTM program will receive information on the safe disposal of prescription medications that are controlled substances. It's a good idea to talk to your doctor about your recommended to- do list and medicat ion list. Bring the summary with you to your visit or anytime you talk with your doctors, pharmacists, and other health care providers. Also, keep your medication list up to date and with you (for example, with your ID) in case you go to the hospital or em ergency room. If we have a program that fits your needs, we will automatically enroll you in the program and send you information. If you decide not to participate, please notify us and we will withdraw you. If you have any questions about this program , please contact Pharmacy Member Services . CHAPTER 6 What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 119 Chapter 6 What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs Are you currently getting help to pay for your drugs? If you are in a program that helps pay for your drugs, some information in this Evidence of Coverage about the costs for Part D prescription drugs may not apply to you. We sen t you a separate insert, called the \"Evidence of Coverage Rider for People Who Get Extra Help Paying for Prescription Drugs\" (also known as the \"Low Income Subsidy Rider\" or the \"LI S Rider\"), which tells you about your drug coverage. If you don't have this insert, please call Pharmacy Member Services and ask for the \"LIS Rider.\" SECTION 1 Introduction Section 1.1 Use this chapter together with other materials that explain your drug coverage This chapter focuses on what you pay for Part D prescription drugs. To keep things simple, we use \"drug\" in this chapter to mean a Part D prescription drug. As explained in Chapter 5, not all drugs are Part D drugs - some drugs are covered under Medicare Part A or Part B and other drugs are excluded from Medicare coverage by law . To understand the payment information, you need to know what drugs are covered, where to fill your prescriptions, and what rules to follow when you get your covered drugs . Chapter 5, Sections 1 through 4 explain these rules . Section 1.2 Types of out -of-pocket costs you may pay for covered drugs There are different types of out -of-pocket costs for Part D drugs . The amount that you pay for a drug is called \"cost sharing\" and there are three ways you may be asked to pay. The \"deductible\" is the amount you pay for drugs before our plan begins to pay its share. \"Copayment\" is a fixed amount you pay each time you fill a prescription. \"Coinsurance\" is a percent age of the total cost you pay each time you fill a prescription. Section 1.3 How Medicare calculates your out -of-pocket costs Medicare has rules about what counts and what does not count toward your out -of-pocket costs. Here are the rules we must follow to keep track of your out -of-pocket costs. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 120 Chapter 6 What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs These payments are included in your out -of-pocket costs Your out -of-pocket costs include the payments listed below (as long as they are for Part D covered drugs and you followed the rules for drug coverage that are explained in Chapter 5): The amount you pay for drugs when you are in any of the following drug payment stages: o The Initial Cover age Stage o The Coverage Gap Stage Any payments you made during this calendar year as a member of a different Medicare prescription drug plan before you joined our plan. It matters who pays: If you make these payments yourself , they are included in your out -of-pocket costs. These payments are also included if they are made on your behalf by certain other individuals or organizations. This includes payments for your drugs made by a friend or relative, by most charities, by AIDS drug assistance programs, by a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program that is qualified by Medicare, or by the Indian Health Service. Payments made by Medicare's \"Extra Help\" Program are also included. Some payments made by the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program are included. The amount the manufacturer pays for your brand name drugs is included. But the amount the plan pays for your generic drugs is not included. Moving on to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage: When you (or those paying on your behalf) have spent a tota l of $ 7,400 in out -of-pocket costs within the calendar year, you will move from the Coverage Gap Stage to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage. These payments are not included in your out -of-pocket costs Your out -of-pocket costs do not include any of these types of payments : Your monthly premium. Drugs you buy outside the United States and its territories. Drugs that are not covered by our plan.

SECTION 3 We send you reports that explain payments for your drugs and which payment stage you are in Section 3.1 We send you a monthly summary called the Part D Explanation of Benefits (the \" Part D EOB\") Our plan keeps track of the costs of your prescription drugs and the payments you have made when you get your prescriptions filled or refilled at the pharmacy. This way, we can tell you when you have moved from one drug payment stage to the next. In particular, there are two types of costs we keep track of: We keep track of how much you have paid. This is called your \" out-of-pocket \" cost. We keep track of your \" total drug costs .\" This is the amount you pay out -of-pocket or others pay on your behalf plus the amount paid by the plan. If you have had one or more prescriptions filled through the plan during the previous month, we will send you a Part D Explanation of Benefits (\" Part D EOB\") . The Part D EOB includes: Information for that month . This report gives the payment details about the prescriptions you have filled during the previous month. It shows the total drug costs, what the plan paid, and what you and others on your behalf paid. Totals for the year since January 1. This is called \"year -to-date\" information.

There are times you may pay for the entire cost of a prescription drug. In these cases, we will not automatically get the informa tion we need to keep track of your out -of-pocket costs. To help us keep track of your out -of-pocket costs, give us copies of these receipts. Here are examples of when you should give us copies of your drug receipts: o When you purchase a covered drug at a network pharmacy at a special price or using a discount card that is not part of our plan's benefit. o When you made a copayment for drugs that are provided under a drug manufacturer patient assistance program. o Any time you have purchased covered drugs at out -of-network pharmacies or other times you have paid the full price for a covered drug under special circumstances. o If you are billed for a covered drug, you can ask our plan to pay our share of the cost. For instructions on how to do this, go to Chapter 7, Section 2. Send us information about the payments others have made for you. Payments made by certain other individuals and organizations also count toward your out -of-pocket costs.

SECTION 4 There is no deductible f or Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) There is no deductible for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) . You begin in the Initial Coverage Stage when you fill your first prescription of the year. See Section 5 for information about your coverage in the Initial Coverage Stage. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 124 Chapter 6 What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs SECTION 5 During the Initial Coverage Stage, the plan pays its share of your drug costs and you pay your share Section 5.1 What you pay for a drug depends on the drug and where you fill your prescription During the Initial Coverage Stage, the plan pays its share of the cost of your covered prescription drugs, and you pay your share (your copayment or coinsurance amount ). Your share of the cost will vary depending on the drug and where you fill your prescription. The plan has six cost-sharing tiers Every drug on the plan's Drug List is in one of six cost-sharing tiers. In general, the higher the cost-sharing tier number, the higher your cost for the drug: Cost Sharing Tier 1 includes Preferred Generic drugs. This is the lowest cost sharing tier. Cost Sharing Tier 2 includes Generic drugs. Cost Sharing Tier 3 includes Preferred Brand drugs and some select insulins . Cost Sharing Tier 4 includes Non- Preferred Brand drugs , some generic drugs and some select insulins . Cost Sharing Tier 5 includes Specialty Tier drugs and has 33% coinsurance. Generally, this is the highest cost sharing tier. Cost Sharing Tier 6 includes Specific Vaccines. Vaccines in this tier are available with no cost sharing. To find out which cost -sharing tier your drug is in, look it up in the plan's Drug List. Your pharmacy choices How much you pay for a drug depends on whether you get the drug from: A network retail pharmacy . A pharmacy that is not in the plan's network. We cover prescriptions filled at out -of- network pharmacies in only limited situations. Please see Chapter 5, Secti on 2.5 to find out when we will cover a prescription filled at an out -of-network pharmacy. The plan's mail -order pharmacy For more information about these pharmacy choices and filling your prescriptions, see Chapter 5 and the plan's Provider Directory. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 125 Chapter 6 What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs Section 5.2 A table that shows your costs for a one -month supply of a drug During the Initial Coverage Stage, your share of the cost of a covered drug will be either a copayment or coinsurance. As shown in the table below, the amount of the copayment or coins urance depends on which cost-sharing tier . Sometimes the cost of the drug is lower than your copayment. In these cases, you pay the lower price for the drug instead of the copayment. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 126 Chapter 6 What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs Your share of the cost when you get a one -month supply of a covered Part D prescription drug in the Initial Coverage Stage: Tier Standard retail cost sharing (in-network) (up to a 30- day supply) Mail -order cost sharing (up to a 30- day supply) Long- term care (LTC) cost sharing (up to a 31- day supply) Out-of-network cost sharing (Coverage is limited to certain situations; see Chapter 5 for details.) (up to a 30- day supply) Cost -Sharing Tier 1 $100.00 copay* ($35.00 copay* for select insulins) Cost Sharing Tier 5 (Specialty Tier) 33% coinsurance A mail order supply is not available for drugs in Tier 5 33% coinsurance 33% coinsurance* Cost Sharing Tier 6 (Vaccines Tier) $0.00 copay (specific) A mail order supply is not available for drugs in Tier 6 $0.00 copay (specific) $0.00 copay (specific) *You may be required to pay the difference between what you pay for the drug at the out -of- network phar macy and the cost that we would cover at an in -network pharmacy. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 127 Chapter 6 What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs Section 5.3 If your doctor prescribes less than a full month's supply, you may not have to pay the cost of the entire month's supply Typically, the amount you pay for a prescription drug covers a full month's supply. There may be times when you or your doctor would like you to have less than a month's supply of a drug (for example, when you are trying a medication for the first time). You can also ask your doctor to prescribe, and your pharmacist to dispense, less than a full month's supply of your drugs, if this will help you better plan refill dates for different prescriptions. If you receive less than a full month's supply of certain drugs , you will not have to pay for the full month's supply. If you are responsible for coinsurance, you pay a percentage of the total cost of the drug. Since the coinsurance is based on the total cost of the drug, your cost will be lower since the total cost for the drug will be lower. If you are responsible for a copayment for the drug, you will only pay for the number of days of the drug that you receive instead of a whole month. We will calculate the amount you pay per day for your drug (the \"daily cost -sharing rate\") and multiply it by the number of days of the drug you receive. Section 5. 4 A table that shows your costs for a long- term (up to a 100-day) supply of a drug For some drugs, you can get a long- term supply (also called an \"extended supply\"). A long- term supply is up to a 100- day supply. The table below shows what you pay when you get a long- term supply of a drug. Sometimes the cost of the drug is lower than you r copayment. In these cases, you pay the lower price for the drug instead of the copayment. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 128 Chapter 6 What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs Your share of the cost when you get a long -term supply of a covered Part D prescription drug in the Initial Coverage Stage: Tier Standard retail cost sharing (in -network) (up to a 100- day supply) Mail -order cost sharing (up to a 100- day supply) Cost -Sharing Tier 1 (Preferred Generic) $7.50 ($52.50 copay for select insulins) Cost Sharing Tier 5 (Specialty Tier) A long- term supply is not available for drugs in Tier 5 A long- term supply is not available for drugs in Tier 5 Cost Sharing Tier 6 (Vaccines Tier) A long- term supply is not available for drugs in Tier 6 A long- term supply is not available for drugs in Tier 6 Section 5.5 You stay in the Initial Coverage Stage until your total drug costs for the year reach $4,660 You stay in the Initial Coverage Stage until the total amount for the prescription drugs you have filled reaches the $4,660 limit for the Initial Coverage Stage . The Part D EOB that you receive will help you keep track of how much you, the plan , and any third parties have spent on your behalf during the year. Many people do not reach the $4,660 limit in a year. We will let you know if you reach this amount. If you do reach this amount, you will leave the Initial Coverage Stage and move on to the Coverage Gap Stage. See Section 1.3 on how Medicare calculates your out -of-pocket costs. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 129 Chapter 6 What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs SECTION 6 Costs in the Coverage Gap Stage Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) offers additional gap coverage. When you are in the Coverage Gap Stage, preferred generic drugs (Tier 1) are covered the same way as they are in the Initial Coverage Stage. For a one -month supply, you pay a $3 copayment at retail. For a 3- month supply, you pay a $0 copayment through mail order. You also pay a $0 copayment for specific Tier 6 vaccines. During the Coverage Gap stage, your out -of-pocket costs for select insulins will be $35 for a one-month supply. To find out which drugs are select insulins, review the most recent Drug List we sent you in the mail. You can identify Select Insulins by looking for the \"SI\" abbreviation in the Requirem ents/Limits column within the Drug List. If you have questions about the Drug List, you can also call Pharmacy Member Services. When you are in the Coverage Gap Stage, the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program provides manufacturer discounts on brand name drugs. You pay 25% of the negotiated price and a portion of the dispensing fee for brand name drugs. Both the amount you pay and the amount discounted by the manufacturer count toward your out -of-pocket costs as if you had paid them and moves you through the coverage gap. You also receive some coverage for generic drugs. You pay no more than 25% of the cost for generic drugs and the plan pays the rest. Only the amount you pay counts and moves you through the coverage gap. You continue paying the se costs until your yearly out -of-pocket payments reach a maximum amount that Medicare has set. Once you reach this amount $7,400, you leave the Coverage Gap Stage and move to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage . Medicare has rules about what counts and what does not count toward your out -of-pocket costs (Section 1.3) . SECTION 7 During the Catastrophic Coverage Stage, the plan pays most of the cost for your drugs You enter the Catastrophic Coverage Stage when your out -of-pocket costs have reached the $7,400 limit for the calendar year. Once you are in the Catastrophic Coverage Stage, you will stay in this payment stage until the end of the calendar year. During this stage, the plan will pay most of the cost for your drugs. You will pay: Your share of the cos t for a covered drug will be either coinsurance or a copayment, whichever is the larger amount: o - either - coinsurance of 5% of the cost of the drug 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 130 Chapter 6 What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs o - or - $4.15 for a generic drug or a drug that is treated like a generic and $ 10.35 for all other drugs. SECTION 8 Part D Vaccines. What you pay for depends on how and where you get them Important Message About What You Pay for Vaccines - Our plan covers most Part D vaccines at no cost to you. Call Pharmacy Member Services for more information. There are two parts to our coverage of Part D vaccinations: The first part of coverage is the cost of the vaccine itself . The second part of coverage is for the cost of giving you the vaccin e. (This is sometimes called the \"administration\" of the vaccine. ) Your costs for a Part D vaccination depend on three things: 1. The type of vaccine (what you are being vaccinated for). Some vaccines are considered medical benefits. (See the Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) in Chapter 4). Other vaccines are considered Part D drugs. You can find these vaccines listed in the plan's List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) . 2. Where you get the vaccine. The vaccine itself may be dispensed by a pharmacy or provided by the doctor's office. 3. Who gives you the vaccin e. A pharmacist may give the vaccine in the pharmacy or another provider may give it in the doctor's office. What you pay at the time you get the Part D vaccination c an vary depending on the circumstances and what Drug Stage you are in. Sometimes when you get a vaccination, you have to pay for the entire cost for both the vaccine itself and the cost for the provider to give you the vaccine. You can ask our plan to pay you back for our share of the cost. Other times, when you get a vaccination, you will pay only your share of the cost under your Part D benefit. Below are three examples of ways you might get a Part D vaccin e. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 131 Chapter 6 What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs Situation 1: You get your vaccination at the network pharmacy. (Whether you have this choice depends on where you live. Some states do not allow pharmacies to give vaccines.) You will pay the pharmacy your coinsurance or copayment for the vaccine itself which includes the cost of giving you the vaccine. Our plan will pay the remainder of the costs . Situation 2: You get the Part D vaccination at your doctor's office. When you get the vaccine, you will pay for the entire cost of the vaccine itself and the cost for the provider to give it to you. You can then ask our plan to pay our share of the cost by using the procedures that are described in Chapter 7. You will be reimbursed the amount you paid less your normal coins urance or copayment for the vaccine (including administration) less any difference between the amount the doctor charges and what we normally pay. (If you get \"Extra Help, \" we will reimburse you for this difference.) Situation 3: You buy the Part D vaccine itself at your pharmacy, and then take it to your doctor's office where they give you the vaccine . You will have to pay the pharmacy your coinsurance or copayment for the vaccine itself. When your doctor gives you the vaccin e, you will pay the entire cost for this service. You can then ask our plan to pay our share of the cost by using the procedures described in Chapter 7. You will be reimbursed the amount charged by the doctor for administering the vaccine less any difference between the amount the doctor charges and what we normally pay. (If you get \"Extra Help, \" we will reimburse you for this difference.) Note: Geisinger Gold members do not have cost sharing on most Part D vaccines during the Initial Coverage and Coverage G ap benefit Stages. CHAPTER 7 : Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services or drugs 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 133 Chapter 7 Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services or drugs SECTION 1 Situations in which you should ask us to pay our share of the cost of your covered services or drugs Sometimes when you get medical care or a prescription drug, you may nee d to pay the full cost. Other times, you may find that you have paid more than you expected under the coverage rules of the plan. In these cases , you can ask our plan to pay you back (paying you back is often called \"reimbursing\" you). It is your right to be paid back by our plan whenever you've paid more than your share of the cost for medical services or drugs that are covered by our plan. There may be deadlines that you must meet to get paid back. Please see Section 2 of this chapter . There may also be t imes when you get a bill from a provider for the full cost of medical care you have received or possibly for more than your share of cost sharing as discussed in this document . First try to resolve the bill with the provider. If that does not work, send th e bill to us instead of paying it. We will look at the bill and decide whether the services should be covered. If we decide they should be covered, we will pay the provider directly. If we decide not to pay it, we will notify the provider. You should never pay more than plan- allowed cost sharing. If this provider is contracted, you still have the right to treatment. Here are examples of situations in which you may need to ask our plan to pay you back or to pay a bill you have received: 1. When you've received emergency or urgently needed medical care from a provider who is not in our plan's network You can receive emergency or urgently needed services from any provider, whether or not the provider is a part of our network. In these cases, You are only responsible for paying your share of the cost for emergency or urgently needed services. Emergency providers are legally required to provide eme rgency care. If you accidentally pay the entire amount yourself at the time you receive the care, ask us to pay you back for our share of the cost. Send us the bill, along with documentation of any payments you have made. You may get a bill from the provider asking for payment that you think you do not owe. Send us this bill, along with documentation of any payments you have already made. o If the provider is owed anything, we will pay the provider directly. o If you have already paid more than your share of the cost of the service, we will determine how much you owed and pay you back for our share of the cost. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 134 Chapter 7 Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services or drugs 2. When a network provider sends you a bill you think you should not pay Network providers should always bill the plan directly and ask you only for your share of the cost. But sometimes they make mistakes and ask you to pay more than your share. You only have to pay your cost -sharing amount when you get covered services. We do not allow providers to add additional separate charges, called \"balance bill ing.\" This protection (that you never pay more than your cost -sharing amount) applies even if we pay the provider less than the provider charges for a service and even if there is a dispute and we don't pay certain provider charges. Whenever you get a bil l from a network provider that you think is more than you should pay, send us the bill. We will contact the provider directly and resolve the billing problem. If you have already paid a bill to a network provider, but you feel that you paid too much, send us the bill along with documentation of any payment you have made and ask us to pay you back the difference between the amount you paid and the amount you owed under the plan. 3. If you are ret roactively enrolled in our plan Sometimes a person's enrollment in the plan is retroactive. ( This means that the first day of their enrollment has already passed . The enrollment date may even have occurred last year.) If you were retroactively enrolled in our plan and you paid out -of-pocket for any of your covered services or drugs after your enrollment date, you can ask us to pay you back for our share of the costs. You will need to submit paperwork such as receipts and bills for us to handle the reimbursement. 4. When you use an out -of-network pharmacy to get a prescription filled If you go to an out -of-network pharmacy, the pharmacy may not be able to submit the claim directly to us. When that happens, you will have to pay the full cost of your prescription. Save your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back for our share of the cost. Remember that we only cover out of network pharmacies in limited circumstances. See Chapter 5, Section 2.5 for a discussion of these circumstances. 5. When you pay the full cost for a prescription because you don't have your plan membership card with you If you do not have your plan membership card with you, you can ask the pharmacy to call the plan or to look up your plan enrollment information. However, if the pharmacy cannot get the enrollment informati on they need right away, you may need to pay the full cost of the prescription yourself. Save your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back for our share of the cost. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Classic Complete Rx (HMO) 135 Chapter 7 Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services or drugs 6. When you pay the full cost for a prescription in other situations You may pay the full cost of the prescription because you find that the drug is not covered for some reason. For example, the drug may not be on the plan's List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) ; or it could have a requirement or restriction that you didn't know about or don't think should apply to you. If you decide to get the drug immediately, you may need to pay the full cost for it. Save your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back. In some situations, we may need to get more information from your doctor in order to pay you back for our share of the cost. All of the examples above are types of coverage decisions. This means that if we deny your request for payment, you can appeal our decision. Chapter 9 of this document has inf ormation about how to make an appeal. SECTION 2 How to ask us to pay you back or to pay a bill you have received You may request us to pay you back by either calling us or sending us a request in writing. If you send a request in writing, send your bill and documentation of any payment you have made. It's a good idea to make a copy of your bill and receipts for your records. You must submit your claim to us within three (3) years of the date you received the service, item, or drug. To make sure you are giving us all the information we need to make a decision, you can fill out our claim form to make your request for payment. You don't have to use the form, but it will help us process the information faster. You must include an itemized bill of services, the provider's information, name address, and proof of payment.

Otherwise, we will consider your request and make a coverage decision. If we decide that the medical care or drug is covered and you followed all the rules, we will pay for our share of the cost. If you have already paid for the service or drug, we will mail your reimbursement of our share of the cost to you. If you have not paid for the service or drug yet, we will mail the payment directly to the provider. If we decide that the medical care or drug is not covered, or you did not follow all the rules, we will not pay for our share of the cost. W e will send you a letter expla ining the reasons why we are not sending the payment and your rights to appeal that decision. Section 3.2 If we tell you that we will not pay for all or part of the medical care or drug, you can make an appeal If you think we have made a mistake in turning down your request for payment or the amount we are paying, you can make an appeal. If you make an appeal, it means you are asking us to change the decision we made when we turned down your request for payment. The appeals process is a formal process with detailed procedures and important deadlines. For the details on how to make this appeal, go to Chapter 9 of this document .

CHAPTER 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Cl assic Complete Rx (HMO) 146 Chapter 9 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) SECTION 1 Introduction Section 1.1 What to do if you have a problem or concern This chapter explains two types of processes for handling problems and concerns: For some problems, you need to use the process for coverage decisions and appeals . For other problems , you need to use the process for making complaints ; also called grievances . Both of these processes have been approved by Medicare. E ach process has a set of rules, procedures, and deadlines that must be followed by us and by you. The guide in Sec tion 3 will help you identify the right process to use and what you should do. Section 1.2 What about the legal terms? There are legal terms for some of the rules, procedures, and types of deadlines explained in this chapter. Many of these terms are unfam iliar to most people and can be hard to understand. To make things easier, this chapter : Uses simpler words in place of certain legal terms. For example, this chapter generally says \"making a complaint\" rather than \"filing a grievance,\" \"coverage decision \" rather than \"organization determination,\" or \"coverage determination \" or \"at -risk determination,\" and \" independent r eview organization\" instead of \"Independent Review Entity.\" It also uses abbreviations as little as possible. However, it can be helpful - and sometimes quite important - for you to know the correct legal terms. Knowing which terms to use will help you communicate more accurately to get the right help or informati on for your situation. To help you know which terms to use, we include legal terms when we give the details for handling specific types of situations. SECTION 2 Where to get more information and personalized assistance We are always available to help you. Even if you have a complaint about our treatment of you, we are obligated to honor your right to complain. Therefore, you should always reach out to 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Cl assic Complete Rx (HMO) 147 Chapter 9 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) customer service for help. But in some situations , you may also want help or guidance from someone who is not connected with us. Below are two entities that can assist you. State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) Each state has a government program with trained counselors. The program is not connected with us or with any insurance company or health plan. The counselors at this program can help you understand which process you should use to handle a problem you are having. They can also answer your questions, give you more information, and offer guidance on what to do. The services of SHIP counselors are free. You will find phone numbers and website URLs in Chapter 2, Section 3 of this document . Medicare You can also contact Medicare to get help . To contact Medicare: You can call 1 -800-MEDICARE (1 -800-633-4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users should call 1- 877-486-2048. You can also visit the Medicare website (www.medicare.gov ). SECTION 3 To deal with your problem, which process should you use? If you have a problem or concern, you only need to read the parts of this chapter that apply to your situation. The guide that follows will help. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Cl assic Complete Rx (HMO) 148 Chapter 9 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) Is your problem or concern about your benefits or coverage? This inclu des problems about whether medical care or prescription drugs are covered or not, the way they are covered, and problems related to payment for medical care or prescription drugs. Yes. Go on to the next section of this chapter, Section 4, \"A guide to the basics of coverage decisions and appeals.\" No. Skip ahead to Section 10 at the end of this chapter: \"How to make a complaint about quality of care, waiting times, customer service or other concerns.\" COVERAGE DECISIONS AND APPEALS SECTION 4 A guide to t he basics of coverage decisions and appeals Section 4.1 Asking for coverage decisions and making appeals: the big picture Coverage decisions and appeals deal with problems related to your benefits and coverage for medical services and prescription drugs, including payment. This is the process you use for issues such as whether something is covered or not and the way in which something is covered. Asking for coverage decisions prior to receiving services A coverage decision is a decision we make about your benefits and coverage or about the amount we will pay for your medical services or drugs. For example, your plan network doctor makes a (favorable) coverage decision f or you whenever you receive medical care from him or her or if your network doctor refers you to a medical specialist. You or your doctor can also contact us and ask for a coverage decision if your doctor is unsure whether we will cover a particular medical service or refuses to provide medical care you think that you need. In other words, if you want to know if we will cover a medical service before you receive it, you can ask us to make a coverage decision for you. In limited circumstances a request for a coverage decision will be 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Cl assic Complete Rx (HMO) 149 Chapter 9 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) dismissed, which means we won't review the request. Examples of when a request will be dismissed include if the request is incomplete, if someone makes the request on your behalf but isn't legally authorized to do so or if you ask for your request to be withdrawn. If we dismiss a request for a cov erage decision, we will send a notice explaining why the request was dismissed and how to ask for a review of the dismissal. We are making a coverage decision for you whenever we decide what is covered for you and how much we pay. In some cases, we might decide a service or drug is not covered or is no longer covered by Medicare for you. If you disagree with this coverage decision, you can make an appeal. Making an appeal If we make a coverage decision , whether before or after a service is received, and you are not satisfied, you can \"appeal\" the decision. An appeal is a formal way of asking us to review and change a coverage decision we have made. Under certain circumstances, which we discuss later, you can request an expedited or \"fast appeal \" of a coverage decision. Your appeal is handled by different reviewers than those who made the original decision. When you appeal a decision for the first time, this is called a Level 1 appeal . In this appeal, we review the coverage decision we made to check to see if we were properly following the rules. When we have completed the review , we give you our decision. In limited circumstances a request for a Level 1 appeal will be dismissed , which means we won't revi ew the request. Examples of when a request will be dismissed include if the request is incomplete, if someone makes the request on your behalf but isn't legally authorized to do so or if you ask for your request to be withdrawn. If we dismiss a request for a Level 1 appeal , we will send a notice explaining why the request was dismissed and how to ask for a review of the dismissal. If we do not dismiss your case but say no to all or part of your Level 1 appeal , you can go on to a Level 2 appeal . The Level 2 appeal is conducted by an independent review organization that is not connected to us. ( Appeals for medical services and Part B drugs will be automatically sent to the independent review organization for a Level 2 appeal - you do not need to do anything. For Part D drug appeals, if we say no to all or part of your appeal you will need to ask for a Level 2 appeal . Part D appeals are discussed further in Section 6 of this chapter). If you are not satisfied with the decision at the Level 2 appeal , you may be able to continue through additional levels of appeal (Section 9 in this chapter explains the Level 3, 4, and 5 appeals processes) . Section 4.2 How to get help when you are asking for a coverage decision or making an appeal Here are resources if you decide to ask for any kind of coverage decision or appeal a decision: You can call us at Member Services . 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Cl assic Complete Rx (HMO) 150 Chapter 9 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) You can get free help from your State Health Insurance Assistance Program. Your doctor can make a request for you. If your doctor helps with an appeal past Level 2, they will need to be appointed as your representative. Please call Member Services and ask for the \"Appointment of Representative\" form. (The form is also available on Medicare's website at www.cms.gov/Medicare/CMS -Forms/CMS - Forms/downloads/cms1696.pdf or on our website at www.GeisingerGold.com .) o For medical care or Part B prescription drugs , your doctor can request a coverage decision or a Level 1 appeal on your behalf. If your appeal is denied at Level 1, it will be automatically forwarded to Leve l 2. o For Part D prescription drugs, your doctor or other prescriber can request a coverage decision or a Level 1 appeal on your behalf. If your Level 1 appeal is denied your doctor or prescriber can request a Level 2 appeal . You can ask someone to act on your behalf. If you want to, you can name another person to act for you as your \"representative\" to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal. o If you want a friend, relative, or other person to be your representative, call Member Services and ask for the \"Appointment of Representative\" form . (The form is also available on Medicare's website at www.cms.gov/Medicare/CMS - Forms/CMS -Forms/downloads/cms1696.pdf or on our website at www.GeisingerGold.com .) The form give s that person permission to act on your behalf. It must be signed by you and by the person who you would like to act on your behalf. You must give us a copy of the signed form. o While we can accept an appeal request without the form, we cannot begin or complete our review until we receive it. If we do not receive the form within 44 calendar days after receiving your a ppeal request (our deadline for making a decision on your appeal), your appeal request will be dismissed. If this happens, we will send you a written notice explaining your right to ask the independent review organization to review our decision to dismiss your appeal. You also have the right to hire a lawyer. You may contact your own lawyer or get the name of a lawyer from your local bar association or other referral service. There are also groups that will give you free legal services if you qualify. However, you are not required to hire a lawyer to ask for an y kind of coverage decision or appeal a decision. Section 4.3 Which section of this chapter gives the details for your situation? There are four different situations that involve coverage decisions and appeals. Since each situation has different rules and deadlines, we give the details for each one in a separate section: 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Cl assic Complete Rx (HMO) 151 Chapter 9 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) Section 5 of this chapter: \"Your medical care: How to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal\" Section 6 of this chapter: \"Your Part D prescription drugs: How to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal\" Section 7 of this chapter: \"How to ask us to cover a longer inpatient hospital stay if you think the doctor is discharging you too soon\" Section 8 of this chapter: \"How to ask us to keep covering certain medical services if you think your coverage is ending too soon\" ( Applies only to these services: home health care, skilled nursing facility care, and Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services) If you're not sure which section you should be using, please call Member Services. You can also get help or information from government organizations such as your S HIP. SECTION 5 Your medical care: How to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal of a coverage decision Section 5.1 This section tells what to do if you have problems getting coverage for medical care or if you want us to pay you back for our share of the cost of your care This section is about your benefits for medical care and services. These benefits are described in Chapter 4 of this document : Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay ). To keep things simple, we generally refer to \"medical care coverage\" or \"medical care\" which includes medical items and services as well as Medicare Part B prescription drugs. In some cases, different rul es apply to a request for a Part B prescription drug. In those cases, we will explain how the rules for Part B prescription drugs are different from the rules for medical items and services. This section tells what you can do if you are in any of the five following situations: 1. You are not getting certain medical care you want, and you believe that this care is covered by our plan. Ask for a coverage decision. Section 5.2. 2. Our plan will not approve the medical care your doctor or other medical provider wants to give you, and you believe that this care is covered by the plan. Ask for a coverage decision. Section 5.2. 3. You have received medical care that you believe should be covered by the plan, but we have said we will not pay for this care. Make an appeal . Section 5.3. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Cl assic Complete Rx (HMO) 152 Chapter 9 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 4. You have received and paid for medical care that you believe should be covered by the plan, and you want to ask our plan to reimburse you for this care. Send us the bill. Section 5.5. 5. You are being told that coverage for certain medical care you have been getting that we previously approved will be reduced or stopped, and you believe that reducing or stopping this care could harm your health. Make an appeal . Section 5.3. Note: If the coverage that will be stopped is for hospital care, home health care, skilled nursing facility care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services , you need to read Sections 7 and 8 of this Chapter. S pecial rules apply to these types of care. Section 5.2 Step -by-step: How to ask for a coverage decision Legal Terms When a coverage decision involves your medical care, it is called an \"organization determination.\" A \"fast coverage decision\" is called an \"expedited determination.\" Step 1: Decide if you need a \"standard coverage decision\" or a \"fast coverage decision.\" A \"standard coverage decision\" is usually made within 14 days or 72 hours for Part B drugs . A \"fast coverage decision\" is generally made within 72 hours, for medical services, or 24 hours for Part B drugs. In order to get a fast coverage decision, you must meet two requirements: You may only ask for coverage for medical care you have not yet received . You can get a fast coverage decision only if using the standard deadlines could cause serious harm to your health or hurt your ability to function. If your doctor tells us that your health requires a \"fast coverage decision,\" we will automatically agree to give you a fast coverage decision. If you ask for a fast coverage decision on your own, without your doctor's support, we will decide whether your health requires that we give you a fast coverage decision. If we do not approve a fast coverage decision, we will send you a letter that: o Explains that we will use the standard deadlines o Explains if your doctor asks for the fast coverage decision, we will automatically give you a fast coverage decision 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Cl assic Complete Rx (HMO) 153 Chapter 9 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) o Explains that you can file a \"fast complaint\" about our decision to give you a standard coverage decision instead of the fast coverage decision you requested. Step 2 : Ask our plan to make a coverage decision or fast coverage decision. Start by calling , writing, or faxing our plan to make your request for us to authorize or provide coverage for the medical care you want. You, your doctor, or your representative can do this. Chapter 2 has contact information. Step 3: We consider your request for medical care coverage and give you our answer. For standard coverage decisions we use the standard deadlines. This means we will give you an answer within 14 calendar days after we receive your request for a medical item or service. If your request is for a Medica re Part B prescription drug , we will give you an answer within 72 hours after we receive your request. However, if you ask for more time, or if we need more information that may benefit you, we can take up to 14 more days if your request is for a medical item or service. If we take extra days, we will tell you in writing. We can't take extra time to make a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug. If you believe we should not take extra days, you can file a \"fast complaint\". We will give you an answer to your complaint as soon as we make the decision . (The process for making a complaint is different from the process for coverage decisions and appeals. See Section 10 of this chapter for information on complaints.) For Fast Coverage decisions we use an expedited timeframe A fast coverage decision means we will answer within 72 hours if your request is for a medical item or service. If your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug, we will answer within 24 hours. However, if you ask for more time, or if we need more information that may benefit you, we can take up to 14 more days . If we take extra days, we will tell you in writing. We can't take extra time to make a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug. If you believe we should not take extra days, y ou can file a \"fast complaint\". (See Section 10 of this chapter for information on complaints.) We will call you as soon as we make the decision. If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested , we will send you a written statement that explains why we said no. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Cl assic Complete Rx (HMO) 154 Chapter 9 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) Step 4: If we say no to your request for coverage for medical care, you can appeal. If we say no, you have the right to ask us to reconsider this decision by making an appeal. This means asking again to get the medical care coverage you want. If you make an appeal, it means you are going on to Level 1 of the appeals process. Section 5.3 Step -by-step: How to make a Level 1 appeal Legal Terms An appeal to the plan about a medical care coverage decision is called a plan \"reconsideration.\" A \"fast appeal\" is also called an \"expedited reconsideration.\" Step 1: Decide if you need a \"standard appeal\" or a \"fast appeal.\" A \"standard appeal\" is usual ly made within 30 days. A \"fast appeal\" is generally made within 72 hours. If you are appealing a decision we made about coverage for care that you have not yet received, you and/or your doctor will need to decide if you need a \"fast appeal.\" If your doctor tells us that your health requires a \"fast appeal,\" we will give you a fast appeal. The requirements for getting a \"fast appeal\" are the same as those for getting a \"fast coverage decision\" in Section 5.2 of this chapter. Step 2: Ask our plan for an appeal or a Fast appeal If you are asking for a standard appeal, submit your standard appeal in writing . Chapter 2 has contact information. If you are asking for a fast appeal, make your appeal in writing or call us . Chapter 2 has contact information. You must make your appeal request within 60 calendar days from the date on the written notice we sent to tell you our answer on the coverage decision. If you miss this deadline and have a good reason for missing it, explain the reason your appeal is late wh en you make your appeal. W e may give you more time to make your appeal. Examples of good cause may include a serious illness that prevented you from contacting us or if we provided you with incorrect or incomplete information about the deadline for requesting an appeal. You can ask for a copy of the information regarding your medical decision . You and your doctor may add more information to support your appeal. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Cl assic Complete Rx (HMO) 155 Chapter 9 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) Step 3: We consider your appeal and we give you our answer. When our plan is reviewing your appeal, we take a careful look at all of the information. We check to see if we were following all the rules when we said no to your request. We will gather more information if needed possibly contacting you or your doctor . Deadlines for a \"fast appeal \" For fast appeals, we must give you our answer within 72 hours after we receive your appeal . We will give you our answer sooner if your health requires us to. o However, if you ask for more time, or if we need more information that may benefit you, we can take up to 14 more calendar days if your request is for a medical item or service . If we take extra days, we will t ell you in writing. We can't take extra time if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug. o If we do not give you an answer within 72 hours (or by the end of the extended time period if we took extra days), we are required to automatically sen d your request on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will be reviewed by an independent review organization. Section 5.4 explains the Level 2 appeal process. If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must authorize or provide the coverage we have agreed to provide within 72 hours after we receive your appeal. If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you our decision in writing and automatically forward your appeal to the independent review organization for a Level 2 appeal. The independent review organization will notify you in writing when it receives your appeal. Deadlines for a \"standard appeal \" For standard appeals, we must give you our answer within 30 calendar days after we receive your appeal . If your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug you have not yet received , we will give you our answer within 7 calendar days after we receive your appeal . We will give you our decision sooner if your health condition requires us to. o However, if you ask for more time, or if we need more information that may benefit you, we can take up to 14 more calendar days if your request is for a medical item or service . If we take extra days, we will tell you in writing. We can't take extra time to make a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug. o If you believe we should not take extra days, you can file a \"fast complaint .\". When you file a fast complaint, we will give you an answer to your complaint within 24 hours. ( See Section 10 of this chapter for information on complaints.) 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Cl assic Complete Rx (HMO) 156 Chapter 9 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) o If we do not give you an answer by the deadline (or by the end of the extended time period), we will send your request to a Level 2 appeal , where an i ndependent review organization will review the appeal. Section 5.4 explains the Level 2 appeal process. If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must authorize or provide the cover age within 30 calendar days if your request is for a medical item or service, or within 7 calendar days if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug. If our plan says no to part or all of your appeal, we will automatically send your appeal to the i ndependent r eview organization for a Level 2 appeal. Section 5.4 Step -by-step: How a Level 2 appeal is done Legal Term The formal name for the \" independent review organization\" is the \"Independent Review Entity.\" It is sometimes called the \"IRE.\" The independent r eview organization is an independent organization hired by Medicare . It is not connected with us and is not a government agency. This organization decides whether the decision we made is correct or if it should be changed. Medicare oversees its work. Step 1: The independent review organization reviews your appeal. We will send the information about your appeal to this organization. This information is called your \"case file.\" You have the right to ask us for a copy of your case file . You have a right to give the i ndependent r eview o rganization additional informatio n to support your appeal. Reviewers at the i ndependent r eview o rganization will take a careful look at all of the information related to your appeal. If you had a \"fast appeal \" at Level 1, you will also have a \"fast appeal \" at Level 2 For the \"fast appeal \" the review organization must give you an answer to your Level 2 appeal within 72 hours of when it receives your appeal. However, if your request is for a medical item or service and the i ndependent r eview organization needs to gather more information that may benefit you, it can take up to 14 more calendar days . The i ndependent review organization can't take extra time to make a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Cl assic Complete Rx (HMO) 157 Chapter 9 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) If you had a \"standard appeal \" at Level 1, you will also have a \"standard appeal \" at Level 2 For the \"standard appeal\" i f your request is for a medical item or service, t he review organization must give you an answer to your Level 2 appeal within 30 calendar days of when it receives your appeal. If your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug, the review organization must give you an answer to your Level 2 appeal within 7 calendar days of when it receives your appeal. However, if your request is for a medi cal item or service and the i ndependent r eview organization needs to gather more information that may benefit you, it can take up to 14 more calendar days . The i ndependent review organization can't take extra time to make a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug. Step 2: The independent review organization gives you their answer. The i ndependent review organization will tell you it' s decision in writing and explain the reasons for it. If the review organization says yes to part or all of a request for a medical item or service, we must authorize the medical care coverage within 72 hours or provide the service within 14 calendar days after we receive the decision from the review organiza tion for standard requests . For expedited requests, we have 72 hours from the date we receive the decision from the review organization. If the review organization says yes to part or all of a request for a Medicare Part B prescription drug , we must author ize or provide the Part B prescription drug within 72 hours after we receive the decision from the review organization for standard requests . For expedited requests we have 24 hours from the date we receive the decision from the review organization. If this organization says no to part or all of your appeal , it means they agree with us that your request (or part of your request) for coverage for medical care should not be approved. (This is called \"upholding the decision\" or \"turning down your appeal.\") . In this case, the i ndependent r eview o rganization will send you a letter: o Explaining its decision o Notify ing you of the right to a Level 3 appeal if the dollar value of the medical care coverage meet s a certain minimum. The written notice you get from the independent r eview organization will tell you the dollar amount you must meet to continue the appeals process. o Telling you how to file a Level 3 appeal. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Cl assic Complete Rx (HMO) 158 Chapter 9 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) Step 3: If your case meets the requirements, you choose whether you want to take your appeal further. There are three additional levels in the appeals process after Level 2 (for a total of five levels of appeal). If you want to go to a Level 3 appeal the details on how to do this are in the written notice you get after your Level 2 appeal. The Level 3 appeal is handled by an A dministrative L aw Judge or attorney adjudicator . Section 9 in this chapter explains the Level 3, 4, and 5 appeals process es. Section 5.5 What if you are asking us to pay you for our share of a bill you have received for medical care? Chapter 7 describes when you may need to ask for reimbursement or to pay a bill you have received from a provider. It also tells how to send us the paperwork tha t asks us for payment. Asking for reimbursement is asking for a coverage decision from us If you send us the paperwork asking for reimbursement, you are asking for a coverage decision. To make this decision , we will check to see if the medical care you paid for is a covered service. We will also check to see if you followed all the rules for using your coverage for medical care. If we say yes to your request : If the medical care is covered and you followed all the rules, we will send you the payment for our share of the cost within 60 calendar days after we receive your request. I f you haven't paid for the services, we will send the payment directly to the provider. If we say no to your request : If the medical care is not covered, or you did not follow all the rules, we will not send payment. Instead, we will send you a letter that says we will not pay for the services and the reasons why. If you do not agree with our decision to t urn you down, you can make an appeal . If you make an appeal, it means you are asking us to change the coverage decision we made when we turned down your request for payment. To make this appeal, follow the process for appeals that we describe in Section 5.3. For appeals concerning reimbursement, please note: We must give you our answer within 60 calendar days after we receive your appeal. If you are asking us to pay you back for medical care you have already received and paid for, you are not allowed to ask for a fast appeal. If the i ndependent r eview organization decides we should pay, we must send you or the provider the payment within 30 calendar days. If the answer to your appeal is yes at any 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Cl assic Complete Rx (HMO) 159 Chapter 9 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) stage of the appeals process after Level 2, we must send the payment you requested to you or to the provider within 60 calendar days. SECTION 6 Your Part D prescription drugs: How to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal Section 6.1 This section tells you what to do if you have problems getting a Part D drug or you want us to pay you back for a Part D drug Your benefits include coverage for many prescription drugs. To be covered, the drug must be used for a medically accepted indication. (See Chapter 5 for more information about a medically accepted indication.) For details about Part D drugs, rules, restrictions, and costs please see Chapters 5 and 6. This section i s about your Part D drugs only. To keep things simple, we generally say \"drug\" in the rest of this section, instead of repeating \"covered outpatient prescription drug\" or \"Part D drug\" every time. We also use the term \"drug list\" instead of \"List of Covere d Drugs\" or \"Formulary.\" If you do not know if a drug is covered or if you meet the rules , you can ask us. Some drugs require that you get approval from us before we will cover it. If your pharmacy tells you that your prescription cannot be filled as writ ten, the pharmacy will give you a written notice explaining how to contact us to ask for a coverage decision. Part D coverage decisions and appeals Legal Term An initial coverage decision about your Part D drugs is called a \"coverage determination.\" A coverage decision is a decision we make about your benefits and coverage or about the amount we will pay for your drugs. This section tells what you can do if you are in any of the following situations: Asking to cover a Part D drug that is not on the plan's List of Covered Drugs . Ask for an exception. Section 6.2 Asking to waive a restriction on the plan's coverage for a drug (such as limits on the amount of the drug you can get) . Ask for an exception. Section 6.2 Asking to pay a lower cost -sharing amount for a covered drug on a higher cost -sharing tier. Ask for an exception. Section 6.2 Asking to get pre -approval for a drug. Ask for a coverage decision. Section 6.4 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Cl assic Complete Rx (HMO) 160 Chapter 9 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) Pay for a prescription drug you already bought. Ask us to pay you back. Section 6.4 If you disagree with a coverage decision we have made, you can appeal our decision. This section tells you both how to ask for coverage decisions and how to request a n appeal. Section 6.2 What is an exception? Legal Terms Asking for coverage of a drug that is not on the Drug List is sometimes called asking for a \"formulary exception.\" Asking for removal of a restriction on coverage for a drug is sometimes called asking for a \"formulary exception.\" Asking to pay a lower price for a covered non -preferred drug is sometimes called asking for a \"tiering exception.\" If a drug is not covered in the way you would like it to be covered, you can ask us to make an \"exception.\" An exception is a type of coverage decision. For us to consider your exception request , your doctor or other prescriber will need to explain the medical reasons why you need the exception approved. Here are three examples of exceptions that you or your doctor or other prescriber can ask us to make: 1. Covering a Part D drug for you that is not on our Drug List. If we agree to cover a drug not on the Drug List, you will need to pay the cost -sharing amount that applies to drugs in Tier 4 . You cannot ask for an exception to the cost -sharing amount we require you to pay for the drug 2. Removing a restriction for a cover ed drug . Chapter 5 describes the extra rules or restrictions that apply to certain drugs on our Drug List. If we agree to make an exception and waive a restriction for you, you can ask for an exception to the copayment or coinsurance amount we require you to pay for the drug. 3. Changing coverage of a drug to a lower cost -sharing tier. Every drug on our Drug List is in one of six cost-sharing tiers. In general, the lower the cost -sharing tier number, the less you will pay as your share of the cost of the drug. If our drug list contains alternative drug(s) for treating your medical condition that are in a lower cost -sharing tier than your drug, you can ask us to cover your drug at the cost-sharing amount that applies to the alternative drug(s) . 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Cl assic Complete Rx (HMO) 161 Chapter 9 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) If the drug you're taking is a biological product you can ask us to cover your drug at a lower cost-sharing amount . This would be the lowest tier that contains biological product alternatives for treating your condition. If the drug you're taking is a brand name drug you can ask us to cover your drug at the cost -sharing amount that applies to the lowest tier that contains brand name alternatives for treating your condition. If the drug you're taking is a generic drug you can ask us to cover your drug at the cost-sharing amount that applies to the lowest tier that contains either brand or generic alternatives for treating your condition. You cannot ask us to change the cost -sharing tier for any drug in Tier 5 (Specialty Tier). If we approve your tiering exception request and there is more than one lower cost - sharing tier with alternative drugs you can't take, you will usually pay the lowest amount. Section 6.3 Important things to know about asking for exceptions Your doctor must tell us the medical reasons Your doctor or other prescriber must give us a statement that explains the medical reasons for requesting an exception. For a faster decision, include this medical information from your doctor or other prescriber when you ask for the exception. Typically, our Drug List includes more than one drug for treating a particular condition. These different possibilities are called \"alternative\" drugs. If an alternative drug would be just as effective as the drug you are requesting and would not cause more side effects or other health problems, we will generally not approve your request for an exception. If you ask us for a tiering exception, we will generally not approve your request for an exception unless all the alternative drugs in the lower cost -sharing tier(s) won't work as well for you or are likely to cause an adverse reaction or other harm . We can say yes or no to your request If we approve your request for an exception, our approval usually is valid until the end of the plan year. This is true as long as your doctor continues to prescribe the drug for you and that drug continues to be safe and effective for treating your condition. If we say no to your request, you can ask for a nother review by making an appeal. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Cl assic Complete Rx (HMO) 162 Chapter 9 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) Section 6.4 Step -by-step: How to ask for a coverage decision, including an exception Legal Term A \"fast coverage decision\" is called an \"expedited coverage determination.\" Step 1: Decide if you need a \"standard coverage decision\" or a \"fast coverage decision.\" \"Standard coverage decisions\" are made within 72 hours after we receive your doctor's statement. \"Fast coverage decisions\" are made within 24 hours after we receive your doctor's statement. If your health requires it, ask us to give you a \"fast coverage decision.\" To get a fast coverage decision, you must meet two requirements: You must be asking for a drug you have not yet received. (You cannot ask for a fast coverage decisi on to be paid back for a drug you have already bought.) Using the standard deadlines could cause serious harm to your health or hurt your ability to function. If your doctor or other prescriber tells us that your health requires a \"fast coverage decision,\" we will automatically give you a fast coverage decision. If you ask for a fast coverage decision on your own, without your doctor or prescriber's support, we will decide whether your health requires that we give you a fast coverage decision. If we do not approve a fast coverage decision, we will send you a letter that: o Explains that we will use the standard deadlines . o Explains if your doctor or other prescriber asks for the fast coverage decision, we will automatically give you a fast coverage decision . o Tells you how you can file a \"fast complaint\" about our decision to give you a standard coverage decision instead of the fast coverage decision you requested. We will answer your complaint within 24 hours of receipt. Step 2 : Request a \"standard coverage decision\" or a \"fast coverage decision.\" Start by calling, writing, or faxing our plan to make your request for us to authorize or provide coverage for the medical care you want.
