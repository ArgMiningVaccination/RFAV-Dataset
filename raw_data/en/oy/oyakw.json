A medical practice that has its roots deep inside nature, Ayurveda first originated in India more than 3,000 years ago. The term \"Ayurveda\" has been derived from the Sanskrit terms \"ayur\" (which means life), and \"veda\" (which means science and knowledge). Summing it up, Ayurveda can loosely be translated to the \"knowledge of life\". Ayurveda, as a medical treatment, believes that diseases are caused due to an imbalance or stress that has been caused in a person's consciousness. Thus, Ayurveda prescribes a certain way of lifestyle improvement through intervention, in the form of natural therapies, that will help the person to regain a balance between their body, mind, spirit, and regain harmony with the natural environment. The natural practice of Ayurveda begins with an internal purification process, which is followed by a special diet, certain herbal remedies, massage therapy, yoga, and meditation. The primary basis of the Ayurvedic treatment is the concept of universal interconnectedness with the human body's constitution or \"Prakriti\", and life forces, also known as \"doshas.\" Ayurveda treatment aims to heal the ailing person by eliminating his or her internal impurities, reducing all symptoms (physical or spiritual), increasing their resistance to the disease, getting rid of all signs of worry, and as a result, elevating the person's harmony of life. Various oils, common spices, and plants, including herbs, are extensively used in traditional ayurvedic treatments.

Even bodily secretions such as bile and pancreatic juices, which are meant to help process the nutrients in our body, oftentimes are not expelled properly from our body. Thus it is very important to reset our digestive tract every once in a while in order to clean it deeply, as well as give them time to rejuvenate themselves. The Virechanam Treatment is an excellent way to get rid of all toxins from the digestive system, through the help of medically induced purgation or fecal expulsion, and it has been specifically designed to purify the digestive tract, pancreas, and liver. Focuses on the 'Pitha' dosha, and it is beneficial for all kinds of digestive disorders, digestion-induced skin disorders and diseases, mental disorders, and chronic rheumatism.
