The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine estimates more than 3 million adults have acupuncture each year. Fang Mu, of Mu Chinese Acupuncture and Herbs, said acupuncture is an ancient Chinese treatment which can help allergy sufferers pin point their symptoms. \"With the Chinese herb and acupuncture, it will give them the benefits. I know this because we have thousands of years of experience,\" said Mu. Practitioners say the treatment boosts the body's immune system and energy flow. Allergist Dr. Chris Van Winkle said there is not enough research yet to support its effectiveness. \"So I tend to stick with the stuff we do know. We do know that allergen shots work well. We know the risks and benefits a little bit better of the medications than we know the risks and benefits of acupuncture,\" said Van Winkle. While some may argue there's a placebo affect, there's no denying these natural treatments have a loyal following. Janeane Sheffield receives acupuncture on a regular basis. \"I know that it works. It has worked on me and there's a lot of different type of medicines than just Western,\" said Sheffield. And healing patients is something all doctors agree on regardless of the method. \"I feel very good and I can help them,\" said Mu. While some insurance companies do not cover acupuncture, a 1-hour session is $65 at Mu Chinese Acupuncture. The exact cost at other facilities varies depending on the practitioner.
