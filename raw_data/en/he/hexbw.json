Based on prevention and the concept of the \"family doctor\", it has enabled the population of the island to enjoy a level of health protection unique in the Third World, comparable to that of the most developed countries. The World Health Organization (WHO), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the World Bank, among others, as well as the medical journals The Lancet, Science and The New England Journal of Medicine have praised this system and present it as the model to follow for developing countries, as well as a path to be explored for the richest nations. 2Despite limited resources and a complex geopolitical context - the country having been under US sanctions since 1960 - how has Cuba managed to become a global benchmark in the field of public health? What are the characteristics of the island's health system that enable it to provide the entire population with high quality care? How did a nation representing 0.001% of the world's population become the leader of international medical solidarity? 3Three axes structure this study. The first part will be devoted to the genesis of the Cuban health system based on the doctrine \"prevent before you heal\" and the formation of an abundant human capital. Secondly, the effectiveness of this model will be considered in the light of statistical results and opinions issued by international institutions on the health policy of the Caribbean island. Finally, the reasons which led Cuba to export its medical services, to make health solidarity a pillar of its foreign policy and to make this sector the first source of income for the country will be analyzed. - 1 Francisco Rojas Ochoa, \"El n\u00famero had only 6,286 physicians for a total population of 6 million, a ratio of one doctor to 1,064 people. Within three years, 1,402 of them chose to leave the country for the United States, attracted by better professional opportunities and a favorable migration policy put in place by Washington for Cuban executives from all sectors in the framework of the ideological war against the Cuban Revolution. With a ratio of one doctor to 1,268 inhabitants, the island was facing a serious health crisis. [1](#ftn1) 5Faced with this, Cuba therefore decided to make the development of a public, universal and free health system a national priority. Founded in 1961, the National Health System (SNS), an entity dependent on the Ministry of Public Health, is structured around seven principles: - Health is a people's right. - The health of the population is the responsibility of the state. - Health services are equally accessible to the population. - Health practices have a solid scientific basis. - Health actions have a preventive orientation. - Social participation is inherent in the use and development of health services. - - 2 Benito A.

[2](#ftn2) 6The entire Cuban health system is based on the model called \"the family doctor and nurse\", developed in 1984. This model, where the basic unit is the family nucleus, with a clinical, epidemiological and social approach of health problems, has seven characteristics that ratify the principles set out by the SNS: - state and social character of medicine - accessibility and free services - prophylactic (preventive) orientation - community and intersectoral participation - international collaboration - normative centralization and executive decentralization - - 3 Pedro Mujica R\u00edo, Sep [(...)](#ftn3) adequate application of advances in science and technology.

Each polyclinic caters to a population of 30,000 to 60,000 people and works closely with 20 to 40 consultation centers. A polyclinic offers an average of twenty different services: rehabilitation, radiology, ultrasound, optometry, endoscopy, emergency services, traumatology, clinical laboratory, family planning, thrombolysis, medical and dental emergencies, maternal and child care, immunization and attention to people with diabetes, geriatrics, dermatology, psychiatry, cardiology, family medicine and internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology.

M\u00e1rquez Morales, \"Modelo : el M\u00e9dico y la de familia en Cuba\", in Ministerio de [(...)](#ftn5) 8Within these entities, health professionals are responsible for the primary medical attention of the population and more specifically deal with the most vulnerable categories of people, namely children, the elderly and pregnant women. The emphasis is on preventive medicine, hygiene, diet, sports and the fight against risk factors. Prevention is \"the cornerstone\" of the Cuban health system. Thus, each Cuban family nucleus - regardless of their state of health - receives a regular visit from the doctor considered to be \"the guardian of health\". This model has notably shown its effectiveness in the areas of epidemiological surveillance and epidemic disease control. [5](#ftn5) 9This model adapts to its environment and to the biological, psychological and social characteristics of the community and its health situation. Thus, if a territorial area has a population particularly prone to allergies, the polyclinic will open a dedicated service in order to respond to this type of problem. Likewise, if a significant percentage of a community has hypertension, the institution will take the necessary steps to adjust to that reality. Another example, if a sector has a large number of smokers, an awareness campaign on the harmfulness of tobacco will be carried out at regular intervals. - 6 Organisation mondiale de la sant\u00e9, \"La revoluci\u00f3n a also has 284 hospitals with an average of 5.2 hospital beds per 1,000 inhabitants. According to the World Health Organization, it is the best-endowed Latin American country in this sector. [6](#ftn6) By way of comparison, France has 6.1 beds per 1,000 inhabitants in the entire health sector, namely public establishments, private establishments of collective interest and private for-profit establishments. If only public hospitals are considered, the average drops to 3.8 beds per 1,000 inhabitants. [7](#ftn7) - 8 Clarivel Presno Labrador, Integr [(...)](#ftn8) 11Cuba has 24 faculties of medicine and 40 formation centers for nurses in all provinces of the country and trains an average of 10,000 doctors and nearly 30,000 health professionals per year. At the level of the university course, the specialty \"family medicine\" is an obligation for all future doctors. After completing their studies, doctors must systematically complete one year as interns and two years as residents in a consultation center or polyclinic, in order to complete and validate their formation. [8](#ftn8) - 9 Elizabeth Newhouse, \"Disaster Medicine : U.S. Doctors Examine Cuba's Approach\", Center for Internat [(...)](#ftn9) 12All specialties are taught in Cuba, including disaster medicine, which is an integral part of the medical curriculum. The population is also trained from elementary school on the attitude to adopt in the face of a natural disaster. Regular exercises are carried out and involve all categories of the population, from children to the elderly. The entire population is also trained in first aid and survival skills. In this regard, the Washington Center for International Policy (CIP) notes in a report that \"the result is an ingrained culture of prevention and preparation second to none\". The CIP also stresses that \"that the system is effective is beyond doubt. Only a handful of Cubans died in the 16 major storms that battered the island over the last decade\u2014and the likelihood of being killed by a hurricane in the United States is 15 times greater than in Cuba\". [9](#ftn9) - 10 Juventud mil habitantes\", op. cit. 13Cuba thus has nearly 50,000 medical professors, more than 100,000 doctors and around 100,000 nurses. With an average of 9 doctors and 9 nurses per 1,000 inhabitants, Cuba is today one of the best-endowed nations in the sector. [10](#ftn10) For comparison, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), France has 3.4 doctors per 1,000 inhabitants and Austria, the best-endowed European country, has 5.2 doctors per 1,000 inhabitants. As for the United States, the figure is 2.6 doctors per 1,000 inhabitants. [11](#ftn11) The island also has nearly 20,000 dentists and dental surgeons as well as more than 15,000 pharmacists. In total, according to the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, the National Health System employs nearly half a million professionals, or 13% of the working population, in the 13,000 health institutions in the nation. [12](#ftn12) 14Cuba has also invested in the biotechnology sector by creating a leading industry with the following characteristics: - The state is the main investor. - The scientific and technical preparation of professionals trained in Cuban universities aims for excellence. - Significant investment in education and training of human resources. - Close relationship between the health system and the health needs of the population: the products developed are primarily focused on the health needs of the country. - Product development to substitute for imports and be self-sufficient for national demand and national health programs. - The national market is the highest priority. - \"Closed cycle\" and complete policy within the biotechnology centers: research, development, production, marketing, after-sales service. - Synergy between research and development institutions and production, free from any individual competition. Each institution contributes with its strengths to the common need to create new products. The products are thus obtained thanks to the collaboration of all the institutions. - Gain in international competitiveness in terms of quality, production volume, costs and novelty. - - 13 Organizaci\u00f3n Panamericana de la Salud & \"Biotecnolog\u00eda para la sa [(...)](#ftn13) Collaboration with developing countries for the research, development, production and commercialization of biotechnological products. [13](#ftn13) 15In 1992, in the midst of a Special Period marked by severe material shortages, Cuba created the West Havana Science Pole. It is the coordinating and strategic structure of Cuban biotechnology which brings together a total of 38 institutions belonging to 13 state bodies. Among these are the Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (CIGB), the Center for Immunoassay (CIE), the Center for Molecular Immunology (CIM), the Cuban Neuroscience Center (CNEURO), the Center for Biomolecular Chemistry (CQB), the International Center for Neurological Restoration (CIREN), the National Center for Bio-Prepared Products (BIOCEN), the National Center for Scientific Research (CNIC), the Finlay Institute, the \"Pedro Kour\u00ed\" Institute of Tropical Medicine (IPK), the Center for the State Control of Drugs, Equipment and Medical Devices (CECMED) which is the national regulatory authority for drugs and medical equipment, and the National Coordinating Center for Clinical Trials (CENCEC). In 2012, these institutions were grouped into the BioCubaFarma Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Industries Group, whose mission is to \"produce high-tech drugs, equipment and services aimed at improving the health of the population and creating exportable goods and services\". [14](#ftn14) - 15 Organizaci\u00f3n 16Thanks to its advanced biotechnology industry, Cuba manages to produce nearly 65% of the drugs necessary for the health of the population. The island has been able to develop thirteen vaccines with efficacy recognized by the World Health Organization, in particular against meningitis B and leptospirosis, cholera, whooping cough, diabetes and hepatitis B, which are exported to dozens of countries. [15](#ftn15) 17A report published jointly by the European Commission, the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization hails Havana's results: - \"Experie [(...)](#ftn16) Over the years, Cuba has successfully developed its capacity to produce health technologies to maintain its health system, recognized worldwide for having achieved universal coverage. This reality is illustrated by the health indicators obtained, comparable to those of highly developed countries. The level of this success prompts other countries attempting to establish a sustainable and competitive national pharmaceutical sector to emulate the model. Cuba has therefore become a world leader in South-South technology transfer, helping low-income countries to develop their own national biotechnology capacities, providing technical capacity and facilitating access to life-saving medicines at low cost for fight diseases such as meningitis B and hepatitis B.

Resources have been invested in developing biotechnology expertise to become competitive with advanced countries\". [17](#ftn17) According to the medical journal The Lancet, \"If the accomplishments of Cuba could be reproduced across a broad range of poor and middle-income countries the health of the world's population would be transformed\". [18](#ftn18) The results obtained by the Caribbean island are indeed remarkable. - 19 Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la sa et de la Sant\u00e9, d\u00e9penses en 2018 - allocates 27.5% of its national budget to the health sector, [19](#ftn19) just over 6% of its GDP. This is the nation's primary budget. According to the Pan American Health Organization, Cuba is one of five countries in Latin America and the Caribbean that allocate more than 6% of their GDP to health. [20](#ftn20) By way of comparison, France allocates 11.3% and the United States 17.1%. [21](#ftn21) This investment has enabled the island to achieve remarkable results. Thus, life expectancy is 79 years, similar to that of the richest countries. [22](#ftn22) Cuba is one of the countries with the highest number of centenarians per million inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization. [23](#ftn23) - 24 Banco Mundial, \"Tasa de madre [(...)](#ftn25) 20Prenatal care exceeds 95% and the institutional delivery rate is 99.9%. This explains why the infant mortality rate is so low. According to the World Bank, it is 4 per thousand and it is the lowest rate on the continent, lower even than that of the United States and similar to that of Canada. Latin America has an infant mortality rate of 14 per thousand. [24](#ftn24) Meanwhile, according to the World Health Organization, in 2015 Cuba became \"the first country in the world\" to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis. \"Eliminating the transmission of a virus is one of the greatest possible successes in public health\", notes the UN institution. \"This is a triumph for Cuba and a triumph for children and families around the world\", according to the WHO.

All Cuban children are vaccinated very early against thirteen infectious diseases. According to the Pan American Health Organization, \"Immunization is one of the most powerful tools science has offered us to prevent disease and save lives\". The World Health Organization points out that \"Cuba not only enjoys universal vaccine coverage, it also manufactures and exports these products\". Indeed, of the eleven vaccines applied to all children in Cuba, eight are produced in the country. [27](#ftn27) - 28 Jos\u00e9 A.

[28](#ftn28) Juan Jos\u00e9 Ortiz, representative of the institution in Havana, notes that \"severe malnutrition does not exist in Cuba [because] there is a political will\" to eliminate it. \"There are no children in the streets here. In Cuba, children are always a priority and that is why they do not suffer from the shortages that affect millions of children in Latin America, who work, who are exploited or who find themselves in prostitution networks\", he underlines. [29](#ftn29) Likewise, UNICEF recalls that Cuba is the only country in Latin America - and the Third World - to have eradicated child malnutrition. [30](#ftn30) 24The non-governmental organization Save the Children, founded in 1919 in the United Kingdom, ranks Cuba first among developing countries for the conditions for prospective mothers, ahead of Argentina, Israel or South Korea. In this study, several criteria were considered, such as the health and education system, assistance by qualified personnel during childbirth, the distribution of contraceptive methods, the level of education of women. and children, and political and economic equality between men and women, i.e. the participation of women in political life and equal pay. [31](#ftn31) - 32 Ricardo cited Cuba as an example: \"Cuba has a lot to teach the world about its preventive health system, which has achieved important results such as low mortality, long life expectancy and universal coverage\".

[36](#ftn36) 29The specialist journal adds: This highly structured, prevention-oriented system has produced positive results. Vaccination rates in Cuba are among the highest in the world. The life expectancy of 78 years from birth is virtually identical to that in the United States. The infant mortality rate in Cuba has fallen from more than 80 per 1000 live births in the 1950s to less than 5 per 1000 \u2014 lower than the U.S. rate.

However, as a report by the Pan American Health Organization points out, the Cuban Ministry of Public Health had drawn up an \"intersectoral response plan two months previously with Civil Defense, approved by central government authorities at the end of January\". The Covid-19 Confrontation Plan has based its action on national epidemiological surveillance in order to rapidly identify cases. [47](#ftn47) Since March 17, 2020, the more than 28,000 medical students on the island have been carrying out a weekly door-to-door survey across the country to detect possible cases of contamination, commonly known as active finding of suspected cases\", thus making it possible to control nearly four million people per day.

The first four are given through an injection and the last through a nasal spray. The most advanced research concerns the Abdal\u00e1 and Soberana 2 vaccines which began the second phase of the clinical trial in January 2021 and which included a sample of 900 people aged 19 to 80 years. In February 2021, the trial also involved the pediatric population so that the vaccine can be administered to children. The Carlos Finlay Institute launched phase III in March 2021 in collaboration with the Pasteur Institute of Iran which included 150,000 vulnerable people and residents of high-risk areas.

Cuba, according to the World Health Organization, \"was the first candidate from Latin America and the Caribbean to put its vaccine into the clinical phase\". The Cuban vaccine has already been \"prequalified\" by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).

Thus, as early as 1960, even before the development of its health system, Cuba offered its aid to Chile following the earthquake that had devastated the country. In 1963, the Havana government sent its first medical brigade of 55 professionals to Algeria to help the young independent nation cope with a serious health crisis. Since that date, Cuba has extended its solidarity to the rest of the world, especially Latin America, Africa and Asia. [60](#ftn60) The United Nations highlighted this contribution: \"Saving lives: this is what Cuba is doing in the world\". According to the institution, the island \"has a long history of cooperation\" with Third World countries.

In almost all cases, Cuban aid has been free, although from 1977 onwards, with certain high-income countries, mainly oil-producing, cooperation in the form of compensation developed.

It is currently in force in three continents and is founded on three basic principles: - the free dispatch of health workers for a period of two years after which a new team replaces the existing staff; - the presence of medical brigades who provide their services in rural areas and medical deserts, so that their work does not interfere with that of national doctors; - the training of medical personnel at the Latin American School of Medicine in Havana, or in universities created there under the direction of Cuban professors.

It involves operating for free on poor Latin Americans with cataracts and other eye diseases, who are unable to finance an operation that costs between $ 5,000 and $ 10,000 depending on the country. This humanitarian mission has since been extended to other latitudes (Africa, Asia). Operation Miracle includes the participation of 165 Cuban institutions. It has 49 eye centers and 82 operating theaters in 15 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. [83](#ftn83) In fifteen years, nearly 4 million people from more than 35 countries have been treated by Cuban doctors.

We know this well, because we Italians have been a people of migrants and we know what feelings accompany those who leave. We will miss you but you will not disappear, because our consciences will preserve your gift and strengthen us in our conviction that in Crema no one should ever be considered a stranger again. And henceforth we will have a decisive argument to oppose to anyone who wishes to limit or interfere with our sacred duty of hospitality. Your reassuring presence will be missed as it was an effective remedy in a time of unprecedented uncertainty and imminent danger. What you have represented silently during these weeks, starting with the certainty that our planet can fight and overcome inequalities, injustices and emergencies, if all peoples fraternize, will be missed. When you came here, you said that your homeland was the world. Therefore, from now on, you will always be our compatriots, in this vast world often abused by the absence of the supreme value of solidarity. We were shipwrecked and you rescued us, without asking us our name or our origin. After months of struggle, anguish, doubts, we now see the light, but only because we have come together.

You have arrived at the most dramatic moment and you fought in our company to transform \"the complaint into dance\", a collective dance, proving once again that great battles are not won by lone heroes, but by communities, and what has happened on our earth is the proof, the demonstration. We have been a community and that is why we have triumphed. We have been, thanks to you once again, a remedy for individualism, the favorite ally of adversity. We have of course been a multicultural and very human community. A deployment that did not admit defeat and we did not indeed lose. We fought like a passionate people with a project, refusing the risk of being a chaotic and hesitant crowd, driven only by fear. We have become intelligent adversaries of a killer pathogen [...]. With you, everything was easier. - [(...)](#ftn118) Thank you, on behalf of all the citizens of Crema, our territory, Lombardy and all of Italy! Giusi Spica, \"Emergenza Covid, la Sicilia chiede a Cuba force di 60 medici e infermieri\", [(...)](#ftn119) 83In November 2020, faced with the resurgence of Covid-19 cases, Sicily launched an urgent appeal to Cuba to receive help from 60 health professionals and relieve regional hospitals structurally lacking in human and material resources. The Italian press highlighted the vital contribution of Cuban doctors: \"This is a race against time to capture professionals from overseas, before other regions do\". Renato Costa, the Covid-19 emergency commissioner in Palermo behind the initiative, explained his decision: \"The Cuban government has teams of doctors and nurses willing to travel. We asked for their help. We are aware that other regions have followed suit and we hope we were the first. I am in close contact with the Embassy, which seems to have welcomed our S.O.S.\".

[...] Yet with the 52-strong brigade, this is the first time Cuba has sent an emergency contingent to Italy, one of the world's richest countries, demonstrating the reach of its medical diplomacy\". Christopher Tufton, Jamaican Minister of Health, thanked the Cuban authorities for their support: \"In a time of crisis, the Cuban government, the Cuban people ... have risen to the occasion, they have heard our appeal and they have responded\". [132](#ftn132) 89The United Kingdom also expressed gratitude to Cuba for agreeing to host a cruise ship of over 1,000, mostly British, with cases of Covid-19 on board, which was wandering the Caribbean after suffering rejection from all quarters, including from member countries of the British Commonwealth and the United States. [133](#ftn133) Ambassador Anthony Stokes thanked the Cuban health workers who handled the transfer in an open letter: I wish to express my immense gratitude and that of my country to the 43 Cubans who have completed the quarantine period today, after their incalculable contribution to the success of the operation carried out by Cuba to help the passengers and part of the crew of the Braemer cruise ship to return to the UK on March 18th. I highly appreciate the courage and humanism of those who decided to be on the front line knowing that it was a complex and delicate operation and that they should be separated for two weeks from their families and people who are dear to them. [...] During Operation Braemer, I witnessed the many qualities of the Cuban people, their humanitarian principles, their friendliness, their commitment to work; facets of Cuban character that I have discovered and come to love since arriving on this island.

Thus, Havana regularly enjoys the support of most developing nations, especially the United Nations where its resolutions - against sanctions imposed by the United States, for example - are generally supported by the majority of members. [135](#ftn135) 91As early as 1959, Cuba made the choice to create a public, universal and free health care system, making the health of the population a national priority and dedicating the largest part of the national budget to this sector. By focusing its health philosophy on prevention and on the \"family doctor\" model and relegating commercial considerations to the background, the island has obtained remarkable results, unprecedented for a Third World country with limited resources and under economic sanctions for more than half a century. 92The excellence achieved in the field of health has thus enabled the island to form an abundant human capital whose expertise is now in demand around the world, to the point of making international medical cooperation the first source of income for Cuba. This contribution to emergencies that occur across the planet and its capacity to respond to epidemics and natural disasters has led Havana to develop a health diplomacy unparalleled in the world and to strengthen the prestige of its health system. 93By making health a state monopoly not subject to budgetary constraints, Cuba has been able to put in place a strategy of prevention and fight against emerging diseases such as Covid-19, which has proved to be highly effective, thus allowing the competent authorities to provide quality protection to citizens and to have one of the lowest rates of infection and lethality in the world. By placing the patient at the center of the health project, Havana has shown that it is possible to provide top quality services to the population, despite the structural constraints linked to its low income.
