At CDIP we use two formats for analysis, 9-band and parameter. In the the 9-band products, all of the wave energy is divided into 9 broad bands. In the parameter products, the energy is split into 64 (or 128) narrow bands. As a result, the 9-band Tp and Dp give more general, broad values, while the parameter Tp and Dp identify finer, subtler peaks. So which Tp/Dp values are better? It depends what you're looking for. For instance, the broad bands of the 9-band values are better for addressing general questions about the sea state (e.g. which is currently predominant - local seas or ground swell?). To pick up more subtle features - like the arrival of long-period swell from a distant storm - the parameters values may be more helpful. For a more in depth discussion of wave measurements and standards, we recommend the [ Coastal Engineering Manual (CEM)](http://chl.erdc.usace.army.mil/CHL.aspx?p=s&a=Publications;8), published by the United States Army Corps of Engineers' Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory. 456 a NOAA PORTS (for CA) presentation| |2023-06-29||Randy Bucciarelli presented and attended at the Marine Exchange of Southern California centennial celebration| |2023-06-20||James Behrens Behrens and Ross Timmerman attended the Louisiana State of the Coast Conference| |2023-04-04||Ross Timmerman attended The Ocean Visions Biennial Summit at Georgia Aquarium, Atlanta, GA| |2023-03-28||James Behrens presented at the California OSPR Technology Workshop in Tiburon, CA| |2023-03-09||CDIP hosted Senator Catherine Blakespear for a and program briefing| |2023-02-14||James Behrens Oceanology Intenational Americas in San Diego, CA| |2022-11-30||Ross Timmerman attended the San Diego Harbor Safety Committee meeting| |2022-11-07||Ross Timmerman attended IOOS Fall meeting in San Juan, Puerto Rico| |2022-11-04||John Lodise presented at the SIO AOS seminar| |2022-11-01||James Behrens presented and Ross Timmerman attended 2022, San CA| |2022-09-20||Ross Timmerman and Les Hanson attended the MTS Buoy Workshop in Wilmington, NC.
