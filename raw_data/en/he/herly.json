In view of the sterngth of Ayush systems in reducing the disease burden, the efforts to promote these systems and integrate with mainstream medicine are on for last few decades. Off late, the National Health Policy (NHP) 2017 has advocated mainstreaming the potential of Ayush systems promoting a pluralistic system of Intergative healthcare. Effective integration strategies will promote communication and mutual understanding among different medical systems, evaluate medical care in its totality, ensure equitable distribution of resources, provide a training and educational programme for both traditional and conventional medicine, and finally generate a holistic healthcare system. Due to various policy initiatives, India has achieved physical integration to a great extent, in terms of collocation of AYUSH units in different levels of health care delivery facilities. However, for the successful mainstreaming the operational integration in terms of communication, information sharing, cross referrals between conventional and AYUSH systems are very important. The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, functioning under the Ministry of Ayush has contributed significantly in conducting research adopting interdisciplinary approach and developed some integrative treatment protocols for diseases such as Osteoarthritis, Cancer Quality of Life etc. In addition, several such initiatives have been taken up by different Scientific Organizations and have generated extensive evidences. Now, the Council is bringing out a document titled \"Ayurveda and Conventional Medicine- A Cross Referral Approach for Select Disease Conditions\" embodied with evidence based information through extensive consultative process. This cross referral guideline is a first ever effort to bring clarity to healthcare providers of both Ayurveda and Modern Medicine of referrals of suitable case. I hope this document will help to harmonize the assimilation approaches to successfully achieve functional integration for the benefit of the society. Guidelines are never static and revisions will take place whenever the new evidences emerge in the area. I appreciate the efforts put in by the Council in bringing out this document. New Delhi (Rajesh Kotecha) Dated: 09th July, 2021 Cross Referral Protocol iiiPROLOGUE Cross-referral is an important component of the hierarchical health care delivery system that ensures adequate and quality health care to all health seekers, as appropriate. Within the pluralistic health culture existing in India, formal or informal referral system exists in place within the tiered health care system. The need to have a structured cross- referral system, which is transparent, accountable and responsive, is indeed a matter of great priority. The existing referral system is most often unidirectional with referral being done from Ayush Systems of Medicine to contemporary bio-medicine, which has led to the concept of setting a referral guideline for improvement of cross referral across different systems of medicines and to the different hierarchical levels as per the requirement. This would enable delivery of timely, appropriate, cost-effective, and skill oriented health service to all health seekers. The dynamics established from the development of a refer-ral/counter-referral system aids in the development of mutual respect and trust, essential to the emergence of a seamless team dynamic between specialists across different systems that would ultimately benefit the patients and care givers. The successful establishment of a cross referral system in a resource-limited setting is highly challenging, considering the specialised skill and infrastructure requirement, establish - ment of levels of communication between the systems, maintaining a healthy and responsive relation with the patients and caregivers. This document has been developed with inputs from different stakeholders and domain experts through an extensive consultative process to make it comprehensive and pragmatic. In the emerging scenario of integrative medicine, cross-referral across the traditional and conventional systems of medicine plays a pivotal role to realize the objectives of the functional integration of these systems. Evidence based approaches comprise the core component to ensure the efficacy and safety of these approaches as standalone therapies or as add-on to conventional care. Further, in certain contexts, the cross referrals may also be intended to improve the quality of life of individual, alongside the main therapies. I appreciate the efforts of the contributors, reviewers and other experts in bringing out this document.

References 33-48Cross Referral Protocol 1CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION India has a very unique health care system. It widely accepts both indigenous medical systems like Ayurveda and foreign systems like Homeopathy and Unani. Among these, Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) are officially recognized and practiced as parallel to the mainstream allopathic system of medicine. Government of India, in collaboration with state/UT governments and other stake holders has taken active initiation to extend AYUSH system of medicine to general public. AYUSH along with other modern medical facilities across India, through various programs such as National Health Mission (NHM), National AYUSH Mission (NAM) etc. has brought proximity among various systems of medicinethus facilitating emergence of integrative system to bring about an architectural correction and re-inforce the existing public health care delivery system, to facilitate the use of natural, safe time tested, accessible, affordable and holistic care to all.Among all AYUSH systems, Ayurveda is the most popular one in India. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), definition \"referral\" is a process in which a health worker at one level of the health system, having insufficient resources (drugs, equipment, skills) to manage a clinical condition, seeks the help of a better or differently resourced facility at the same or higher level to assist in. Common reasons for referral (either an emergency or routine cases) are: A) For taking expert opinion B) For seeking additional services C) For seeking better treatment D) For using of high end diagnostic and therapeutic tools, which is not available at current level. Health referral not only involves direct extensive patient care but also includes support services such as transportation or transfer of patient from one health facility to another. It is a two-way relationship that requires cooperation, coordination and exchange of information between the healthcare providers during the referral and discharge of the patient. Referral can be from the community to a nearby health centre, from one facility to another or within the internal departments of a healthcare facility. An ideal referral mechanism ensures that people receive the best possible care, promotes cooperation & complementation of primary, secondary & tertiary health facilities as well as continuity of treatment and sustainability. Timely and properly coordinated referral and appropriate care can prevent morbidity and mortality to a great extent. Therefore to establish an effective cross referral mechanism between the Allopathy and Ayurveda, being the more accepted system among AYUSH, a guideline delineating the necessary criteria was felt essential. By considering the strengths and 2 Cross Referral Protocollimitations of these two medical systems, a broad referral guideline has been devised with following objectives: 1. To have a standard facilitating scientific document for managing referrals by the healthcare providers of Ayurveda and Allopathy 2. To facilitate provision of best possible health care service to any health seeker 3. To safely direct patients to appropriate levels of care 4. To effectively triage patients with medical emergencies and to offer appropriate care 5. To have a strategy to strengthen the public health care delivery through promotion of comprehensive health care and delivered through functional cross referral mechanism between Allopathy and Ayurveda The document is primarily intended to be used in the Government facilities where both Ayurveda & Modern medicine services are available under one roof or in proximity, such as AYUSH Health & Wellness Centres under Ayushmana Bharat, Primary Health Centres, Ayurveda dispensaries, Community Health Centres/District Hospitals, State Teaching Hospitals, National level institutions and Research Councils. Yoga is also included in referral in certain conditions where it is commonly recommended as integral part of Ayurveda. General guidelines This cross referral document is a first ever effort to bring clarity to healthcare providers of both Ayurveda and Allopathic Medicine for referrals of suitable case. Guidelines are dynamic and will be periodically reviewed to incorporate newly emerged evidences in the area. During referral, the need, merits, advantages, service availability, accessibility and even cost effectiveness and patient preference should be taken into account. The continuum of care has to be ensured throughout the care period. To make it an effective cross referral system, every member of the team should understand his roles and act with utmost care. The responsibilities of both referring and consulting physician are pivotal and some of them are mentioned below, however it is up to the attending physician to judge what is best for a patient. Roles and responsibilities of referring physician Should know what, when, whom, and where to refer. A patient should be referred only if there is a definite and convincing indication felt by the referring doctor for expert opinion, diagnostic purposes or for further management Should be empathetic about the socioeconomic condition of the patient and plan to link government facilities/schemes and insurance packages to patients so that they do not face financial hardshipCross Referral Protocol 3 Should connect the patient to the specialist through telemedicine, if the facility is available. This may enable the specialist to have a preliminary understanding of the case and also can avoid unnecessary travel to the referral facility It is expected that the referring doctor, should furnish the requisite information in the referral slip including probable diagnosis, available information regarding co-morbidities, allergies, medicines given, and reason for referral. Referral should be accompanied with all available medical records Should provide complete details of the receiving hospital like name, address, contact number and name of the attending physician with contact number if possible Should facilitate scheduling and transportation specially in case of life threatening or emergency situation Should explain the rationale/reasons for the choice of doctor/hospital, preparation, expected cost, possible outcome of the referral. Should ensure continuity of care, provide accurate patient information so that they return to the facility after referred services The details about the patient being referred should be recorded at the referral institute, a format is provided at the end of the chapter. Roles and responsibilities of consulting physician Should attend to the request for consultation with appropriate and early care should during emergency or life threatening conditions Ensure effective communication with the referred doctor Should communicate to the patient/patient's family in detail about the medical condition and expenses involved in further management. Should provide an update to the referred care provider on the management of the patient, inform if the patient is referred to another specialist/ facility. Ensure that the patients are referred back(back referrals) as and when appropriate by mentioning medical/treatment details of the patient in the slip Should not attempt by word or deed, to usurp or undermine the role of the primary physician.4 Cross Referral ProtocolRegister of Referrals -OUT Date of referral Patient Name (M/ F)Identity No.Referred toReferred forBack referral Yes/No Register of Referrals- IN Date referral receivedPatient Name (M/ F)Identity No. Referred from Referred for Back referral dateAppropriate referral Yes/No This protocol does not include already developed referral pathways within the particular stream of medicine.
