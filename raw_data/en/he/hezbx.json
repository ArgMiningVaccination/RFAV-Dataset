Obesity is linked to an increased risk for heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, some cancers, sleep problems, bone and joint ailments, and problems during pregnancy for both mom and baby. Intermittent fasting, a newer diet trend, offers a variety of options for weight loss, including: Depending on the diet, the fasting period may allow a person to consume only calorie-free drinks or 500 to 600 calories per day (for women and men, respectively). During the non-fasting period, a person is generally allowed to eat food with no restrictions, though some diets encourage sensible eating (recommended 2,000 calories per day for women and 2,500 calories per day for men). Proponents of intermittent fasting claim it helps people lose weight, allows them to enjoy their favorite foods and results in favorable health markers. Animal studies on mice and rats and a few studies in people have shown positive outcomes. Many studies suggest fasting-type diets may produce more weight loss than traditional calorie-restricted diets. They may result in lower blood levels of glucose, bad LDL cholesterol and triglycerides compared to traditional weight- loss diets. By the end of one study, two participants with type 2 diabetes no longer required insulin to control their blood glucose because of the weight they lost. These outcomes sound intriguing, but more studies are needed to answer questions like: The good news is that there is great interest in this subject for research, so more information should be coming. Who shouldn't fast? People who take insulin and women who are - or may be - pregnant should avoid fasting diets because of risks related to low blood sugar and undernutrition.
