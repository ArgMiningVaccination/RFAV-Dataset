Detoxification described in this handout includes the ways our bodies identify, neutralize, and eliminate things that are unhealthy for us. These include physical substances such as toxins (poisons) from our environ ment or by-products from the chemical processes that keep us alive. It also includes emotions or behaviors that are unhealthy. Alcohol and other narcotic withdrawal therapies are serious medical conditions requiring close supervision and are not discusse d here. We live in a polluted and stressful world . A person's body can become overburdened and strained by contaminants . This contamination can lead to health problems .1 There are several types of toxins .2 Anti-nutrients such as high fructose corn syr up, trans -fats, caffeine, alcohol, and processed foods By-products from the chemical processes that keep us alive such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, bile, urea, and stool Medications used improperly, inappropriately, or too often Heavy metals such as merc ury, arsenic, lead, cadmium, tin, and aluminum Chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides, cleaning products, solvents, and glues Allergens such as food, mold, dust, pollen, and chemicals Cause s of infections such as bacteria, viruses, yeast, and parasites Further, there are social, emotional, and spiritual challenges that affect health and well -being :3,4 Stress such as lack of personal time, too much work, excessive worry, too little rest, and financial strain Unhealthy mental states such as addictions, overeating, and destructive mental patterns Distractions that surround us such as constant noises, smells, lights, and images Over -stimulation from advertisements, radio, computers, TV, phones, and pagers Lack of spiritual connection , a loss of meaning and purpose Isolation , the lack of social support and community Nature deprivation , being disconnected from natural environments Negative emotions and persistent self -defeating thoughts such as anger, fear, guilt, hopelessness Our bodies and mind s already have the ability to handle these challenges. This process of maintaining physical and emotional balance is called homeostasis. The major body systems that work together to maintain health and balance include our: Liver and gallbladder Kidneys Gut Skin Lungs Lymphatics/ Circulation Mind/Brain Detoxification to Promote Health: A 7 -Day Program Detoxification to Promote Health PATIENT HANDOUT 2 University of Wiscon sin Integrative Medicine www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative There are no exact s ymptoms to suggest that your body's natural detoxification system is not working well. Your body may have a problem with detoxification if 1) you have a number of the following symptoms and 2) a c linician has seen you to determine that they are not caused by other medical conditions :1,5,6 Fatigue with sleep disruption and brain fog Mood disturbance, especially depression, anxiety, fear, and anger Muscle aches and joint pain Sinus congestion, dark circles under the eyes, and post -nasal drip Headaches with neck and shoulder pain Bloating and gas Irritable bowel, foul -smelling stools, and dark urine Weight changes and loss of muscle tone Heartburn, recurrent colds, and persistent infections Infertili ty and low interest in sex Premature aging and weakness Fluid retention and excess weight Rashes and canker sores Bad breath and body odor We currently have very little research that proves that detoxification therapies are helpful. However, if you are a patient experiencing these symptom s, you may be quite frustrated, wondering , \"What can I do to find relief?\" Detoxification therapy is one option to try. Unfortunately there are many gimmicky, expensive, unnecessary, and potentially harmful products, pro grams, and practitioners who exaggerate the helpfulness of their detoxification plans . In general, we recommend that you avoid any approach that sounds dramatic or extreme . If you are going to try one, follow guidelines that seem reasonable and safe, and that promote a healthy lifestyle . Choose one that helps you feel in control and that does not promise results that seem unrealistic. The five basic components of any detoxification program should include: Exercise : every day such as yoga and walking (especially in natur e) Regular sweating : a sauna, steam room, or hot room yoga class Healthy nutrition : rich in organic fruits and vegetables and filtered water Self-reflection : such as meditation and breathing -focused relaxation Body -work: such as massage and acupuncture. Bob Stockfield, Courtesy: NCCAM http://creativecommo ns.org/publicdomain/ Detoxification to Promote Health PATIENT HANDOUT 3 University of Wiscon sin Integrative Medicine www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative General guidelines for selecting complementary or alternative hea ling therapies If you are considering a complementary or alternative therapy such as detoxification, first seek the answers to the following questions. Is this treatment safe and what are the risks? Is there evidence to support this therapy? Does this ther apy appropriately address my condition, concerns, and expectations? What are the qualifications and intentions of the practitioner offering the therapy? Am I open and receptive to this approach , and do I believe in it? How expensive is the treatment ? Is t he cost in line with the possible benefits and risks? If all answers are reassuring, then it is likely you will benefit from this treatment . A Suggested 7 -Day Detoxification Program There are many detox approaches, and there is very little evidence to suggest that one is better than the next. However, a 7 -day commitment to healthy activities can be helpful for many symptoms. It can help your body find balance. It is important to be creative and adapt a program to your needs. The following plan off ers general guidelines for self -guided detoxification. Getting Started This regimen is not intended to be all things to all people. Nor is it a test of will and endurance. It is designed to be a safe, useful, empowering, health guide. You can change it as necessary to meet your own needs. However, this process does require planning and preparation, so read through it and make preparations ahead of time. In addition to physical approaches, this plan equally emphasizes mind -body approaches. These can he lp you relax and unravel negative and unconscious mental patterns that often result in pain and discomfort. (See our handout Mind/B ody Awareness Writing Exercises ). The most important part of going through a detox program is to first ask why you are doing it. Being clear about your intentions helps avoid disappointment and expectations that are too high. Write down your reasons for g oing through a detox program using language that is meaningful to you. The five basic ingredients of this detox regimen are self -reflection, exercise, sauna, nutrition, and manual -therapy. The program offered here is designed to support and enhance your ow n ability to heal and experience well -being. It is intended for most people, and you can do it on your own. However, first check with your primary care clinician to make certain this is a healthy option for you. We encourage you to use organic, sustainabl e, local, responsible, gentle, natural, whole, balanced, and easeful products and methods. These honor the global and spiritual aspect of health. Detoxification to Promote Health PATIENT HANDOUT 4 University of Wiscon sin Integrative Medicine www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative Precautions and Expectations Healing crises commonly occur during a detoxification regimen. Common and temporary symptoms of detoxification include feeling lousy, headache, lightheadedness, diarrhea, cramps, bloating, body aches, fatigue, mood changes, and weakness. These symptoms are due to a combination of factors including the how toxins in the body are affected, low blood sugar, low fluids, electrolyte imbalance, withdrawal from various substances (such as alcohol, caffeine, sugar, nicotine), and even changes in your daily routine. If you develop any of these symptoms, usually the best approach is to cont inue with the detox . However, you may need to stop or alter the detox if you experience ongoing distressing symptoms. Dehydration is common during a detox. Make sure that you drink a lot of fluids. Address your particular needs as you go along, such as mor e frequent snacks, larger meals, increasing protein and healthy fats, working less, resting more, and less striving for goals. In general, continued use of prescribed daily medications is recommended. Use other medications sparingly (for example pain medic ation taken as needed for headaches or other problems). Communicate with your health care provider , therapist, or other healing practitioners for any concerns that arise during the detox as needed. In the end , you will likely find that you feel better, ha ve more energy, and may require less medication.
