In June, he was named a 2014 Pew Scholar in the Biomedical Sciences. Six weeks later, Rangan received a $1.43 million grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Rangan, an RNA Institute affiliated faculty member whose research focuses on developmental genetics and biophysics, was one of 22 outstanding early-career researchers honored by The Pew Charitable Trusts. The award provides flexible funding to support some of the most pressing health problems in the world. The NIH grant supports Rangan's study of the ways stem cells control their differentiation. Understanding the biology of stem cells, said the researcher, \"can help with design of therapeutics for regenerative therapy\" related to cancer and degenerative diseases. Theatre Major Stages an Encore Here's an announcement sure to be met with applause: The University's theatre major returns this fall within the newly created Department of Music and Theatre. \"The re-established theatre major will provide an excellent curriculum that embraces performance, production, literature and history to give students a solid foundation for careers in the field, as well as continued study,\" said Dean of Arts and Sciences Elga Wulfert. \"I anticipate a bright future for both music and theatre.\" Svare Receives Fulbright Fulbright Senior Scholar Bruce Svare will spend the Fall 2014 semester assisting Thailand's higher-education system in developing a contemporary psychology program of study.

Liberty Terrace Earns LEED Gold Certification Liberty T errace, the apartment-style student-housing complex located near Indian Pond on the east side of UAlbany's uptown campus, boasts many energy-saving, environmentally friendly features, including a geo-thermal heating and air-conditioning system; energy-efficient windows and doors; green roofing; rain gardens; and permeable pavement. The 20,000-square-foot facility has now earned more bragging rights - as the first building at the University to be designated a LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) Gold facility. Granted by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), the LEED certification verifies that a \"green\" building incorporates environmental, social and economic benefits throughout its entire life cycle. Campus Center Expansion Begins Designed and constructed more than four decades ago to accommodate a student body of 10,000, the Campus Center remains a hub of activity for the 17,000 undergraduate and graduate students currently enrolled at the University. This summer, however, construction began on a $62.2 million expansion that will see new amenities - including a 400-seat auditorium, a two-level fitness center, and enhanced dining facilities that will house market-style food-service options - brought to the building. Completion of the 21,000-square-foot East addition is set for September 2015. The 55,000-square-foot West addition will be completed in late 2016, as will 46,000 square feet of renovated space within the existing Campus Center. Spring 2017 is the anticipated opening date for the renovation and the West addition. Mark Schmidt Mark Schmidt4 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2014Out and About By Christine A.

A Tribute to Coach Ford Photos: Bill Ziskin6 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2014 A Writer's Life Carol Olechowski William Nothdurft (Will North), B.A.'70www.albany.edu 7William Nothdurft - a.k.a. novelist Will North - has crafted a career almost as colorful as the settings of his books and the characters who inhabit them. Coupled with his University at Albany degree in English literature, Nothdurft's ability to adapt his writing style to both fiction and non-fiction has brought him acclaim in both genres. At SUNYA, as UAlbany was then known, he belonged to Myskania; served as vice president of his fraternity, Sigma T au Beta; and founded the literary magazine The Word. A member of the Class of 1969, Nothdurft lost a semester because of illness and graduated cum laude in 1970. He went on to earn an M.A. in journalism at Penn State but never worked in that field. \"The environmental movement was emerging, and I initially worked as a writer and analyst in environmental planning and management, a career that culminated in a senior political appointment in the Carter Administration,\" Nothdurft remembered. \"Promptly shown the door\" after the election of Ronald Reagan, he was approached by some Washington, D.C., think tanks \"to write books about various public-policy issues,\" he explained. \"Sounds dull, right? But my skills as a writer, thanks in part to SUNYA, were such that people loved reading my books, and decision-makers acted upon them.\" Nothdurft's career evolved again when then-Vice President Al Gore called to ask him to write a book on reinventing the federal government to make it more consumer oriented. \"Suddenly, I was a ghostwriter,\" said Nothdurft. \"After I finished Common Sense Government (Random House) for the vice president, President Bill Clinton called. (No, I am not making this up.) In three months, we completed Between Hope and History (Times Books), a book about the president's vision for the country's future at the turn of the millennium. \"But at some point,\" he continued, \"I began to believe that my work on these subjects, while successful, wasn't really making a significant difference to real people in need. So I just walked away from that career.\" Nothdurft relocated to Washington State, where the editor-in-chief of Seattle-based Mountaineers Books approached him. \"A team of climbers had set off to find out what had happened to the first Everest explorer, the Englishman George Mallory, who disappeared in 1924 after being last seen tantalizingly close to the summit, decades before Sir Edmund Hillary. Astonishingly, the team found Mallory, frozen solid, on the Tibetan side of the peak. Ghosts of Everest, the book I wrote for the team, was an international sensation and won awards in the United Kingdom and Italy. Publishers Weekly called it 'a book of historic importance that reads like a detective thriller.' The 'ghost' who wrote Ghosts then went on to write books for a team of dinosaur hunters, a famous heart doctor, a 'green-living' proponent, and others.\" Later, Nothdurft turned from non-fiction to fiction, completing his first novel, The Long Walk Home, in 90 days. \"T wo weeks later, there was a bidding war for the book between three major New York publishers. My agent said it was virtually unheard of, for a debut novelist,\" noted the author, who writes \"using the friendlier name 'Will North.' I've been writing fiction ever since.\" North's subsequent novels, Water, Stone, Heart and Seasons' End, have also garnered acclaim. Switching genres again, he published the first in his \"Davies & West\" British mystery series, Harm None, this past summer. The second book in that series, T oo Clever By Half, will be published later this fall. At the September 1995 White House launch of Common Sense Government, Will North, left, talks with then-Vice President Al Gore, right, who asked him to ghostwrite the book.

And they're all University at Albany alumni and students!

As the founder of Professional Internships for Networking and Connections (PINC), Miranda has developed a life-shaping experience for women aged 18 and over. The program, which just hosted its first five participants this summer, involves spending eight weeks in Madrid in a combination of internship placement and cultural immersion. Participants gain valuable work experience at a variety of companies and take important steps outside their comfort zones. \"You have to be ambitious and adventurous to do a program like this,\" explained Miranda. \"But we provide a safe, structured way to have this experience.\" \"Ambitious\" and \"adventurous\" are also good words to describe Miranda. After a few years of working in marketing in Manhattan, the 2006 UAlbany graduate moved to Madrid, where she became certified as an English teacher. She then worked her way into top marketing positions at two educational companies. Inspired by a strong female mentor, she decided to pursue her vision for PINC ... basing it in a country she had grown to love. \"Madrid is my second home,\" said the 30-year-old New York City native. Miranda ultimately hopes that PINC will evolve into a community of \"alumni\" - women who have this unique, shared experience and serious ambition. \"We're looking to empower future female leaders,\" said Miranda.

They are also standouts in Great Danes athletics: In May, the attackmen became the first joint winners of the Tewaaraton Award, lacrosse's version of the Heisman Trophy, and the first Native Americans to earn the honor. (\"Tewaaraton\" is the Mohawk name for the sport.) The siblings had a spectacular 2014. With cousin Ty Thompson, they led UAlbany to a second consecutive America East championship and first-round victory in the NCAA Tournament over top-ranked Loyola. Twenty-one-year- old Lyle, the only player in Division I history to claim two 100-point seasons, was one of five finalists for ESPN's Best Male College Athlete (ESPY) Award. Miles, 23, finished the season with 82 goals in 18 games, matching the all-time Division I record for goals in a season set in 1990 by Yale's Jon Reese. In the 2014 Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL) World Championships, Lyle and Miles spurred the Iroquois Nationals to their first medal, a bronze, with a 16-5 victory over Australia. - Carol Olechowski www.albany.edu 9 Prescott, Esq., B.A.'08 THE IMPORTANCE OF LEVERAGE When former English major Amanda N. Prescott decided to attend law school, she found her University at Albany degree a great asset. \"The core of being a successful attorney is the ability to be an excellent and efficient writer,\" says Prescott, who minored in women's studies and criminal justice. \"All law-school exams are essays; therefore, I was able to leverage my writing skills to excel on my final examinations and become a member of the Law Review [at the City University of New York School of Law, Queens College]. All of my English courses at UAlbany assisted me in being the skilled writer I am today. Because of my English degree, I'm also able to articulate proficiently and clearly in court while advocating for my clients. \"Moreover, attending the University at Albany has been a tremendous boost to my legal career,\" added Prescott, a 27-year-old associate attorney with Malapero & Prisco LLP . \"I interned at the New York State Assembly for a semester, and it was through those connections and experiences that I was able to obtain internships and clerkships with New York Supreme Court and U.S. District Court judges while in law school.\" Prescott practices insurance-defense law in all five New York City boroughs. \"I represent several insurance companies in various civil lawsuits ranging from slip-and-falls to labor-law disputes. I negotiate settlements on behalf of the companies; if no settlement can be reached, I handle all discovery and court appearances until trial,\" she said.

I realized quickly that nursing was the right profession for me.\" In fact, Freeman went on to graduate from New York's Phillips Beth Israel School of Nursing (PBISN). Hired at Beth Israel Medical Center, he won its 2011 Novice Nurse Award. Freeman used the award money to create Nurse Net, a free, interactive application that allows users to access information ranging from nursing and medical abbreviations to news. \"Once I had the concept, I worked with a friend with app-development experience. It took about 12 weeks to get the app operational and approved by Apple. Nurse Net works on any Apple iOS device (iPhone or iPad). There's no special equipment needed, and it can be downloaded from the Apple store like any other app,\" Freeman explained. By May 2014, Nurse Net had been downloaded more than 200,000 times. Freeman received an M.S. in nursing from Excelsior College in Albany, a distance- learning program, in 2013. He remains at what is now Mount Sinai Beth Israel as a clinical nurse specialist - medical surgical quality, \"a leadership position with a focus on patient safety.\" The Brooklyn resident also participates in the Google Glass Explorers program, consulting regularly with other healthcare professionals \"to pilot ways we can use the technology to improve patient outcomes.\" The courses he took at UAlbany \"laid a great foundation for my nursing and pharmacology classes,\" added Freeman, 30, who won an athletics scholarship and competed on the University's cross country and indoor and outdoor track teams. \"Being an athlete and part of an incredible team that won numerous conference titles showed me that we can achieve great things together. In the hospital setting, we also depend on the performance of the entire team; teamwork and communication are key. The stakes are higher. A win for us is delivering excellent patient- and family- centered care each day.\"8Age: 30 Major: human biology Minor: Spanish Employer: Suffolk Obstetrics and Gynecology Title: OB/GYN Location: Port Jefferson, N.Y.

Sneed has a unique job title: social entrepreneur. \"A social entrepreneur pursues innovative solutions to the pressing social challenges of our time, such as poverty, environmental sustainability, educational inequity, by leveraging enterprise,\" explained Sneed, 29. \"The concept was coined in 1994 and rooted in a corporate- sustainability framework. Most social entrepreneurs focus on the triple bottom line: people, planet, profit. We want to combine the best of the traditional non-profit sector with the business acumen of the corporate sector.\" After completing her studies in sociology at UAlbany, Sneed \"spent the first ten years of my career as a strategist and business-development specialist. I've worked with several non-profits and have raised more than $15 million for marginalized communities.\" Sneed shares her professional expertise with others through Advice For A Brilliant Life (www.adviceforabrilliantlife.com), created as a Times Union blog in 2006 when she recognized that there was no online advice for young professionals wanting to \"move forward in our careers and our lives.\" Nearly eight years later, \"my writing and my audience have both evolved,\" she observed. \"The goal of ABL is to provide socially conscious executives and entrepreneurs tools to do good, be well and make money,\" added Sneed. Her average reader is \"a 30-to-45-year-old professional who likely works in the corporate sector, but is dedicated to a cause and looking for information about how to live in a more sustainable way, lead authentically, or fund a social venture as a founder or board member.\" ABL also affords its editor-in-chief \"a place to post the content I write about social innovation, leadership and philanthropy for various websites, such as CNN, The Huffington Post, Cosmopolitan Latina and Stanford Social Innovation Review.\" In the past year, \"I've upgraded the site and have started to bring in additional writers,\" she noted. At 16, Sneed enrolled at UAlbany, envisioning a transfer to Cornell University and a career in orthopedic surgery. \"However, at UAlbany, I found a home where I was able to develop a great social network; I was active on campus and enjoyed intellectual freedom. Through the women's-studies department, I was introduced to Holding Our Own [HOO], a local women's foundation. I later became a member of its board, continuing in that role until I moved to New York City in 2009. The time I spent with HOO and my socially conscious peers organizing for women's rights on campus absolutely influenced who I have become and truly laid the groundwork for my continued evolution.\" SIMONE N.

His responsibilities include managing the day-to-day operations of the mayor's office and collaborating with an array of civic and community leaders. Peter also takes an active role in developing and implementing policy. Last fall, Peter served as campaign manager for Sheehan, Albany's first- ever female mayor, and he helped her win the general election on a platform of progressive change. In Sheehan's first year in office, they have already begun work on sustainability and \"walkability\" initiatives that will enhance quality of life for the city's 98,000 residents. \"I get energized by good policy,\" explained Peter. \"It's very gratifying to make a difference.\" The magna cum laude graduate says that his UAlbany education has served him well in his career - especially his study-abroad experience and internship opportunities in state government. It also helped him find his home. www.albany.edu 13Four months after graduating from the University at Albany with a degree in public administration and policy, Joe Bonilla was not only employed. He was self-employed. Bonilla, with friend and fellow alumnus Rich Fazio, founded Relentless Awareness, a public-relations and advertising firm, in January 2012. As its name suggests, Relentless Awareness provides \"non-stop outreach through public relations and digital outreach solutions to a variety of clients,\" noted Bonilla, 28. \"We rely on aggressive tactics for getting the word out about their products, services, establishments or candidacies.\" Clients include Albany Mayor Kathy Sheehan; Bow Tie Cinemas; the Washington Avenue Armory; Mingle Restaurants; Nine Pin Cider; and the Albany Distilling Company. UAlbany prepared Bonilla well for the venture. His experiences working with Albany Student Television (ATV) and serving as Student Association programming director, \"tied in with such key classes as Public Relations Writing with Mark Marchand and Bureaucratic Politics with Michael Christakis, were critical in developing the necessary skills for public relations and business,\" he recalled. \"I'll add that I practically grew up on campus: My mother, Adrienne Bonilla, works for the University as assistant vice president for Research.\" \"A class called Sociology of Media opened my mind to what the everyday American was being shown in the newspapers, on television and on the radio,\" said Fazio, 31. \"I felt a need to tell a different side of what the mainstream media were showing and was able to, years later, with Joe's help. \"Joe and I began working on projects that Capital Region residents would enjoy; we started the Knickerbocker Film Festival and other events, which eventually allowed us to form Relentless Awareness. I had the freedom to move anywhere to conduct business, so I decided to move to South Carolina.\" Thus far, Myrtle Beach and Greenville, S.C., \"are our main focus in the Southeast,\" added Fazio, who majored in sociology and minored in English at UAlbany. \"We have plans to expand to Atlanta; Charlotte and Asheville, N.C.; and Florida.\" Most Relentless Awareness interns, and some employees, \"also come from the University,\" said Bonilla. \"It's an incredibly unifying factor to have had such shared college experiences within the same office, and even with our clients.

Without strong support from the athletics and math departments, the School of Business and many mentors, I do not think I would be where I am today.\" Fund today is at Goldman Sachs in New Jersey. Hired as an analyst in July 2005, shortly after earning a degree in mathematics, she has since held \"a variety of roles\" with the firm. Currently, as manager of a Global Strategy and Change Management team in the Securities Operations Control & Quality Management Group, Fund oversees \"global projects to help the organization optimize controls, create efficiency and enhance service levels.\" The work affords her opportunities for extensive travel: Recent business has taken her primarily to Salt Lake City, \"where we have a large presence.\" Fund helps Goldman Sachs recruit for Operations at various campuses and serves as a mentoring champion. She is also involved with the company's various diversity-affinity networks. Outside of Goldman Sachs, Fund volunteers with the Global Circle Steering Committee of the non-profit American Jewish World Service, a group of young professionals that supports AJWS' efforts \"to alleviate poverty, hunger and disease among the most marginalized people and communities in the developing world.\" The organization also advocates for \"gender equality, global hunger relief, global health initiatives and basic human rights.\" Fund's philanthropic interests extend to the University. The GOLD (Graduates of the Last Decade) alumna and former captain of the women's tennis team has spoken at math graduation and various open houses, \"sharing what UAlbany offers and what a great education I received.\" She also responded to an Alumni Association challenge to encourage leadership gifts from young alumni by endowing a scholarship fund. The award will support a female student intending to follow academic and career paths similar to Fund's. \"Having the Alumni Association match half of the endowment minimum is a fantastic way to encourage and enable younger alumni to start an endowment,\" observes Fund. \"Each year, I try to give a donation to UAlbany, and I thought that [the scholarship] would be a great way to confirm my commitment to the University and be able to impact a student's career. I am looking forward to congratulating the first scholarship recipient in the next few years and following her successes, along with those of future recipients!\" 13Under 30 Thirty Lisa Fund, B.S.'05 A Firm Commitment to UAlbany 14 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2014By Carol Olechowski 12 Daniel Morales- Armstrong, Majors: criminal justice and psychologyAdvanced degree: Ed.M.'11, prevention science and practice, Harvard Graduate School of Education Employer: The Bronx Institute at Lehman College-CUNY Title: assistant director - ENLACE Program Location: Bronx, N.Y.

The \"Greenwich Village feel of Lark Street and the surrounding Center Square neighborhood\" convinced Owens, a freelance graphic designer and illustrator, that \"a concept like ours would do well\" there. \"We capitalize on passersby and on Art on Lark, LarkFEST and other events. We encourage other artists to bring in their supplies and paint with us for our Mid-Month Live Painting events, or at least communicate with us.\" For graphic designer and DJ DeBellis, Machine activity ranges from \"screen printing, custom tailoring and sewing, and music\" to \"video shooting and editing.\" Like everyone else involved, he plans, organizes and promotes \"different events, artists, and projects\" at the co-op. Public events at The Machine include \"music, live-art demonstrations, installations and a farmers' market,\" explains DeBellis. \"We all work on different projects throughout the studio and invite the public to do the same. It's a chain reaction of art.\" According to Lora, the Machine's \"First Friday\" series has \"cultivated a fan base\" for the co-op. \"We display new works and invite the public to jam with us, musically and in studio art. I hope The Machine will always be a creative space that inspires us to exit the norm, open our minds to new ideas and exercise our creativity,\" adds Lora. Mic DeBellis, B.A.'13; Dana S.

Media personality. And that's all within two years of graduation. \"I've been so busy for so long that I couldn't imagine life simpler,\" noted the multi-faceted Jacques Bastien. Born in Haiti, Bastien has been an entrepreneur since his high-school days in Brooklyn, when he created and sold music beats for aspiring artists. He continues to channel that energy in numerous directions. These days, the 24-year-old Bastien is largely focused on running his Albany-based social media and interactive-marketing agency, Boogie. He started the company in his dorm room while a sophomore at UAlbany, and the venture has evolved and grown since then. Bastien credits UAlbany for providing him a strong foundation for his business success, and he maintains strong ties to the University. He currently teaches an interactive design course as an adjunct professor, and Boogie employs several UAlbany graduates (including his wife, Dahcia, a fellow 2012 graduate). Perhaps the most important skill Bastien learned at UAlbany was his ability to maximize his time. \"I've learned to operate effectively with four to five hours of sleep,\" said Bastien. \"It's difficult to imagine myself not having so much to do.\" By Jim Sciancalepore, M.A.'93 17, 18, 19 From S.

Casey Wittchen published her first book in January. And the 21-year-old UAlbany junior has several more \"in the works.\" Wittchen was in high school when she wrote Behind Locked Doors over the course of about six months; the edit took two years. She is already working on Within Silent Graves, the next installment in her planned Devils Grace series. Set in Santa Monica, Calif., Behind Locked Doors is a young- adult/urban-fantasy novel. It follows 17-year-old Tempest Laurier as the search for her birth father plunges her into a world of faeries and demons, adventures and secrets. The investigation into her past \"sets her on a crumbling road of physical and psychological pain, along with loss as relationships are tried and truths are discovered,\" notes the Amazon.com book description. The cover was illustrated by family friend and artist John Hebert, who based the drawing of Tempest on Wittchen - fitting, considering that the protagonist seems to draw from her creator's personality. Wittchen observed: \"A lot of people said that when they read Tempest, she's just like me. So maybe Tempest, to a certain extent, draws from my own experiences.\" Behind Locked Doors is the Mechanicville, N.Y., resident's first full novel. She published it herself using Amazon CreateSpace. It's available in both e-book and print formats. A second edition of Behind Locked Doors, released in June, \"is slightly different from the [original] version,\" Wittchen noted. \"I also signed a contract to have my book made into an audio book. It will be narrated by Todd Haberkorn, an incredible voiceover actor and a huge inspiration to me.\" Wittchen, a writer since age 4, is an English major at UAlbany. She minors in Japanese, history, business and anthropology. In May, Wittchen completed the first book in another series; Forgive Me For I Have Sinned is slated for publication this fall. She is currently writing Haven's Wake, which begins a third series. Follow Wittchen on Twitter @NaturallyCasey or visit her website, www.cawittchen.com. Elizabeth Q. Gray, B.A.'08.

Gray raised funds to establish a school in rural Ecuador for children of the indigenous Wishi community. \"The kids are advancing steadily, and we have partnered with several organizations to support ongoing initiatives, including further additions to the school building; the development of traditional-dance and soccer programs; and the introduction of storytelling, acting and writing workshops.\" Co-founder and president, Board of Trustees, Castle Island Bilingual Montessori, \"a not-for-profit school in the urban core of Albany.\" The school, which serves Capital Region youngsters ages 3 to 6, \"strives to meet the needs of its students through an accessible and innovative early-education model designed to foster a love of learning, independence, innovation, and academic excellence in children from diverse backgrounds and learning needs.\" Gray's UAlbany experience provided her \"the confidence and skills to undertake larger projects after graduation. I had the opportunity to take on initiatives I felt were important and to realize them in a supportive environment.\" Casey Wittchen ~ A Passion for Writing By Kyle Adams 20 Kyle Adams/Mechanicville Mile 2118 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2014Since the 1960s, Detroit has struggled with economic woes, population loss, surplus housing stock, curtailed municipal services and a host of other issues. But self-described \"urban mechanic and futurist\" Jason Zogg sees his adopted hometown as a place where \"everyone matters,\" and he's eager to revitalize the city. \"A desire to do something I felt had a greater impact on the world\" led the Delmar, N.Y., native to Michigan in 2012. One of 30 participants selected for the inaugural Challenge Detroit Fellowship, he worked four days a week for DTE Energy, a corporate sponsor of the program. Each Friday for a year, Zogg and the other Fellows met to address childhood obesity, food deserts and other challenges affecting the community. Many of the recommendations \"have already been implemented in one form or another,\" he says. Zogg, who enrolled at UAlbany as a Presidential Scholar, was drawn to urban planning \"as soon as I took my first course with John Pipkin in 2003.\" The class \"changed my life. Suddenly, I was looking at the world in a completely different way,\" says the former urban-planning/political science major, who minored in business. After three semesters of additional study, Zogg earned a master's in regional planning with a focus on transportation. He relocated to Boston to work for consulting firm VHB Inc. There, he became a LEED AP [Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design Accredited Professional] and added to his knowledge of electric-vehicle, airport, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure. Today, as urban planner & strategy analyst at DTE Energy, Zogg is involved with Energize Detroit, a company program seeking \"to stabilize, improve and transform the 15-plus downtown blocks immediately surrounding the corporate headquarters. Thirty percent of the land is vacant, with very few residential, retail or entertainment venues.\" Zogg notes: \"The position draws on everything I learned at UAlbany. I frequently reference books I used all the way back in The American City with John Pipkin, Energy & Resources with John Delano, or Bike & Pedestrian Planning with Jeff Olson. UAlbany really set my foundation for a truly broad, holistic understanding of urban planning and the key challenges facing 21st-century cities. \"The multidisciplinary nature of the profession gives us an extraordinary awareness of the complexities and interdependencies involved in creating truly livable places of lasting value that are loved,\" he adds. \"Urban planners create places that are vibrant, economically viable, environmentally responsible, healthy and safe.\" Under 30 Thirty Jason Zogg, B.A.'07, M.R.P.'08 22REVITALIZING DETROIT By Carol Olechowskiwww.albany.edu 19\"We see an entire generation that is up for grabs ... young people who have been overlooked or underestimated by most media outlets,\" explained James Allen. \"They consume content through new channels: social and mobile. And they happen to be the largest generation in American history.\" Allen was describing the concept behind Mic.com, a new media outlet for which he is the vice president of Communications and Strategy. Allen and his co-workers have an ambitious goal: to be the most trusted and relevant news source for millennials. Mic is certainly off to a good start: Its audience has grown by more than 750 percent since early 2013. It currently reaches more than 19 million monthly readers, an estimated two-thirds of them under age 35. As \"keeper of the Mic brand,\" Allen oversees brand strategy and media relations - and serves as Mic's liaison in Washington, D.C., and other industry communities. Allen, 28, is no stranger to politics. While a sophomore at UAlbany, he served as an intern to former U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton. Allen later worked as campaign manager for U.S. Rep. John Carney's successful congressional campaign, and he was director of Communications for Newark [N.J.] Mayor (now senator) Cory Booker. \"All of these roles gave me a deep understanding of politics and journalism,\" said Allen. \"For me, Mic is the best of both worlds: I get my political fix, and I'm diving into the digital-media industry at a very exciting time.\"James Allen, B.A. '07 A NEW VOICE 24By Jim Sciancalepore, M.A.'93 James Allen works with U.S. Sen. Cory Booker.Eric Fisher, chief meteorologist at WBZ-TV, the CBS affiliate in Boston, had a unique childhood, to say the least. \"I was that kid sitting out on the porch with Mom yelling at me to get inside during thunderstorms. I would watch endless hours of The Weather Channel, get pumped up for big snowstorms, and even had a backyard weather station where I kept observations in a notebook. So you could say the path was laid out. I knew I wanted to work in weather,\" recalls Fisher, 30. As a high-school student in South Windsor, Conn., he \"took all the science classes possible.\" When it was time for college, \"I looked solely at schools with meteorology programs, and the University at Albany seemed the best fit.\" UAlbany's atmospheric-science program, Fisher points out, \"is for those who are really into the weather - true 'weather geeks,' as many of us proudly call ourselves! It's not just a program to breeze through and get on TV, and for that I'm grateful. Professors [Lance] Bosart, [Mike] Landin and [Chris] Thorncroft, to name a few, were all excellent, laying down the fundamentals of what we'd expect out in the job market. And even though there was not a broadcasting program in place, everyone in the department made us comfortable in our love for the weather so we could fully embrace and enjoy our work - the key to success in any job.\" Fisher returned to his native Massachusetts after graduation to work at WGGB in Springfield. Four years later, \"my strong background in meteorology helped to get me a job at The Weather Channel, which is pretty much the mother ship for hard-core weather fans.\" WBZ has been home base for Fisher 2013.By Eric Fisher, the American Dream as \"the never-ending pursuit of reaching your goals and enjoying every minute of your life. Both are easier said than done.\" Still, he and Melissa, married since August 2013, are giving the effort their all. The founders of Cape Crabbers, which Melissa describes as \"a nautically inspired lifestyle brand,\" are \"having fun creating a product that people are excited to wear\" while \"making it a point not to take our brand too seriously.\" Ironically, the couple brainstormed the line of T-shirts, hats and other beachwear on a raw winter day in 2009. \"The whole idea was to work toward living on the Cape one day,\" recalls Melissa, who spent childhood summers with her family on Cape Cod. \"I was doodling on a napkin and drew Petey the Crab [the firm's first logo], and Zane came up with the name 'Cape Crabbers.' After a while, we rebranded the company with our signature CC anchor logo.\" The 27-year-olds \"work only with domestic manufacturers,\" Zane says. To launch the business, \"we learned to sew, screen print and finish many of our products in-house.\" In 2012, they lived briefly on Cape Cod, \"spreading the word about our quality made-in-U.S.A. apparel,\" notes Melissa. Now back in the Albany area, the Krumanockers conduct most company business online (www.capecrabbers.com). Growing up in Troy, N.Y., the pair exemplified the entrepreneurial spirit. \"Melissa opened a lemonade stand annually on the side of the road by her grandparents' pool,\" remembers Zane, a formerly self-employed landscaper and DJ. He earned a degree in business administration; \"I felt the program would be a great jumping-off point for whatever path I wanted to take,\" Zane comments. Initially a seasonal enterprise, Cape Crabbers now operates year-round, reports Melissa, who studied communication and psychology at UAlbany. \"Two summers ago, about 80 percent of our sales were made on Cape Cod, or online to people in and around the area. Today, we have sales in every single state across the country. It's really kind of crazy!\" \"Business has steadily grown,\" Zane adds, \"and for that we are incredibly thankful. When we started, we would make lists of friends and family we thought would be willing to support the brand. It was silly, but it helped us realize the importance of recognizing your target market.\" Under 30 Thirty \"My work is my passion,\" explained Jordan Edelson. Whether you're a fan of the NBA, Lady Gaga, beer, perfume or a growing range of games, you may have held his work in the palm of your hand. Edelson is the CEO and founder of Appetizer Mobile, a mobile-application development, consulting and marketing company. The Manhattan-based business was formed in 2009, and Edelson and his team have already scored numerous wins. From developing top-selling educational apps for Montessorium - which were featured in two Apple iPad TV commercials - to creating an experiential app for Lady Gaga's Little Monsters tour and digital bobblehead versions of top NBA stars, Appetizer continues to expand its portfolio. Edelson noted that the company is now emphasizing the development of its own intellectual property and has instituted an in-house design lab to drive innovative ideas. \"I love being creative and never feeling boxed in,\" explained Edelson, 29. \"It's very inspiring.\" Long before he arrived at UAlbany, Edelson was taking technology in new directions; his innovations included a digital-streaming channel for video games, formed when he was just 17. Edelson noted that the University gave him a \"perfect foundation\" of communication and business skills - a foundation that helps to fuel his passion today.Jordan Edelson, B.A. '07 Upwardly Mobile By Jim Sciancalepore, M.A.'93 20 UAlbany 2014www.albany.edu 21As a business administration major in UAlbany's Financial Analyst Honors Program, Alfieri worked hard to attain that dream. With friends Vincent Cisternino, B.S.'08, and Michael Reynolds, B.S.'08, he founded the University at Albany School of Business Investment Group (UASBIG) to \"afford students the opportunity to apply what they learn in the classroom in a real-world portfolio-management setting.\" A summer analyst with Citi in 2006 and with Goldman Sachs in 2007, Alfieri joined the latter as a full-time analyst after graduation. His expertise now also includes \"advising corporates in such areas as initial public offerings (IPOs), other forms of equity financings and general corporate finance matters.\" Today, \"I work on Goldman's Principal Strategic Investments team, which manages a portfolio of private-equity positions with roughly $1 billion invested across about 60 companies,\" says Alfieri, 27. A board member for one of the portfolio companies, he also assumes director-level roles for other investments. \"Goldman's culture is very team oriented and driven. People know one another at all levels,\" Alfieri notes. University connections have promoted his career aims. David Smith, Hany Shawky and Rita Biswas were among the professors \"helpful in shaping my learning experience.\" Alfieri is grateful to \"alumni like Michael Borys [B.S.'78, M.B.A.'79] and Dan Byrne [B.S.'93, M.B.A.'96], who came through the doors of GS before me and helped make recruiting from UAlbany possible.\" His mentors include Goldman Sachs managing directors Dean Backer, B.S.'88, and Stacy Bash-Polley, B.S.'89; Wellington Management Co. Partner Michael Carmen, B.S.'84; and GoldenTree Asset Management President Robert Matza, B.S.'77. When Alfieri was seeking new challenges at the company's New York office in 2011, advisers rightly predicted that a new opportunity would arise when the economy emerged from its slump. He left for London shortly thereafter. Alfieri is now following his mentors' example: \"I've helped some younger alumni get interviews with Goldman Sachs, or been part of the interview process. I also try to stay connected with the school through my participation on the UASBIG Associate Advisory Board.\" By Carol Olechowski Matthew Alfieri, B.S.'08 ALLEGIANCE TO UALBANY 27 Matthew Alfieri is living a dream: working in London as vice president on the Principal Strategic Investments team at Goldman Sachs. \"I almost don't believe it's real. It's like an extended holiday,\" he observes.22 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2014By Carol Olechowski Dumbstruck, the application Mike Tanski and Peter Allegretti created last year, also aptly describes the UAlbany doctoral students' reaction to the popularity the app has achieved in a short time. \"The idea of sending a funny photo or video to a friend, or posting something on social media, really boils down to one main concept: to get a reaction,\" observed Tanski, 24. \"We figured if there was a fast and easy way to capture those reactions, people would really engage with the content. Turns out we were right!\" The Dumbstruck user \"enhances a video or photo with creative tools, such as stickers and memes, then sends it to friends. When the image is opened, the app records the viewer's reaction and forwards it to the sender. The message and the reaction are fused into one new piece of content that can be shared to Facebook, Twitter and other social media,\" Tanski explained. Tanski and Allegretti, Siena College graduates, met at UAlbany, where they are enrolled in the doctoral program in informatics. They started Doctored Apps \"as a mobile app-idea lab,\" launching \"the best ideas we had\" as tech companies. \"One of those ideas, Dumbstruck, is now its own company, with about 20 employees working in various capacities.\" Dumbstruck is \"a powerful idea,\" added Tanski. \"Historically, entertainers saw their audiences react. But radio, film and television separated entertainer and audience. Dumbstruck brings the audience back into the room. A few actors from the cast of 'Glee' shared just four reactions to their social media, and those reactions gained more than 126 days of viewing time. The engagement metrics for Dumbstruck are much higher, on average, than anything else these celebrities have ever posted to Twitter, Facebook or Instagram.\" Naming the app took a while. \"Peter really liked 'Dumbstruck,' but everyone else wanted a name that related more to reactions and videos. Finally, we put all of our suggestions into a hat, and Dumbstruck was the name we pulled out, so we went with it. Everyone loves the name; it's very catchy. We used Peter's hat, though - so I'm pretty convinced [the drawing] was rigged!\" Tanski joked. The Dumbstruck team has \"had multiple offers to move to California and New York City, but the resources in Albany are just as good as those elsewhere. Everyone at UAlbany was incredibly supportive, willing to help any way they could to get us off the ground. To do our part, we created internships that allow students to work and learn from some of the best talent in the area, and we have hired past interns to work with us full time. Others have taken the experience and connections they made during their time with us and gone on to get great jobs at top companies in the tech industry.\" Under 30 Thirty 28ABSOLUTELY DUMBSTRUCKMike Tanski Allegretti, left, and Mike Tanski, right, created the Dumbstruck app. Colleen Piccolinowww.albany.edu 23 Age: 30 Major: criminal justice degree: Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, LLP Title: associate in the Litigation & Arbitration Group Location: New York, N.Y. UAlbany, Laroche says, \"prepared me well for law school and the legal profession. I was lucky to have the opportunity to study under a number of professors who had also practiced law. One in particular, James Acker, became my mentor. Professor Acker was very influential in my career path, and I still consider him a source of guidance and support to this day.\" Adds Laroche: \"The University offers countless opportunities, and I took advantage of many of them. Two stand out. I played Division I-AA football for Coach Bob Ford. Playing for him was an honor, and many of the players on the team remain some of my closest friends to this day. I also participated in UAlbany's moot-court program under Professor Acker; our team was very successful, winning a regional tournament and reaching the semi-finals of a national competition. That experience ultimately shaped my decision to pursue a law degree.\" 30If the folks at Google will pardon the pun, Stacey Gammon is truly an embodiment of the phrase \"Google Plus.\" Gammon, who simultaneously earned her B.S. and M.S. in computer science in four years at UAlbany, is currently a senior software engineer for the Internet giant's AdWords Editor Team. Her team is responsible for providing solutions to help large advertisers manage their immensely complex \"adword\" accounts. But she also has another passion: pet photography. Gammon, 30, has photographed a veritable zoo of animals for a range of customers, from animal shelters and rescue organizations to private pet owners. It started a few years ago when she volunteered to take shots of a rescue dog to help the four-legged friend find a home. And Gammon was hooked. \"I absolutely love doing pet photography,\" explained Gammon. \"I love that I'm able to use my creativity and - most importantly - I get to help shelters and other organizations that do such important work.\" Gammon is grateful that Google's corporate culture not only allows but truly encourages employees to pursue their passions outside work. \"Google is super supportive of outside pursuits, especially activities that are creative or community-oriented,\" she said. \"They know that happy people are better employees.\" Stacey Gammon, B.S./M.S. '06 PET B.A.'05, M.A.'07Rob Spring OlechowskiSTEVE COX, B.A.'81 Accidental Entrepreneurwww.albany.edu 25Pull up the website for Adirondack Distilling Company, and you'll see what looks like the setup for a joke: \"A doctor, a lawyer and a political consultant walk into a bar ...\" But it's actually the story of how Adirondack Distilling got its start, says co-founder Steve Cox. \"I'm the lawyer,\" acknowledges the Oneida County, N.Y., assistant district attorney. \"I met Jordan Karp when he managed the 1996 Congressional campaign of my then-boss, Michael Arcuri, B.A.'81. One day, when Jordan was really fed up with D.C., he texted me, 'Potato vodka - let's make it.'\" Karp and Cox \"visited distilleries around New York, watched YouT ube videos and took a distilling course at Cornell University.\" They drafted a business plan with assistance from the SUNY IT Small Business Development Center, which serves five Mohawk Valley counties, and recruited third partner Bruce Elwell, D.O., Cox's longtime friend. The partners' decision to hand- craft potables from local ingredients \"made good economic sense and a much more compelling story to market the products\" in the immediate area, observes Cox. \"We found strong demand for artisan, local, quality products that aren't about to knock Grey Goose off the shelf but have developed a growing, loyal following.\" Adirondack Distilling's vodka; gin; and 1,000 Stills White Whisky, d\u00e9buted last February, are also gluten free. With gluten tolerance \"a larger issue overall,\" Cox notes, \"it was a convenient by-product of our choice to use 100-percent corn as our mashing grain that it was gluten free. We now have what we believe to be the only gluten-free gin in New York; this year, we rolled out bourbon whisky that is also gluten free.\"Currently marketed in California, Connecticut and New York, Adirondack Distilling products \"should be in four to five more states very soon. We have already made inroads with distribution channels in Europe and in China. China is the easier market to break into; American craft whiskies are all the rage there,\" explains Cox. Since its founding in 2011, Adirondack Distilling has \"won and placed well in several major competitions,\" he adds. \"The SIP Awards in Las Vegas are judged by actual consumers - a notoriously difficult group to win over - and our vodka won platinum, the top award available. We won double-gold in the New York State Fair Wine & Spirits Competition and took a bronze at the San Francisco International Spirits Competition. Our bottle and packaging even won a gold in that same category.\" The distillery's workforce includes the partners, their wives, a full-time employee and several part-time staff. There are plans for expansion; \"our building was designed to house a second still, which would about double our capacity and will likely be added in 2015. We will add personnel as we go.\" As a political-science major at UAlbany, Cox minored in journalism, studying with \"the great Bill Kennedy and Bill Rowley.\" He applied for admission to the School of Business but \"didn't get in.\" Still, Cox \"greatly enjoyed\" his University experience. \"I was later a newspaper reporter for a while, and I continue to write every day,\" says the 1996 University at Buffalo Law School graduate. A self-described \"accidental entrepreneur,\" Cox believes that \"no idea is too far out there to become the foundation of a sound business plan. If you are not a business person already, there are plenty of resources to guide you.\" Bruce Elwell, D.O.; Steve Cox, B.A.'81; and Jordan Karp co-founded Adirondack Distilling in Utica, N.Y.26 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2014 RIGHT Greg Gattuso wanted back in. Somehow, some way, he had to have the responsibility of being a head coach again. He yearned to be in charge of a program, running a team his way. His style. His rules. His attitude. His team.By Jeff Gold \"THE GUY \" Mark Schmidtwww.albany.edu 27But if not for the lucky timing of reconnecting with an old friend, Bob Benson, now UAlbany's defensive coordinator, the opportunity never would have come. \"Honestly, I had no idea the [UAlbany head coach's] job was even open. But the moment I found out, I was intrigued. This was what I was looking for,\" Gattuso said. Gattuso put together an application immediately, becoming a candidate just before the deadline. And his timing could not have been better. Not only did he want UAlbany; the University wanted him. On Dec. 9, 2013, Gattuso was named UAlbany's football coach, becoming just the second man to hold the position. Bob Ford, who was in charge for 44 years, led the Great Danes to 256 wins. \"Bob Ford has done an incredible job at Albany, taking it from a club team, through the ranks and now into what I believe is one of the top conferences in the country,\" Gattuso said. \"He made this a great opportunity for me and my staff, and I want him to remain involved in the program in whatever capacity he'd like.\" Gattuso, 52, comes to UAlbany from the University of Maryland, where he spent the past three seasons as the defensive line coach and the previous two as the assistant head coach. Prior to Maryland, he spent six seasons at the University of Pittsburgh, primarily coaching the defensive line, and 12 seasons as the head coach at Duquesne University, leading the Dukes to a phenomenal 97-32 record, including eight conference titles. Before getting involved in coaching, Gattuso had an outstanding career as a player. He was a star in high school at Seton-LaSalle in Pittsburgh and then at Penn State, where he was a defensive lineman on the 1982 national championship team. Gattuso has coached on both sides of the ball throughout his career, and said he believed in a vertical offense and an aggressive defense. However, the task at UAlbany will be a challenge: Last season, in their Colonial Athletic Association d\u00e9but, the Great Danes went 1-11 overall and 0-8 in the conference. The move from the Northeast Conference to the CAA is a steep one, both in terms of talent and scholarship allotment. UAlbany is up to 61 scholarships now, two short of the maximum. \"If you want a guy who responds to challenges, Greg is the right guy. He will compete at anything,\" said Tom Donahoe, who was Gattuso's high-school football coach before becoming director of Football Operations for the Pittsburgh Steelers and GM of the Buffalo Bills. \"On top of that, he is a student of the game.\" Added New England Patriots defensive lineman Joe Vellano, who played for Gattuso at Maryland: \"Not only is he great at teaching technique; he has a way of dealing with players. He can be serious and funny, back and forth. That is what you need.\" Gattuso has fully immersed himself in the job and the community. He moved to Albany with wife Colleen and younger daughter Kaitlin, and has quickly familiarized himself with his players. \"I might be the adopted father right now because I didn't recruit them, but they are still my kids,\" Gattuso said. \"We will concede nothing this year. The goal is to win games. And pretty soon, it will be to win the conference. And if you can win the CAA, you can win the national championship.\" Above, from left: Former University President George Philip, B.A.'69, M.A.'73; John Bertuzzi, B.S.'76; Great Danes Football Head Coach Greg Gattuso; recently retired coach Bob Ford; and UAlbany President Robert J.

Her $2.2 million bequest is one of the largest gifts from an individual in UAlbany's history, and the largest for University Libraries support. Her parents taught at NYSCT, and Hastings Murphy grew up on what is now UAlbany's downtown campus. She earned a bachelor's degree in library science at the college and later completed master's studies at Columbia University. Hastings Murphy returned to Albany in 1948 to join the staff of the University Libraries. She remained with the institution during its transformation from college to state university. The first person to hold the director of University Libraries title, Hastings Murphy played an integral role in the libraries' massive growth during the 1960s. She retired in 1970 as head librarian but remained involved with the Friends of the Libraries, of which she was a founding member. \"This generous gift cannot be counted in dollars and cents,\" said George R. Hearst III, president of The University at Albany Foundation. \"The legacy of Alice Hastings Murphy enriches our campus by advancing the University's libraries and inspiring students to take their learning and ambition to the next level.\" T o honor her parents' memory and their many years of service to the University, Hastings Murphy established the Harry and Louise Clement Hastings Fund, which supports the purchase of literary materials and the preservation of library collections. Her fellow Friends of the Libraries created the Alice Hastings Murphy Scholarship to support students planning careers as library professionals. \"Libraries and information services are a critical component of the infrastructure at a public-research university,\" said University at Albany President Robert J. Jones. \"Alice Hastings Murphy's generous bequest will enhance the University Libraries' capacity to support innovative scholarly research and productive academic inquiry by faculty and students alike.\" The Preservation Department will be named in Hastings Murphy's honor Oct. 10.For nearly a century, Alice Hastings Murphy, B.A.'40, enjoyed a close relationship with the New York State College for Teachers (NYSCT) and its successor institution, the University at Albany. Through a planned gift to the University, she will forever remain connected with her beloved alma mater. www.albany.edu 29By Diane Corbett, University at Albany Director of Financial Aid Student-loan debt is a topic being raised at both the local and national levels. Frequently, media stories describe the challenges and struggles of recent graduates as they try to fulfill their student-loan repayment obligations. At the University at Albany, we remain committed to helping students navigate the financial-aid process while in school - and often, after they graduate. And while we are pleased to report that UAlbany students' average loan indebtedness amounts to $5,000 less than the national average, Office of Financial Aid staff are concerned about student debt and default. T oday, helping students understand the importance of loan repayment and the options available to them is becoming more critical as they transition to post-college life. The following tips will assist UAlbany alumni in formulating practical loan-repayment strategies. Take the first step. Identify your U.S. Department of Education-assigned federal loan servicer(s). If you do not know this information, find out at the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) website (www.nslds.ed.gov). You will need your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) personal identification number (PIN) to access your information. A duplicate PIN can be obtained at www.pin.ed.gov. Take charge. Do not wait for your servicer to contact you, as your contact information may be outdated. Please note that any private student loans you may have borrowed are not included in the NSLDS site. Work directly with the lender from which you borrowed the private student loan. Know your repayment options. Under income-based repayment options, payments change as your income changes. Last year, the Department of Education's Federal Student Aid Division emailed approximately 3.5 million students nationally, advising them of the availability of such plans. At the time this article was written, students were automatically enrolled in the Standard Repayment Plan, where payments are a fixed amount for up to 10 years. Under this plan, the minimum payment is $50 per month. However, individuals who are having financial difficulties may qualify for income-based plans, such as Pay as You Earn. Under income-based plans, the payment amount is capped based on a percentage of the individual's income and the number of years to repay the loan is extended, with loan forgiveness after a specified number of years. You may want to use a loan-repayment estimator prior to contacting your loan servicer to help you determine which repayment plan may be your best option. Further details on federal student- loan repayment plans are available at www.studentaid.gov/repay-loans/ understand/plans. This site has a repayment estimator, as well as information on loan consolidation, forgiveness, cancellation and discharge. Keep in mind that if you are continuing your education as a degree-seeking student and enrolled at least half time, in-school deferment options may be available to you. Understanding your options for educational loan repayment is essential to securing a healthy financial future. Be proactive. Avoid misinformation by using the federal sites listed above. Seek help if you are struggling to make your student-loan payments. Your UAlbany education is a great lifetime asset and one of the most important investments you have made, to date. Continue to protect that investment after graduation with an informed and well-planned loan-repayment plan. Visit UAlbany's Office of Financial Aid online www.albany.edu/ financialaid/. Federal Student-Loan Repayment: Understanding Your OptionsAsk Geoff By Williams, University Archivist Emeritus 30 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2014University at Albany Archivist Geoff Williams, retired Sept. 2, looks back at the physical and demographic changes UAlbany has undergone in the past 27 years. When I arrived at the University at Albany in June 1987, the first thing to strike me was the massive size of the Edward Durrell Stone-designed campus, reputedly second only to the Pentagon as a continuous pour of concrete in the United States. At that time, the University's uptown and downtown campuses remained almost completely unchanged since the completion of Indian Quad in 1972. Only one new structure - the \"bubble,\" opened in 1986 near the Physical Education Building - had been added in 16 years. There has been an enormous amount of construction since I came. The photos below highlight some of those projects; the date each building opened is in parentheses. More capital projects have been completed, are under way or are planned for the near future. On the downtown campus, Husted Hall was completely gutted, remodeled and re-opened in 2010. Last year, the University acquired the old Albany High School as expansion space; it will house UAlbany departments while the uptown and downtown campuses are remodeled over the next decade. Construction has started on major additions to the Campus Center extensions, and new science buildings are planned for the east end of the Academic Podium. The whole podium will be renovated to eliminate asbestos while upgrading wiring and digital connectivity. One of the first things I realized on starting work at the University was how little was known about the school's history. Preparing for my job interview, I was unable to find any history of the State University of New York at Albany. The only published history, 1944's College of the Empire State, was 43 years old. While shaking hands with incoming President Patrick Swygert in Fall 1990, I mentioned that our 150th anniversary was coming up in 1994. He quickly seized on that observation as a milestone around which to build the University's first major capital campaign. The Cancer Research Center (East Campus, 2005)The RACC, now the SEFCU Arena (1992) The Life Sciences Research Building (2004) University Hall (2006)The Campus Center extensions (1994) Empire Commons (2004)Construction 1988-present Looking Back: MY YEARS AT UALBANY Freedom Quad, first of the new apartment-style housing (1988)www.albany.edu 31State Support for the University's Funding Raised 1990 1970 2013200 100 50150Amount (in millions) Swygert commissioned Professor Emeritus of History Kendall Birr to write an up-to-date history of the University, A Tradition of Excellence: the Sesquicentennial History of the University at Albany, 1844-1994. As the book would not be published until the sesquicentennial year, however, I was asked to provide the president a brief history of the school. Over one weekend, I created a 10-page sketch of important dates and events from 1844 to 1990 that has since evolved into a more comprehensive history of the school. The Chronological History of the University at Albany, SUNY, 1844-2008 - now about 175 pages long! - is accessible online at http://library.albany. edu/speccoll/chronology.htm. I have enjoyed writing, and speaking, too, in conjunction with my work. For several years, I've written \"Ask Geoff\" for UAlbany magazine. The column has focused on all things great and small about the University. I have also had great fun over the years guiding alumni tours of UAlbany's campuses and speaking at a variety of alumni gatherings. Through alumni feedback, I have learned many wonderful facts about the school. On just about every front, including student and faculty demographics, the University has changed dramatically since I arrived 27 years ago. President Vincent O'Leary, who headed the University when I first arrived, had made it a priority to have the student body reflect the general makeup of New York's population. When O'Leary stepped down in 1990, 17 percent of the undergraduate students were African American, Asian American, Latino and Native American, and 5 percent of graduate students were persons of color. Currently, according to UAlbany's Office of Institutional Research, those figures stand at 38 percent and 15 percent, respectively. The faculty today also more nearly mirrors state demographics. In 1990, only 20 percent of full-time faculty members were women, and 10 percent were persons of color. T oday, women and persons of color account for 38 and 23 percent, respectively, of the full-time faculty. Another dramatic change has been the decline in state support for the University's operating budget. In 1990, that figure was 46 percent. Currently, according to UAlbany President Robert J. Jones, New York State provides just 12 percent of the operating budget. In response, the University has sought private support. The Annual Fund started small in 1973, took off in the 1980s and exceeded $1 million dollars for the first time in 1991-92. UAlbany's first comprehensive fundraising drive, the Campaign for Albany, raised $55 million in the 1990s. Outside funds, which totaled only $6.3 million in 1970, had grown to $105 million by 1990, and, in 2013, stood at $193 million. (That amount does not include CNSE research and contract funding.) Research grants and contracts support ground-breaking University research and stipends for graduate research assistants. At UAlbany, my particular interest has been in expanding knowledge of and access to the school's history, and in that I hope I have succeeded. As I leave, I wish the University - and my readers - a prosperous future. I have had a great ride as UAlbany archivist!

Class councilor: Edna Wright Smith, Ednawrightsmith@aol.com 48 A note from your class councilor: Gari Deliganis Paticopoulos traveled from Florida to Albany in June to attend her grandson Christopher's graduation from the Albany Academy. Marjorie Harland Harrington is recovering from quadruple heart-bypass surgery and is doing well. Annalee Levine Ginsberg and Elihu celebrated their 59th wedding anniversary July 3. Daughter Marsha and son-in-law Neil celebrated their 24th anniversary on May 27. Grandson Brett started his senior year at Drexel U. He has received a scholarship award for his service to the university and has been featured in several articles in the university newspaper. Younger grandson Michael is a sophomore at Rutgers University. Annalee hears frequently from Joan Sittner Sherwood, as well as other classmates. They don't travel now because of health issues. Donald Sayles writes from his home on the Great Sacandaga that he has been sailing on for 41 years. Dulcinea, a 22-footer made in Canada, is a very safe boat whose 1,500-lb. keel weighs the same as all the rest of the boat. He spent 15 hours getting Dulcinea ready for launching. Now Donald only sails when his oldest son, Doug, is with him. Donald says he is convinced that remaining physically active contributes to a long and happier life. He downhill skied for 50 years and finally gave that up at age 82. Eleanor Holbig Alland attended a weekend in June celebrating the 100th anniversary of Chi Sigma Theta Sorority and will share more about that in the next issue. Joan Sittner Sherwood writes of the passing of her best friend, classmate Anne Gilleo Vondra, in January 2014. She and Anne were roommates at Pierce Hall during their senior year, and they made a promise to save their money and take a grand tour of Europe. Their dream came true, and on July 10, 1951, they boarded the French liner DeGrasse in New York City and visited France, Switzerland, Italy and England. They flew home via TWA on Aug. 30, both declaring the trip \"the high point of our lives.\" Anne had been a stroke survivor for 11 years. Class Notes Councilor: Eleanor Holbig Alland, ealland214b@nycap.rr.com 49 A note from your class councilor: Joan Rourke McClelland died April 27, 2014. After settling in Sedona, Joan became one of the wonderful full-time volunteers who make it such a vibrant place. She spent many hours on committees helping to preserve the beauty of the Sedona, Ariz., area. Bonnie Totten Adkins and husband Lee have been very busy, as usual. In March, two great-grandchildren were added to their family. In May, Bonnie and Lee traveled from Vermont to the Capital District area to celebrate the Excellence in Alumni Service Award presented to Joyce and Joe Zanchelli. That same month, they flew to South Carolina for a granddaughter's graduation from the University of South Carolina and saw her off to South Africa with a Volunteers in Mission team. In June, Bonnie and Lee celebrated their 24th wedding anniversary. In July, they held a family reunion and attended the wedding of a granddaughter; they were also looking forward to the October wedding of a grandson. Robertson Baker reports that his grandson Benjamin completed his first year as a music major at Syracuse. Elsa Cox Moberg is proud of her granddaughter, who graduated from UCLA in three and a half years and was headed for Pepperdine Law School. In the spring, Don Dickinson, who lives in Tucson, visited his two daughters in the Bay Area.

Granddaughter Jennifer is working for an e-book company in Norwalk, Conn.; granddaughter Jackie, a student at the University of Connecticut, has recently returned from a semester in Barcelona. And grandson Thomas is a student at Claremont McKenna College in California. Ellen Fay Harmon and her daughter Maureen did not have to travel far in May (they live in Albany) to attend the University at Albany Alumni Association Gala Awards Event, where they helped Joyce and Joe celebrate receiving the Excellence in Alumni Service Award. Also in May, Ellen, husband Tom, two daughters and one granddaughter relaxed on a cruise to Bermuda. There was a family gathering in July to celebrate Ellen's 87th birthday and again in August to celebrate Tom and Ellen's 63rd wedding anniversary. Their 11 grandchildren range in age from 18 to 30. Bob Kittredge reports that his wife, Diana, celebrated her 47th year as a naturalized U.S. citizen, and states that \"Britain's loss was Bob's gain!\" Bob helps distribute 300 or more boxes of food once a month in the low-income neighborhood of Pinedale in Fresno, Calif. Through his Rotary Club, he was instrumental in securing soccer uniforms and balls for 75 children from Pinedale Elementary School. In May, Bob and Diana attended granddaughter Kelsey's graduation from the University of Idaho. For July, they were planning to rent two houses near Yosemite National Park for their annual family gathering. \"Freddy \" Laemmerzahl Miller, with her daughter and son-in-law, participated in a \"birdathon\" and spotted 82 different species in a 24-hour period.

They plan to drive to San Francisco to visit one of Irwin's daughters, then go on to Washington, D.C., for their flight to Rome. Upon their return, they will spend some time in Washington collecting the last of Elise's possessions to take back to California. Elise's condo is in the process of being sold; Irwin's home in Whittier will become their permanent residence. The drive back to California will include a visit to a granddaughter in Houston. Another granddaughter lives near Irwin and manages his real-estate properties. A pair of mallard ducks has taken over their swimming pool; \"if they are still here when we return, we may have to evict them,\" they said. Audrey Hartman White is now living in a Salt Lake City retirement community near son William White Jr.; \"I will be far from the east but one has to adjust.\" She has been planning a trip back to Westerville, Ohio, in the spring. Her husband died April 25, 2013. Audrey thought she was doing great; she flew to Orlando for a granddaughter's graduation from the University of Central Florida; drove to Ocala to visit Elly (Adams) Rapacz - then, out of the blue, she had a major heart attack. Ben and Gloria Jackson had two grandchildren graduating last spring: Jenna Willett from Kenyon College and Lewis Smoot III from New Albany High School in New Albany, Ohio. Audrey Koch Feathers continues to live in Queensbury, N.Y., near both the Feathers camp on Jenny Lake and the high school in South Glens Falls where she, Richard, Sparky Vaughn and BJ taught for several years. Sparky stopped by one morning in May. A little later that day, Audrey left for Jenny Lake and a family gathering celebrating multiple birthdays. Lila Lee Silva Harrington wrote, \"Life has been good to me these past five years here at Prestwick Chase independent living facility in Saratoga Springs.\" The plethora of activities keeps her involved in aerobics, a book-chat club, poetry, bingo and erecting bluebird houses. She also serves on the executive board of the in-house newspaper, The Chase, and attends plays, concerts and lectures at Skidmore College and the wider area: Lila enjoys operas, plays and popular shows at Saratoga Performing Arts Center, Proctors, Cinemax and, not to forget, the Saratoga Racetrack in August. She is blessed with reasonably good health and continues to drive, making trips to Oneonta to visit family and Maggie (Hosking) Winne. Lila also keeps in touch with Jeannie Bowen Walsh Gardner. Last spring, the Silva clan was planning a July family reunion - always a joyful event - bringing together 70-plus family members. At her children's urging, Lila will curtail solo trips to Vermont and Canada, but, accompanied by brother Bob, she will travel in August to visit aunts, uncles and cousins. She sends all her best to her fellow alumni from the Class of 1950 and to her Phi Delta sisters. Marjorie Lyons is still directing plays, with more to come in 2015. Marjorie's dear friend Barbara Smith Vosburgh, who has always been a non-flyer, found her granddaughter's graduation from Florida Atlantic University irresistible. She recently flew to Florida for that event; she and Marjorie, old friends, had a joyous lunch together. Ruth Marschner Boynton reports that daughter Lois Boynton, a professor in the School of Journalism and Mass Communications at the University of North Carolina, was chosen by a vote of the senior class to give the last lecture to the University on the steps of the Morehead Planetarium in Chapel Hill, N.C. Lois' family are (understandably) very proud of her, as we all are. Dr. Malcolm (Mickey) Slakter and his wife, Dr. Nancy Suzuki-Slakter, planned to join their three children, their spouses and four grandchildren on a cruise to Alaska out of Seattle in June. The reunion will celebrate Malcolm's 85th birthday. Earline (Ken) Thompson Sorensen hesitated to respond because \"so little seems to change in my life that I am not sure it warrants an update. And I suppose that is a good thing.\" She is still in Auburn, N.Y., and still enjoys daily walks, tai chi, some golf, and three or four trips a year. In June she was at the Chautauqua Institute for her annual week-long visit. \"I really love that place, the serenity and the feeling of being shut off from the rest of the world,\" said Earline. In August, she spent some time in Quebec. Her four children and their families are all doing well; Earline's five grandchildren range in age from 8 to 23. \"My sincere best wishes to all and an invitation to call, e-mail, or visit.\" Harold Sparky Vaughn, one son, three daughters, and two grandchildren were in Vermont for the May wedding of his great-niece. En route, he and son Eric passed through Glens Falls, stopping for a great visit with Audrey Koch Feathers and, later, with Potter Club brother Tom Yole '52 and his wife, who happens to be Sparky's cousin. He continues to be absorbed in a project to maintain and preserve a unique family library in San Marcello Pistoise, Italy, and hopes to develop a project in cooperation with the Rotary Club of Bangkok, Thailand, focusing on issues of child slavery. Three great granddaughters and a great grandson have been added to the family since he last wrote.

He was a distinguished educator, both a teacher and a business administrator. He is survived by his wife, Phyllis, also a member of the Class of 1952. We also report with great sadness the loss of Eleanor Rosenblum Roth. Eleanor, a published novelist, always had plenty of news to share with us. We send our sympathies to the families of Bob and Eleanor. You will be happy to know that our friend Al Stephenson is well on his way to complete recovery after his long-term illness. He has regained all the weight he lost (35 lbs.) during the fall and winter and got through his part-time teaching this spring. Al could see his physical progress as he started lecturing from a chair, but by the end of the semester, he was standing most of the time. With school out this summer, he was hoping to increase his stamina even more, as he still tires easily. Al wanted to visit the Capital Region during the summer; he has several little grandnieces he looks forward to seeing. He also said he has begun selling his oversized document collection. We had the privilege of seeing part of his impressive collection at one of our reunions. Tom Holman writes from Naples, Fla., that he continues his relaxed lifestyle, following the sun between St. Maarten and Naples. Sounds like a nice life, Tom! A nice note from Shirley Feinstein Rosenbaum states that, as a member of the League of Women Voters, she's the membership director of the state league board and the local board of Morgantown, W.V. She is also a membership and leadership development state league coach. In addition, she is a violinist with her community orchestra and substitute teaches high-school English several days a week in Mon County. What do you with all that spare time, Shirley? Her son Jonathan is president of the League of Women Voters (yes, the league has women and men members) and a cellist in the local orchestra. Jonathan is also the chair of Positive Spin, a non-profit community bike shop that aims to empower people to repair bicycles, find happy homes for unhappy bikes and make bicycles more accessible to the community. Shirley's daughter, a Juilliard piano major, has a children's music workshop in Kentucky and also accompanies opera students from the University of Kentucky. Her husband, a string physicist, teaches and lectures worldwide. Shirley's two grandchildren are studying viola and cello. One had a successful bat mitzvah last spring; the other will have his bar mitzvah next year. Bill Wiley reports that he and Jane have been dealing with a number of health issues and are commuting between Hilton Head, S.C., and Jacksonville, Fla., seeking medical care. Jane has had back and balance problems, and Bill had an atrial fibrillation this past December. However, his non-Hodgkins lymphoma is in total remission (hallelujah!). Their family is spread from Tucson to Geneva, N.Y., and from Indianapolis to Marietta, Ga. The Wileys' granddaughter in Tucson is attending grad school for electrical engineering in aerospace; she was honored for her teaching-assistant position in her first year. Another, back from teaching English to students in the Czech Republic, is now working in a law firm in Geneva, helping less fortunate people navigate this complex world. She hopes to get into a doctoral program in law and sociology. A third granddaughter is returning to college to become a paralegal. Jane and Bill's other three grandchildren are in high school, 6th grade and 5th grade. Bill says: \"Any of you who get into this area (Hilton Head) are always welcome. Give us a call at 843-341-7544.\" Vickie Eade Eddy always has news about her family. Son Chris is a brigadier general in the Air Force Reserves; he was named to Olean's Academic Hall of Fame in June. Her daughter, Pam Eddy, Ph.D., teaches at William and Mary and has authored and co-authored books on leadership in community colleges. She has also supervised some of her doctoral students on trips abroad. Vickie is equally proud of her other three children, a high-school physical- education teacher, a budget analyst for the court system of Philadelphia, and a marketing director for a non-profit that hires people with disabilities. Nancy Frey Pettinelli brings us the sad news that she lost her husband just five weeks short of their 53rd wedding anniversary. She intends to stay in their \"starter\" home so her address will remain the same. She did have some good news: her grandson, who was confirmed, and her granddaughter, who made her First Communion. Joan Bennett Kelly has had a stressful year trying to find a cure for Charlie's serious back problems. He is now much better, thank goodness, but the difficulty of finding care in two areas as diverse as Vermont and Florida has convinced them to give up their Florida home and substitute an apartment in New Jersey, which will put them close to their children. They weren't able to get to all the graduations they wanted to attend, but they did get to Sara's at Binghamton and to her last track meet, where she did her personal best. Sara was on a track scholarship. Joan and Charlie also got to attend their granddaughter's graduation from West Point; they are very proud she wants to serve her country. She also did her personal best at her diving meet. Dorothy Simmons Van Der Ven writes: \"I still live as 'Little Old Red Riding Hood' in the woods at 8036 Indian Hill, Manlius, N.Y.

Two weeks afterward, they were in Detroit for the wedding of their niece; 10 days after that they were back in Vermont for their granddaughter's graduation. (She had been inducted into Phi Beta Kappa on their previous visit.) In June, Kitty and Marty took a cruise to Bermuda; in July, they headed to Texas for their family reunion and, in August, Granville, N.Y., for their annual two-week vacation on a small lake. Whew! They'll need a rest. In the meantime, Kitty is occupied with church activities, bridge, quilting, book-discussion group, and theater trips to New York City. With Quilts of Valor, a small group in Goshen, N.Y. Kitty makes quilts for wounded servicemen and women to keep. Very nice idea, Kitty. Your co-councilors, Joan Barron and Joyce Zanchelli, were in Albany to present our annual scholarship. This year, we awarded scholarships to two men in the Department of Languages, Literatures and Cultures. Joshua De Clerk, who had a triple major in Spanish, Italian, and French, and Michael Maneen, a junior with a triple major in Russian, French and international relations, were the recipients. Both of these young men were very pleased with the award. Joyce Leavitt Zanchelli and her husband, Joe, were recognized May 3 with the Excellence in Alumni Service Award from the University at Albany Alumni Association. \"We have many of you to thank for helping us win this prestigious award, for you are the ones who supply us with news, attend our reunions and help us keep in touch with one another. Thank you, classmates,\" Joyce said Class notes councilor: Joyce Zanchelli, jjzanch@yahoo.com 53 A note from your class councilor: Hello, Red Devils Class of 1953. Here's news about your old friends. The American Legion presented Daniel Kelly the Americanism Award for his work on the World War II exhibit in his hometown, Rye, N.Y. Dan sent us pictures that showed him riding in a Jeep in the 2014 Memorial Day parade; he was looking quite dapper. He went on to say, \"Strange how it took until retirement to return to my Albany education, but I am totally involved with history, especially as it focuses on my hometown. It's a far cry from the world of IBM, which I also relished.\" Congratulations, Dan, on the award! Rye is lucky to have you as a devoted volunteer. This May, Dan took a three-week trip to Germany and England. Carolyn Gazulis Johnson told us about her husband's passing in 2013; our sincere condolences. She is now living in Florida and says, \"The invite is open for visiting classmates.\" Carolyn loved traveling and has seen a good part of the world.

Reporting on her children, Carolyn said that her twin daughters are successfully employed: one is a computer teacher in San Francisco, and the other is a lobbyist for the motion-picture industry. Her son is a professional golfer. Kitty Brumfield Pickett reports that she enjoyed the councilor's reminiscing in the class letter; it brought about fond memories for her. Kitty remembers: \"I enrolled at NYSCT in December 1950, when my father was recalled into the Army to go to Korea. (We lived In Delmar and my mother planned to sell our house and move to an apartment in Albany.) I decided to leave Mount Holyoke College and transfer to State. I entered the building with Minerva at the entrance. The only person there that day was Dr. Josiah T. Phinney, whose wife had graduated at MHC. We got along so well that I was accepted, and I asked him to be my advisor. I was very shy then and made few friends, but even then I knew I had made a good decision. My father got to Japan and then was sent home to pick up his job with the NY Health Dept. I am very proud of Albany, and because all New York teachers have to have a master's degree, I applied to return for another year. The dean of Men asked me to take a job at Brubacker Hall counseling 70 sophomores on half of the top floor. Carolyn Gazulis got the other side of that floor. It was a difficult and rewarding year, and Carolyn and I are still friends.\" Joe Lombardi, in response to a class letter sent in March, remarked he had just returned from a 15-day trip to Cambodia and Vietnam. \"We were there during 'Tet,' their New Year's celebration. It was festive, decked out with red banners (hammers and sickles prominently displayed). And beautiful flowers everywhere. The Vietnamese were friendly, cordial and open to Americans. One can even buy a condo on the South China Sea. The country is open for business.\" Alvin Brown responded to the class letter's request for information, either past or present, with this interesting news: \"After college graduation I served in the Air Force and flew to many places and islands in the Pacific, including Japan. A number of these were famous battle sites in WWII. As a result, I spoke to diverse senior groups and veterans' organizations about such events. [I] am the historian/archives person with a veterans' organization.\" Al went on to say that he had authored two books that are listed on Amazon. Based on the description of the author, it's fairly safe to assume that Al is the author of Native American Stories and Spelling: A Mnemonics Approach. Herb Thier has become interested in programs for seniors through organized university and other programs. He indicated that he would be further interested in contacting others who have gotten involved in this education for the general public. In March 2014, he was finally fully retired from UC Berkeley after nearly 51 years as an academic. In December, Herb and his wife, Marlene, will be celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary by taking their immediate family (10 now) on a cruise. Congratulations on your anniversary and your retirement, Herb! Gary LaGrange happily informed us that he had moved to southern California and is enjoying the beautiful weather. In response to a questionnaire about a class reunion, Joyce Turner Ogden said, \"I'm retired to a far corner of the U.S. (only 60 miles from the Pacific Ocean) so Albany is just too far away to travel to reunions.\" She, along with your councilor, would like to see more folks on our Facebook group page. Just find us at SUNY Albany Class of 1953. You can reminisce, post comments to your classmates, post photos - the list of possible activity goes on. Bob and Rosie Keller Hughes have decided to downsize, sell their home, and move to a condo near their youngest son and his family. First, Rosie had surgery on her hammertoe.

After the surgery, the surgeon told her that recovery www.albany.edu/givingAlumni News & Notes For more information about the positive impact your support has on the lives of University at Albany students, or to make a gift online, please visit www.albany.edu/giving. Meet Hayley. Hayley Calarco, a junior business major from Bridgeport, N.Y., and a recipient of the 2013 Citizen Laureate Nigro Companies Scholarship, has been busy during her two-plus years at UAlbany. A member of the Presidential Honor Society and a research assistant in the cognition and language laboratory of Dr. Jeannette Altarriba, Calarco also is president of Psi Chi, the National Honor Society in Psychology. She plays intramural volleyball, too. Calarco, who plans to earn a master's in either industrial/organizational psychology or human resources, found Dr. Paul Morgan Jr. \"an incredible teacher. He makes students feel very comfortable and gives us every opportunity to succeed. Every class was enjoyable.\" 38 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2014could last six months - he was right.) Shortly after, Bob started having horrendous pain in his back. After many tests and lots of medications, it was determined that the pain was caused by the healing of a compressed fracture in his spine. Finding it progressively difficult to manage the stairs in their house, they decided to find a one-story condo and appreciate and enjoy having someone else maintain their abode. They're not yet ready for independent or assisted living, but who knows what is down the road. Bob and Rosie so enjoy their grandchildren. They happily watched a live stream of one of their granddaughters get her master's degree with distinction from Pratt Institute. Another happy moment was seeing their oldest grandson dressed in his tuxedo, all ready to go to his first formal dance. Evi Iglauer is still involved in her career: She continues to work as a per diem (two days a week) administrative law judge for the City of New York. Evi spends long weekends at the condo she owns with her sister on the water on eastern Long Island. She still travels at every opportunity. Evi, too, shared memories of our freshman year at State; \"I remember that song as we ascended to the balcony, 'We did it last year, now you do it this year!'\" Ruth Dunn Reed replied to the question of when we should have our next reunion: \"I love reunions - anytime. I go despite severe hearing and sight loss. [I] Agree with Rosie - college memories strong and lasting.\" Recalling our freshman year, Ruth mentioned Mary McFarland [one of the leading actors in the Frosh Big 4; she had a lovely voice] was one of her four roommates, and she later dropped out of NYSCT. Ann Pelton, Annie Oberst and Ruth lived in Miss Cobb's house the first part of the year - no room elsewhere was available - 18th and 19th century lived there also!\" It's not expected that Ruth will \"friend\" our Facebook page, since her last comment was \"I don't compute or twitter.\" Ruth is still the spunky redhead we all knew and loved at State. Jordine Skoff Van Wontoch is very active in several theatres and on the Board of Directors of the Old Globe Theatre, when she is home in San Diego. To keep up on what is new in the theatre, she went to London in May and New York in June. Marion Howard Bon replied to a query on whether her email address, \"born to dig,\" was indicative of a hobby in petrology, anthropology or archeology. \"In retirement my husband and I have had time to enjoy new avocations. He (school administrator in another life) and I (librarian) are busy with new interests. He is doing a lot of volunteer archeology, and I am a master gardener, hence the digging reference.\" Marion described the weather at home as cold and snowy and very windy. She moved to Delaware \"to get away from snow and cold in New York!\" Carroll Judd was given the Wright Brothers Master Pilot Award in September 2011 for promoting and practicing safe aircraft operation for 50 consecutive years.

Rudy Desantolo had been missing from our class list for some time. Your class councilor decided to try to find him on the Internet and discovered his obituary in Newsday, published Aug. 1, 2013: \"De SANTOLO - Rudolph on July 26 of complications from Parkinson's at age 82. He served as Former Assistant Superintendent of Sachem Schools and founded the Special Education Program.\" Vince Aceto retired 10 years ago - happily - as a SUNY Distinguished Service Professor and a Collins Fellow. He is working at IBM East Fishkill, managing the library online information services as an external contractor. In April 2013, he went for two weeks to Prague with his best interpreter, his Czechoslovakian wife. William (Bill) Whitwer hung up his clerical robe in March when he retired from the ministry after 58 years. Enjoy your retirement, Bill; you have earned it! Wilma Nuber Cutler enjoyed reading the class letter since it sure brought back many memories of our four years at Albany. Lucille Roulier Guthrie was happy to spend the winter in Venice, Fla., especially since New York had such terrible weather. She was looking forward to going back north in May and hopefully enjoying a nice, warm summer at Brant Lake near Lake George.

In closing, your councilor wants to encourage all of you to send her your news either via e-mail or in response to a class letter. Just as you enjoy reading about your former classmates, your classmates would enjoy hearing about you. We were such a great class, with good fellowship, involvement in Red Devil activity, and a love for the school where Minerva reigned. We have not seen many of our fellow 53ers for 61 years but I, for one, and I'm sure others, as well, still hold all of you in happy memories of four wonderful years ... a Camelot for many first-generation Americans and for children of parents who wanted their offspring to have a good education despite their financial circumstances.

Lyons, B.A.'50, M.S., Ph.D. Standing in line at the UAlbany alumni luncheon in Fort Lauderdale a few years ago, I heard the woman ahead of me introduce herself: \"Helen Jones Warner.\" \"Who?\" I sputtered. and UAlbany grad, Helen Jones Warner?\" Later, I visited Helen at her home in Delray Beach. Smiling, she exclaimed, \"Oh, I would have known you anywhere!\" We settled on the couch and looked at photos in my 1950 Pedagogue. Helen smiled at pictures of Hawley Hall and Minerva. In The Crystal - the 1946 yearbook from my alma mater, Port Jefferson High School in Long Island, N.Y. - my former teacher pointed to students and faculty, recognizing them from 68 years before and asking about them. We later spoke about our experiences at UAlbany. As 17-year-olds from tiny New York towns (Granville for her; Miller Place for me), we were the first in our families to attend college. I asked, \"How has your education been important to you?\" Helen paused, then laughed: \"Well, I'm glad I got it! And it got me a job!\" Helen's education also benefited the South Florida medical community. T old by her doctor that Boynton Beach's Bethesda Hospital needed a medical library but lacked funding, Helen enrolled at UAlbany, \"substituting in libraries for the experience.\" While she earned her degree, funds were raised for the facility - and, on graduating, Helen started the medical library. T oday, the plaque at the library honors Helen Jones Warner for her 15 years of service. As teacher and librarian, Helen was happy with her life. \"I liked getting along with a variety of people,\" she said. I nodded, transfixed that my teacher, almost 100, was telling me about her life and work. \"People used to think that libraries were just books,\" said Helen. But they are actually media centers \"with pictures and movies\" that afford young people, especially, access to information. \"That's the key, access!\" Helen added.
