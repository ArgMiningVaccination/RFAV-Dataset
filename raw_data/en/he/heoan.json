A bill to phase out the sale of new fluorescent light bulbs that contain toxic mercury was signed into law by Governor Kotek on Thursday. [House Bill 2531](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2023R1/Measures/Overview/HB2531) will protect Oregonians from the unnecessary threat of mercury exposure from breakages of mercury-containing fluorescent lamps while also saving consumers money on utility bills. It also serves as a climate protection initiative, accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy through increased use of energy-efficient LED lighting solutions. LED light bulbs, which are twice as energy efficient as fluorescent bulbs, are expected to gradually take over, resulting in Oregon residents and businesses saving [$49 million annually in electricity bill savings by 2030](https://appliance-standards.org/sites/default/files/Oregon.pdf) if the bill is signed. \"We can save energy and reduce our exposure to toxic mercury,\" said [Celeste Meiffren-Swango](https://environmentamerica.org/oregon/people/celeste-meiffren-swango/), state director of Environment Oregon. \"The bill signed into law today to phase out fluorescent light bulbs will help protect the health and safety of Oregonians for years to come.\" See the Campaign [Energy Conservation & Efficiency](https://environmentamerica.org/oregon/campaigns/energy-conservation-efficiency/) Energy Conservation & Efficiency Topics Updates [Clean lighting delivers big energy savings](https://environmentamerica.org/oregon/updates/clean-lighting-delivers-big-energy-savings/) [Energy Conservation & Efficiency](https://environmentamerica.org/oregon/campaigns/energy-conservation-efficiency/) Clean lighting delivers big energy savings [Nearly 80,000 gas cooktops recalled](https://environmentamerica.org/oregon/updates/nearly-80000-gas-cooktops-recalled/) Nearly 80,000 gas cooktops recalled [A marine heat wave is taking a toll on the Pacific Northwest](https://environmentamerica.org/oregon/updates/a-marine-heat-wave-is-taking-a-toll-on-the-pacific-northwest/) A marine heat wave is taking a toll on the Pacific Northwest [Sea otters are restoring eelgrass in Monterey Bay](https://environmentamerica.org/oregon/updates/sea-otters-are-restoring-eelgrass-in-monterey-bay/) Sea otters restoring eelgrass in "}
