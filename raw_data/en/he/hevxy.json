Stockwell, MD, MPH, Christina A. Porucznik, PhD, MSPH, Ashton Dixon, MPH, Jazmin Duque, MPH, Joseph B. Stanford, MD, MSPH,Vic Veguilla, DrPH, and Fatimah S. Dawood, MD Background: Millions of children have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and over 1000 children have died in the US. However, vaccination rates for children 5 to 11 years old are low. Methods: Starting in August 2020, we conducted a prospective SARS-CoV-2 household surveillance study in Spanish and English-speaking households in New York City and Utah. From October 21 to 25, 2021, we asked caregivers about their likelihood of getting COVID-19 vaccine for their child, and reasons that they might or might not vaccinate that child. We compared intent to vaccinate by site, demographic characteristics, SARS-CoV-2 infection detected by study surveillance, and parents' COVID-19 vaccination status using Chi-square tests and a multivariable logistic regression model, accounting for within-household clustering. Results: Among parents or caregivers of 309 children (0 to 11 years) in 172 households, 87% were very or somewhat likely to intend to vaccinate their child. The most prevalent reasons for intending tovaccinate were to protect family and friends and the community; individual prevention was mentioned less often. The most prevalent reasons for not intending to vaccinate were side effect concerns and wanting to wait and see. In multivariable analysis, parents had much lower odds of intending to vaccinate if someone in the household had tested SARS-CoV-2-positive during the study (adjusted odds ratio = 0.09; 95% con-dence interval, 0.03-0.3). Conclusion: This study highlighted several themes for clinicians and public health ofcials to con- sider including the importance and safety of vaccination for this age-group even if infected previously,and the benets of vaccination to protect family, friends, and community.

Under- standing factors affecting parents 'willingness to vac- cinate their children is critical to promoting uptake. Methods We previously reported the methods and ndings of a SARS-CoV-2 household surveillance study in Spanish and English-speaking households in New York City and Utah.3During October 21 to 25, 2021 immedi- ately before the FDA meeting, we conducted a short survey asking the reporting caregiver of each childaged 0 to 11 years about their intent to vaccinate thatchild against COVID-19 (very, somewhat, not too ornot at all likely), and reasons that they might (reported\"very\"or\"somewhat likely \")o rm i g h tn o t( \"some- what, \"\"not too \"or\"n o ta ta l ll i k e l y \"). Response options about reasons to vaccinate or not vaccinatewere adapted from CDC national internet panel sur-veys that were eld tested and have been used to assess attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination periodically dur-ing the pandemic. Only 1 caregiver reported for eachchild, but 1 could report for multiple children eachTable 1.

We compared intent to vaccinate (very/ somewhat likely vs not too/not at all likely)by site, demographic characteristics, SARS-CoV-2 infection detected by study surveillance amonghousehold members during the study period,and parents' COVID-19 vaccination status using Chi square tests. Samples were not reweighted ineither the main study or this analysis. Variables witha univariate p value <0.1 were entered into a multi- variable logistic regression model. Generalized esti-mating equations assuming a within-household clustering. The University ofUtah Institutional Review Board (IRB) was the centralIRB and approved the study. Results Among respondents for 309 children (305 parents, 2 grandmothers, 2 aunts, response rate 78%) in 172households, 87% were very or somewhat likely tovaccinate their child (Table 1). The most prevalentreasons for vaccinating were to protect family andfriends and the community; individual preventionwas endorsed less often. The most prevalent rea- sons for not vaccinating were side effect concerns and wanting to wait and see (Figure 1). These werethe top themes regardless of site or age (0 to 4 yearsand 5 to 11 years). In multivariable analysis, parents had much lower odds of intending to vaccinate if someone inthe household had tested SARS-CoV-2-positive during the study (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.09; 95% con dence interval, 0.03 to 0.3) (Table 1). Higher household income aOR 13.9 (1.2 to 165.8)and parental COVID-19 vaccine receipt aOR 12.3(2.1 to 73.2) were independently associated withvaccine intentions, but not child 's age, childcare/ school attendance outside the home, parental edu-cation level, or other selected demographic factors(Table 1). Trends were similar when chi squareswere strati ed by age-group and by site. Discussion In this study, most parents intended to vaccinatetheir children aged 0 to 11 years once vaccine wasavailable. This study included a convenience sampleof a relatively small number of households, andpersons of certain racial and ethnic backgrounds,those who were low-income and those who wereuninsured persons were under-represented. Thus,ndings may not be generalizable to all segments of the US population. However, ndings suggest sev- eral themes for clinicians and public health of cials to consider when thinking about communication strategies as part of multi-level interventions. First, it may be important to underscore to families the importance of vaccination even if householdmembers have previously had SARS-CoV-2 infec- tion. 4Families may also need reassurance about vaccine safety after prior infection. Second, for this younger age-group, the bene ts of vaccination to protect family, friends and community may play a particularly important role, even more than perso- nal protection, in motivating parents to vaccinatetheir child. Addressing concerns about vaccine sideeffects also remains important. Third, low-income households may bene t from additional outreach efforts to provide information about COVID-19 vaccines for children. Finally, while parental vacci- nation status was associated with vaccine intention for children, 5over 50% of unvaccinated parents reported intention to vaccinate their child, demon-strating the importance of offering COVID-19 vac- cine, regardless of parental vaccination status.
