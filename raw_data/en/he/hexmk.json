In an effort to introduce only wholesome, unrefined elements into their bodies, more and more people are turning to herbal and homeopathic remedies to treat ailments from arthritis to allergies. Believers in herbal and homeopathic treatment point to several advantages over Western medicine. Aside from the obvious appeal of being completely natural, we have compiled three of the most favored benefits of these remedies. Differences between Herbal Medicine and Homeopathy Before diving into the virtues of herbal medicine and homeopathy, it is essential to know how the two differ. Although similar, there are a few distinct differences. Homeopathy has been used around the world for over 200 years and focuses on treating the whole person, not just the body's affected area. It operates under two founding principles: \"like heals like\" and \"the minimum dose.\" Natural substances, not only herbs, are diluted and then ingested to engage the body in an organic healing process. Herbal medicine (or herbalism) is the use of plants to treat a condition. Using herbs is supremely different from using plant-derived drugs because the latter tends to extract only one active chemical and synthesize it. In contrast, using pure herbs, incorporates the entire chemical compound of the plant, completely un-synthesized. Taking these distinctions into consideration, they nonetheless share many benefits because of their 100% natural bedrock. 1. Highly Individualized When prescribing herbal and homeopathic remedies, we are can take a patient's symptoms and illness into consideration to find a matching resolution. Homeopathy and herbal medicine are most commonly used to treat ailments such as depression, [joint pain](https://www.spinepluschiropractic.com/joint-pain-treatment-farmington-hills-mi/), and asthma, whose symptoms and severity vary widely. Homeopathy and herbalism, when practiced correctly, take advantage of this by conducting in-depth examinations of each patient. Stress levels, emotional triggers, personality traits, and even relationship dynamics play a part in treatment options. As opposed to mass-produced, synthesized drugs, herbal and homeopathic treatments can be tailored to an individual's needs with great care and precision. 2.
