The system traces its origin to Traditional Chinese Medicine, philosophy and martial arts. It incorporates slow, rhythmic movements and controlled breathing exercises to promote the body's natural healing ability and balance qi, or life energy. Sutter's Qigong classes are suitable for beginners as well as people with a regular practice. The movements are easy to learn and not physically demanding.
