A novel model of interprofessional spiritual care was developed by a national consensus conference of experts in spiritual care and palliative care.Integral to this model is a spiritual screening, history or assessment as part of the routine history of patients.Spiritual screening can be done by a clinician on an intake into a hospital setting. Clinicians who make diagnosisand assessments and plans, and make referrals to appropriate experts do spiritual histories. In spiritual care,board certified chaplains, spiritual directors and pastoral counselors are the typical spiritual care referrals.Board certified chaplain do a spiritual assessment that is a more detailed assessment of religious and spiritualbeliefs and how those impact care or patient's healthcare decision-making. There are several screening andhistory tools. One history tool named FICA, was developed by a group of primary care physicians and recentlyvalidated at study at the City of Hope. This tool is widely used in a variety of clinical settings in the US andCanada. The spiritual history tools allow the clinician the opportunity to diagnose spiritual distress or identifypatients' spiritual resources of strength and then integrate that information into the clinical treatment or careplan. Keywords : Cancer death - spiritual care - palliative care - spiritual screening if that physician addresses their spiritual concerns (Ehman et al., 1999). Ninety five per cent of the patients who report that spirituality is important want their doctor tobe sensitive to their spiritual needs and to integrate it intheir treatment. In another study, McCord et al (McCordet al., 2004) reported that patients in a family practicesetting felt that it was important for physicians andhealthcare providers to address their spiritual issues andbeliefs. In this study, 95% of patients wanted theirspiritual beliefs addressed in the case of serious illness,86% when admitted to a hospital and 60% during a routinehistory. These results are also corroborated by surveysregarding patients' desire for nursing attention to theirspiritual concerns. A novel model of interprofessional spiritual care was developed by a national consensus conference of expertsin spiritual care and palliative care and co-sponsored bythe City of Hope, the George Washington Institute forSpirituality and Health and the Archstone Foundation(Puchalski et al., 2009). Integral to this model is a spiritualscreening, history or assessment as part of the routinehistory of patients. One goal of spiritual assessment is todiagnose spiritual distress as well as spiritual resourcesof strength of patients. Figure 1 below outlines a modelof interprofessional spiritual care implementationdeveloped at the National Consensus Conference whichshows how spirituality is addressed with patients in an Introduction Spirituality is increasingly recognized as an essential element of health. Spirituality speaks to what givesultimate meaning and purpose in a person's life. It is thatpart of people that seeks healing and reconciliation withself or others (Foglio & Brody, 1988; Puchalski, 2002).Spirituality, broadly defined, is inclusive of the non-believers as well as the religious. Atheists, agnostics,spiritual but not religious, and religious patients all havean inner life that may be described in the overallunderstanding of spirituality. There is also institutionalsupport for the inclusion of spirituality, broadly defined,into healthcare. JCAHO requires that when a hospitalizedpatient requests spiritual care, it should be provided(JCAHO, 1996). Numerous surveys support patient requests for spiritual care from physicians and other healthcare professionals.Initial research suggests that between 41% and 94% ofpatients want their physicians to address these issues. Inone survey, even half of the non-religious patients thoughtthat physicians should inquire politely about patients'spiritual needs (Ehman et al., 1999). In these surveys,patients indicate their preference to have a more integratedapproach to their care with their spiritual issues addressedby their healthcare professionals. In one study, 85% ofpatients noted that their trust in their physician increasesChristina Maria Puchalski Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention, Vol 11, 2010: MECC Supplement52in-patient setting, and how spiritual issues are integrated into a treatment plan. The model is based on a generalist-specialist model in which the Board Certified Chaplain isrecognized as the spiritual care expert on the medical team.While all clinicians ask about spiritual issues of patientsand do initial diagnosis and assessment, the chaplains arethe experts that treat or counsel patients in spiritual care.Chaplains can also recommend appropriate interventionsthat non-chaplain clinicians can do (Puchalski et al., 2009). Spiritual Distress Spiritual distress can be manifested in many different ways. The inability to find meaning and purpose can leadto depression and anxiety. People find many sources ofmeaning and purpose throughout their lives that may betransient---jobs, relationships, accomplishments, andfinancial success. However, the challenge for all peopleis to find meaning and purpose even in the midst of failedjobs, relationships, accomplishment and unattainedsuccesses especially at the end of life. Ultimate meaningand purpose is meaning that sustains individuals in theemptiness of their external lives, or as people face theirdying. Spiritual and religious beliefs play a significantrole in how people transcend their suffering in order tofind such ultimate meaning (Wong & Fry, 1998). Hopelessness often arises in the midst of serious illness. Studies have indicated that people who are morehopeful do better with regard to depression and otherhealth indicators (Synder et al., 1991; Breitbart, 2003).How people come to understand hope also varies. Initially, hope may be lodged in cure or recovery but when that isnot possible, people may have a hard time tapping intoresources of hope. In those times hope may be manifestedas acceptance, completing important goals or activities,living life fully in the face of difficulty, finding meaningand eventually experiencing a good quality of life anddeath. Helping people restructure their thinking so thatthey can see hopefulness in the midst of despair is anessential part of therapy. Spiritual and religious beliefsoffer people a language of hope. Religious and spiritualcommunities offer support in the quest to find hope andmeaning. Others spiritual issues include forgiveness and/or resentment. Illness can trigger many of the spiritual issuesand therefore the clinical setting may be the first placewhere these spiritual issues arise. Religious issues canalso cause distress in people's lives. Anger at God iscommon in the face of serious illness. Yet, it can lead toconflict, guilt and despair. It is important in the clinicalsetting to allow people to talk about that anger in a safeenvironment where they do not feel they will be judged.In their religious communities patients may be told that itis wrong to be angry at God, or that it reflects a weakeningin one's faith to be angry at or feel abandoned by God.Yet, in the clinician's office, the patient may find a safehaven to explore these feelings in greater depth. Many of the spiritual issues faced by patients are summarized in Table 1. This was developed as part of theNational Consensus Conference on InterprofessionalFigure 1. A Model of Interprofessional Spiritual Care Implementation Developed at the National Consensus Conference Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention, Vol 11, 2010: MECC Supplement 53Formal and Informal Spiritual Assessment Spiritual Care. This table identifies these issues as spiritual distress diagnosis. It also gives examples as well asstatements that patients might use in communicating aboutthese issues with clinicians. Spiritual Resources of Strength Spirituality can also provide support for patients. Spiritual and religious beliefs and practices have beenshown to have an impact in stress management, providingresiliency, as well as in coping with suffering (Boston etal., 2006). Spiritual groups such as faith based groups,yoga, or other types of spiritual groups can offer peoplesocial support. The ability to find hope in the midst ofdespair or meaning in suffering is examples of spiritualresources of strength. Having a purpose in one's life isimmensely important for people. Communication about Spiritual Issues Communication with patients and families about spiritual issues ranges from identification of spiritualissues to formal assessment (Puchalski & Romer, 2000;Lo et al., 2002). Thus there are four basic ways to approach communication about spiritual issues. The first three canbe considered informal the forth is a formal part of theclinical encounter.1. Recognition of spiritual themes, spiritual distress or suffering, and resources of strength.2. Response to patients' statements about spiritual,religious or existential issues.3. Response to patient's cues such as what they are wearingor reading.4. Formal spiritual history, screening or assessment. The first three approaches can be done by anyone on the care team. During the clinical encounter, one shouldlisten for expressions of these themes and then follow upwith an appropriate comment or question. For example,a patient may allude to a sense of hopelessness. Theprofessional may elicit more conversation with the patientand identify appropriate treatment options. Patients mayexpress spiritual or existential issues, for example, inasking \"why is this happening to me?'. It is important torespond to these types of questions with open-endedquestions, such as \"Tell me more\", or \"Why do you thinkthis is happening to you?\" By trying to answer these often-unanswerable questions, the clinician could signal a lackof interest in hearing the patient's existential distress. Patients may also voice explicit spiritual and/or religious beliefs. For example, a patient may makereferences to God or a higher power, or may mentionhelpful practices such as meditation or yoga. The cliniciancan follow up by asking more about these practices.Clinicians do not need to be experts in all spiritual orreligious beliefs and practices; they can learn from their(After Puchalski et al., 2009) Table 1.

Patients may wear religious or spiritual jewelry, or have religious or spiritual reading material at their bedside.Clinicians can acknowledge these objects and askquestions in reference to what the patient is wearing orreading. Spiritual Screening, History, Assessment A spiritual history, screening or assessment is a more formal part of the medical history in which the patient orfamily is asked about their spiritual and/or religiousbeliefs. In general, non-chaplain clinicians do a spiritualscreening or a spiritual history; chaplains do a spiritualassessment. These are further defined below: Spiritual Screening Spiritual screening or triage is a quick determination of whether a person is experiencing a serious spiritualcrisis and therefore needs an immediate referral to aprofessional chaplain. Spiritual screening helps identifywhich patients may benefit from an in-depth spiritualassessment by a professional chaplain. Good models ofreligious or spiritual screening employ a few, simplequestions, which can be asked by any health careprofessional in the course of an overall screening.Examples of questions could be, \"How important isreligion and spirituality in your coping? and \"How wellare those resources working for you at this time?\" Spiritual History Spiritual history taking is the process of interviewing a patient, asking them questions about their life, in orderto come to a better understanding of their needs andresources. Compared to screening, history taking employsa broader set of questions to capture salient informationabout needs, hopes, and resources. The history questionsare usually asked in the context of a comprehensiveexamination, by the clinician who is primarily responsiblefor providing direct care or referrals to specialists such asprofessional chaplains. The information from the historypermits the clinician to understand how spiritual concernscould either complement or complicate the patient'soverall care. It also allows the clinician to incorporatespiritual care into the patient's overall care plan. Unlikespiritual screening which requires virtually no training,those doing a spiritual history should have some trainingin and comfort with issues and how to engage patientscomfortably in this discussion. Spiritual Assessment Spiritual assessment refers to a more extensive [in- depth, on-going] process of active listening to a patient'sstory as it unfolds in a relationship with a professionalchaplain and summarizing the needs and resources thatemerge in that process. The summary includes a spiritualcare plan with expected outcomes, which should becommunicated, to the rest of the treatment team. Unlikehistory taking, the major models for assessment are notbuilt on a set of questions that can be employed in aninterview. Rather, the models are interpretive frameworksthat are applied based on listening to the patient's story as it unfolds in the clinical relationship. Because of thecomplex nature of these assessments and the specialclinical training necessary to engage in them, onlyprofessional chaplains should do them. When each of these inquiries occur depends on the setting as well as who is asking the question. In hospitals,long-term care sites or hospices, the nurse or social workerupon triage or admission does the spiritual screening. Thepurpose is to assess for spiritual emergencies that mayrequire a chaplain immediately. Once the initial admissionprocess is completed, then a spiritual history is taken aspart of the intake or complete history after the initial triage.In outpatient settings, the spiritual screening might notoccur. If the patient comes to the physician's office and isin distress, a spiritual screening might be done as part ofthe initial conversation with the physician, nursepractitioner or physician-assistant. Spiritual History Tools For non-chaplains, there are clinical history tools that are used to collect and document clinical information. Thespiritual history can be integrated into these tools; so forexample, the spiritual history has been integrated into thesocial history section of the clinical database in manysettings. A spiritual history is as important as any otherpart of the clinical history. When doing a clinical history,clinicians target specific areas. Simply listening to themesalone will not elicit all the information needed to providegood medical care. Thus, specific questions need to beasked to target areas of information regarding life eventssuch as depression, social support, domestic violence,sexual preferences and practices. Patients may notvolunteer information to a clinician unless they are invitedto share in sensitive areas. This is particularly true ofspirituality. While patients are interested in havingspirituality integrated into their care, it is not yet a commonpractice to have physicians or others address spiritualissues; patients may need an invitation to share theirexperiences. A spiritual history is simply a set of targetedquestions aimed at inviting patients to share their spiritualand/or religious beliefs if desired and to guide them todelve into the meaning of life events. The goals of the spiritual history are to: Invite the patient to share spiritual and religious beliefs if they chose. Invite patients to define what spirituality is for them and what are their spiritual goals. Learn about the patient's beliefs and values.Assess for spiritual distress (meaninglessness, hopelessness etc) as well as for spiritual resources ofstrength (hope, meaning and purpose, resiliency, spiritualcommunity). Provide an opportunity for compassionate care whereby the healthcare professional connects to the patientin a deep and profound way. Empower the patient to find inner resources of healing and acceptance. Identify patients' spiritual and religious beliefs thatAsian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention, Vol 11, 2010: MECC Supplement 55Formal and Informal Spiritual Assessment might impact healthcare decision-making. Identify spiritual practices or rituals that might be helpful in the treatment or care plan. There are several tools that have been developed for this purpose. These include FICA, (see Figure2)(Puchalski & [see Figure 4] (Maugans, 1996). Generally, these tools includeobjective data (religious affiliation, spiritual identification,community, spiritual practices) as well as provide an openended part of the conversation to assess for spiritualaspects such as meaning, importance of belief and/or faith,beliefs in afterlife, sources of hope or distress. These toolsare shown in the Figures 2-4. Of the three tools mentioned,the FICA tool is the only one that has been validated. In astudy at City of Hope, FICA was correlated with thespiritual domain of the City of Hope Quality of Lifequestionnaire and demonstrated to assess for spiritual andreligious issues in patients. While these tools ask specific questions, they are not H: Sources of hope, strength, comfort, meaning, peace, love and connection O: The role of organized religion for the patientP: Personal spirituality and practicesE: Effects on medical care and end-of-life decisions Figure 3.

F - Faith and Belief; I - Importance; C - Community; A - Address in Care or Action (Puchalski and Romer, 2000)F. \"Do you consider yourself spiritual or religious?\" - or -\"Do you have spiritual beliefs that help you cope withstress (contextualize to the situation, for e.g. with what youare going through right now, with dying, with dealing withpain)?\"If the patient responds \"No\" the physician might ask,\"What gives your life meaning?\" I. \"What importance does your faith or belief have in your life? Have your beliefs influenced how you take care of yourself inthis illness? What role do your beliefs play in regaining yourhealth?\" C. \"Are you part of a spiritual or religious community? Is this of support to you and how? Is there a group of people you reallylove or who are important to you? A. \"How would you like me, your health care provider, to address these issues in your health care?\" Or ask the patient,\"What action steps do you need to take in your spiritualjourney?\"Sometimes patients respond with answers such as family, career, or nature. Patients who respond \"yes\" to thespiritual question should also be asked about meaning. These questions can help lead into questions about advance directives and proxies who can represent thepatient's beliefs and values. One can also ask aboutspiritual practices and rituals that might be important topeople. Communities such as churches, tamples, and mosques, or a group of like-minded friends can serve as strong supportsystems for some patients. Often it is not necessary to ask this question but to think about what spiritual issues need to be addressed in thetreatment plan. Examples include, referral to chaplains,pastoral counselors, spiritual directors, journaling, andmusic or art therapy. Sometimes the plan may be simplyto listen and support the person in their journey.Christina Maria Puchalski Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention, Vol 11, 2010: MECC Supplement56meant to be used as checklist but rather as a guide to open the conversation with patients to deeper questions abouta patient's inner life. The spiritual history should be doneroutinely during the social history section of the initialassessment or the annual history and physical exam. Anexample of a social history is in table 2 below taken fromthe curriculum at the George Washington UniversitySchool of Medicine. However, one can ask a spiritualhistory in the context of a specific clinical issue. Forexample, if the patient is coming for a routine visit, onemight address spirituality in the context of stressmanagement or health. If the patient has just been told ofa serious diagnosis, then the questions might be phraseddifferently. For example \"Do you have spiritual beliefsthat have helped you in difficult times before?\" or \"It mustbe hard to hear difficult news like this; do you havespiritual beliefs that might help you right now?\" The goal of all these tools is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of a patient's relationship to spirituality,what the patient's spiritual beliefs are, and what their goalsare for spiritual health. These tools are not meant for useas a checklist but rather to give people the opportunity toshare about their beliefs, hopes, fears and concerns. Thespiritual history helps the clinician understand how thespirituality of the patient helps that patient understand theirillness and health, cope with suffering and find meaningin the midst of what is happening to them. Ethical Guidelines In addressing spiritual issues with patients, it is important to recognize that the conversation is alwayspatient centered and patient led. Proselytizing is not ethicalin the clinical encounter nor is ridiculing patients for theirbeliefs. There is a power differential between patients andclinicians; clinicians should never abuse that power northe trust patients place in them. A clinician that might wantto share his or her beliefs with a patient might inadvertentlyencourage that patient to agree with or adopt the clinician'sbeliefs out of fear that the clinician will not treat the patientwell if the patient does not agree with the clinician.Questions about spirituality should also be asked in amanner that conveys openness to all types of beliefs,humanistic, religious and non-theist alike. A spiritualhistory or assessment must be sensitive enough to identifyconcerns in all patients and ask general questions thatinvite all patients to share what is important to them andtheir care. Integration into Treatment or Care Plans Once spiritual issues are assessed clinicians can then integrate those issues into a treatment plan. Cliniciansneed to make the appropriate referrals to expert spiritualcare professionals such as Board Certified Chaplains orPastoral Counselors or Spiritual Directors. In table Xbelow, an algorithm is described of how spiritual distresscan be identified by clinicians that normally developclinical assessment and plans and make referrals to expertsdepending on the issues. As noted in this figure there arecomplex spiritual issues that need an immediate referralto a chaplain. Simple issues may be able to be handled appropriately by the non-chaplain clinician with a varietyof interventions such as compassionate presence,supporting a patients self described spiritual resources ofstrength such as meditation, hope, strong sense ofmeaning, referral for breath work, encouraging journalingor other reflective practices. Spiritual issues need to beassesses on an ongoing basis as with any other clinicalissues and especially addressed if there is any change inclinical situation with the patient. Two examples of the process is described below: Case 1:\"My life is meaningless\" Ms. Harper is a 75-year-old former advocate for thehomeless, who recently suffered a stroke that left her withmild cognitive impairment and hemiparesis. The meaningin her life came from her work, and since the stroke she isunable to work and feels life has no meaning anymore. Spiritual History F: Atheist; meaning in social activismI: Work is her life and her whole sense of who she isC: Activist communityA: Interested in passing on her dreams to younger peoplewho will carry on her work when she dies. Referral topastoral counselor, find resources for patient to work withstudents, continued presence, journaling (patient may beinterested in recording her narrative or history)InterventionsThe goal is to help Ms. Harper move beyond definingherself by what she did to a deeper intrinsic meaning andvalue of herself as a person. Cognitive-oriented therapycan help. One can ask questions such as: What have been important events in your life?What is the most important event in your life?Have you loved? The chaplain's spiritual assessment would explore Ms.Harper's sense of meaning and existential concerns morecompletely. The assumption should be that it is not thework per se that gives her meaning. If that were the case,any work would do. It is something about this particularwork and what it produces or the good it brings to theworld that has particular salience for her. Some of thequestions might be: Explore Ms Harper's sense of meaning and existential concerns more completely. Work per se may not givemeaning\u2014what is it about the work What is it about social activism that is meaningful?Why is it meaningful?Why is she drawn to the homeless?What events in her life made her who she is? Ms. Harper has obviously already considered how shemight pass on her passion and commitment to those whowill follow her. The \"how\" of this process is fairlystraightforward. The \"what\" is more complicated andshould also be part of an assessment. What ideas and beliefs does she have about the world and our duty to it that she wants to pass on? On an existential level, why be an activist? (Example- Judaism calls all Jews to participate in the healing of theAsian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention, Vol 11, 2010: MECC Supplement 57Formal and Informal Spiritual Assessment References Anandarajah G, Hight E (2001). Spirituality and medical practice: Using the HOPE questions as a practical tool forspiritual assessment. Am Family Physician , 63, 81-9.world.) As always, this process is both an assessment and an intervention in that it gives the patient insight that canhelp her move on and find the same meaning throughactivities that she is still capable of. Sometimes peoplefind meaning in their struggle, sometimes not. But ascaregivers, we can support them in looking beyond theextrinsic and into an intrinsic sense of value in them andfind some meaning for themselves in theirstruggle.Interventions by the non-chaplain clinicians onthe team could include: Help patient create a dream listand facilitate passing onto others, ongoing compassionatepresence and providing connection and listening to MsHarper's life story. The Assessment and Plan for this patient might be: Ms. Harper: 75 yo s/ cva with hemiparesis and mild cognitive impairment Physical: ongoing physical therapy, d/c to rehab when stable Psychological: grief reaction over loss of previous stateof functioning: supportive counseling and continuedpresence Social: engage activist community in her care as much aspossible, home health aid, and financial issues about long-term care Spiritual: meaninglessness, consider referral to pastoralcounselor or chaplain, connection with younger people atmedical school interested in helping homeless, ongoingpresence, provide connection, elicit life story. Case 2:\"Hopelessness\" Ronda is a 58-year old female with end stage ovariancancer. Seven and one half years after multiple surgeriesand chemotherapy with good outcomes, she is now facedwith advanced disease for which there is no longer anytreatment. Her hope has always been for a cure. Now shefaces a deep sense of hopelessness. Hope can be expressed in many ways. It may initially be for a cure, but when that is no longer possible, peoplemay still find hope in finding important projects, makingpeace with others, and having a peaceful death.Hope/hopelessness can also be related to other spiritualdiagnoses. These would include feelings of abandonmentby God and isolation from an important community,religious or otherwise. In general, hopelessness is oftengenerated by a sense of abandonment or isolation- beingabandoned by our communities, being abandoned by ourhigher power, or as in this case, being abandoned by ourown bodies. Thus, the chaplain will always assess for allof the possible sources of the hopelessness. Spiritual History F: Raised Jewish culturally; meaning has always been innature and not in religionI: Spirituality is important and now that she is dying shewould like to know how Judaism views dying and whatrituals might help herC: Friends are her spiritual supportA: Would like to see a Rabbi to discuss her spiritualquestions with him. Referral to chaplain to help connect patient with Rabbi, dream list, explore sources of hopeWhile the spiritual history suggests that Rhonda's supportto this point has come from friends, there are strongindications that she wants to explore her Jewish historyas a source of spiritual support. Thus the chaplain'sassessment questions would include: What was her upbringing from a Jewish perspective? What is her experience with Jewish ritual? If she did have some level of Jewish practice earlier in her life, why did she leave that? What does it mean to her to be a \"good Jew\"?What is her belief about an afterlife? The interventions by the non chaplain clinicians on theteam might include helping Ronda create a dream list,listening to her story and her relationships with peopleand with God, talking about her sources of hope in pasttimes as well as current and helping her accomplish herdreams and wishes if possible. Ronda's Assessment and Plan might be: Ronda52 yo with end stage ovarian ca . Physical: pain is well controlled; continue with current medication regimen. Nausea; still has episodes of nauseaand vomiting, likely secondary to partial small bowelobstruction (SBO). Add octreotide to current regimen Psychological: grief reaction that \"fight is over\". Tearful,difficulty sleeping. Supportive counseling and continuedpresence. Social: Ronda concerned about how to tell family she isdying; social worker to arrange for family meeting Spiritual: hopelessness, main source of meaning in\"winning the fight\", active in ovarian cancer alliance andseen as inspiration. Not religious but now wants to learnhow \"Jewish Patients die?\"Dream List, legacy building, encourage talking withOvarian Cancer Alliance, referral to chaplain and to Rabbi(choice of Rabbi might be impact by chaplain assessmentabove) Conclusion Spirituality is an essential element of the care of patients. A National Consensus Conference developed amodel for interprofessional spiritual care where allmembers of the healthcare team address patients'spirituality and refer to the spiritual care professionals onthe team, such as board certified chaplains, pastoralcounselors and spiritual directors. There are formal andinformal ways of communicating with patients about theirspiritual issues. Formal ways include doing a spiritualscreening, history and assessment. Spirituality should beintegrated into the assessment and plan of patients'treatment and care plans and followed up as with any otherclinical issue.Christina Maria Puchalski Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention, Vol 11, 2010: MECC Supplement58Boston P, Puchalski CM, O'Donnell JF (2006).
