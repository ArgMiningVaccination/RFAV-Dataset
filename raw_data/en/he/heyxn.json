Thousands of years ago, a man was moving through the mountains of Europe with what were, at the time, advanced technologies. He had a copper axe, which probably meant he was a high-status individual. He also had numerous herbs with him, which may have been used as state of the art medications at the time. Nowadays, we don't consider herbs to be state of the art medicine. Instead, we consider them to be a part of alternative medicine, medicine and therapies that are used instead of mainstream medicine, such as prescription medication and surgery. Other terms for alternative medicine are integrative or complementary medicine. What must be made clear, however, is that while stated as alternative, that doesn't mean the alternative practice is truly as effective as traditional medicine. So, it's alternative only in the sense that's different, not in the sense that it is different and just as effective. The same goes for the term 'complementary medicine.' The use of complementary techniques doesn't imply that mainstream (scientific) medicine will become more effective. Keeping that in mind, this lesson goes over some types and examples of alternative medicine. Herbs, Acupuncture & Acupressure The man mentioned in the introduction is now known as Otzi. He is named for the Otztal Alps, where he was discovered in 1991. He appears to have died sometimes around 3200 B.C. but was found in a miraculously well-preserved state. It's because of this that we know he carried various herbs with him the day he was, what most believe, murdered by someone else. Herbal medicine is thus, one type of alternative medicine. Herbal medicine relies on all sorts of roots, bark, flowers, berries, and leaves of various plants or fungi to either prevent, cure or minimize a medical condition's effect on the body. For example, Valerian root is believed by many to help relax a person and might thus be used by some to help treat insomnia. Otzi himself carried the woody fruit of a fungus known as Piptoporus betulinus. Piptoporus betulinus contains compounds that might be effective against diarrhea caused by parasites or bacteria. Otzi relied on another kind of state of the art therapy at the time, one that's considered alternative nowadays. He has tattoos on his body that many believe were used as markers and points for acupressure or acupuncture, which involves stimulation for various conditions. Indeed these might have been conditions Otzi had, such as abdominal pain stemming from intestinal parasites. This means Otzi used these two alternative therapies thousands of years before the Chinese, who made these therapies famous, ever did. Aromatherapy and Meditation It's possible although not proven, that some of the substances Otzi carried may have been used as a part of aromatherapy, another kind of alternative medicine. This form of alternative medicine uses various plant material and plant oils in order to improve a person's mental and physical state with smell. Indeed, aromatherapy practitioners believe that by smelling one kind of odor or another, various benefits could be reaped. As an example, some believe the chamomile essential oil could help with everything from stress and pain relief to urinary infections. Stress may be relieved with yet another type of alternative medicine; meditation, although we don't know if Otzi had any time for this. Meditation uses any number of combinations of breathing, posture, thought, sound and visualization techniques to help a person relax. This is actually important because science is well aware of the fact that stress can suppress the immune system, which can leave a person vulnerable to infection by viruses, bacteria, and the like. Homeopathy And, for this lesson at least, the last kind of alternative medicine is known as homeopathy, which was developed way after Otzi's death. This form of alternative medicine will take various organic or inorganic substances and dilute them into extremely small quantities. The less of the substances present in the compounds that will be used, the more powerful it supposedly becomes at healing. One example of a homeopathic remedy is the element sulfur, which might help some people with burning pain when used as directed. Lesson Summary Poor Otzi almost certainly experienced all sorts of pain towards the very end of his life, although it's unlikely he practiced homeopathy, one kind of alternative medicine. Alternative medicine, also called integrative or complementary medicine, refers to various therapies not used by mainstream (scientific) medicine. Some examples of alternative medicine include: - Herbal medicine, which relies on all sorts of roots, bark, flowers, berries, and leaves of various plants or fungi to either prevent, cure or minimize a medical condition's effect on the body. - Acupressure and acupuncture, which involves the stimulation of various points on the body to heal oneself. - Aromatherapy, which uses the use of smell to help relieve various problems. - Meditation, which involves the use any number of combinations of breathing, posture, thought, sound and visualization techniques in order to help destress. - Homeopathy, which is the use of highly diluted substances to heal.

This particular provider specializes in herbal medicine. Following an examination, the practitioner shares her diagnosis and treatment plan with Jim. The treatment includes a combination of herbal remedies. She prescribes the following herbs and dosages: - Valerian (Vakeriana officianlis) in the form of a 250-mg tablet two times a day - Kava (Piper methysticum) as a 250-mg standardized extract capsule two times a day - Chamomile (Matricaria recutita) in the form of dried flowers from the plant to be steeped in hot water and the liquid sipped before bed Activity: Practical Application 1. Research the three herbs and identify the conditions they are commonly used to treat and how they produce the desired therapeutic effects. Based upon the uses for the three herbs, what condition or conditions do you think Jim is being treated for? 2. Identify the side effects associated with the herbs and any precautions Jim must take while using them. For example: a) Should Jim be concerned about driving or operating machinery after consuming the herbs? b) What symptoms may Jim notice after consuming the herbs, such as dizziness or a stomachache? c) What medications may interact with the herbs the practitioner prescribed for Jim? 3. Based upon the condition that you think Jim was diagnosed with, what additional herbs may be helpful? Solution Jim was experiencing anxiety. The herbs prescribed are calming and help alleviate those symptoms; however, Jim does need to be careful as they may have a sedative effect. \"Medical Disclaimer: The information on this site is for your information only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.\" Register to view this lesson Unlock Your Education See for yourself why 30 million people use Study.com Become a Study.com member and start learning now.
