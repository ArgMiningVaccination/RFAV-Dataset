The development of trade must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Contracting Parties. 3. The EC Commission as well as the EFTA Surveillance Authority shall ensure within their respective competence the application of the provisions of this Article and shall, where necessary, address appro \u00ad priate measures to the States falling within their respective territory. Article 60 Annex XIV contains specific provisions giving effect to the principles set out in Articles 53, 54, 57 and 59. CHAPTER 2 STATE AID Article 61 1.

Article 62 1. All existing systems of State aid in the territory of the Contracting Parties, as well as any plans to grant or alter State aid, shall be subject to constant review as to their compatibility with Article 61. This review shall be carried out: (a) as regards the EC Member States, by the EC Commission according to the rules laid down in Article 93 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community; (b) as regards the EFTA States, by the EFTA Surveillance Authority according to the rules set out in an agreement between the EFTA States establishing the EFTA Surveillance Authority which is entrusted with the powers and functions laid down in Protocol 26. 2.

Article 63 Annex XV contains specific provisions on State aid. Article 64 1. If one of the surveillance authorities considers that the implemen \u00ad tation by the other surveillance authority of Articles 61 and 62 of this Agreement and Article 5 of Protocol 14 is not in conformity with the maintenance of equal conditions of competition within the territory covered by this Agreement, exchange of views shall be held within two weeks according to the procedure of Protocol 27, paragraph (f). B 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 30 If a commonly agreed solution has not been found by the end of this two-week period, the competent authority of the affected Contracting Party may immediately adopt appropriate interim measures in order to remedy the resulting distortion of competition. Consultations shall then be held in the EEA Joint Committee with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution. If within three months the EEA Joint Committee has not been able to find such a solution, and if the practice in question causes, or threatens to cause, distortion of competition affecting trade between the Contracting Parties, the interim measures may be replaced by definitive measures, strictly necessary to offset the effect of such distortion. Priority shall be given to such measures that will least disturb the functioning of the EEA. 2. The provisions of this Article will also apply to State monopolies, which are established after the date of signature of the Agreement. CHAPTER 3 OTHER COMMON RULES Article 65 1.

They shall, in particular, exchange information and, at the request of a Contracting Party, hold consultations within the EEA Joint Committee in respect of plans or proposals for the establishment or amendment of framework programmes, specific programmes, actions and projects in the fields referred to in Article 78. 3. Part VII shall apply mutatis mutandis with regard to this Part whenever the latter or Protocol 31 specifically provides therefor. Article 80 The cooperation provided for in Article 78 shall normally take one of the following forms: \u2014 participation by EFTA States in EC framework programmes, specific programmes, projects or other actions; \u2014 establishment of joint activities in specific areas, which may include concertation or coordination of activities, fusion of existing activities and establishment of ad hoc joint activities; \u2014 the formal and informal exchange or provision of information; \u2014 common efforts to encourage certain activities throughout the territory of the Contracting Parties; \u2014 parallel legislation, where appropriate, of identical or similar content; \u2014 coordination, where this is of mutual interest, of efforts and activities via, or in the context of, international organizations, and of cooperation with third countries.

The terms and conditions of the continued participation in the activity in question may be reviewed by the EEA Joint Committee in accordance with Article 86. (d) At the project level, institutions, undertakings, organizations and nationals of EFTA States shall have the same rights and obligations in the Community programme or other action in question as those applicable to partner institutions, undertakings, organizations and nationals of EC Member States. The same shall apply mutatis mutandis to participants in exchanges between EC Member States and EFTA States, under the activity in question. (e) EFTA States, their institutions, undertakings, organizations and nationals shall have the same rights and obligations with regard to dissemination, evaluation and exploitation of results as those applicable to EC Member States, their institutions, undertakings, organizations and nationals.

Article 82 1. When the cooperation envisaged under the present Part involves a financial participation of the EFTA States, this participation shall take one of the following forms: (a) The contribution of the EFTA States, arising from their participation in Community activities, shall be calculated proportionally: \u2014 to the commitment appropriations; and \u2014 to the payment appropriations; entered each year for the Community in the general budget of the Community for each budgetary line corresponding to the activities in question. The 'proportionality factor' determining the participation of the EFTA States shall be the sum of the ratios between, on the one hand, the gross domestic product at market prices of each of the EFTA States and, on the other hand, the sum of the gross domestic products at market prices of the EC Member States and of that EFTA State. This factor shall be calculated, for each budgetary year, on the basis of the most recent statistical data. The amount of the contribution of the EFTA States shall be additional, both in commitment appropriations and in payment appropriations, to the amounts entered for the Community in the general budget on each line corresponding to the activities concerned. The contributions to be paid each year by the EFTA States shall be determined on the basis of the payment appropriations. Commitments entered into by the Community prior to the entry into force, on the basis of this Agreement, of the participation of the EFTA States in the activities in question \u2014 as well as the payments which result from this \u2014 shall give rise to no contribution on the part of the EFTA States. B 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 35 (b) The financial contribution of the EFTA States deriving from their participation in certain projects or other activities shall be based on the principle that each Contracting Party shall cover its own costs, with an appropriate contribution which shall be fixed by the EEA Joint Committee to the Community's overhead costs. (c) The EEA Joint Committee shall take the necessary decisions concerning the contribution of the Contracting Parties to the costs of the activity in question. 2. The detailed provisions for the implementation of this Article are set out in Protocol 32. Article 83 Where cooperation takes the form of an exchange of information between public authorities, the EFTA States shall have the same rights to receive, and obligations to provide, information as EC Member States, subject to the requirements of confidentiality, which shall be fixed by the EEA Joint Committee.

Article 85 Unless otherwise provided for in Protocol 31, cooperation already estab \u00ad lished between the Community and individual EFTA States in the fields referred to in Article 78 on the date of entry into force of this Agreement shall thereafter be governed by the relevant provisions of this Part and of Protocol 31. Article 86 The EEA Joint Committee shall, in accordance with Part VII, take all decisions necessary for the implementation of Articles 78 to 85 and measures derived therefrom, which may include, inter alia, supple\u00ad menting and amending the provisions of Protocol 31, as well as adopting any transitional arrangements required by way of implemen \u00ad tation of Article 85.

Article 99 1. As soon as new legislation is being drawn up by the EC Commission in a field which is governed by this Agreement, the EC Commission shall informally seek advice from experts of the EFTA States in the same way as it seeks advice from experts of the EC Member States for the elaboration of its proposals. B 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 39 2. When transmitting its proposal to the Council of the European Communities, the EC Commission shall transmit copies thereof to the EFTA States. At the request of one of the Contracting Parties, a preliminary exchange of views takes place in the EEA Joint Committee. 3. During the phase preceding the decision of the Council of the European Communities, in a continuous information and consultation process, the Contracting Parties consult each other again in the EEA Joint Committee at the significant moments at the request of one of them. 4. The Contracting Parties shall cooperate in good faith during the information and consultation phase with a view to facilitating, at the end of the process, the decision-taking in the EEA Joint Committee. Article 100 The EC Commission shall ensure experts of the EFTA States as wide a participation as possible according to the areas concerned, in the preparatory stage of draft measures to be submitted subsequently to the committees which assist the EC Commission in the exercise of its executive powers. In this regard, when drawing up draft measures the EC Commission shall refer to experts of the EFTA States on the same basis as it refers to experts of the EC Member States. In the cases where the Council of the European Communities is seized in accordance with the procedure applicable to the type of committee involved, the EC Commission shall transmit to the Council of the European Communities the views of the experts of the EFTA States. Article 101 1. In respect of committees which are covered neither by Article 81 nor by Article 100 experts from EFTA States shall be associated with the work when this is called for by the good functioning of this Agreement, These committees are listed in Protocol 37. The modalities of such an association are set out in the relevant sectoral Protocols and Annexes dealing with the matter concerned. 2. If it appears to the Contracting Parties that such an association should be extended to other committees which present similar char \u00ad acteristics, the EEA Joint Committee may amend Protocol 37. Article 102 1. In order to guarantee the legal security and the homogeneity of the EEA, the EEA Joint Committee shall take a decision concerning an amendment of an Annex to this Agreement as closely as possible to the adoption by the Community of the corresponding new Community legislation with a view to permitting a simultaneous application of the latter as well as of the amendments of the Annexes to the Agreement. To this end, the Community shall, whenever adopting a legislative act on an issue which is governed by this Agreement, as soon as possible inform the other Contracting Parties in the EEA Joint Committee. B 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 40 2. The part of an Annex to this Agreement which would be directly affected by the new legislation is assessed in the EEA Joint Committee. 3. The Contracting Parties shall make all efforts to arrive at an agreement on matters relevant to this Agreement. The EEA Joint Committee shall, in particular, make every effort to find a mutually acceptable solution where a serious problem arises in any area which, in the EFTA States, falls within the competence of the legislator. 4. If, notwithstanding the application of the preceding paragraph, an agreement on an amendment of an Annex to this Agreement cannot be reached, the EEA Joint Committee shall examine all further possibilities to maintain the good functioning of this Agreement and take any decision necessary to this effect, including the possibility to take notice of the equivalence of legislation. Such a decision shall be taken at the latest at the expiry of a period of six months from the date of referral to the EEA Joint Committee or, if that date is later, on the date of entry into force of the corresponding Community legislation. 5. If, at the end of the time-limit set out in paragraph 4, the EEA Joint Committee has not taken a decision on an amendment of an Annex to this Agreement, the affected part thereof, as determined in accordance with paragraph 2, is regarded as provisionally suspended, subject to a decision to the contrary by the EEA Joint Committee. Such a suspension shall take effect six months after the end of the period referred to in paragraph 4, but in no event earlier than the date on which the corresponding EC act is implemented in the Community. The EEA Joint Committee shall pursue its efforts to agree on a mutually acceptable solution in order for the suspension to be terminated as soon as possible. 6. The practical consequences of the suspension referred to in paragraph 5 shall be discussed in the EEA Joint Committee. The rights and obligations which individuals and economic operators have already acquired under this Agreement shall remain. The Contracting Parties shall, as appropriate, decide on the adjustments necessary due to the suspension. Article 103 1. If a decision of the EEA Joint Committee can be binding on a Contracting Party only after the fulfilment of constitutional require \u00ad ments, the decision shall, if a date is contained therein, enter into force on that date, provided that the Contracting Party concerned has notified the other Contracting Parties by that date that the constitutional requirements have been fulfilled. In the absence of such a notification by that date, the decision shall enter into force on the first day of the second month following the last notification. 2. If upon the expiry of a period of six months after the decision of the EEA Joint Committee such a notification has not taken place, the decision of the EEA Joint Committee shall be applied provisionally pending the fulfilment of the constitutional requirements unless a Contracting Party notifies that such a provisional application cannot take place. In the latter case, or if a Contracting Party notifies the non-ratification of a decision of the EEA Joint Committee, the suspension provided for in Article 102(5) shall take effect one month after such a notification but in no event earlier than the date on which the corresponding EC act is implemented in the Community.

CHAPTER 3 HOMOGENEITY, SURVEILLANCE PROCEDURE AND SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES S e c t i o n 1 Homogeneity Article 105 1. In order to achieve the objective of the Contracting Parties to arrive at as uniform an interpretation as possible of the provisions of the Agreement and those provisions of Community legislation which are substantially reproduced in the Agreement, the EEA Joint Committee shall act in accordance with this Article. 2. The EEA Joint Committee shall keep under constant review the development of the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the EFTA Court. To this end judgments of these Courts shall be transmitted to the EEA Joint Committee which shall act so as to preserve the homogeneous interpretation of the Agreement. 3.

The Contracting Parties shall immediately enter into consultations in the EEA Joint Committee with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution. 3. The Contracting Party concerned may not take safeguard measures until one month has elapsed after the date of notification under paragraph 1, unless the consultation procedure under paragraph 2 has been concluded before the expiration of the stated time-limit. When exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action exclude prior examination, the Contracting Party concerned may apply forthwith the protective measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation.

If a safeguard measure taken by a Contracting Party creates an imbalance between the rights and obligations under this Agreement, any other Contracting Party may towards that Contracting Party take such proportionate rebalancing measures as are strictly necessary to remedy the imbalance. Priority shall be given to such measures as will least disturb the functioning of the EEA. 2. The procedure under Article 113 shall apply.

TITLE II DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT OF 'ORIGINATING PRODUCTS' Article 2 General requirements 1. For the purpose of implementing the Agreement, the following products shall be considered as originating in the EEA: (a) products wholly obtained in the EEA within the meaning of Article 4; (b) products obtained in the EEA incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing in the EEA within the meaning of Article 5. For this purpose, the territories of the Contracting Parties to which the Agreement applies, shall be considered as a single territory. 2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the territory of the Principality of Liechtenstein shall be excluded from that of the EEA, for the purpose of determining the origin of the products referred to in Tables I and II of Protocol 3 and such products shall be considered to be originating in the EEA only if they have been either wholly obtained or sufficiently worked or processed in the territories of the other Contracting Parties. Article 3 Diagonal cumulation of origin 1. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2, products shall be considered as originating in the EEA if they are obtained there, incor \u00ad porating materials originating in Switzerland (including Liechten \u00ad stein) ( 1 ), Iceland, Norway, the Faroe Islands, Turkey, the European Union or in any participant in the European Union's Stabilisation and Association Process ( 2 ), provided that the working or processing carried out in the EEA goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6. It shall not be necessary for such materials to have undergone sufficient working or processing. M298 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 112 ( 1 ) The Principality of Liechtenstein has a customs union with Switzerland, and is a Contracting Party to the Agreement of the European Economic Area. ( 2 ) Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Mace \u00ad donia, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo under UNSC Resolution 1244/99. 2. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2, products shall be considered as originating in the EEA if they are obtained there, incor \u00ad porating materials originating in any country which is a participant in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, based on the Barcelona Declaration adopted at the Euro-Mediterranean Conference held on 27 and 28 November 1995, other than Turkey ( 1 ), provided that the working or processing carried out in the EEA goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6. It shall not be necessary for such materials to have undergone sufficient working or processing. 3. Where the working or processing carried out in the EEA does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 6, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the EEA only where the value added there is greater than the value of the materials used originating in any one of the countries referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. If this is not so, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the country which accounts for the highest value of originating materials used in the manufacture in the EEA. 4. Products, originating in one of the countries referred to in para \u00ad graphs 1 and 2, which do not undergo any working or processing in the EEA shall retain their origin if exported into one of these countries. 5. The cumulation provided for in this Article may be applied only provided that: (a) a preferential trade agreement in accordance with Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is applicable between the countries involved in the acquisition of the originating status and the country of destination; (b) materials and products have acquired originating status by the appli \u00ad cation of rules of origin identical to those given in this Protocol; and (c) notices indicating the fulfilment of the necessary requirements to apply cumulation have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series) and in the other Contracting Parties according to their own procedures. The cumulation provided for in this Article shall apply from the date indicated in the notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union (C series). The European Union shall provide the other Contracting Parties, through the European Commission, with details of the Agreements, including their dates of entry into force, and their corresponding rules of origin, which are applied with the other countries referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.

Article 4 Wholly obtained products 1. The following shall be considered as wholly obtained in the EEA: (a) mineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed; (b) vegetable products harvested there; (c) live animals born and raised there; (d) products from live animals raised there; (e) products obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there; (f) products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea outside the territorial waters of the Contracting Parties by their vessels; (g) products made aboard their factory ships exclusively from products referred to in (f); (h) used articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials, including used tyres fit only for retreading or for use as waste; (i) waste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there; (j) products extracted from marine soil or subsoil outside their terri \u00ad torial waters provided that they have sole rights to work that soil or subsoil; (k) goods produced there exclusively from the products specified in (a) to (j). 2. The terms 'their vessels' and 'their factory ships' in paragraph 1(f) and (g) shall apply only to vessels and factory ships: (a) which are registered or recorded in a Member State of the European Union or in an EFTA State; (b) which sail under the flag of a Member State of the European Union or of an EFTA State; (c) which are owned to an extent of at least 50 % by nationals of a Member State of the European Union or of an EFTA State, or by a company with its head office in one of these States, of which the manager or managers, Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Supervisory Board, and the majority of the members of such boards are nationals of a Member State of the European Union or of an EFTA State and of which, in addition, in the case of partnerships or limited companies, at least half the capital belongs to those States or to public bodies or nationals of the said States; M298 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 114 (d) of which the master and officers are nationals of a Member State of the European Union or of an EFTA State; and (e) of which at least 75 % of the crew are nationals of a Member State of the European Union or of an EFTA State. Article 5 Sufficiently worked or processed products 1. For the purposes of Article 2, products which are not wholly obtained shall considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Annex II are fulfilled. The conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by the Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. It follows that if a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture. 2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list in Annex II, should not be used in the manufacture of a product may nevertheless be used, provided that: (a) their total value does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the product; (b) any of the percentages given in the list for the maximum value of non-originating materials are not exceeded by virtue of this paragraph. This paragraph shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System. 3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply subject to the provisions of Article 6. Article 6 Insufficient working or processing 1. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the following operations shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not the requirements of Article 5 are satisfied: (a) preserving operations to ensure that the products remain in good condition during transport and storage; (b) breaking-up and assembly of packages; M298 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 115 (c) washing, cleaning; removal of dust, oxide, oil, paint or other coverings; (d) ironing or pressing of textiles; (e) simple painting and polishing operations; (f) husking, partial or total bleaching, polishing, and glazing of cereals and rice; (g) operations to colour sugar or form sugar lumps; (h) peeling, stoning and shelling, of fruits, nuts and vegetables; (i) sharpening, simple grinding or simple cutting; (j) sifting, screening, sorting, classifying, grading, matching; (including the making-up of sets of articles); (k) simple placing in bottles, cans, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards and all other simple packaging operations; (l) affixing or printing marks, labels, logos and other like distin \u00ad guishing signs on products or their packaging; (m) simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds; (n) mixing of sugar with any material; (o) simple assembly of parts of articles to constitute a complete article or disassembly of products into parts; (p) a combination of two or more operations specified in (a) to (o); (q) slaughter of animals. 2. All operations carried out in the EEA on a given product shall be considered together when determining whether the working or processing undergone by that product is to be regarded as insufficient within the meaning of paragraph 1. Article 7 Unit of qualification 1. The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonised System. M298 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 116 It follows that: (a) when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the Harmonised System in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification; (b) when a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonised System, each product must be taken individually when applying the provisions of this Protocol. 2. Where, under General Rule 5 of the Harmonised System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin. Article 8 Accessories, spare parts and tools Accessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question. Article 9 Sets Sets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonised System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 % of the ex-works price of the set. Article 10 Neutral elements In order to determine whether a product is an originating product, it shall not be necessary to determine the origin of the following which might be used in its manufacture: (a) energy and fuel; (b) plant and equipment; (c) machines and tools; (d) goods which neither enter into the final composition of the product nor are intended to do so. M298 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 117 TITLE III TERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS Article 11 Principle of territoriality 1. Except as provided for in Article 3 and paragraph 3 of this Article, the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in Title II must be fulfilled without interruption in the EEA. 2. Except as provided for in Article 3, where originating goods exported from the EEA to another country return, they must be considered as non-originating, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that: (a) the returning goods are the same as those exported; and (b) they have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being exported. 3. The acquisition of originating status in accordance with the conditions set out in Title II shall not be affected by working or processing done outside the EEA on materials exported from the EEA and subsequently reimported there, provided: (a) the said materials are wholly obtained in the EEA or have undergone working or processing beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 prior to being exported; and (b) it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that: (i) the reimported goods have been obtained by working or processing the exported materials; and (ii) the total added value acquired outside the EEA by applying the provisions of this Article does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the end product for which originating status is claimed. 4. For the purposes of paragraph 3, the conditions for acquiring originating status set out in Title II shall not apply to working or processing done outside the EEA. However, where, in the list in Annex II, a rule setting a maximum value for all the non-originating materials incorporated is applied in determining the originating status of the end product, the total value of the non-originating materials incor \u00ad porated in the territory of the party concerned, taken together with the total added value acquired outside the EEA by applying the provisions of this Article, shall not exceed the stated percentage. M298 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 118 5. For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, 'total added value' shall be taken to mean all costs arising outside the EEA, including the value of the materials incorporated there. 6. The provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products which do not fulfil the conditions set out in the list in Annex II or which can be considered sufficiently worked or processed only if the general tolerance fixed in Article 5(2) is applied. 7.

For the implementation of paragraphs 1 and 2, the exporter must indicate in his application the place and date of exportation of the products to which the movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED relates, and state the reasons for his request. 4. The customs authorities may issue a movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED retrospectively only after verifying that the information supplied in the exporter's application complies with that in the corresponding file. 5.

Where considerable cost or material difficulties arise in keeping separate stocks of originating and non-originating materials which are identical and interchangeable, the customs authorities may, at the written request of those concerned, authorise the so-called 'accounting segregation' method (hereinafter referred to as the 'method') to be used for managing such stocks. 2. The method must be able to ensure that, for a specific reference period, the number of products obtained which could be considered as 'originating' is the same as that which would have been obtained had there been physical segregation of the stocks. 3. The customs authorities may make the grant of authorisation referred to in paragraph 1, subject to any conditions deemed appropriate. 4. The method shall be applied and on the application thereof shall be recorded on the basis of the general accounting principles applicable in the country where the product was manufactured. 5. The beneficiary of the method may make out or apply for proofs of origin, as the case may be, for the quantity of products which may be considered as originating. At the request of the customs authorities, the beneficiary shall provide a statement of how the quantities have been managed. 6.

Proofs of origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances. 3. In other cases of belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing country may accept the proofs of origin where the products have been submitted before the said final date. Article 24 Submission of proof of origin Proofs of origin shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing country in accordance with the procedures applicable in that country.

When a movement certificate EUR.1 is issued, or an origin declaration is made out, in one of the Contracting Parties for originating products, in the manufacture of which goods coming from other Contracting Parties which have undergone working or processing in the EEA without having obtained preferential originating status have been used, account shall be taken of the supplier's declaration given for these goods in accordance with this Article. 2. The supplier's declaration referred to in paragraph 1 shall serve as evidence of the working or processing undergone in the EEA by the goods concerned for the purpose of determining whether the products in the manufacture of which these goods are used, may be considered as products originating in the EEA and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol. 3.

A long-term supplier's declaration may normally be valid for a period of up to one year from the date of making out the declaration. The customs authorities of the country where the declaration is made out lay down the conditions under which longer periods may be used. The long term supplier's declaration shall be made out by the supplier in the form prescribed in Annex VI and shall describe the goods concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified. It shall be provided to the customer concerned before he is supplied with the first consignment of goods covered by this declaration or together with his first consignment. The supplier shall inform his customer immediately if the long-term supplier's declaration is no longer applicable to the goods supplied. 5. The supplier's declaration referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall be typed or printed using one of the languages in which the Agreement is drawn up, in accordance with the provisions of the national law of the country where it is made out, and shall bear the original signature of the supplier in manuscript. The declaration may also be hand-written; in such a case, it shall be written in ink in printed characters. M298 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 129 6.

Article 30 Discrepancies and formal errors 1. The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the proof of origin and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted. 2. Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin should not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document. Article 31 Amounts expressed in euro 1. For the application of the provisions of Article 21(1)(b) and Article 26(3) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than euro, amounts in the national currencies of the Member States of the European Union and of the countries referred to in Article 3 equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixed annually by each of the countries concerned.

The amounts shall be communicated to the European Commission by 15 October and shall apply from 1 January the following year. The European Commission shall notify all countries concerned of the relevant amounts. 4. A country may round up or down the amount resulting from the conversion into its national currency of an amount expressed in euro. The rounded-off amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than 5 %. A country may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any rounding-off, results in an increase of less than 15 % cent in the national currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion were to result in a decrease in that equivalent value. 5. The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the EEA Joint Committee at the request of the Contracting Parties. When carrying out this review, the EEA Joint Committee shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For this purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euro. TITLE VI ARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION Article 32 Administrative cooperation 1. The customs authorities of the Contracting Parties shall provide each other, through the European Commission, with specimen impressions of stamps used in their customs offices for the issue of movement certificates EUR.1 and EUR-MED, and with the addresses of the customs authorities responsible for verifying those certificates, origin declarations and origin declarations EUR-MED or suppliers' declarations. 2.

Article 2 Scope 1. Without prejudice to the specific provisions in force under agreements concluded between the European Economic Community and EFTA States, this Protocol shall apply to inspections and formalities concerning the carriage of goods which have to cross a frontier between an EFTA State and the Community, as well as between the EFTA States. 2. This Protocol shall not apply to inspections or formalities: \u2014 in respect of ships and aircraft as means of transport; however, it shall apply to vehicles and goods carried by the said means of transport; \u2014 required for the issue of health or plant health certificates in the country of origin or of provenance of the goods. M219 3. The customs security measures in Chapter IIa and Annexes I and II to the Protocol shall only apply between the Community and Norway. 4. When reference is made to the customs territory of the Contracting Parties in Chapter IIa and Annexes I and II to this Protocol, it covers: \u2014 the customs territory of the Community, \u2014 the customs territory of Norway. B 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 164 CHAPTER II PROCEDURES Article 3 Random checks and formalities 1. Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Protocol, the Contracting Parties shall take the necessary measures to ensure that: \u2014 the different inspections and formalities provided for in Article 2(1) are carried out with the minimum delay necessary and, in so far as possible, at one place; \u2014 inspections are carried out by means of random checks, except in duly justified circumstances. 2. For the purposes of implementing the second indent of paragraph 1, the basis for carrying out random checks shall be the total number of consignments passing through a frontier post and presented to a customs office or inspection authority during a given period, and not the total number of goods making up each consignment. 3. The Contracting Parties shall facilitate, at the places of departure and destination of goods, the use of simplified procedures and data processing and data transmission techniques for the purposes of the export, transit and import of goods. 4. The Contracting Parties shall endeavour to deploy customs offices, including those in the interior of their territory, in such a way as best to take account of the requirements of commercial operators. Article 4 Veterinary rules In areas relating to the protection of human and animal health and the protection of animals, implementation of the principles set out in Articles 3, 7 and 13 and the rules governing the fees to be charged in respect of the formalities and inspections carried out shall be decided upon by the EEA Joint Committee in accordance with Article 93(2) of the Agreement. Article 5 Plant health rules 1. Plant health inspections of imports shall take the form only of random checks and sample testing except in duly justified circum \u00ad stances. Such inspections shall be carried out at either the place of destination of the goods or another place designated within the respective territories on condition that the itinerary of the goods is affected to the least possible extent. 2. Rules governing the carrying out of identity checks on imports in relation to goods covered by plant health legislation shall be adopted by the EEA Joint Committee in accordance with Article 3(2) of the Agreement. The measures pertaining to the fees to be charged in respect of plant health formalities and inspections shall be decided upon by the EEA Joint Committee in accordance with Article 93(2) of the Agreement. B 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 165 3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to goods other than those produced in the Community or in an EFTA State except in cases where, by their nature, they present no plant health risk or in cases where they have undergone a plant health inspection on entering the territory of the respective Contracting Parties, and are found, at the time of such inspections, to meet the requirements relating to plant health laid down in their legislation. 4. Where a Contracting Party considers that there is imminent danger of the introduction or spread of harmful organisms in its territory, it may take such temporary measures as are necessary to protect itself against that danger. The Contracting Parties shall notify one another forthwith of the measures taken and of the reasons which made them necessary. Article 6 Delegation of powers The Contracting Parties shall see to it that, by express delegation by the competent authorities and on their behalf, one of the other services represented, and preferably the customs service, may carry out inspections for which those authorities are responsible and, in so far as such inspections relate to the requirement to produce the necessary documents, checks on the validity and authenticity thereof and on the identity of the goods declared in such documents. In that event the authorities concerned shall ensure that the means required for carrying out such checks are made available. Article 7 Recognition of inspections and documents For the purposes of implementing this Protocol and without prejudice to the possibility of carrying out random checks, the Contracting Parties shall, in the event of goods being imported or entering in transit, recognize the inspections carried out and the documents drawn up by the competent authorities of the other Contracting Parties which certify that the goods comply with the legal requirements of the country of import or equivalent requirements in the country of export. Article 8 Opening hours of frontier posts 1. Where the volume of traffic so warrants, the Contracting Parties shall see to it that: (a) frontier posts are open, except when traffic is prohibited, so that: \u2014 frontiers can be crossed 24 hours a day with the corresponding inspections and formalities in respect of goods placed under a customs transit procedure, their means of transport and vehicles travelling unladen, save where frontier inspection is necessary in order to prevent the spread of disease or protect animals; \u2014 inspections and formalities relating to the movement of means of transport and goods which are not moving under a customs transit procedure may be performed from Monday to Friday during an uninterrupted period of at least 10 hours, and on Saturday during an uninterrupted period of at least six hours, unless those days are public holidays; B 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 166 (b) as regards vehicles and goods transported by air, the periods referred to in the second indent of subparagraph (a) are adapted in such a way as to meet actual needs and for that purpose are split or extended if necessary. 2. Where general compliance with the periods referred to in the second indent of subparagraph l(a) and in subparagraph l(b) poses problems for veterinary services, the Contracting Parties shall see to it that, subject to at least 12 hours' notice being given by the carrier, a veterinary expert is available during those periods; in the case of the transport of live animals, however, the period of such notice may be increased to 18 hours. 3. Where several frontier posts are situated in the immediate vicinity of one and the same frontier zone, the Contracting Parties concerned may jointly agree for certain of such posts, to derogate from paragraph 1 provided that the other posts in that zone are able to clear goods and vehicles in accordance with that paragraph. 4. As regards the frontier posts and customs offices and services referred to in paragraph 1, and under the conditions laid down by the Contracting Parties, the competent authorities shall, if specifically requested during business hours and for sound reasons, provide for inspections and formalities to be carried out, as an exception, outside business hours, on condition that, where relevant, payment is made for services so rendered. Article 9 Express lanes The Contracting Parties shall endeavour to establish at frontier posts, where technically possible and justified by the volume of traffic, express lanes reserved for goods placed under a customs transit procedure, their means of transport, vehicles travelling unladen and all goods subject to such inspections and formalities as do not exceed those required in respect of goods placed under a transit procedure. M219 CHAPTER IIa CUSTOMS SECURITY MEASURES Article 9a Definitions For the purposes of this Chapter: (a) 'risk' shall mean the likelihood of an event occurring in connection with the entry, exit, transit, transfer and end-use of goods moved between the customs territory of one of the Contracting Parties and third countries and the presence of goods that are not in free circu \u00ad lation, which pose a threat to the security and safety of the Contracting Parties, to public health, to the environment or to consumers; B 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 167 (b) 'risk management' shall mean the systematic identification of risk and implementation of all measures necessary for limiting exposure to risk. This includes activities such as collecting data and information, analysing and assessing risk, prescribing and taking action and regular monitoring and review of the process and its outcomes, based on sources and strategies defined by the Contracting Parties or internationally. Article 9b General provisions on security 1. The Contracting Parties shall introduce and apply to goods entering or leaving their customs territories the customs security measures defined in this Chapter ensuring thus an equivalent level of security at their external borders. 2. The Contracting Parties shall waive the application of the customs security measures defined in this Chapter where goods are carried between their respective customs territories. 3. Before concluding any agreement with a third country in the area covered by this Chapter, the Contracting Parties shall consult each other in order to ensure the compatibility with the provisions of this Chapter, particularly where that agreement contains provisions that are derogating from the customs security measures referred to in this Chapter. Each Contracting Party shall ensure that agreements with third countries do not create rights and obligations for another Contracting Party unless the EEA Joint Committee decides otherwise. Article 9c Pre-arrival and pre-departure declarations 1. Goods brought from third countries into the customs territory of the Contracting Parties shall be covered by an entry declaration (here \u00ad inafter referred to as the entry summary declaration) with the exception of goods carried on means of transport only passing through the terri \u00ad torial waters or the airspace of the customs territory without a stop within this territory. 2. Goods leaving the customs territory of the Contracting Parties for third countries, shall be covered by an exit declaration (hereinafter referred to as the exit summary declaration) with the exception of goods carried on means of transport only passing through the territorial waters or the airspace of the customs territory without a stop within this territory. 3. Entry and exit summary declarations shall be lodged before the goods are brought into or leave the customs territory of the Contracting Parties. 4. The lodging of the entry and exit summary declarations referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 is optional until 31 December 2010 provided that transitional measures derogating from the obligation to present such declarations are applicable in the Community. Where, in accordance with the first subparagraph, the entry or exit summary declaration is not lodged, risk analysis for customs security matters, referred to in Article 9e, shall be carried out by the customs authorities at the latest upon presentation of the goods at arrival or exit, where appropriate on the basis of any declaration covering these goods or any other information available for them. M219 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 168 5. Each Contracting Party shall determine the persons liable for lodging entry or exit summary declarations as well as the authorities competent for accepting such declaration. 6. Annex I to this Protocol establishes: \u2014 the form and the particulars of the entry or exit summary declaration, \u2014 the exceptions from the obligation to lodge an entry or exit summary declaration, \u2014 the place where the entry or exit summary declaration shall be lodged, \u2014 the deadlines for lodging the entry or exit summary declaration, \u2014 any other provision necessary to ensure the application of this Article. 7. A customs declaration may be used as an entry or an exit summary declaration provided that it contains all the particulars required for a summary declaration. Article 9d Authorised economic operator 1. Each Contracting Party shall grant, subject to the criteria provided for in Annex II to this Protocol, the status of 'authorised economic operator' to any economic operator established in its customs territory. However, subject to specific conditions, in particular taking into account international agreements with third countries, the requirement of being established in the customs territory of a Contracting Party may be waived for specific categories of authorised economic operators. Moreover, each Contracting Party shall determine whether and under what conditions an airline or shipping company which is not established on its territory but has a regional office there may be granted this status. An authorised economic operator shall benefit from facilitations with regard to security-related customs controls. The status of authorised economic operator granted in one Contracting Party shall, subject to the rules and conditions laid down in paragraph 2, be recognised by another Contracting Party, without prejudice to customs controls, particularly with a view to taking into account the implementation of agreements with third countries providing for a mutual recognition of the status of an authorised economic operator. 2. Annex II of this Protocol lays down: \u2014 the rules for granting the status of authorised economic operator, in particular the criteria and conditions for granting this status, \u2014 the type of facilitations that may be granted, \u2014 the conditions under which the status is suspended or revoked, \u2014 the procedures to exchange information between the Contracting Parties concerning their authorised economic operators, \u2014 any other provision necessary to ensure the application of this Article. M219 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 169 Article 9e Security related customs controls and security risk management 1. Customs controls other than random checks, shall be based on risk analysis using automated data processing techniques. 2. Each Contracting Party shall define its risk management framework, risk criteria and priority control areas related to security. 3. The Contracting Parties shall recognise the equivalence of their risk managements systems related to security. 4. The Contracting Parties shall cooperate with a view to: \u2014 exchanging information in order to improve and reinforce their risk analyses and efficiency of security controls, and \u2014 defining within an appropriate time span, a common risk management framework, common risk criteria, common priority control areas as well as putting in place an electronic common risk management system. 5. The EEA Joint Committee shall adopt the measures necessary for the application of this Article. Article 9f Monitoring of the implementation of customs security measures 1. The EEA Joint Committee shall define the rules allowing the Contracting Parties to ensure the monitoring of the implementation of this Chapter and to verify whether the provisions of this Chapter and Annexes I and II to this Protocol are complied with. 2. The monitoring referred to in paragraph 1 shall be ensured by: \u2014 regular evaluation of the implementation of this Chapter, in particular the evaluation of the equivalency of the customs security measures, \u2014 an examination with a view to improving the application of the provisions of this Chapter or to modifying them in order to better meet its objectives, \u2014 the organisation of meetings between experts of the Contracting Parties to discuss specific issues and a review of administrative procedures, including on-the-spot visits. 3. The measures taken in compliance with this Article shall not infringe the rights of operators concerned. Article 9g Protection of professional secrecy and of personal data Information exchanged by the Contracting Parties in the framework of the provisions of this Chapter is protected by the law on professional secrecy and protection of personal data applicable in the Contracting Party to which the information is submitted. M219 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 170 The information shall not be made available to any persons other than the competent authorities in the Contracting Party and shall not be used by these authorities for any purpose other than those provided for in this Chapter. Article 9h Evolution of legislation 1. All changes in Community legislation relevant to the rights and obligations of the Contracting Parties created by this Chapter and Annexes I and II to this Protocol shall be subject to the procedure stipulated in this Article. 2. As soon as the Community is drawing up new legislation in a field which is governed by this Chapter, it shall informally seek advice from experts of the EFTA State concerned according to the procedure stipulated in Article 99 of the Agreement. 3. When amendments to this Chapter and to Annexes I and II to this Protocol are necessary to take into account the development of Community legislation on matters covered by this Chapter and Annexes I and II, they shall be decided in such a manner as to allow applying these amendments simultaneously with those introduced in Community legislation and with due respect for the internal procedures of the Contracting Parties. If a decision cannot be adopted in a way that allows such simultaneous application, the Contracting Parties shall where possible and with due respect for their internal procedures, provisionally apply the amendments provided for in the draft Decision. 4. For issues which are relevant for the EFTA State concerned, the Community shall ensure the participation as observers of experts from the EFTA State concerned in the Customs Code Committee set up by Article 247a of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code. Article 9i Safeguard measures and suspension of the provisions of this Chapter 1. If a Contracting Party does not respect the conditions stipulated in this Chapter or if the equivalency of the customs security measures in the Contracting Parties is no longer assured, after consultations in the EEA Joint Committee and only for a scope and duration strictly necessary for settling the situation, another Contracting Party may suspend partially or completely the application of the provisions of this Chapter or take appropriate measures. Articles 112 to 114 of the Agreement apply mutatis mutandis. 2. If the equivalency of the customs security measures is no longer assured because the amendments referred to in Article 9h(3) have not been decided, the application of this Chapter is suspended on the date when the Community legislation concerned is applied, unless the EEA Joint Committee, having examined the measures to maintain its appli \u00ad cation, decides otherwise.

In order to facilitate the crossing of frontiers, the Contracting Parties shall take the measures necessary to extend cooperation at both national and regional or local level between the authorities responsible for the organization of inspections and between the various departments carrying out inspections and formalities on either side of such frontiers. 2. Each Contracting Party shall, in so far as it is concerned, see to it that persons engaged in trade covered by this Protocol can rapidly inform the competent authorities of any problems encountered when crossing frontiers. 3. The cooperation referred to in paragraph 1 shall cover in particular: (a) the arrangement of frontier posts in such a way as to meet traffic requirements; (b) the conversion of frontier offices into juxtaposed inspection offices, where possible; M219 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 172 (c) the harmonization of the responsibilities of the frontier posts and offices situated on either side of the frontier; (d) the seeking of appropriate solutions to any problems reported. 4. The Contracting Parties shall cooperate in order to harmonize the business hours of the various departments carrying out inspections and formalities on either side of the frontier. Article 11 Notification of new inspections and formalities Where a Contracting Party intends to introduce a new inspection or formality, it shall inform the other Contracting Parties thereof. The Contracting Party concerned shall ensure that the measures taken to facilitate the crossing of frontiers are not rendered inoperative through the application of such new inspections or formalities.

The criteria for granting the status of authorised economic operator shall include: (a) an appropriate record of compliance with customs requirements; (b) a satisfactory system of managing commercial and, where appropriate, transport records, which allows appropriate customs controls; (c) where appropriate, proven financial solvency; and (d) where applicable, appropriate security and safety standards. 2. Each Contracting Party shall determine the procedure for granting the status of authorised economic operator and the legal effects of that status. 3. The Contracting Parties shall ensure that their customs authorities control that all the conditions and criteria for granting the status are complied with by the authorised economic operator and shall review them in case of an important amendment to the legislation concerned or when new circumstances appear, which raise a reasonable suspicion on the part of the authorities that the operator no longer complies with the conditions and criteria concerned. Article 2 Record of compliance 1. The record of compliance with customs requirements shall be considered as appropriate if over the last three years preceding the submission of the appli \u00ad cation no serious infringement or repeated infringements of customs rules have been committed by any of the following persons: (a) the applicant; (b) the persons in charge of the applicant company or exercising control over its management; (c) if applicable, the applicant's legal representative in customs matters; (d) the person responsible in the applicant company for customs matters. 2. The record of compliance with customs requirements may be considered as appropriate if the competent customs authority considers any infringement to be of negligible importance in relation to the number or size of the customs-related operations, and not to create doubts concerning the good faith of the applicant. 3. If the persons exercising control over the applicant company are established or resident in a third country, the customs authorities shall assess their compliance with customs requirements on the basis of records and information that are available to them. M219 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 179 4. If the applicant has been established for less than three years, the customs authorities shall assess his compliance with customs requirements on the basis of the records and information that are available to them. Article 3 Satisfactory system of managing of commercial and transport records To enable the customs authorities to establish that the applicant has a satisfactory system of managing commercial and, where appropriate, transport records, the applicant shall fulfil the following requirements: (a) maintain an accounting system which is consistent with the generally accepted accounting principles applied where the accounts are held and which will facilitate audit-based customs control; (b) allow the customs authority physical or electronic access to its customs and, where appropriate, transport records; (c) have an administrative organisation which corresponds to the type and size of business and which is suitable for the management of the flow of goods, and have internal controls capable of detecting illegal or irregular transactions; (d) where applicable, have satisfactory procedures in place for the handling of licenses and authorisations connected to importation and/or exportation; (e) have satisfactory procedures in place for the archiving of the company's records and information and for protection against the loss of information; (f) ensure that employees are made aware of the need to inform the customs authorities whenever compliance difficulties are discovered and establish suitable contacts to inform the customs authorities of such occurrences; (g) have appropriate information technology security measures in place to protect the applicant's computer system from unauthorised intrusion and to secure the applicant's documentation. Article 4 Financial solvency 1. For the purposes of this Article, financial solvency shall mean a good financial standing which is sufficient to fulfil the commitments of the applicant, with due regard to the characteristics of the type of the business activity. 2. The condition relating to the financial solvency of the applicant shall be deemed to be met if his solvency can be proven for the past three years. 3. If the applicant has been established for less than three years, his financial solvency shall be judged on the basis of records and information that are available. Article 5 Security and safety standards 1. The applicant's security and safety shall be considered to be appropriate if the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) buildings to be used in connection with the operations to be covered by the certificate are constructed of materials which resist unlawful entry and provide protection against unlawful intrusion; M219 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 180 (b) appropriate access control measures are in place to prevent unauthorised access to shipping areas, loading docks and cargo areas; (c) measures for the handling of goods include protection against the intro \u00ad duction, exchange or loss of any material and tampering with cargo units; (d) where applicable, procedures are in place for the handling of import and/or export licenses connected to prohibitions and restrictions and to distinguish these goods from other goods; (e) the applicant has implemented measures allowing a clear identification of his business partners in order to secure the international supply chain; (f) the applicant conducts, in so far as legislation permits, security screening on prospective employees working in security sensitive positions and carries out periodic background checks; (g) the applicant ensures that its staff concerned actively participate in security awareness programmes. 2. If the applicant, established in the Contracting Parties, is the holder of an internationally recognised security and/or safety certificate issued on the basis of international conventions, of a European security and/or safety certificate issued on the basis of Community legislation, of an International Standard of the Inter \u00ad national Organisation for Standardisation, or of a European Standard of the European standard organisations, or of any other recognised certificate, the criteria provided for in paragraph 1 shall be deemed to be met to the extent that the criteria for issuing these certificates are identical or correspond to those laid down in this Annex. TITLE II Facilitation granted to authorised economic operators Article 6 Facilitation granted to authorised economic operators The customs authorities shall grant an authorised economic operator the following facilitations: \u2014 the competent customs office may, before the arrival of the goods into the customs territory or before they leave it, notify the authorised economic operator when, as a result of security and safety risk analysis, the consignment has been selected for further physical control. This notice shall only be provided where it does not jeopardise the control to be carried out. However, the customs authorities may carry out a physical control even where an authorised economic operator has not been notified, \u2014 an authorised economic operator may lodge entry and exit summary declar \u00ad ations comprising the reduced data requirements set out in Annex 30A of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93; however where an economic operator is a carrier, freight forwarder or customs agent he is entitled to lodge such declar \u00ad ations only on the condition that he is involved in the importation or expor \u00ad tation of goods on behalf of an authorised economic operator, \u2014 an authorised economic operator shall be subject to fewer physical and document-based controls than other economic operators. The customs auth \u00ad orities may decide otherwise in order to take into account a specific threat, or control obligations set out in other legislation, M219 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 181 \u2014 where, following risk analysis, the competent customs authority nevertheless selects for further examination a consignment covered by an entry or exit summary declaration or by a customs declaration lodged by an authorised economic operator, it shall carry out the necessary controls as a matter of priority. If the authorised economic operator so requests, and subject to agreement with the customs authority concerned, these controls may be carried out at a place which is different from the place of the customs office involved. TITLE III Suspension and revocation of the status of authorised economic operator Article 7 Suspension of the status 1. The status of authorised economic operator shall be suspended by the issuing customs authority in the following cases: (a) where non-compliance with the conditions or criteria for granting the status has been detected; (b) the customs authorities have sufficient reason to believe that an act, which gives rise to criminal court proceedings and is linked to an infringement of the customs rules, has been perpetrated by the authorised economic operator; (c) upon a request of the authorised economic operator when he is temporarily incapable of complying with the conditions or criteria for granting of the status. 2. In the case referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1, the customs authority may decide not to suspend the status of authorised economic operator if it considers an infringement to be of negligible importance in relation to the number or size of the customs related operations and not to create doubts concerning the good faith of the authorised economic operator. 3. Where the nature or the level of the threat to citizens' security and safety, to public health or to the environment so requires, suspension shall take place immediately. 4. The suspension shall not affect any customs procedure already started before the date of suspension and not yet completed. 5. Each Contracting Party shall determine the duration of the suspension period which is to allow the authorised economic operator to regularise the situation. 6. When the economic operator concerned has, to the satisfaction of the customs authorities, taken the necessary measures to comply with the conditions and criteria that have to be met by an authorised economic operator, the issuing customs authority shall withdraw the suspension. Article 8 Revocation of the status 1. The status of the authorised economic operator shall be revoked by the issuing customs authority in the following cases: (a) where serious infringements related to customs rules have been committed by the authorised economic operator and there is no further right of appeal; M219 01994A0103(01) \u2014 EN \u2014 01.08.2016 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 182 (b) where the authorised economic operator fails to take the necessary measures during the suspension period referred to in Article 7(5); (c) upon request of the authorised economic operator. 2. However, in the case referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1, the customs authority may decide not to revoke the status if it considers the infringements to be of negligible importance in relation to the number or size of the customs related operations and not to create doubts concerning the good faith of the authorised economic operator. 3. Revocation shall take effect from the day following its notification. TITLE IV Exchange of information Article 9 Exchange of information The European Commission and the customs authorities of the relevant EFTA State shall, on a regular basis, exchange the following data concerning the identity of the authorised economic operators: (a) the Trader Identification Number of the operator (TIN) in a format compatible with the Economic Operator Registration and Identification EORI legislation; (b) the name and the address of the authorised economic operator; (c) the number of the document by which the status of the authorised economic operator was granted; (d) the current status (valid, suspended, revoked); (e) the periods when the status was modified; (f) the date from which the certificate is valid; (g) the authority which issued the certificate.

If a request does not meet the formal requirements, its correction or completion may be demanded; the ordering of precautionary measures may, however, take place. Article 7 Execution of requests 1. In order to comply with a request for assistance, the requested authority or, when the latter cannot act on its own, the administrative department to which the request has been addressed by this authority, shall proceed, within its competence and resources available, as though it were acting on its own account or at the request of other authorities of that same Contracting Party, by supplying information already possessed, by carrying out appropriate enquiries or by arranging for them to be carried out. 2.

In derogation from the definition of the turnover relevant for the application of Article 56 of the Agreement, as contained in Article 2 of this Protocol, the relevant turnover shall be constituted: (a) as regards agreements, decisions of associations of undertakings and concerted practices related to distribution and supply arrangements between non-competing undertakings, of the amounts derived from the sale of goods or the provision of services which are the subject matter of the agreements, decisions or concerted practices, and from the other goods or services which are considered by users to be equivalent in view of their characteristics, price and intended use; (b) as regards agreements, decisions of associations of undertakings and concerted practices related to arrangements on transfer of tech \u00ad nology between non-competing undertakings, of the amounts derived from the sale of goods or the provision of services which result from the technology which is the subject matter of the agree \u00ad ments, decisions or concerted practices, and of the amounts derived from the sale of those goods or the provision of those services which that technology is designed to improve or replace. 2. However, where at the time of the coming into existence of arrangements as described in paragraph 1(a) and (b) turnover as regards the sale of goods or the provision of services is not in evidence, the general provision as contained in Article 2 shall apply. Article 5 1. Where individual cases concern products falling within the scope of application of Protocol 25, the relevant turnover for the attribution of those cases shall be the turnover achieved in these products. 2. Where individual cases concern products falling within the scope of application of Protocol 25 as well as products or services falling within the scope of application of Articles 53 and 54 of the Agreement, the relevant turnover is determined by taking into account all the products and services as provided for in Article 2.

However, if the surveillance authority which is not competent to decide on a case in accordance with Article 56 so requests, the competent surveillance authority shall convene a meeting. REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTS AND THE RIGHT TO MAKE OBSERVATIONS Article 7 The surveillance authority which is not competent to decide on a case in accordance with Article 56 of the Agreement may request from the other surveillance authority at all stages of the proceedings copies of the most important documents concerning cases falling under Article 56(1)(b) and (c), (2) second sentence and (3) of the Agreement, and may furthermore, before a final decision is taken, make any obser \u00ad vations it considers appropriate. ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE Article 8 1. When the competent surveillance authority, as defined in Article 56 of the Agreement, by simple request or by decision requires an undertaking or association of undertakings located within the territory of the other surveillance authority to supply information, it shall at the same time forward a copy of the request or decision to the other surveillance authority. 2. At the request of the competent surveillance authority, as defined in Article 56 of the Agreement, the other surveillance authority shall, in accordance with its internal rules, undertake inspections within its territory in cases where the competent surveillance authority so requesting considers it to be necessary. 3. The competent surveillance authority is entitled to be represented and take an active part in inspections carried out by the other surveillance authority in respect of paragraph 2. 4. All information obtained during such inspections on request shall be transmitted to the surveillance authority which requested the inspections immediately after their finalization. 5. Where the competent surveillance authority, in cases falling under Article 56(1)(b) and (c), (2), second sentence and (3) of the Agreement, carries out inspections within its territory, it shall inform the other surveillance authority of the fact that such inspections have taken place and, on request, transmit to that authority the relevant results of the inspections. 6.

Information acquired or exchanged pursuant to this Protocol shall only be used in evidence for the purpose of procedures under Articles 53 and 54 of the Agreement and in respect of the subject matter for which it was collected. 3. Where the information referred to in Article 2 (1) and (2) concerns a case which has been initiated as a result of an application for leniency, that information cannot be used by the receiving surveillance authority as the basis for starting an inspection on its own behalf. This is without prejudice to any power of the surveillance authority to open an inspection on the basis of information received from other sources. 4. Save as provided under paragraph 5, information voluntarily submitted by a leniency applicant will only be transmitted to the other surveillance authority with the consent of the applicant. Similarly other information that has been obtained during or following an inspection or by means of or following any other fact-finding measures which, in each case, could not have been carried out except as a result of the leniency application will only be transmitted to the other surveillance authority if the applicant has consented to the trans \u00ad mission to that authority of information it has voluntarily submitted in its application for leniency. Once the leniency applicant has given consent to the transmission of information to the other surveillance authority, that consent may not be withdrawn. This paragraph is without prejudice, however, to the responsibility of each applicant to file leniency applications to whichever authorities it may consider appropriate. 5. Notwithstanding paragraph 4, the consent of the applicant for the transmission of information to the other surveillance authority is not required in any of the following circumstances: (a) no consent is required where the receiving surveillance authority has also received a leniency application relating to the same infringement from the same applicant as the transmitting surveillance authority, provided that at the time the information is transmitted it is not open to the applicant to withdraw the information which it has submitted to that receiving surveillance authority; (b) no consent is required where the receiving surveillance authority has provided a written commitment that neither the information trans \u00ad mitted to it nor any other information it may obtain following the date and time of transmission as noted by the transmitting surveillance authority, will be used by it or by any other authority to which the information is subsequently transmitted to impose sanctions on the leniency applicant or on any other legal or natural person covered by the favourable treatment offered by the transmitting authority as a result of the application made by the applicant under its leniency programme or on any employee or former employee of the leniency applicant or of any of the afore \u00ad mentioned persons. A copy of the receiving authority's written commitment will be provided to the applicant; (c) in the case of information collected by a surveillance authority under Article 8(2) at the request of the surveillance authority to whom the leniency application was made, no consent is required for the transmission of such information to, and its use by, the surveillance authority to whom the application was made.

The right of access to the file shall also not extend to correspondence between the surveillance authorities, between a surveillance authority and the competition authorities of the EC Member States or EFTA States or between the competition authorities of the EC Member States or EFTA States where such correspondence is contained in the file of the competent surveillance authority. M150 COMPLAINTS AND TRANSFERRAL OF CASES Article 11 1. Complaints may be addressed to either surveillance authority. Complaints addressed to the surveillance authority which, pursuant to Article 56, is not competent to decide on a given case shall be trans \u00ad ferred without delay to the competent surveillance authority. 2. If, in the preparation or initiation of ex officio proceedings, it becomes apparent that the other surveillance authority is competent to decide on a case in accordance with Article 56 of the Agreement, this case shall be transferred to the competent surveillance authority. 3. Once a case is transferred to the other surveillance authority as provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2, the case may not be transferred back. A case may not be transferred after \u2014 the statement of objections has been sent to the undertakings or associations of undertakings concerned, \u2014 a letter has been sent to the complainant informing him that there are insufficient grounds for pursuing the complaint, \u2014 the publication of the intention to adopt a decision declaring Article 53 or 54 not applicable, or the publication of the intention to adopt a decision making commitments offered by the under \u00ad takings binding on the undertakings.

The EC Commission shall transmit all submissions pursuant to Article 4(4) of Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 and this paragraph to the EFTA Surveillance Authority without delay. 5. With regard to a concentration as defined in Article 3 of Regu \u00ad lation (EC) No 139/2004 which does not have a Community dimension within the meaning of Article 1 of that Regulation and which is capable of being reviewed under the national competition laws of at least three EC Member States and at least one EFTA State, the persons or under \u00ad takings referred to in Article 4(2) of that Regulation may, before any notification to the competent authorities, inform the EC Commission by means of a reasoned submission that the concentration should be examined by the Commission.

All agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices in respect of particular products referred to in Protocol 14 which may affect trade between Contracting Parties tending directly or indirectly to prevent, restrict or distort normal competition within the territory covered by this Agreement shall be prohibited, and in particular those tending: (a) to fix or determine prices, (b) to restrict or control production, technical development or investment, (c) to share markets, products, customers or sources of supply. 2. However, the competent surveillance authority, as provided for in Article 56 of the Agreement, shall authorize specialization agreements or joint-buying or joint-selling agreements in respect of the products referred to in paragraph 1, if it finds that: (a) such specialization or such joint-buying or joint-selling will make for a substantial improvement in the production or distribution of those products; (b) the agreement in question is essential in order to achieve these results and is not more restrictive than is necessary for that purpose; and (c) the agreement is not liable to give the undertakings concerned the power to determine the prices, or to control or restrict the production or marketing, of a substantial part of the products in question within the territory covered by the Agreement, or to shield them against effective competition from other undertakings within the territory covered by the Agreement. If the competent surveillance authority finds that certain agreements are strictly analogous in nature and effect to those referred to above, having particular regard to the fact that this paragraph applies to distributive undertakings, it shall authorize them also when satisfied that they meet the same requirements. 3. Any agreement or decision prohibited by paragraph 1 shall be automatically void and may not be relied upon before any court or tribunal in the EC Member States or the EFTA States. Article 2 1. Any transaction shall require the prior authorization of the competent surveillance authority, as provided for in Article 56 of the Agreement, subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article, if it has in itself the direct or indirect effect of bringing about within the territory covered by the Agreement, as a result of action by any person or undertaking or group of persons or undertakings, a concentration between undertakings at least one of which is covered by Article 3, which may affect trade between Contracting Parties, whether the trans \u00ad action concerns a single product or a number of different products, and whether it is effected by merger, acquisition of shares or parts of the undertaking or assets, loan, contract or any other means of control.

The competent surveillance authority, as provided for in Article 56 of the Agreement, shall grant the authorization referred to in paragraph 1 if it finds that the proposed transaction will not give to the persons or undertakings concerned the power, in respect of the product or products within its jurisdiction: \u2014 to determine prices, to control or restrict production or distribution or to hinder effective competition in a substantial part of the market for those products, or \u2014 to evade the rules of competition instituted under this Agreement, in particular by establishing an artificially privileged position involving a substantial advantage in access to supplies or markets. 3. Classes of transactions may, in view of the size of the assets or undertakings concerned, taken in conjunction with the kind of concen \u00ad tration to be effected, be exempted from the requirement of prior authorization. 4. If the competent surveillance authority, as provided for in Article 56 of the Agreement, finds that public or private undertakings which, in law or in fact, hold or acquire in the market for one of the products within its jurisdiction a dominant position shielding them against effective competition in a substantial part of the territory covered by this Agreement are using that position for purposes contrary to the objectives of this Agreement and if such abuse may affect trade between Contracting Parties, it shall make to them such recommendations as may be appropriate to prevent the position from being so used. Article 3 For the purposes of Articles 1 and 2 as well as for the purposes of information required for their application and proceedings in connection with them, 'undertaking' means any undertaking engaged in production in the coal or the steel industry within the territory covered by the Agreement, and any undertaking or agency regularly engaged in distribution other than sale to domestic consumers or small craft industries.
