What's behind the trend, and will it help you feel better? YJ investigates. 2/13/16, 2:26 PMYoga for Healing: Why Western Doctors Are Now Prescribing Yoga Therapy Page 2 of 9http://www.yogajournal.com/article/health/western-doctors-prescribing-yoga-therapy/In a small workout room with a handful of other Navy veterans, David Rachford looked out the window to watch the fringed leaves of a tall royalpalm tree wave softly in the warm Southern California breeze. The soothing view eased the challenging exercise routine he was trying for the rsttime. It was just a simple twist, Supta Matsyendrasana (Supine Spinal Twist) (http://www.yogajournal.com/article/beginners/reclining-twist/)\u2014nothing like the rigorous daily training he'd done as a damage controlman on aircraft carriers\u2014but his legs refused to cooperate, due to the painfulnerve damage and severe sciatica he'd suered as a result of a career-ending \u0000]ack injury. As an outpatient receiving pain-\u0000hanagement treatmentat the Veterans Administration West Los Angeles Medical Center, Rachford was now required to attend this weekly yoga physical-therapy class. Itwas the last place he'd ever expected to nd himself. \"I thought yoga was for thin, bendy, liberal, hippie vegetarians and auent housewives, not tough, macho 'warrior' types,\" says the 44-year-old,now a Web developer in Santa Barbara, California. \"But at that time, I felt pretty broken. I was in a lot of pain and open to anything that might help.I was depressed and scared at the prospect of surgery, and mourning the loss of my health and my self-image of being a physically t 'tough guy.'\"Rachford also worried he wouldn't be able to hold his own in a yoga class. \"I couldn't bend much or stand more than a couple minutes withoutassistance,\" he says.A yoga therapist led Rachford and the rest of the group through gentle stretching poses, urging them to repeat the simple movements at homedaily. He did, and sure enough, over the next few months, Rachford noticed his range of movement gradually increasing and his pain improving. \"Ibecame more aware of my breath, body, and sensations,\" he says. \"My yoga practice became the base that restored my health, taking me fromsmoking, having high blood pressure, and being overweight and pre-diabetic to being t, active, and a picture of health. I've lost 50 pounds, myblood pressure is normal, and I can jog and hike without pain.\"ONLINE YOGACLASSESyogaanytime.comTry Classes Free for 15 Days.Unlimited Yoga Classes, AllLevels!

Here in the West, yoga has only recently become \u0000\\ component of medical care. However, \u0000\\ growing number of health carepractitioners are turning to the ancient practice as a way to help their patients feel better. Yoga therapy(http://www.yogajournal.com/category/yoga-therapy-types-of-yoga/) is now recognized as a clinically viable treatment, with established programsat major health care centers, such as The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, ClevelandClinic, and many others. In 2003, there were just ve yoga-therapy training programs in the International Association of Yoga Therapists (IAYT)database. Today, there are more than 130 worldwide, including 24 rigorous multi-year programs newly accredited by IAYT, with 20 more underreview. According to a 2015 survey, most IAYT members work in hospital settings, while others work in outpatient clinics or physical therapy,oncology, or rehabilitation departments (and in private practice).How are Crohn's symptoms affecting you?Take >Medication Guide >Medication Guide Information About Important Safety Information About HUMIRAHUMIRA\u00ae\u00ae (adalimumab) (adalimumab)11squamous cell) may increase.

Yoga has even been documented as away to alleviate the side eects of cancer treatment.\"The size, quantity, and quality of clinical trials for yoga therapy are increasing exponentially, and it's mostly happened over the past ve years,\"says longtime yoga researcher Sat Bir Singh Khalsa, PhD, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and co-author of the Harvard MedicalSchool Guide e-book Your Brain on Yoga (http://www.amazon.com/Brain-Harvard-Medical-School-Guides-ebook/dp/B00AQ29ADA). In fact, morethan 500 research papers on yoga therapy have been published in peer-reviewed journals, including the randomized, controlled, double-blindstudies that are modern medicine's gold standard, and the eld now has its rst professional-level medical textbook, Principles and Practice ofYoga in Health Care (Handspring Press, 2016), co-edited by Khalsa; Lorenzo Cohen, PhD; Shirley Telles, PhD; and Yoga Journal's medical editor,Timothy McCall, MD. \"The book's publication is an indication of how far yoga and yoga therapy have come,\" says McCall.Yoga therapy has grown partly by piggybacking on yoga's ever-increasing popularity. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'sNational Health Interview Survey, in 2002 only 5 percent of the US population actively practiced yoga. By 2012, that number had nearly doubled,reaching 9.5 percent. At the same time, more practitioners believe yoga improves their health: In 2004, only 5 percent of readers surveyed by YogaJournal said they did yoga for health reasons; in this year's Yoga Journal and Yoga Alliance joint Yoga in America study(http://www.yogajournal.com/yogainamericastudy/), more than 50 percent of all respondents cited health as a motivator. Although funding foryoga research remains modest compared to funding for pharmaceutical research, it's growing. In 2010, The University of Texas MD AndersonCancer Center received more than $4.5 million\u2014one of the largest yoga-related grants ever\u2014from the National Institutes of Health's NationalCancer Institute to support an ongoing study of the ecacy of yoga as part of a treatment program for women with breast cancer. Resultspublished so far are promising: Breast-cancer patients who practice yoga while undergoing radiation therapy have lower levels of stress hormonesand report less fatigue and better quality of life.The research on yoga as a helpful component of cancer treatment has expanded the most, says Khalsa. \"These days, it's hard to nd a major UScancer center that does not have a yoga program,\" he says. \"Patients are demanding, and spending more on, complementary medicine likeacupuncture, chiropractic, massage, and yoga.\"See also A Yoga Sequence to Keep You Healthy this Winter (http://www.yogajournal.com/slideshow/yoga-sequence-keep-healthy-winter/)What Is Yoga Therapy, Exactly?For many yogis, simply practicing yoga regularly improves overall well-being and strength. However, fast-paced vinyasa classes(http://www.yogajournal.com/category/yoga-101/types-of-yoga/vinyasa-yoga/) are not for everyone, especially those suering from a healthchallenge or injury. Yoga therapy serves as a safe alternative. Led by yoga teachers who've received additional training to work with clients withvarious health conditions, the styles and formats dier widely, ranging from chair yoga (http://www.yogajournal.com/slideshow/5-yoga-poses-for-people-with-multiple-sclerosis/) in hospitals and elder-care facilities to small, focused therapeutic classes and one-on-one sessions.\"In yoga therapy, we work on individuals, not conditions,\" says McCall, a former internist who now trains yoga therapists with his wife, ElianaMoreira McCall, at their Summit, New Jersey, yoga therapy center. That's because patients often have multiple, overlapping conditions, he says:\"For instance, we may work on back pain, but the client also ends up sleeping better and becomes happier.\" Some therapists focus on physicalmechanics, while others bring in Ayurvedic healing principles (category/ayurveda) and factor in diet, psychological health, and spirituality(http://www.yogajournal.com/category/yoga-101/yoga-o-the-mat-spirituality/) to create a holistic, customized plan.See also An Introduction to Yoga Therapy (http://www.yogajournal.com/article/teach/an-introduction-to-yoga-therapy/)As a new professional eld, yoga therapy has only recently become more established. Over the past 12 years, the IAYT has made major strides withits mission to establish yoga as a respected and recognized therapy in the West, from publishing an annual peer-reviewed medical journal topresenting at academic research conferences. With an NIH grant, the group has created rigorous standards and is now accrediting trainingprograms and beginning to certify therapist graduates. \"Our goal is a certication that is respected not only by those steeped in the yoga tradition,but also by the many health care elds we work in partnership with,\" says John Kepner, IAYT's executive director.Increasingly, yoga therapy is making inroads in conventional health care settings. At Manhattan Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in New YorkCity, Loren Fishman, MD, author of Healing Yoga (http://www.amazon.com/Healing-Yoga-Postures-Ailments-2014from-Backache/dp/0393078000),regularly uses yoga alongside traditional treatments to treat scoliosis, rotator cu syndrome, and other neuromuscular problems. \"Many2/13/16, for Healing: Why Western Doctors Are Now Prescribing Yoga Therapy Page 4 of 9http://www.yogajournal.com/article/health/western-doctors-prescribing-yoga-therapy/physicians have come to appreciate the benecial eects of yoga, says Fishman.\"Patients\u2014even the most skeptical\u2014are experiencing the benets of yoga therapy rsthand. When Stacey Halstead was plagued by chronicinsomnia, she made an appointment with her family doctor, whom she hoped would prescribe sleeping pills. But after chatting with Halsteadabout stressors in her life, the doctor instead suggested she try yoga to see if it helped release tension and manage stress. \"I was furious with her,\"says Halstead. \"I was exhausted and wanted something to help me now.\" She agreed to try yoga for six weeks, but only with her doc's promise toconsider medication if the experiment failed. To Halstead's great surprise, yoga did help her sleep\u2014and Halstead hasn't requested those sleepmeds.See also How to Outsmart Your Insomnia (http://www.yogajournal.com/article/practice-section/sweet-surrender-3/)Results from several studies show that Halstead's outcome\u2014and the positive results experienced by countless patients who are turning to yogatherapy\u2014is common. In the newest scientic studies, researchers are using genomic expression and brain imaging to understand how yoga aectspractitioners on a cellular and molecular level. \"Researchers take blood samples before and after yoga practice to see which genes have beenturned on and which were deactivated,\" says Khalsa. \"We're also able to see which areas of the brain are changing in structure and size due to yogaand meditation (http://www.yogajournal.com/category/meditation/).\" This kind of research is helping take yoga into the realm of \"real science,\" hesays, by showing how the practice changes psycho-physiological function.See also Yoga Therapy: Need to Know (http://www.yogajournal.com/article/yoga-101/yoga-vs-yoga-therapy/)The Future of Yoga TherapyGiven rising health care costs and challenges, experts agree yoga is a safe, relatively aordable complementary therapy. But making it moreaccessible to those with less access is key. \"Health care providers and the yoga community need to continue to reach out to people of color and inlower socioeconomic levels\u2014populations that suer more stress and higher rates of lifestyle-related diseases,\" says McCall. One important stepwould be changes in insurance coverage, says Fishman. \"I would like to see health care institutions and insurance companies accept yoga as areimbursable treatment for specic conditions, some of which have already been proven and some of which are currently being studied,\" he says.It will take time to shift both practitioners' and patients' attitudes toward yoga. Many from both groups still view yoga as strictly a supplement toconventional treatment rather than a primary approach. However, increasing access to yoga therapy and a growing body of scientic evidencedocumenting its benets are cultivating a sense of optimism among those immersed in this work. \"I see a bright future where yoga and othermind-body practices become more accepted within standard medical care, as our medical system starts to move away from a more limiting illnessmodel to a more enlightened wellness model of health,\" says Lorenzo Cohen, PhD, professor and director of the Integrative Medicine Program atMD Anderson Cancer Center and grandson of the famed early Western yoga teacher, the late Vanda Scaravelli. The most powerful shift may be theone that happens within each of us\u2014when we take responsibility for our own health, do our practice, and allow for transformation and healing tooccur.Rachford, the Navy vet, is now a trained yoga teacher and leads classes at the publishing company where he works. He also teaches communityclasses. \"We tend to want immediate cures for pains or injuries, and Western medicine is very much geared toward prescriptions and surgery,\" hesays. \"But yoga doesn't work that way. As Sri K. Pattabhi Jois (http://www.yogajournal.com/uncategorized/in-memory-of-sri-k-pattabhi-jois-father-of-ashtanga/) said, 'Do your practice and all is coming.' Yoga helps me deal with stress and has allowed me to release addictions and harmfulbehaviors. It has set me free from pain and suering, which allows peace, joy, and health to be present in my life.\"See also Alternative Medicine Guide: Find the Right Treatment for You (http://www.yogajournal.com/article/health/nd-right-alternative-medicine/)2/13/16, 2:26 PMYoga for Healing: Why Western Doctors Are Now Prescribing Yoga Therapy Page 5 of 9http://www.yogajournal.com/article/health/western-doctors-prescribing-yoga-therapy/ How to nd the right yoga therapistWondering whether yoga therapy might help you with a health issue? Here are some tips on navigating this new therapeutic eld:Do your researchTo see if yoga therapy will help to heal your specic condition, or if you want to read the research before you invest your time and money, visitYoga Alliance's site (yogaalliance.org) to nd study highlights for specic health conditions under Yoga Research.Explore local optionsSearch the IAYT member prole database (iayt.org) to nd details on training, style, and areas of expertise for yoga therapists near you. Althoughcertication standards for individual therapists aren't yet in place, they're expected in the next year or two. Your yoga teacher or doctor may alsobe able to recommend a therapist. If you don't nd someone near you, consider traveling to a nearby town, since you need to see a yoga therapistonly intermittently. \"What's important is that you get a thorough evaluation, and a home practice that suits you well,\" says McCall.Talk with your primary health care providerMany doctors still think of yoga as vigorous exercise that would be inappropriate for people with health challenges, so be prepared to do someeducating (bring your research). If you've found a yoga therapist you like, you may want to give your doctor permission to discuss your case withhim or her, says Laura Kupperman, E-RYT 500, a professional yoga therapist in Boulder, Colorado.See also Coordinating Yoga Therapy with Doctors and Other Health Professionals (http://www.yogajournal.com/article/teach/coordinating-yoga-therapy-with-doctors-and-other-health-professionals/) (https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.yogajournal.com/article/health/western-doctors-prescribing-yoga-therapy/)SHARE ONGOOGLE PLUS DOCTORS ARE NOW PRESCRIBING AND HEALTH (/CATEGORY/HEALTH/)YOGA THERAPY (/CATEGORY/YOGA-THERAPY-TYPES-OF-YOGA/)2/13/16, 2:26 PMYoga for Healing: Why Western Doctors Are Now Prescribing Yoga Therapy Page 6 of 9http://www.yogajournal.com/article/health/western-doctors-prescribing-yoga-therapy/BALANCE 4 Ways Practicing YogaOutdoors Enhances ItResearch makes a strong case for taking your practiceinto the wild as the weather warms\u2014or at least yourbackyard.(http://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/4-reasons-science-suggests-practicing-yoga-outdoors-enhances/)LIFE Yoga for Multiple Sclerosis: How8 Weeks of Yoga Can HelpA new study from Rutgers University shows how yogacan help improve mobility and quality of life, forpeople living with MS.(http://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/healing-practices-yoga-multiple-sclerosis/)YOGA AND HEALTH A 6-Step Flow That'll Make YouSmileKathyrn Budig shares a favorite mini sequences thatcan be added to any practice.(http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/a-6-step-flow-thatll-make-you-smile/)YOU Why Western Doctors Are Yoga Therapy Page 7 of 9http://www.yogajournal.com/article/health/western-doctors-prescribing-yoga-therapy/ Deepen Your Practice with a Mindful Embrace (http://www.yogajournal.com/meditation/hugging-meditation-mindful-embrace-can-deepen-practice/)The Art of Teaching Yoga: 5 Things Your Students Wish They Could Tell You (http://www.yogajournal.com/teach/the-art-of-teaching-yoga-5-things-your-students-wish-they-could-tell-you/)What Your Sign Says About Your Love Life (http://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/astrology-what-sign-says-about-love-life/)Gabrielle Bernstein's Kundalini Meditation for Oneness (http://www.yogajournal.com/meditation/gabrielle-bernsteins-kundalini-meditation-oneness/)Inside YJ's YTT: Discovering the Power of the Breath + the Mind (http://www.yogajournal.com/teach/inside-yjs-ytt-discovering-power-breath-mind/) Subscribe and Get 4Free Gifts!SubscribeGive a Gift Western Doctors Now Prescribing Yoga Therapy Page 8 of 9http://www.yogajournal.com/article/health/western-doctors-prescribing-yoga-therapy/Full Name: Address 1: Address 2 StateSelect a stateZip/Postal Email: SUBMIT MY ORDERCanadian Subscriptions | International SubscriptionsYES!
