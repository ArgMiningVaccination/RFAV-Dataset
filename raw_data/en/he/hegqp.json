It's important to talk with a healthcare professional before you begin using essential oils and be sure to research the [quality](https://greatist.com/health/best-essential-oils-how-to-buy-essential-oils) of a brand's products. Always do a [patch test](https://greatist.com/health/patch-test) before trying a new essential oil. Your immune system plays an important role in keeping you healthy. When your immune system is weakened, it can make you more vulnerable to becoming ill. Because of this, it's important to do what you can to help your immune system work to its full potential. You may have heard that essential oils (EOs) can help boost your immune system. In this article, we'll take a closer look at what's known about EOs and immunity, focusing on what the research has to say about which EOs may boost your immune system the most. Before we discuss EOs and immunity, it's important to know a little bit about your [immune system](/health/cold-flu/fun-facts). Overall, your immune system is a complex network of tissues and cells that works to defend you against harmful factors, such as: Your immune system is activated when it encounters something it considers to be a harmful foreign substance. This is known as an [antigen](/health/infection/antigen-vs-antibody). An example of an antigen is the spike protein found on the surface of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Once an antigen is recognized, an immune response is generated. This involves signaling between the different cells of the immune system by both cell-to-cell contact and by signaling molecules called [cytokines](/health/cytokine-storm). The types of immune response There are two types of immune response \u2014 innate and adaptive. While they both work closely together, they each have different functions. The innate response is non-specific and happens immediately. Think of the cells of the innate immune system as first responders. There are many types of innate immune cells. A few examples are: - macrophages [monocytes](/health/absolute-monocytes) - dendritic cells [neutrophils](/health/neutrophils) [eosinophils](/health/eosinophil-count-absolute) Innate immune cells recognize patterns on foreign substances and can go on to activate the adaptive response. The innate immune response also often leads to [inflammation](/health/inflammation), which is typically promoted by the release of specific cytokines. The adaptive immune response is specific and associated with memory. After exposure to an antigen, the adaptive immune system learns how to respond to it again in the future. Examples of cells in the adaptive immune response are B cells and T cells. [EOs](/nutrition/what-are-essential-oils) are concentrated substances extracted from plants. They can come from a variety of sources, including, but not limited to: - leaves - flowers - bark Typically, EOs are used in [aromatherapy](/health/what-is-aromatherapy), either by inhaling them or by applying a diluted solution to the skin. They're used for a variety of purposes, such as: - reducing stress - promoting sleep - easing pain Safety tips for essential oils - Do not apply an EO directly to your skin. It needs to be diluted with a [carrier oil](/health/carrier-oil), like coconut, jojoba, or olive oil at around a 1.5 to 3 percent concentration. - Do not use an EO on or near irritated skin, wounds, or rashes. - Avoid contact with your eyes or mucous membranes. - Do not ingest or use an EO internally. - Avoid using EOs on infants, children, pregnant people, older adults, or those with serious health conditions without first talking with a doctor. - Keep out of reach of children and pets, and do not use EOs on animals. EOs are very complex substances. For example, a single EO can contain [up to 400](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7309671/) One of these effects may be adjusting how the immune system behaves. This is referred to as immunomodulation. It may include things like: - stimulating certain parts of the immune system - increasing the activity of specific immune cells - interfering with pathways associated with inflammation Much of the information about EOs boosting immune function is anecdotal. That means it comes from personal experience rather than from scientific research. Generally speaking, research into how exactly EOs interact with the immune system is pretty limited. However, some studies have found potential immune benefits for specific EOs that require further investigation. It's important to note, however, that a lot of the research that's been done with EOs and immunity has been conducted on rats, mice, or laboratory-grown cells. Very few of these studies have been conducted on human participants. Below, we'll examine what scientific research has uncovered regarding four of these EOs. [Eucalyptus essential oil](/health/9-ways-eucalyptus-oil-can-help) comes from the leaves of the eucalyptus tree (Eucalyptus globulus). It has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and it has a long history of use for ailments like a cough and respiratory infections. Some research indicates that eucalyptus EO can enhance phagocytosis, a process immune cells use to engulf, or \"eat,\" a germ. It may also help reduce cytokines associated with inflammation that are produced by some immune cells. A [2008 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2374764/) A [2017 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5687727/) Lastly, a [2020 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7472567/) Summary Eucalyptus EO may increase the activity of some types of innate immune cells. It also appears to reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines produced by these cells. [Clove essential oil](/health/clove-essential-oil) comes from the dried flower buds of the Syzygium aromaticum tree. It has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and pain-easing properties. Clove EO has been used for hundreds of years in traditional medicinal practices to ease pain and help wounds. A [2011 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21796701/) A [2015 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24873744/) A [2021 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8066448/) [campylobacteriosis](/health/campylobacter-enteritis), a type of bacterial food poisoning. Researchers found that, compared with mice receiving a placebo, mice that were given clove EO had: - lower levels of bacteria in their small and large intestines - less severe illness - fewer signs of cell death and inflammation in their large intestine - reduced levels of immune cells like macrophages, monocytes, and T cells in their large intestine - lower levels of inflammatory cytokines both in and outside their intestines Summary Clove EO appears to affect the immune response by reducing inflammatory cytokines produced by some immune cells. However, at higher doses, it may actually increase some inflammatory cytokine production. [Lavender essential oil](/health/what-lavender-can-do-for-you) is obtained from the flowers of the lavender plant (Lavandula angustifolia). It has anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and stress-reducing properties. It has traditionally been used to: - lower anxiety - promote sleep - help with skin problems A [2016 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26730790/) - enhanced phagocytosis of staph bacteria by macrophages - reduced bacterial growth within macrophages - lowered the release of inflammatory cytokines by macrophages A [2017 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28783372/) Lastly, a [2018 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5878871/) Summary Lavender EO boosts some markers of immune function. It may also decrease inflammation and enhance the activity of some types of immune cells. [Tea tree essential oil](/nutrition/tea-tree-oil) is made from the leaves of the tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia). It has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Tea tree EO has been used historically for a variety of conditions, such as skin problems and respiratory illnesses. A [2015 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25858876/) Later [research from 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29121804/) Summary Tea tree EO reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines by macrophages. This, in turn, may reduce inflammation levels. Although we're still learning more about how EOs can affect the immune system, there are other tried-and-tested things you can do to help [boost your immune system](/nutrition/how-to-boost-immune-health). These include: - Eating a nutritious diet. Try to focus on making [nutritious food choices](/nutrition/how-to-eat-healthy-guide), as the nutrients from these foods can help bolster your immune function. Some examples of foods to emphasize in your diet include: - fresh fruits and vegetables - whole grains - low fat dairy products - lean protein sources - Limiting certain foods. There are also some types of foods to try to limit or avoid, as they may [increase inflammation](/nutrition/6-foods-that-cause-inflammation)in your body. These include foods that are high in: - Using supplements. Some dietary supplements, such as [vitamin C](/nutrition/how-much-vitamin-c-should-i-take-daily), [zinc](/nutrition/zinc), and [probiotics](/nutrition/probiotics-101), may boost immune function. However, be sure to talk with a doctor before introducing new supplements to your diet. - Managing weight. Excess weight is associated with inflammation and lower immune function. If you're overweight, talk with a doctor about healthy ways to lose weight. - Lowering stress. High levels of stress and anxiety can negatively impact your immune system. That's why it's important to find healthy, effective ways to reduce your stress. Some examples include [exercise](/health/heart-disease/exercise-stress-relief), [yoga](/nutrition/13-benefits-of-yoga), and [meditation](/nutrition/12-benefits-of-meditation). - Getting enough sleep. Not getting enough sleep may impact your immunity. Try to prioritize your sleep and form a [nighttime routine](/health/nighttime-routine)that promotes good sleep. - Exercising regularly. Getting [regular exercise](/nutrition/10-benefits-of-exercise)can benefit your immune system by helping to manage weight, reduce stress, and improve your sleep. - Drinking alcohol in moderation. [Drinking alcohol](/nutrition/alcohol-good-or-bad)in excess can weaken your immune system. If you drink alcohol, try to do so in moderation. - Quitting smoking. [Smoking](/health/smoking/effects-on-body)increases the risk of many health conditions and may lead to problems with your immune system. If you smoke, talk with your doctor about developing a [quit plan](/health/quit-smoking). - Getting vaccinated. [Vaccines](https://www.healthline.com/health/vaccinations)are vital tools for providing immunity against various infectious diseases, including COVID-19 and the flu. It's possible you may have heard that using EOs, particularly eucalyptus EO, can protect you from contracting the coronavirus that causes [COVID-19](/health/coronavirus-covid-19). However, there's currently no scientific evidence to support this. In fact, the [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-products) The most effective way to prevent becoming ill with COVID-19 is to get vaccinated. If you have questions or concerns about [COVID-19 vaccination](/health-news/heres-exactly-where-were-at-with-vaccines-and-treatments-for-covid-19), don't hesitate to discuss them with your doctor. Some research has found that certain EOs may be able to boost the immune system. These EOs include: - eucalyptus - clove - lavender - tea tree oil However, much of the research that's been done on these EOs is still in its early stages and has been done on laboratory-grown cells or animals. Because of this, further research is needed to discover how exactly EOs can impact the human immune system. Until then, there are many strategies you can use every day to help boost your immunity. This includes eating a nutritious diet, maintaining a moderate weight, reducing stress levels, and getting vaccinated against infectious diseases. "}
