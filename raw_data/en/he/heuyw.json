Holistic Integration means bringing together all of the the pieces of ourselves to create the best version of ourselves. This can mean working on our mental or physical health, spiritual health, or anything else that you think of when you consider holistic wellbeing. Each of these modalities serve as tools to help your conscious thought connect with your body. Mind-Body Integration. Somatic Therapy The practice is based on the notion that your body and mind are connected. By providing positive imagery and self-suggestion, visualization can change emotions that you hold which subsequently have a physical effect on the body, thus allowing healing to begin. At times when visualizing what we want, past trauma may appear in order to be healed. Through developing awareness of the mind-body connection and using specific interventions, somatic therapy helps you to release stuck emotions and trauma that remain in your body from these past negative experiences. Pain often dissipates or completely disappears from certain pain points in the body allowing for increased range of motion and a regained sense of freedom.

Aromatherapy Aromatic plant extracts and essential oils are used through inhalation or as a topical application. Inhaling essential oils stimulates the olfactory system, the part of the brain connected to smell, including the nose and the brain. Molecules that enter the nose or mouth pass to the lungs, and from there, to other parts of the body.
