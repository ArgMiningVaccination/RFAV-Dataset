(AP) - The frozen body of a girl sacrificed 500 years ago by the Incas of Peru will go on display in Washington, D.C., May 21 despite objections from Peruvian scholars, the National Geographic Society said Wednesday . \"The Peruvian government has been very cooperative,\" said Bar\u00ad bara Moffet, spokesperson for the society, which is sponsoring the exhibit. \"We expect to have a high\u00ad level visitor from Lima for the opening.\" Some Peruvian scholars have objected that transporting the body of the girl, who was about 13 when she died, might be risky and that it should be examined in Peru, not abroad. Moffet said U.S. air conditioning experts have designed two cases specially for the mummy to keep it frozen, one for air transport from Peru and another for its display in Washington, D.C. The display room will be kept at normal tem\u00ad perature for viewers. She said the Incas had a practice of taking children to a mountain\u00ad top at times of crisis and sacrific\u00ad ing them, probably to please their gods. Johan Reinhard, an Ameri\u00ad can archaeologist, found the girl at 20,000 feet near the top of Mount Ampato in the Andes last October. She must have frozen almost instantly, Moffet said. The body was clothed in elaborate textiles and surrounded by ritual pots and other objects.

They have two children at the UI -a son in the College of Dentistry and a daughter in the College of Pharmacy. \"Nearly 75 percent of UI stu\u00ad dents depend on some form of financial aid to complete their education , so we deeply appreci\u00ad ate the Parents Association endowing these special scholar\u00ad ships,\" said Mark Warner, direc\u00ad tor ofUI Student Financial Aid. \u00b7Our office will work to select deserving students who have demonstrated academic excel\u00ad lence and show promise of con\u00ad tinuing their success at Iowa and contributing to society after graduation.

Dole campaign has Republicans in a 'funk' Jay Dee Daily Iowan political reporter With Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole trailing Presi\u00ad dent Bill Clinton by 20 1I0ints in the polls, some members of the Grand Old Party may not be feel\u00ad ing so grand. House Speak\u00ad er Newt Gin\u00ad grich, R-Ga., has said his party may be in I a period of '\"funk,\" and recent com- ments by other GOP officials indicate divi\u00ad sions that sur\u00ad faced in the primary season have not been healed. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-New York, co-chairperson of Dole's cam\u00ad paign, in the party were telling peo\u00ad ple how they should think. D' Ama\u00ad to criticized Gingrich and presiden\u00ad tial candidate Pat Buchanan for creating the perception Republi\u00ad cans are extremists . Buchanan 's campaign, dormant since he conceded Dole had the nomination wrapped up, has been revived by D'Amato 's accusations and an attempt by four pro-choice GOP governors to remove the anti\u00ad abortion plank from the party plat\u00ad fonn. Buchanan officials said they would fight to preserve the party's stance against abortion at the Republican convention in August. In Iowa, GOP activists have held county and district conventions - activities that normally promote party unity. But some Republicans may still lack enthusiasm for Dole. Local Dole supporter Irene Chalmers Neubauer said backers of other GOP presidential candi\u00ad dates have yet to come around to work for Dole. \"I don't think there's a serious move that they won't back Dole,\u00b7 she said. \"But it's still a transition period.\" While polls show good reason for a GOP \"funk,\u00b7 other factors are more promising for Republicans . The most recent voter registra\u00ad tion statistics show Republicans hold a sizable edge in Iowa. Since last summer, Republicans have added more than 10,000 voters to their lead over Democrats. Repub- '''Book Buyback. lieans now outnumber Democrats in Iowa by 26,000. Most of the GOP's gain can be attributed to people who registered as Republicans to take part in the Iowa caucuses last February . Republican congressional candi\u00ad dates were also able to raise sub\u00ad stantially more money than their Democratic challengers, and in Iowa, GOP legislative leaders raised more funds than the Democ\u00ad ratic leadership. In low-profile races for the both houses of the state Legislature, a rew extra thousand dollars in a candidate's war chest can make the difference. Republicans are partic\u00ad ularly optimistic about winning control of the Iowa Senate, where Democrats hold a slim 27-23 majority and several incumbent lawmakers are retiring. Yet nearly every poll released in the last few months has been bad news for Republicans . The most recent Gallup Poll shows Clinton with a 58-37 percent edge, and the president's approval rating stands at 56 percent, considered high for an incumbent. The numbers are not much bett\u00ad ter in Iowa. It pays to be part of it. \" *http://www,book.uiowa.edu Tue-Wed, Apr 30-May 1.. .......................................... 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Thursday, May 2 ............ \" .......................................... 8:30 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Friday, May 3 ................................................... .......... 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Saturday, May 4 ......................................................... 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Sunday, May 5 ............................................ .....................

Marty Blake, NBA's director scouting States has acted as the 'world's police for too many years. The Clinton administration must resist pressure to send troops to Liberia. Since the end of the Cold War era, the United States has become the world's only true superpower . In this role, the world has now . come to look upon the United States as a peacekeeping police force in areas of instability. Within the last three years of the Clinton administration, American troops have been sent to Somalia, Haiti and now Bosnia on various missions to \"restore order\" -to countries where they've never known order. Now, a new conflict raging in Mrica may lead the world community to call upon the United States once again. A civil war has erupted in Liberia between rival militia groups in a nation founded by former Mrican-American slaves in the 1800s. The capital of Monrovia, named after President James Monroe, has been looted and burned to ruins. U.S. Marines have evacuated all Americans living in Liberia and are sheltering an additional 10,000 Liberians at the U.S. Embassy compound. Their quick actions to save American lives are to be com\u00ad mended. However, the actions of the American military may prompt a larger, more involved peacekeeping action to be requested by the Unit\u00ad ed Nations. Certainly, our leaders in this country don't want to see the killing of innocent people anywhere in the world. However, the leaders of the We saw what happened when our troops were serving in another pointless mission with the United Nations in Somalia. Our soldiers were slaughtered because their Hands were tied by the United Nations. United Nations must realize the Un,ited States can no longer play po ice officer to the world. It's time for the United Nations to fmd more sensible solutions for resolving conflict in the world, rather than sending peacekeeping troops info a hostile area with no defined mission other than to \"maintain or4er.\" It has become difficult to explain to the American people how troops are to \"maintain order\" when they are instructed to not fire back. How can they a.ccomplish military objectives when the people control\u00ad lirJg them are U.N. bureaucrats who have no military leadership? We saw what happened when our troops were serving in another pointless mission with the United Nations in Somalia. Our soldiers were slaughtered because their hands were tied by the United Nations. Vice President AI Gore sent letters to the slain soldiers fami\u00ad Ii ,saying, \"You can be proud your sons and daughters died in the service of the United Nations.- This should be considered an outrage. The only time American troops should be risking their lives is in the setvice of the United States, not the United Nations. Hopefully, in this election year, President Clinton will have the reltraint to say to the United Nations, thanks, but no thanks. We have enough problems to solve in our own country before traipsing across the world to fIX every nation's civil wars or conflicts. It's time to concentrate on the home front. , Todd Versteegh is an editorial writer and a UI junior.

From the makers of Asbestos, DDT, Agent Orange and Paraquat comes the chemical revo\u00ad lution to agriculture . The new generation of farmers appears hooked on the plentlful supply of agri-chemicals like Lindane, Toxaphene , Chlordane and Atrazine. Farmers began purchasing millions Qf tons of these synthetic chemicals in the 1960s. But more has sprouted than corn and beans from the agri-chemical trend. A recent Danish study shows the advent of agri-chemical use parallels a 300 percent increase in some forms of cancer. A five-fold increase in the cost of agricultural production ensued, mostly attributed to the multibillion dollar expenditure on chemicals and the machinery required for their applica\u00ad tion. But more has sprouted than com and beane from the agri-chemical trend. A recent Danish study shows the advent of agri-chemical use parallels a 300 percent increase in some forms of cancer.

The document also charges the UI 81 being \"negligent in its duty to exercise care and caution\" for his son, and therefore \"was a proximate caue\" of his death. Ann Rhodes, vice president for University Relations, said the UI had been expecting a suit to be filed and would be represented by both UI General Counsel Mark Schantz and the State Attorney General's Office. \"I can't imagine anything worae than loaing a child,\" she said. \"If this helpa them to work through this than I can see why they would.\" Rhodea said she couldn't comment further on the incident until she read Jain's court petition, and said she was unaware of a policy pro\u00ad hlbiting UI employees from notifying parents of suicide attempts . The decision to notify parents in these matters was determined on an indi\u00ad vidual basis by those working most closely wi th the student, Rhodes said. The UI would honor confidentiali \u00ad ty, Rhodes said, if a student were seeing a psychiatrist, or if the stu\u00ad dent had requested his or her par\u00ad ents not be informed of a suicide attempt and had promised to seek counseling. Uttam Jain said he was complete\u00ad ly unaware of the extent of his son's discontent during his first semester at the UI. \"Obviously, we didn't know,\" he said. \"If we had known he was suici\u00ad dal, we would have run down there and brought him home to get the psychiatric care that he needed.\" Uttam Jain filed a first claim for damages against the UI and the state of Iowa on April 24, 1995, but withdrew the claim on Feb. 5.

Christine Hanley Associated Press BROOKFIELD, Conn. -The pink triangle on a small decal affixed to the door of Veronica Berrill's classroom has been a wel\u00ad come sign to students with ques\u00ad tions about sexual identity. Similar triangles hang outside six other rooms at Brookfield High School and designate \"safe zones,\u00b7 refuges for gay, lesbian and bisexu\u00ad al students who wish to express themselves without worrying about being judged. The program drew relatively lit\u00ad tle attention or controversy in its first two years. But a clash over val\u00ad ues spilled into this town of 15,000 and is now headed for a courtroom . Berrill, an English teacher since 1973 and the widow of the creator of the comic strip \"Gil Thorpe,\u00b7 was accused by a student's parents of using her classroom safe zone to recruit gays. \"This is a homosexual agenda,\u00b7 Neal Houde wrote in an Oct. 5 let\u00ad ter to the school board. \"This is homosexual recruiting . This is dis\u00ad gusting. This is illegal,\" Berril! responded last month by filing a libel lawsuit against Houde and his wife, Katie. On Tuesday, the Houdes held a news conference in front of 'lbwn Hall to complain their free-speech rights were being undermined. They threlltened a lawsuit of their own if Berrill's libel complaint is not dropped. Berril! has declined to comment on the dispute. The controversy dates back to the first day of class in September, when the Houdes' daughter, Krys\u00ad tal, and a mix of students from all grades were auigned to have Berrill 88 a mentor. Accounts differ on what was said in the classroom that day. Berrill, according to her lawyer, Cecilia Buck, sald she tslked about how students should accept all peo\u00ad ple, including gays, and that she would not tolerate derogatory remarks about any particular group. The Houdes, who described themselves as devout evangelical Christians, said Berrill \u00b7spent a. major portion of the class preach\u00ad ing the plight of homosexuals and their right to be the way they were.n Students and faculty interviewed Tuesday at the high school describ d Berrill as a caring and devoted teacher. \"The students are 100 percent in support of Mrs. Berrill, and all the other people who have the pink tri\u00ad angle on their door,\" said Ryan McCaffrey , a enior involv d in th school's peer counseling program, which initiated the safe zone. A committee, aet up by th school board to deal with the Houdes' complaints, voted 5-2 in M rch to keep the safe zone .

Some Hawkeye fans thought with Set\u00ad tles, Kingsbury and Andre Wool\u00ad ridge returning for next season, Iowa could challenge for the Big Ten Conference championship - or more. \"This really hurts the team,\u00b7 senior Chad Rodgers said. \"It's going to be very difficult to replace somebody like him.

My career hip: I scored one of my best perfor\u00ad mances when I traveled to Del Moines to cover the 1995 Drake Relays. Those in authority at Drake decided that I wasn't exactly \"a household name and opted not to give me a preas pass. But after dri\u00ad ving two hours to get there, I wasn't about to be stopped.

Th 33-year-old Holyfield, a former undi puted champion, c n It ep alive his hopes of another title .hot by beating Bobby Czy& In th main event on card featuring three heavy- \"Each and every fight is important. I realize Bob Czyz is a good fighter, but I look forward to being heavyweight champion of the world again.\" [vander Holyfield on his fight this Friday Czyz wei ht bout . Lewi., a 30-year-old former WB champion (rom Britain, mu t b at Ray Mercer to get a fight thi. year against Tyson, who won the WBC title by stop\u00ad ping Frank Bruno of Britain in the third round In lh other light, Tim Wither\u00ad .poon. former WBC-WBA champion, who hal revived his career It age 37, will fight Jorge Luis Gonzalez, a native of Cuba. \"How can you look ahead when someone is in front of you,\" Lewis said in explaining that his only concern is Mercer. Lewis, however, would have to be one cool customer not to be thinking about a fight against Tyson, which litigation appar\u00ad ently has gained him. \"I'd like to nego\u00ad tiate,\" Dino Duva, Lewis' pro\u00ad conference. \"I hope so.\" Don King, Tyson's promoter, wants Tyson to challenge Bruce Seldon for the WBA title on June 13 before fighting Lewis, and he has said that if Tyson has to fight Lewis first, the champion, Seldon, would relinquish the WBC title. \"I'd have to hear that Tyson says he'd give up the title,\" Duva said. As for Lewis waiting for Tyson to fight Seldon, Duva said, \"Anything is possible. \"We'll listen to all proposals, but right now Lennox wants to fight in July.\u00bb Lewis has won three straight fights since he lost the title when he was stopped in the sec\u00ad ond round by Oliver McCall on Sept. 24, 1994. \"That was the greatest thing to happen to me.\" Lewis said. \"It helped me grow mentally and physically . \u00bb \"I'm the best shape I've been in,\" the 35-year-old Mercer said. Associated Press Heavyweight boxer Lennox Lewis, of Britain, works the speed bag in New York Tuesday as he trains for his next bout on Friday. \"When you're not in shape, you beat yourself.\" Mercer, who was in shape when he lost a 10-round decision to Holyfield in his last fight on May 20, 1995, was not in condi- \"Every great machine has a bad night.\" Jorge Luis Gonzalez on his fight last June 17 in which he was pummeled by Riddick Bowe. tion when he lost a l2-round decision to Larry Holmes in 1992 and a lO-round decision to Jesse Ferguson in 1993. Both of those defeats cost him title shots. Holyfield followed up the win over Mercer by being stopped in the eighth round by WBO cham\u00ad pion Riddick Bowe last Nov. 4 in a fight that gave Bowe a 2-1 edge in their series. \"Each and every fight is important,\" Holyfield said. \"I realize Bobby Czyz is a good fighter, but I look forward to being heavyweight champion of the world again.\" \"This is the heavyweight championship of the world for me,\" said the 34-year-old Czyz, a former IBF light heavyweight WBA I'm erspoon, WBC champion in 1984 and WBA champion in 1986, who has gotten himself back into the heavyweight picture by winning seven straight fights. \"Every great machine has a bad night,\" said the 31-year-old Gonzalez who was figuratively dismantled by Bowe in six rounds last June 17. He has won his only fight since. The three fights will be tele\u00ad vised by HBO beginning at 9 p.m. EDT. .

The decision involved their daughter Kim's delivery -from the pitcher's mound. It was early March, and Kim, a 17-year-old junior at the South\u00ad east Regional Vocational-Technical School, was five months pregnant and starting to show. But she was the star pitcher on her school team and determined to play. \"Kim's a great softball pitcher, and she wanted to play even though she's pregnant,\" Laure Schlink said this week. \"Sure, she made a mistake, but she's a good kid and she's been pitching since sh'e was eight years old .~ The Schlinks consulted with school officials and found there is no prohibition against pregnant athletes providing they are acade\u00ad mically eligible and have a doc\u00ad tor's permission. But not everyone is happy about her playing, includ\u00ad ing some of her teammates. The family doctor was skeptical at first, but came around after being told that Kim trains year\u00ad round, her mother said. . Kim and her mother also went to a New London obstetrics and gynecology clinic, where all three physicians cleared the teen-ager to .elay. So, with a one-inch pad strapped around her middle, Kim took the mound. She was not allowed to bat or CeNer home plate, but she started every game during the first month of tbe season. In the first eight games, Kim bad a 5-3 record with 80 strike\u00ad QlIts. .--\"he controversy began two .weeks ago, when the vocational ,ehool at Danielson refused to take the field against Kim, and ~eited the game. The forfeiture touched off a heated local debate about whether a girl late in her second trimester IIbould be allowed to compete in Iports. : Kim's parents were criticized for :ietting her play. : But Dr. Jeffrey Anderson, direc\u00ad tor of sports medicine at the Uni\u00ad yersity of Connecticut, said he lees no problem with a healthy, pregnant girl playing softball. \"If she's physically active and in food shape, there's not much risk,\u00b7 e said. \"I'd consult with an obste\u00ad trician, just the way the family did.\" Laure Schlink says she acted responsibly, no matter what any\u00ad 'body says. ~ ''I'm outraged that anybody would think that I would risk the ;l1ealth of my daughter, or of the \u00b7\"aby,\" she told The Associated ~ess during an interview at the family's home. .. \"There was no danger. Kim sn't batting and she's never en hit by a ball since she began aying.\" The ensuing publicity prompted Kim's parents to remove her from the team. 'II spent all weekend in tears,\" said Kim, a stocky girl with freck\u00ad les and auburn hair. \"Then Coach (Bob) Feliciano called a team meeting this week and told the girls I wouldn't be pitching but would be the team manager.\" Some of Kim's teammates want\u00ad ed her further ostracized, telling Feliciano they didn't want her on the team at all, \"because of all the fuss.w Feliciano declined to diecu88 the matter. Other school officials referred all inquiries to the atate Depart\u00ad ment of Education, which oversees Connecticut's technical echooll on 'sueh matters. , \"We were told that all the other coaches of the teams we played ,,\"ould be notified about my condi\u00ad tion,w Kim said. \"But I think they only notified them on a game-by\u00ad ,game basis.\" On Tuesday, Kim'. team played its first game without her, lOlling . 14-2 to Putnam High School.

Ken Wregget is the goaltender of the moment for the Penguins. He was one of the reasons the Penguins beat Washington in the first round of the NHL playoffs. Now, he is the overwhelming rea\u00ad son they hold a 2-1 lead in their best-of-7 second-round series with the New York Rangers. As the teams prepared for Game 4, Thursday night at MadIson Square Garden, the Penguins' \"backup\" goaltender was very much in the forefront of their plans.

Firing the first bullet of the sum\u00ad mer movie season, \"Twister\" boasts one of the most talented teams of filmmakers to be collected in quite some time, While names like Steven Spielberg and Industrial Light and Magic do not guarantee success, if you had to develop a formula for a popular film, \"Twister\" would be it. The concept for a film about the fierceness and unpredictabili\u00ad ty of nature was born in tbe mind of Michael Crichton after these elements failed to appear in the film version of his novel \"Jurassic Park.\" Crichton, one of Hollywood's most popular authors with hits including \"Congo\" and \"Disclo\u00b7 sure,\" co-wrote the screenplay for the weather thriller with his wife, Anne\u00ad Marie Martin, The film's story centers around two rival groups of scientists who are chasing the largest storm in half a century in Oklahoma's Tornado Alley. Each team wants to be the first to place its own weatber-examining equipment pack inside a tornado. A team of cocky university scientists must face heavily funded com\u00ad petition and anticipate every turn of the twisters as they fight to always stay ahead of the increasingly large funnel clouds. Adding to the charged atmosphere , Jo, the university team's leader, is reluc\u00ad tantly joined by her ex-husband and his new girlfriend, The trio is forced to put aside individual differences in an attempt to help save the lives of people killed by tornadoes, Bringing the massive vision of destruction and humanity to life is an impres\u00ad sive production team, including Steven Spielberg and Kathleen Kennedy, who have been responsible for Hollywood's all-time highest grossing mms \"E,T,\" and \"Jurassic Park.\" \"Twister\" bears Spielberg's trademark of telling an imaginative story with lit\u00ad tle known, yet capable actors. The film stars Helen Hunt (\"Mad About You\") as JOj Bill Elwes (\"The Princess Bride\") as ruthless Dr. Jonas Miller. By casting actors with average physical appearances (for Hollywood), \"Twister\" hopes to ground its spectacular story of rampaging tornadoes in a realistic environment , The real stars of the show, however, are the astounding special effects from special effects supervisor John Frazier and Industrial Light and Magic. While numerous effect shots were created with computer graphics, many of the out\u00ad See TWISTER, Page 3C Johnathan M~S\\etr;,pec;Q\\ \\0 The Daily Iowan A house near Eldora, Iowa, is demolished in it scene for UTwister,\" The film's director fell in love 01 Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) on a' new \u00b7Frlends\u00b7 on NBC an H80 \" 8 p.m, Summer moviea are what America does best.

In early March 1996, -r-.mter\" director, Jan De Bont, and a team from Amblin Entertainm nt reviJlted the house. File photo Some scenes from \"Twister,\" starring Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton, were filmed at a run-down house in Iowa. Thil time they liked what they w. helped to influence the f1I.m's stars. \"The crew really got along well with the people in the area; for\u00ad mer owner of the location Haywood said. \"Bill Paxton went tubin' down the river with some of the guys and kids one day.

The rest of the crew stripped him down naked, hosed him all ofT and forced him to ride in the back of a pickup for three or four days after that. We laughed and explained to him we don~ swim in those kinds of ponds.- Although the filming left fond memories for those involved, the future of the house started a Curi\u00ad ous debate.

The proof, however, will be in the end product. While the tinal word on \"Twister\" has been slow to arrive, early buzz is tremen\u00ad dous. The film topped Premiere magazine's list of summer movie mania, and is highly recommen d\u00ad ed in Movieline's guide to summer.
