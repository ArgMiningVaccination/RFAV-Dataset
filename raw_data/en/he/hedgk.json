Vaccination is one of the most effective and vital strategies to halt the pandemic. However, new-onset and relapsed kidney diseases have been reported after COVID-19 vaccination. This narrative review was conducted to collect published data and generalize some hypotheses for the pathogenesis of renal side effects of COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: A systematic literature search of articles reporting renal adverse reactions, including in adults and children, in the PubMed and Web of Science databases until August 2022 was performed. Results: A total of 130 cases reporting a renal adverse reaction following COVID-19 vaccination from 90 articles were included in this review, of which 90 (69%) were new-onset kidney diseases, while 40 (31%) were relapsed kidney diseases. The most frequent renal side effects of COVID-19 vaccination were minimal change disease (52 cases), IgA nephropathy (48 cases), antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody vasculitis (16 cases), and acute interstitial nephritis (12 cases). Other renal side effects occurred at a much lower frequency. Follow-up data were available for 105 patients, and 100 patients (95%) responded to the treatments. Conclusions: The number of reported cases is far less than the hundreds of millions of vaccinations, and the benefit of COVID-19 vaccination far outweighs its risks. This review will assist healthcare professionals, particularly nephrologists, who should be aware of these side effects and recognize them early and treat them efficiently.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-10-23", "cleaned_text": "Renal Side Effects of COVID-19 Vaccination [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10111783](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10111783) [Safety, Efficacy and Optimization since mass scale vaccination, a growing number of severe and required hospitalization adverse reactions to vaccinations has been reported, including neurological side effects [ [3](#B3-vaccines-10-01783)], myocarditis [ [4](#B4-vaccines-10-01783)], and autoimmune disease [ [5](#B5-vaccines-10-01783)]. Furthermore, newly diagnosed, or relapsed kidney diseases have been reported in adults and children [ [6](#B6-vaccines-10-01783), extracted patient demographics (age and sex), medical history, vaccine type, number of vaccine doses given, baseline characteristics, laboratories upon presentation, onset of symptoms, timing of symptom onset, treatments, and outcomes. The study selection process was carried out using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) guidelines ( [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-01783-f001)). 3. Results 3.1. Overall [Table 1](#vaccines-10-01783-t001), including 89 (70%) cases of newly diagnosed renal involvement and 39 (30%) cases of relapse. Of these, 52 (41%) cases were diagnosed with MCD, which is by far the most frequent renal side effect of COVID-19 vaccination, and the second most common pathology was IgAN (48/128, 37.5%), followed by 16 (12.5%) ANCA and 12 (9.0%) AIN. The median age was 42 (range 12-85) years, and 53% (68 of 128 cases) of patients were male. [Table 2](#vaccines-10-01783-t002)) Renal side effects develop after any of the commercially available COVID-19 vaccinations, but 56% (72/128) of patients received the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine, followed by 30% (38/128) receiving the mRNA-1273 vaccine. vaccine, 1.5% and received inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac). Of these, 39% (50/128) of patients developed symptoms after the first dose, while 61% (78/128) of patients developed symptoms after the second dose. However, most reports did not describe whether the second dose of COVID-19 vaccines was the same as the first dose. 3.2. Minimal Change Disease (MCD) [11](#B11-vaccines-10-01783)] had no follow-up records [ [70](#B70-vaccines-10-01783)]. The third patient was newly diagnosed with atypical anti-GBM nephritis accompanied by hypertension one week after the first Pfizer vaccination. The patient had not yet responded to immunosuppression therapy, and his serum creatinine level continued to new-onset patient developed edema managed with conservative treatment, and no signs of spontaneous remission were observed within 60 days [ [83](#B83-vaccines-10-01783)]. The other case of new-onset NELL-1-associated MN was treated conservatively with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and proteinuria significantly improved from 6.5 g/d to 0.4 g/d. [ [41](#B41-vaccines-10-01783)]. Of 3 patients with PLA2R-associated MN, only 1 patient responded to tacrolimus with proteinuria, and serum albumin improved; 1 patient received obinutuzumab, but the outcome was unknown [ [41](#B41-vaccines-10-01783)], and the other patient had no records of treatment or follow-up [ [55](#B55-vaccines-10-01783)] ( [Table 2](#vaccines-10-01783-t002)). [84](#B84-vaccines-10-01783)] reported a new case that developed PLA2R-associated MN after the first dose of Pfizer vaccination and achieved partial control after treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockade. However, edema worsened after the second dose of Moderna vaccination, and the patient achieved partial remission with rituximab treatment. 3.7. Others [37](#B37-vaccines-10-01783)], and the other patient showed a tip-variant FSGS lesion that received glucocorticoid treatment with no follow-up data [ [67](#B67-vaccines-10-01783)]. One patient with previous MCD but on repeat biopsy revealed a tip-variant FSGS lesion and achieved partial response to prednisone combined with tacrolimus therapy [ [41](#B41-vaccines-10-01783)]. [91](#B91-vaccines-10-01783)] reported a case of new-onset class III lupus nephritis with multiorgan involvement, and Zavala-Miranda al. [ [82](#B82-vaccines-10-01783)] reported a new-onset systemic lupus erythematosus beginning as class V lupus nephritis in a 23-year-old woman. The clinical symptoms of the 2 patients improved after immunosuppression treatment. [81](#B81-vaccines-10-01783)] reported a known case of class V lupus nephritis in remission presented with a flare up of lupus nephritis a week following the first dose of Pfizer vaccination. The patient received immunosuppressive therapy with mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone, but her proteinuria was slow to resolve. [48](#B48-vaccines-10-01783)] described a patient who felt unwell 4 weeks following the first dose vaccination. The patient underwent kidney biopsy because serum creatinine was 2.7 mg/dl, and a tomography findings around small vessels. Serum creatinine returned to normal within 4 weeks after methylprednisolone treatment. [97](#B97-vaccines-10-01783)] that a 66-year-old kidney transplant patient underwent a 1-year protocol graft biopsy 8 weeks after the second vaccine dose of COVID-19 vaccination, and kidney biopsy staining revealed the presence of MN. Notably, staining was retrospectively negative in the 3-month protocol graft biopsy and in the native kidney nephrectomy specimen. The diagnosis of de novo post-transplant MN was firmly established. [98](#B98-vaccines-10-01783)] present a 21-year-old male with a history of FSGS who underwent kidney transplant at 13 years of age and was stable for the following 8 years. He presented with edema, and kidney biopsy showed FSGS recurrence following two doses of COVID-19 vaccination. 4. Discussion [99](#B99-vaccines-10-01783), [100](#B100-vaccines-10-01783), [101](#B101-vaccines-10-01783), [102](#B102-vaccines-10-01783)]. The design of a vaccine requires a pathogen-specific immunogen and an adjuvant to stimulate immunity. An optimal adjuvant provides the necessary second signal for T-cell activation without inducing systemic inflammation. Typically, following mRNA vaccination, the mRNA serves as both immunogen and adjuvant and is recognized by various endosomal and cytosolic innate sensors and taken up by dendritic cells. Cytosolic sensing, such as melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 and retinoic acid-inducible gene I binds to and RNA, while Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3/7 binds to single-stranded RNA in the endosome, resulting in interferon regulatory factor 3/7 and nuclear factor B activation and the production of type I interferon (IFN-I) and multiple inflammatory mediators [ [103](#B103-vaccines-10-01783), [104](#B104-vaccines-10-01783)]. Unlike mRNA vaccination, AdV vector vaccines also contain inherent adjuvant properties, which reside with the virus particle that encases the DNA encoding the immunogen. Following injection, the particles target dendritic cells and macrophages and bind to TLR9, resulting in IFN-I secretion [ IFN-I induces the differentiation of CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells, which thereby stimulates the production of inflammatory and cytotoxic mediators and activated CD4+ T follicular helper cells stimulate B-cell differentiation into plasma cells that secrete antibodies ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-10-01783-f002)). The activation of antigen-specific effector T cells peaks one week after vaccination [ [106](#B106-vaccines-10-01783)]. From our review, more than half of the patients with MCD were observed following the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccination, and the median time for symptom onset was seven days, which supports the hypothesis for the generation of T-cell-mediated injury in MCD, and other studies demonstrated cellular immune responses approximately 1 week after viral infection [ [107](#B107-vaccines-10-01783)]. [103](#B103-vaccines-10-01783), [108](#B108-vaccines-10-01783)]. The resulting permeability factors can directly affect podocytes and alter the glomerular permeability barrier, leading to MCD [ [106](#B106-vaccines-10-01783)]. [109](#B109-vaccines-10-01783)]. The pathogenesis of IgAN is still unclear, and several studies have reported that IgAN is a condition with several hypothetical pathological mechanisms, including genetic factors influencing the encoding galactosylation of IgA1 and environmental triggers, such as bacterial or viral infection and alteration of microbiota and food antigens [ [110](#B110-vaccines-10-01783)]. In recent years, a multihit mechanism has been widely accepted. Specifically, increased synthesis of galactose-deficient IgA1 as the first hit, production of antiglycan IgG and/or IgA1 autoantibodies as the galactosylated IgA1 and antiglycan IgG autoantibodies form immune complexes and deposit in the mesangial area of the glomerulus from the subsequent hits [ [111](#B111-vaccines-10-01783)] The deposition of IgA1 immune complexes causes mesangial cell, podocyte, and tubular epithelial cell damage, leading to end-stage renal disease in patients with IgAN. [112](#B112-vaccines-10-01783)]. However, IgAN is the second most common renal side effect after COVID-19 vaccination, and the explanation has not been fully established. In this review, among 29 patients with new-onset IgAN, 12 patients showed a history of hematuria, which could suggest that IgAN is pre-existing and exacerbated by vaccination. In addition, almost 90% of patients developed gross hematuria and proteinuria after the second dose. One hypothesis is that the production of excess anti-glycan antibodies has a cross-reaction with pre-existing poorly galactosylated IgA1 following COVID-19 vaccination. Furthermore, similar to what was reported for influenza vaccines, the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine relates to a spike in IgA and IgG production in healthy adults and further increases after the second vaccination, while vaccination also stimulates robust T-helper cell and B-cell responses [ [113](#B113-vaccines-10-01783)]. Therefore, the production of excess pathogenic IgA is another explanation. Generally, within 2 days, approximately 30% of patients experience systemic symptoms such as fever and pain after vaccination, which suggests systemic cytokine-mediated attack. Thus, another explanation is that the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may act as a superantigen, activate the immune system and cause cytokine storms in which inflammatory factors, such as IL-6 and IL-10, rise sharply [ [8](#B8-vaccines-10-01783)]. [114](#B114-vaccines-10-01783)]. Moreover, a significantly reduced ANCA response after treatment with ribonuclease vaccines was observed. This encourages the question of whether ANCA vasculitis and RNA vaccines have a direct relationship. Although the occurrence of ANCA vasculitis disease after COVID-19 vaccination has been described, whether it more frequently occurs following mRNA vaccines is required to establish further real-world study. According to the report, a hyperactive immune and an autoimmune response toward SARS-CoV-2 cause ANCA and anti-GBM COVID-19 mRNA vaccination primes a notably enhanced innate immune response compared with primary immunization [ [118](#B118-vaccines-10-01783)]. The heightened innate immune response following booster vaccination could be responsible for triggering the observed PR3 and MPO autoantibodies [ [51](#B51-vaccines-10-01783)]. In ANCA-associated vasculitis, TLRs play crucial roles in initiating autoimmunity and inflammation, which are primarily attributed to TLR-2-induced Th17 autoimmunity, while TLR-9 promotes Th1 autoimmunity of TLR2 in immunodominant cytotoxic T lymphocyte response to the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, which is also produced by COVID-19 vaccines, was described [ [120](#B120-vaccines-10-01783)]. [121](#B121-vaccines-10-01783)]. In the review, all twelve patients who did not take any over-the-counter medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or herbal remedies, developed AIN after COVID-19 vaccination and responded well to steroid treatment. The mechanisms underlying the association of AIN with COVID-19 vaccination remain elusive. However, molecular mimicry could be applied to demonstrate the association between AIN and COVID-19 vaccination. Molecular mimicry refers to a similarity between certain pathogenic elements contained in the vaccine and human proteins with consecutive immune cross-reactivity [ [122](#B122-vaccines-10-01783)]. Mira et al. [ [87](#B87-vaccines-10-01783)] reported a case of AIN development after two doses of Pfizer vaccine that considered a drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. The lymphocyte transformation test was positive for both vaccine solution and polyethylene glycol (PEG) excipient-indicated T cells, particularly for PEG-specific T cells involved in a type IV hypersensitivity reaction. 5.
