Aims and objectives: This study aimed to systematically evaluate the e\u0000cacy of TCM-based integrated health interventions for relieving depression. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted on 17 databases from inception up to June 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined an integrated health intervention based on TCM theory for depression were included. The risk of bias was assessed using the second version of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials, and the quality of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Results: Eighteen RCTs with a total of 1,448 depressed participants were included. Health care providers, mainly nurses (14 studies), implemented TCM-based integrated health interventions. The pooled results showed that TCM-based integrated health interventions had larger effects on reducing depressive symptoms (15 studies; standardized mean difference = 2.05; 95% CI: 2.74, 1.37; p < 0.00001) compared with usual care at posttreatment but showed no signi\u0000cant difference contrasted to cognitive behavioral therapy (two studies, p = 0.31). However, the overall evidence was low. Conclusions: The meta-analysis results indicated that TCM-based integrated health interventions were effective in reducing depression. However, the results should be interpreted with caution because of the low quality of the included studies. Future RCTs with rigorous designs should be conducted to provide robust evidence of the e\u0000cacy of TCM-based integrated health interventions in treating depression. 1. Introduction Depression is a debilitating mental health problem characterized by depressed mood, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low self-esteem, and suicidal ideation (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). Individuals with depression often suffer from disability, increased mortality, impaired quality of life, considerable productivity loss, and huge economic burden (APA, 2013). As one of the major contributors to the overall global burden of disease, depression affects over 300 million people globally (World Health Organization, 2017), and this number is still rising at a rapid rate. In 2020 alone, 53.2 million new depressive cases were recorded (COVID-19 Mental Disorders Collaborators, 2021). At present, antidepressants and psychotherapy remain the \u0000rst line treatments for depression. However, many unhealthy lifestyles and behavior that have been identi\u0000ed as in\u0000uential in the pathogenesis of depression, such as physical inactivity, poor sleep health, and unhealthy diet, are not su\u0000ciently addressed by current treatments (Sarris et al., 2014). Lifestyle medicine, which adopts lifestyle interventions to treat and manage diseases (Kushner & Sorensen, 2013), has been used to address multiple risk factors for depression and change unhealthy lifestyles related to depression through modi\u0000ed lifestyle components that mainly involve diet, physical activity, stress management, and sleep management (Kushner & Sorensen, 2013). A recent meta-analysis of 50 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated multicomponent lifestyle medicine interventions (e.g., physical activity, nutritional advice, sleep management, and stress management) for depression (Wong et al., 2021). The \u0000nding suggested that multicomponent lifestyle interventions were effective in relieving depressive symptoms when compared to the usual care, especially for those diagnosed with major depression (Wong et al., 2021). Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)-based integrated health interventions, which share some similarities with lifestyle medicine interventions, may be a potentially effective alternative for depression. TCM-based integrated health interventions target at educating patients and modifying their lifestyle which include exercise (e.g., Tai Chi, Qigong), food therapy, sleep-wake schedule and psychological management based on TCM theories (Deadman, 2005). These lifestyle components are also targeted by lifestyle medicine which provides theoretical evidence of the use of TCM-based integrated health interventions for depression. Since people with depression are more likely to seek complementary and alternative therapies (Ashraf et al., 2021), the TCM-based integrated health interventions may be more acceptable to them, especially for those with Chinese cultural background (Yang et al., 2009; Yung et al., 2016). This may lead to higher adherence and engagement in the application of the interventions. In recent years, a number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on TCM-based integrated health interventions for depression have been performed (Meng et al., 2020; Song & Yuan, 2015; Zhang et al., 2016). However, no systematic review and meta-analysis have summarized the evidence and contents of the TCM- based integrated health interventions for depression. Such information is critical for clinicians and researchers implementing interventions in clinical and research settings. 2. Aims To \u0000ll this research gap, we aimed to synthesize available evidence of TCM-based integrated health interventions for depression and meta-analyze related effect sizes found in RCTs on the basis of available data. 3. Methods This study was conducted in line with recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statements (Page et al., 2021). A review protocol was developed and registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (registration number: CRD42022302264).Page 3/223.1\u0000Search strategy The search included 17 electronic databases: 10 English databases and seven Chinese databases, namely, the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group Controlled Trials Register (CCMD-CTR), PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (PQDT), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP Database, Wanfang, NCL Taiwan Periodical Literature, and National Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations in Taiwan. All the reference lists of RCTs and reviews related to the review topic were searched for the identi\u0000cation of additional studies. The search time of studies was from the inception to June 2022. Speci\u0000c Medical Subject Headings Terms, free-text words related to four broad concepts of TCM nursing, TCM health preservation, depression, and RCT, and Boolean operators were explored in each database for the identi\u0000cation of relevant studies. No language \u0000lter was used. When the article was presented in a language other than English or Chinese, then language translation was performed or the authors were contacted to obtain an English version. The full search strategies are provided in Appendix A. 3.2\u0000Eligibility criteria 3.2.1\u0000Types of studies The review included only RCTs. Non-RCTs, uncontrolled trials, case series, case reports, crossover studies, and laboratory studies were excluded. 3.2.2\u0000Types of population The participants were adults diagnosed with depression according to a standard diagnostic system (e.g., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM; International Classi\u0000cation of Disease, ICD; Chinese Classi\u0000cation of Mental Disorders Version 3, CCMD-3), a cutoff score of validated screening measure or to clinical diagnosis by physicians or clinical psychologists. 3.2.3\u0000Types of interventions TCM-based integrated health interventions for depression were de\u0000ned as the use of at least two of the following six components (G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2021): TCM-based depression and/or mental health education, TCM-based exercise, TCM-based food therapy and/or nutritional advice, TCM- based psychological management, TCM-based sleep-wake management, and meridian and collateral management. Studies using single-component TCM- based health interventions were excluded. No restrictions on settings, instructors, intervention modalities, sessions, durations, frequencies, and intervention periods were imposed. The operational de\u0000nitions of the six components are shown below. (\u0000) TCM-based depression and/or mental health education This component refers to any education designed on the basis of TCM theories or philosophies that increases an individual's awareness of depression, enriches his or her depressive knowledge, and in\u0000uences the attitudes and behavior associated with depression management. (\u0000) TCM-based exercise This component refers to any exercise developed on the basis of Yin-yang and Qi theories, which are characterized by activating the body's muscles, controlling breath, and nourishing the mind or Shen through resting meditation (Jiang & Zou, 2013; Sun, 2017), such as Taichi, and Qigong exercises, including Baduanjin. (\u0000) TCM-based food therapy and/or nutritional advice This component refers to any food therapy and/or nutritional advice for depression management providing individualized food choice according to TCM theory. The content should be based on an individual's body constitution from the TCM perspective and TCM food therapy and/or nutritional advice principles of Four Qi (cold, cool, warm, and hot) and Five \u0000avors (sour, sweet, bitter, salty, and pungent) (Sun, 2017). (\u0000) TCM-based psychological management This component refers to any psychological care and management or stress and emotion management using TCM theory, such as the control of seven emotions (anger, happiness, pensiveness, sorrow, anxiety, fear, and fright) and \u0000ve wills (anger, happiness, sorrow, thinking, and fear) (Sun, 2017). (\u0000) TCM-based sleep-wake management This component refers to any sleep-wake management advice using TCM theory, such as adjusting the sleep-wake pattern according to the four seasons or planning an optimal bedtime or wake time according to the time being dominated by a particular meridian (Sun, 2017). (\u0000) Meridian and collateral management This component refers to any intervention or strategy used to stimulate the body's meridians and acupuncture points to promote health (Sun, 2017), such as acupressure, auricular pressure, and moxibustion. Page 4/223.2.4\u0000Types of comparators The control group can be waitlist, usual care, or a standardized psychological or pharmacological treatment for depression. 3.2.5\u0000Types of outcomes The primary outcome is depression level as measured by validated questionnaires, such as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) (Hamilton, 1960), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (Kroenke et al., 2001) and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) (Zung, 1965). Secondary outcomes refer to adverse events. 3.3\u0000Study selection Two reviewers (JR and JL) independently screened the titles and abstracts of all identi\u0000ed articles according to the eligibility criteria. Citations considered potentially relevant were searched for full texts and assessed according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion between the two reviewers and by consultation with a third senior author (WY). 3.4\u0000Data extraction A predesigned data collection form adapted from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions were used for data extraction (Higgins et al., 2022). Extracted details included the author, published year, country, population, recruitment, diagnostic criteria for depression, participants' characteristics, details of intervention and comparator, outcome measures, and follow-up information. Two reviewers (JR and SC) extracted data independently, and any discrepancy was resolved by discussion and consultation with the third reviewer (WY). When data were missing or ambiguous information existed, the original authors were contacted through emails for data supplementation or for clari\u0000cation with three attempts. 3.5\u0000Risk of bias and quality appraisal Risk of bias of included studies and overall quality of evidence were evaluated by JR and SC who also discussed with WY if any discrepancy could not be solved between the two reviewers. The second version of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) was used in measuring the risk of bias in each included RCT (Sterne et al., 2019). The RoB 2 tool involves the evaluation of six domains: bias arising from the randomization process, bias due to deviations from intended intervention, bias due to missing outcome data, bias in measurement of the outcome, bias in selection of the reported result, and overall bias. The evaluation of risk of bias for each domain was expressed as \"low risk,\" \"high risk,\" or \"some concerns.\" Then, the overall risk of bias was assigned for each study. The overall quality of evidence was graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) (Goldet & Howick, 2013). The overall GRADE evaluation suggests to which extent an individual can be con\u0000dent in the effect estimates, and results are presented with four levels of evidence: effect, and \"large magnitude of effect,\" \"all residual confounding,\" and \"dose-response gradient\" can rate up the level of certainty in the GRADE evaluation. 3.6\u0000Data analysis Review Manager software version 5.4 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, the Cochrane collaboration: Copenhagen, Denmark) was adopted for statistical analysis. The posttreatment values were used for meta-analysis. Standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% con\u0000dence interval (CI) was used in estimating intervention effects for continuous variables measured by different scales (Higgins et al., 2022). Risk ratio (RR) was expressed with 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes. A two-sided p value of <0.05 indicated statistically signi\u0000cant difference in the overall effect. The heterogeneity of all the included studies was measured by using Cochran's Q (Chi2 test) and I-squared al., 2022). In the Chi2 test, a p value of <0.10 suggested statistically signi\u0000cant heterogeneity in treatment effects. The random-effects model was selected to examine the effects of TCM-based integrated health interventions on depression according to an assumption that the observed estimates of treatment effect can differ across studies because of random sampling error and potential existence of heterogeneity (Higgins et al., 2022). The results of meta-analyses were presented using forest plots and expressed in SMDs, and their corresponding p values, 95% CI, Chi2 test results, and I2 statistics were obtained. In the sensitivity analysis, we excluded one study at a time to examine the robustness and reliability of the pooled results. Moderator analysis using predesigned subgroup analyses was conducted according to different diagnostic criteria for depression, different depression outcome measures, the number of components of TCM-based integrated health interventions, and disease types (Higgins et al., 2022) or when the heterogeneity was moderate, substantial, or considerable. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (version 3.0) was used in measuring publication bias through the visual inspection of funnel plots and Egger's regression test when at least 10 studies were available for meta-analytic comparison (Higgins et al., 2022). In the Egger's regression test, a p value of less than 0.05 indicated statistically signi\u0000cant publication bias. In addition, the \"trim and \u0000ll\" method was used in detecting and adjusting possible publication bias (Duval & Tweedie, 2000). 4. ResultsPage 5/224.1\u0000Study selection Study selection and inclusion are illustrated in a PRISMA \u0000ow chart (Figure 1). The initial pool of 2,185 records were identi\u0000ed by searching 17 databases and other sources. After the titles and abstracts were screened independently, 1,532 articles were excluded, and 40 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Finally, 18 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria were included. 4.2\u0000Characteristics of the included studies 4.2.1\u0000Study characteristics All 18 RCTs included in this review originated from China: 17 published in Chinese from mainland China and one in English from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (Han et al., 2020). The publication years ranged from 2008 to 2021. The participants were all recruited from hospitals. The sample sizes of the RCTs varied from 48 to 140, and the total sample size was 1,448. The mean age of the participants was 58.9 years (SD = 6.5), ranging from 37.1 to 72.5 years. The average female percentage was 53.4%. Only two studies provided the disease duration of depression, which had an average of 3.9 years (SD = 7.0) (Han et al., 2020; Yang, 2018). Depression was diagnosed using the cutoff score of HAMD in four studies (Gao, 2016; Song & Yuan, 2015; Wang, 2019; Zhang et al., 2016), PHQ-9 in one study (Meng et al., 2020), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) in one study (Han et al., 2020), CCMD-3 in one study (Lu et al., 2019), and a combination of HAMD and The Chinese Classi\u0000cation and Diagnostic Criteria of Mental Disorders, Version 2 Revision (CCMD-2R) (Lin et al., 2008) or The criteria of diagnosis and therapeutic effect of diseases and syndromes in TCM (Wang, 2012) or CCMD-3 (Tan et al., 2008; Wu & Li, 2019; Yang, 2018) in \u0000ve studies. Six studies included clinical diagnosis of depression by physicians or clinical psychologists without specifying the diagnostic systems (Peng et al., 2018; Shao et al., 2018; Sui, 2018; Wang & Wang, 2021; Xin, 2014; Zhang, 2014). The majority of studies focused on post-stroke depression (11 studies, 61.1%) (Lin et al., 2008; Shao et al., 2018; Song & Yuan, 2015; Sui, 2018; Tan et al., 2008; Wang, 2012, 2019; Wang & Wang, 2021; Wu & Li, 2019; Xin, 2014; Zhang, 2014), and two studies (11.1%) focused on depression (Han et al., 2020; Yang, 2018). The other studies focused on comorbid depression in speci\u0000c diseases, including leukemia (one study, 5.6%) (Zhang et al., 2016), type 2 diabetes (one study, 5.6%) (Peng et al., 2018), menopause (one study, 5.6%) (Gao, 2016), insomnia (one study, 5.6%) (Meng et al., 2020), and uveitis (one study, 5.6%) (Lu et al., 2019). More than half of the included studies (n = 10, 55.6%) did not provide information about the use of antidepressants. Among studies that provided antidepressant information, only one study reported clearly that all participants were taking antidepressants and their medications were not modi\u0000ed during the study period (Han et al., 2020). The characteristics of the included studies are presented in Table 1. 4.2.2\u0000Characteristics of interventions and comparators Table 2 presents a summary of the characteristics of TCM-based integrated health interventions. The TCM-based integrated health interventions had an average of three components (from two to four). The components of the TCM-based integrated health interventions in the included studies involved TCM- based psychological management (18 studies, 100%), TCM-based food therapy and/or nutritional advice (14 studies, 77.8%), meridian and collateral management (14 studies, 77.8%), TCM-based sleep-wake management (\u0000ve studies, 27.8%), TCM-based exercise (three studies, 16.7%), and TCM-based depression and/or mental health education (one study, 5.6%). However, 17 of the included studies did not report how the contents and components of the TCM-based integrated health interventions were selected and established, how intervention protocols were developed, and which theoretical framework was used to support their research design, except the research of Han et al. (2020). The meridian and collateral management included acupressure in 11 studies (Gao, 2016; Lin et al., 2008; Shao et al., 2018; Song & Yuan, 2015; Sui, 2018; Wang, 2012, 2019; Wang & Wang, 2021; Xin, 2014; Yang, 2018; Zhang et al., 2016) and auricular acupressure in four studies (Lu et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2018; Wu & Li, 2019; Zhang et al., 2016). The modalities of the meridian and collateral management incorporated were nurse-led in seven studies (Lin et al., 2008; Shao et al., 2018; Song & Yuan, 2015; Sui, 2018; Wang, 2019; Wang & Wang, 2021; Xin, 2014) and self-help in four studies (Peng et al., 2018; Wang, 2012; Yang, 2018; Zhang et al., 2016), and no information regarding meridian and collateral management instructors was provided in three studies (Gao, 2016; Lu et al., 2019; Wu & Li, 2019). Three studies adopted TCM-based exercises, including Shaolin mind-body exercises (Han et al., 2020), Baduanjin (Peng et al., 2018), and Taichi (Yang, 2018). Six studies (33.3%) mentioned adopting TCM-based integrated health interventions for depression according to the TCM body constitution theory or TCM pattern differentiation (Lu et al., 2019; Song & Yuan, 2015; Tan et al., 2008; Wang, 2019; Wu & Li, 2019; Yang, 2018), such as liver qi stagnation ( heart and spleen and depression and spleen de\u0000ciency ( \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 ). The TCM-based integrated health interventions were conducted through the Internet (one study, 5.6%) (Meng et al., 2020) or face-to-face sessions at hospital wards (14 studies, 77.8%). Three studies (16.7%) did not report the setting (Han et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2018; Wang, 2012). The instructors of the TCM-based integrated health interventions were nurses in 14 studies (77.8%) (Gao, 2016; Lin et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2018; Shao et al., 2018; Song & Yuan, 2015; Sui, 2018; Tan et al., 2008; Wang, 2019; Wang & Wang, 2021; Xin, 2014; Yang, 2018; Zhang, 2014; Zhang et al., 2016), nurses and physicians in one study (5.6%) (Wu & Li, 2019), physicians in one study (5.6%) (Meng et al., 2020), and clinical psychologist in one study (5.6%) (Han et al., 2020). The mean intervention period was 6.5 weeks, and the range was from 2 weeks to 12 weeks. The number of sessions and session duration were only reported by Han et al. (2020), who conducted 90-minute group sessions weekly for 10 weeks. Usual care was selected as the control group in 17 studies (94.4%), including one study that compared a TCM-based integrated health intervention with either usual care or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (Han et al., 2020). Meng et al. (2020) adopted CBT as the sole comparator (5.6%). Page 6/22Dropout rates were reported in only three studies: 0% in the treatment group and 3.3% in the control group, along with the corresponding reasons (two dropouts: one was admitted to the hospital because of disease aggravation, and the other did not provide a reason) (Meng et al., 2020). Han et al. (2020) reported a 32% dropout rate in the intervention group (eight dropouts because of scheduling di\u0000culties), 32% in the CBT group (eight dropouts because of scheduling di\u0000culties), and 36% in the usual care group (nine dropouts because of scheduling di\u0000culties). Zhang et al. (2016) reported dropout rates of 4.8% (2/42) in the treatment group and 2.4% (1/41) in the control group (three dropouts all due to death). 4.2.3\u0000Outcome measurements Three instruments were used in measuring the level of depressive symptoms: HAMD (12 studies, 66.7%) (Gao, 2016; Han et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2019; Sui, 2018; Tan et al., 2008; Wang, 2012, 2019; Xin, 2014; Yang, 2018; Zhang, 2014; Zhang et al., 2016), SDS (\u0000ve studies, 27.8%) (Peng et al., 2018; Shao et al., 2018; Song & Yuan, 2015; Wang & Wang, 2021; Wu & Li, 2019), and PHQ-9 (one study, 5.6%) (Meng et al., 2020). 4.2.4\u0000Adverse events, adherence, acceptability, \u0000delity, and perceived usefulness None of the included studies reported the adverse events, adherence, acceptability, \u0000delity, and perceived usefulness of TCM-based integrated health interventions. 4.3\u0000Risk of bias assessment The overall methodological quality of the included studies was poor. Approximately 94.4% (17 studies) were rated as \"high risk of bias.\" The assessment of the risk of bias of each RCT included was presented in Figure 2. Although we made at least three attempts to contact the corresponding authors to clarify unclear or missing data, no additional information was retrieved. In terms of bias arising from the randomization process, 17 RCTs (94.4%) were graded as \"some concerns\" and one was evaluated as \"low\" (Han et al., 2020). Although \"randomized\" was mentioned in all studies, only \u0000ve of them (27.8%) reported the methods for sequence generation, such as \"random number table\" (Meng et al., 2020; Song & Yuan, 2015; Wang, 2019; Zhang et al., 2016) or computer-generated random number list (Han et al., 2020). Only one trial (5.6%) provided information on allocation concealment (Han et al., 2020). As for bias due to deviations from intended interventions, all RCTs were rated as \"some concerns\" because none provided precise reporting about the blinding of participants or personnel, and no intention-to-treat analyses or modi\u0000ed intention-to- treat analyses were performed when dropouts existed (Han et al., 2020; Meng et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2016), although the dropout rates did not signi\u0000cantly differ between groups. On missing outcome data, all trials were considered \"low risk of bias,\" except one study, which was designated as \"some concerns\" because of the lack of information about whether the missing status in the outcome depended on its true value (Han et al., 2020). The outcome measurements in all the included RCTs were appropriate for depression, and the ascertainment of the outcome coincided between intervention groups, but no details of assessor blinding was provided. In addition, the participant-reported outcome measures for depression (PHQ-9 and SDS) or clinician-reported outcome measures for depression (HAMD) were used, but no information about whether assessors were blinded was provided, except Han et al. (2020), who indicated that the HAMD was measured by psychiatrists who were blinded to group allocation. Therefore, the 17 included studies (94.4%) were evaluated as having a high risk of bias in the outcome measurements. On bias in the selection of the reported results, all included RCTs were graded as \"some concerns\" because no detailed information on published protocols or registrations and no pre-statistical analysis plan were provided. 4.4\u0000Results of effectiveness of TCM-based integrated health interventions 4.4.1\u0000Depression At posttreatment, TCM-based integrated health interventions were more effective for depression questionnaire score reduction (HAMD and SDS) than usual care (15 studies, SMD = 2.05, 95% CI [2.74, 1.37]; p < = 96%; Figure 3). Signi\u0000cant differences between TCM-based integrated health interventions and usual care were found at 1-month (two studies, SMD = 0.96, p < 0.00001; Figure 3). No signi\u0000cant difference was observed between TCM-based integrated health interventions and CBT with respect to depressive symptoms reduction (HAMD and PHQ-9; two studies, SMD Figure 4). 4.4.2\u0000Moderator analyses Given the considerable heterogeneity in the meta-analysis comparing TCM-based integrated health interventions and usual care in terms of depressive symptoms at posttreatment (I2 = 96%), subgroup analysis was conducted (Table 3). Subgroup analysis based on the outcome measures used, namely, HAMD and SDS or different diagnostic criteria for depression, unexplained considerable heterogeneity still existed. As for the number of intervention components of TCM-based integrated health interventions, three components appeared to be more e\u0000cacious than those with two or four components (seven studies, SMD = 3.09, 95% CI [4.70, = 98%). No statistical signi\u0000cance was shown for subgroup difference (p = 0.08). Although a subgroup analysis was performed to test whether types of diseases moderated the effect of TCM- based integrated health interventions for depression, the limited number of the other types of illnesses or conditions with depression leads to di\u0000culty in producing meaningful \u0000ndings. 4.4.3\u0000Sensitive analysisPage 7/22In terms of depression reduction, the large effect sizes of TCM-based integrated health interventions presented at posttreatment still existed (14 studies, SMD = 1.64, 95% CI [2.21, 1.08]; p < 0.00001; I2 = 94%) when the study of Wang and Wang (2021) which had the largest effect size, was removed (SMD = 8.33, 95% CI [9.57, 7.09]). Similarly, the effect sizes of reducing depressive symptoms at 1-month follow-up (SMD = 0.91, p = 0.004) were obtained after the study of Zhang (2014), which had the largest effect size, was excluded (SMD = 1.02, 95% CI [1.56, 0.48] follow-up). 4.4.4\u0000Publication bias The funnel plot analysis of TCM-based integrated health interventions for depression (n = 15) revealed asymmetry (Figure 5) with statistical signi\u0000cance tested by Egger's regression (t = 4.98, df = 13.0, p = 0.0003) when compared with usual care at posttreatment, suggesting potential publication bias. A trim and \u0000ll method was performed further and imputed potentially four studies on the left side to yield an adjusted effect size with a larger effect size than the overall effect size of 2.05 measured in 15 studies (19 studies, SMD = 2.71, 95% CI [3.61, 1.81]; Figure 6). 4.5\u0000Overall quality of evidence The overall certainty of the body of evidence of TCM-based integrated health interventions for depression was low compared with usual care (Table 4). 5. Discussion 5.1\u0000Summary of main \u0000ndings To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the \u0000rst systematic review and meta-analysis of TCM-based integrated health interventions for depression. The pooled effects indicated the bene\u0000cial effects of TCM-based integrated health interventions on the reduction of depressive symptoms with a large effect size (SMD = 2.05, 95% CI [2.74, 1.37]) compared with usual care at posttreatment. Sensitivity analysis showed that the results were relatively reliable. Nevertheless, the overall quality of evidence was low and should be interpreted cautiously because study quality was poor and no safety information on TCM- based integrated health interventions was provided. Applying TCM-based integrated health interventions for depression has attracted considerable interest (\u0000rst appeared in 2008), and more than half (12 of the 18 trials, 66.7%) have been published since 2016. The trend was similar to that of Western lifestyle medicine for depression (Wong et al., 2021). Interest in these lifestyle interventions may be due to the recognition that unhealthy lifestyle and behavior, such as physical inactivity, poor sleep health, and unhealthy diet, may partially increase the risk of depression (Kraus et al., 2019; Sarris et al., 2014). Given that the alteration of behavior is di\u0000cult, the application of lifestyle interventions should be considered in the context of long-term sustainability and issues regarding adherence and engagement (Sarris et al., 2014). TCM-based integrated health interventions for depression may have additional bene\u0000ts when applied to populations that are culturally adapted and when the interventions are well accepted by individuals with Chinese cultural background (Yang et al., 2009; Yung et al., 2016), such as countries in East Asia, where TCM has gained popularity (e.g., Taiwan, Macau, Japan, and South Korea) (Chen et al., 2015) or global TCM believers. This may in turn increase compliance and effectiveness in reducing depression. Our review found that the majority of the included studies with instructors' information were nurse-led TCM nursing interventions (14 studies); one implemented physician-led TCM health preservation (Meng et al., 2020), and one used clinical psychologist-led integrative lifestyle intervention (Han et al., 2020). TCM nursing education has been established as a compulsory course for undergraduate nursing students for at least 23 colleges and universities in China (Sun, 2017), which provided as the theoretical foundation and practical skills for nurses to adopt TCM nursing as an intervention for depression in clinical practice. Face-to-face modality was adopted by most included trials (77.8%), and one study was delivered through the Internet (Meng et al., 2020). The bene\u0000cial effects of the Internet- and mobile-based depression interventions for depressed individuals have been con\u0000rmed in a previous systematic review and meta-analysis (Hedges' g = 0.90, 95% CI [1.07, 0.73]) (Josephine et al., 2017). Apart from the advantages of being cost-effective, safe and convenient without time and place limitations, further studies are required to explore the e\u0000cacy of telemedicine, internet, or application-delivered TCM-based integrated health interventions for depression. 5.2\u0000Summary of quality assessment The research quality of the studies included in this review was low, and nearly all included studies were graded as high risk of bias. Thus, the quality of evidence was low. The three major problems in the 18 RCTs were lack of information or brief reporting without details about randomization and allocation concealment; lack of published protocols, registrations, and/or no pre-statistical analysis plan or limited information; and use of inappropriate statistical methods. Given these issues, we strongly recommend that researchers conducting trials should report su\u0000cient information in accordance with the CONSORT extension for nonpharmacologic trials (Boutron et al., 2017). Given that TCM-based integrated health interventions belong to complex health behavior interventions, we advocate the adoption of the updated Medical Research Council framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions (Skivington et al., 2021). A suitable theoretical framework, which functions as the foundation of a research and serves as the structure and supports for the rationale of any study, should be used and stated clearly in the articles (Osanloo & Grant, 2014). Moreover, the intervention development should be evidence based, TCM body constitution theory should be applied, and related processes need to be reported clearly in order that they can be repeated by other researchers. All these are essential to the generation of high-quality evidence regarding the use of TCM-based integrated health interventions for depression and promote the understanding of changes in health behavior in depressed individuals. Page 8/225.3\u0000Summary of effectiveness of TCM-based integrated health interventions The pooled effects showed the e\u0000cacy of TCM-based integrated health interventions for reducing depressive symptoms at posttreatment and short-term follow-up when compared with usual care. The effect size for depression at posttreatment (SMD = 2.05, 95% CI [2.74, 1.37]) was larger than the effect sizes of different types of psychological treatments, including life review (Hedges' g = 1.10, 95% CI [0.68, 1.51]), behavioral activation therapy (Hedges' 0.80] (Cuijpers et al., 2020). Owing to the poor quality of the included studies, the effects might be in\u0000ated. Our subgroup analysis found that the largest pooled effect size (SMD = 3.09, 95% CI [4.70, 1.47]) for depression reduction was observed when three components were adopted, which included TCM-based psychological management, TCM-based food therapy and/or nutritional advice, and meridian and collateral management. This \u0000nding was in line with a recent meta-analysis, which showed that the largest effect size was achieved when three lifestyle factors (SMD = 0.27, 95% CI [0.43, 0.12]) in lifestyle interventions (physical activity, nutrition, and stress management or physical activity, nutrition, and sleep management) were combined for depression treatment when compared with effect sizes generated of two lifestyle factors (SMD= 0.17, 95% CI [0.30, 0.05]) combined or four lifestyle factors combined for treating depression (SMD = 0.01, 95% CI [0.12, 0.15]) (Wong et al., 2021). One possible explanation for the larger effect size might be the combination of the three most effective components, which were the most frequently used in the included studies. Speci\u0000cally, enhanced effectiveness might have resulted from (1) TCM-based psychological management using music therapy (e.g., \u0000ve- phase music therapy), which activated a multitude of brain areas, such as the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral Lin et al., 2017); (2) TCM-based food therapy and/or nutritional advice, such as eating oranges, \u0000ngered citron, and tangerine peel, which may have produced an antidepressant-like effect and dispersed stagnated liver qi by regulating neurotransmitters (e.g., gamma-aminobutyric acid), affecting gut microbiome regulation, and increasing the levels of dopamine and serotonin (Ke et al., 2021; Park et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2019); and (3) meridian and collateral management, including acupressure and auricular acupressure, which may have regulated the functions of hormones and neurotransmitters by stimulating acupoints on the body surface; thus, the disease affecting the corresponding organs can be treated (Rani et al., 2020; Tseng et al., 2021). Another possible explanation might be related to the optimal number of components. Handling three components simultaneously might be more prone to generate a large effect size because this approach can address modi\u0000able lifestyle risk factors for depression at a time in contrast to interventions with two components. Patients with depression more easily learn and practice an intervention with three components and adhere to it than an intervention with four components or more. The \u0000ndings of different number of components of TCM-based integrated health interventions on depression may be restricted by the limited number of RCTs available. As such, these \u0000ndings were inconclusive and should be interpreted with caution. Further exploration on the optimal number of components, content needed, and potential mechanism of how these components function is warranted. 5.4\u0000Strengths and limitations Our systematic review has several strengths, including the inclusion of Chinese and English databases, and grading the quality of evidence according to the GRADE guideline. However, \u0000ve limitations should be noted. First, the methodological qualities of the included studies were dissatisfactory and had high risk of bias. Thus, the seemingly positive effects of TCM-based integrated health interventions should be interpreted with caution. Second, most studies included investigated comorbid depression rather depression alone, and no safety information about TCM-based integrated health interventions was reported. Third, only preliminary positive effects of TCM-based integrated health interventions for the treatment of depression at short-term follow-up were generated because only a limited number of related RCTs with long-term follow up are available at present. Fourth, considerable heterogeneity was observed across interventions, including variability in the number of components of TCM-based integrated health interventions and disease types. Although subgroup analyses were performed, the results failed to identify the possible factors that resulted in high heterogeneity. Fifth, publication bias existed, and inputting four studies did not reduce the effect size of TCM-based integrated health interventions for depression after the trim and \u0000ll approach was performed. We encourage researchers and publishers to publish studies not only with positive outcomes but also with non-signi\u0000cant or negative \u0000ndings. 6. Conclusion The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that TCM-based integrated health interventions have bene\u0000cial effects on the reduction of depressive symptoms at posttreatment. However, owing to the poor methodological quality and high heterogeneity of the studies, the seemingly positive \u0000ndings need to be interpreted cautiously. RCTs with larger sample sizes, rigorous designs, and reasonable theoretical frameworks should be conducted to con\u0000rm the effectiveness of the interventions. 7. Relevance To Clinical Practice And Rsearch TCM-based integrated health interventions serve as potential effective alternative for individuals worldwide who are suffering from clinical or subthreshold depression. Especially for those who live in the regions that are more culturally bound to TCM, they may have higher preference and adherence for TCM intervention and hence a higher effectiveness. Nurses could play an important role in designing and providing TCM nursing interventions for the depressed patients. However, due to the limitations of the methodological quality of the included studies, the current evidence may not be enough to support the use of TCM-based integrated health interventions in routine clinical practice. Therefore, further high-quality trials are needed to verify the effects of these TCM-based integrated health interventions for depression. We suggest that these studies should involve individuals with depression at various age groups (e.g., the elderly), from different resources such as hospitals,Page 9/22communities, or in regions or countries where TCM are deeply rooted, use active control groups as comparators (e.g., psychological therapy), and include long- term follow-up in the future.
