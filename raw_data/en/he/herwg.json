APhA has already issued preparedness and prevention guidance for pharmacists , patients and/or caregivers during the coronavirus pandemic , extending the reach of resources and information provided by Ce nters for Disease Control (\" CDC\") and other reputable sources .1 Pharmacists are well -positioned to provide information and educational resources related to coronavirus to the public. We can do more . Under S ection 1135 of the Social Security Act, t he HHS Secretary may now temporarily waive or modify certain Medicare, Medicaid, and Children's Health Insurance Program ( \"CHIP \") requirements to ensure that sufficient health care items and services are available to meet the needs of individuals enrolled in Social Security Act programs in the emergency area and time periods . It also allows providers who provide such services in good faith can be reimbursed and exempted from sanctions (absent any determination of fraud or abuse). Accordingly, APhA urges Congress to include language in statue that directs the HHS Secretary to use the full aut hority of Section 1135 to m aximize the use of pharmacists to prevent, treat, test and respond to the c oronavirus . America's pharmacists stand ready and able to provide the patient care services necessary to help meet the public health needs created by the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19). APhA represents nearly 60,000 pharmacists, pharmaceutical scientists, student pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and others interested in improving medication use and advancing patient care. APhA members provide care in all practice settings, including community pharmacies, specialty pharmacies, hospitals, long -term care facilities, community health centers, physician offices, ambulatory clinics, managed care organizations, hospice settings, and th e uniformed services. APhA has a track record as a strong partner with the Department of Health and Human Services (\" HHS \"), CDC, Food and Drug Administration (\" FDA \") and other agencies in 1 APhA Issues Preparedness and Prevention Guidance During Coronavirus Pandemic. Press Release. March 6, 2020, available -issues- preparedness -and-prevention- guidance -during- coronavirus -pandemic public health needs of communities such as immunizations , emergency preparedness, substance use disorder/opioids, diabetes and other public health concerns. In several states pharmacists currently have the training and authority to conduct influenza and group A s trep tococcus (\"strep\") tests, providing either treatment or referral based on the results. 2 In addition, more than 360,000 pharmacists have been trained to administer vaccines across the lifespan. 3 Pharmacists are trained to help to provide access points f or care as the coronavirus test and vaccine becomes broadly available . Pharmacists are the most accessible health care provider and provide care and services in a wide variety of practice settings in communities across our nation - making them uniquely qualified to reduce clinical burdens and improve patient health. In fact, 90% of all Americans live within five miles of a community pharmacy. 4 In addition to being medication experts, pharmacists also provide a broad array of services beyond dispensing medications, including disease state and medication management, smoking ces sation counseling, health and wellness screenings, preventive services, and immunizations.5 Our members are well -situated to work collaboratively with HHS to intervene and provide meaningful services to curb the spread of the coronavirus and play an integ ral role in containment and mitigation . To assist patients during this time, APhA supports Congress and the Administration's efforts and issuing of guidance to health plans to reduce regulatory and payment barriers for prescription refills , the need for prior authorization, and home delivery. As you likely know, many pharmacies also provide prescription delivery services which will allow patients to stay at home if clinically advisable, thus minimizing disease transmission. APhA offers the following additional immediate actions that Congress can take to help curb the looming crisis : 1. Allow Pharmacist Administ ration of the Coronavirus Test as a Rapid Diagnostic Test Congress could enact legislation to expand public access to coronavirus testing through utiliz ation of pharmacist s to collect samples according to CDC guidelines for the currently available tests, and submit them to approved labs, interpret and communicate the results to patients, make appropriate referrals and guide patients on prevention and appropriate next steps. Once a rapid diagnostic coronavirus test is available for point of care testing, we encourage utilization of pharmacists to assess patients , conduct testing, interpret the results and provide available treatment or referrals, according to CDC guidance. This would align with what pharmacists are currently authorized to do in 17 states for strep throat or influenza. 6 In Idaho , pharmacists are already authorized to prescribe products to treat strep and flu pursuant to a rapid diagnostic test and using an evidence -based protocol. Florida permit s pharmacists to also test for strep and flu along with some skin conditions. Beyond statewide authority, many other states have collaborative practice authority ( \"CPA \") broad enough to allow pharmacists to order or administer laboratory tests pursuant to the terms of the CPA with a prescriber . 2 NASP A.

With these medications the timely prescribing and use of medications is critical for success. 2. Allow All Pharmacies to R eceive a Certificate of Waiver and to O ffer the Coronavirus Test as a Clinical La boratory Improvement Amendments (\"CLIA \")-waived Point- of-Care (\"POC\") T est In addition, under Medicare, a pharmacy may possess a CLIA Certificate of Waiver so that they may expand patient access to CLIA -waived tests and improve public health. For example, patients may come to a pharmacy that has a Certificate of Waiver and ask to obtain a CLIA - waived POC test for an infectious disease. O ne recent study involved pharmacists in three states, where pharmacists in waivered pharmacies worked with a physician under a state -approved collaborative practice agreement (CPA) to help identify patients for an influenza POC test and subsequent identifi cation and management of patients who tested positive for influenza.7 This model improves identification of patients with infectious conditions earlier, particularly for patients without a primary care provider or who are screened outside of regular clini c office hours and could serve a vital role in assisting to identify patients with the coronavirus and get them to appropriate treatments. Fortyfour states allow for pharmacist POC testing for influenza and strep. Accordingly, APhA strongly recommend s Congress and the Administration allow all pharmacies to receive a Certificate of Waiver , when appropriate , for the coronavirus point of care testing when it is available , thereby removing administrative barriers to test access. Offering the coronavirus te st as a CLIA -waived point -of-care POC test for an infectious disease would assist the health system and medical providers in triaging patients . Congress should grant CMS the authority to ensure pharmacies and pharmacists are able to recoup both the costs associated with the CLIA -waived coronavirus test and the pharmacist's time under this model. 3. Recognize and Utilize Pharmacists as Capable Vaccine Providers for the Coronavirus Vaccine Wh en Available Pharmacists are important members of the \" immunization neighborhood \" and improve patient access to vaccinations recommended by the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (\"ACIP\") across the lifespan . As a reminder, ACIP and CDC \"...defines a health care provider as anyone who provides or administers vaccines: primary care physicians, specialists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and pharmacists .\"8 Thanks to changes in state laws, pharmacists are playing an increasingly critical role in increasing influenza -vaccination rates across the United States, with an additional 4.1 million additional adults vaccinated in 2013 because states allowed pharmacists to administer the f lu vaccine, which resulted in between 81,000 -134,000 fewer influenza infections among adults in that year, depending on vaccine effectiveness. Additionally, the odds that an adult would receive the flu shot increased by 7.8 percent in states that allowed p harmacists to be immunizers.9 In addition to influenza vaccination, pharmacists administer vaccines across the lifespan in accordance with ACIP recommendations, as authorized by state laws and regulations. Congress should encourage and work with states to remove any barriers to pharmacists and other health care professionals' 7 ME Klepser, et al.

In addition, Congress should direct CMS to require Part D and Medicare Advantage p lans to recognize and compensate/reimburse pharmacists , as they do physicians and other immunization providers , and maximize the inclusion of pharmacists as in -network clinicians to provide the coronavirus vaccine when it becomes av ailable . Furthermore, CMS should remove any barriers for pharmacists to be immunizers of the coronavirus vaccine, when available, whether under Part B or Part D. CMS permits an entity or individual, such as a pharmacist/pharmacy, who wishes to furnish mass immunization services, but may not otherwise qualify as a Medicare provider, to enroll as a \"mass immunizer.\" Currently, pharmacies as mass immunizers are restrict ed from billing Medicare for any services other than pneumococcal pneumonia vaccines ( \"PPVs \"), influenza virus vaccines, and their administration . 10 Accordingly, due to this public health emergency, Congress should direct CMS to immediately act to ease the requirements to become an immunizer and allow pharmacists and pharmacies to meet the d emand for distributing the coronavirus vaccine once it become s available , whether under Part B or Part D . In addition, CMS should require Part D sponsors to submit and CMS to aggregate data from Medicare Advantage (\" MA\")-Prescription Drug (\"PD \") and Part D plan sponsors to better monitor, measure and attribute the impact different providers, including pharmacists, have on coronaviru s vaccination rates of Medicare beneficiaries and encourage private plans to do the same . 4. Remove Administrative Barriers that Impact Pharmacists Delivery of Care for Patient Preparedness On March 12, 2020, APhA called on all of the nation's health insurers and pharmaceutical benefit managers ( \"PBMs \") to immediately remove/waive any administrative barriers on pharmacists and patients for access to early medication refills from their pharmacy of choice to ensure patients have the medications necessary for chronic diseases to address their needs during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. We appreciate the steps already taken by some states and payers authorizing pharmacists to dispense emergency refills or waiving early medication refill limits on 30 -day prescription maintenance medications, and the guidance in this area issued by the CDC and Department of Homeland Security. APhA also a ppreciates the r ecent actions taken by CMS reminding Medi care Advantage and Part D plans o f their ability to : 1) remove prior authorizations requirements ; 2) waive prescription refill limits, and 3) relax the restrictions on home or mail delivery of prescription drugs. However, Congress could direct HHS to help ease confusion by implementing uniform measures to ease the burdens on pharmacists and patients across the country. Without immediate changes to implement broad, system -wide authorization for early or emergency refills for chronic medications, patients ma y have to endure long waits at the pharmacy while the pharmacist addresses the administrative barriers. Not only does this frustrate patients and increase their risks of exposure in public places, but it challenges pharmacists' ability to deliver patient c are services. In addition to all of the above, we urge Congress t o help provide appropriate and effective protective equipment (N -95 masks, gloves, etc .) to pharmacists and other health care professionals providing direct patient care to individuals. This will address a significant concern 10 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Internet -only manual (IOM), Publication 100- 08, Medicare Program Integrity Manual, Chapter 15, Section 15.4.6.2 -- Mass Immunizers Who Roste r Bill.

Conclusion Again, p harmacists stand ready and able to help. We look forward to working with you as well as the President's Coronavirus Task Force to intervene and provide meaningful services to meet the public health challenge created by the coronavirus - which can serve a s an effective mechanism to combat additional public health emergencies in the future.
