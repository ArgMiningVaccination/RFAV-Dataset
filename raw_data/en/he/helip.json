This virus was first identified during an investigation into an outbreak in Wuhan, China. - The exact way the virus is spread is not fully known. With similar coronaviruses (MERS and SARS), person-to-person spread is thought to have happened mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other viruses that cause respiratory illness spread.
