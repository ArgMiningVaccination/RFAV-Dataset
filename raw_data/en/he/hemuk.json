The most important reason to investigate is to learn enough about the situation to implement appropriate control and prevention measures. Investigations also enable researchers to advance knowledge about the disease, agent, risk factors and interventions; provide a way to respond to public, political or legal concerns; evaluate a health program's effectiveness and weaknesses; and provide training.
