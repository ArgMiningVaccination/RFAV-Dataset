The report was prepared for section 46 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 , in accordance with the requirements of that Act and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 . It was approved by the Board on 9 September 2020 and provides a streamlined, yet full, overview of the ABC's performance and delivery in line with its Charter remit. The ABC walked beside Australians through the stress, fear and change of late 2019 and early 2020, a time full of uncertainty. It provided constant support for audiences with its wide-ranging and comprehensive news coverage, and help and distraction through quality discussion, entertainment, music, children's content and specialist services. We adapted to our new operating circumstances expediently, while facing our internal challenges head on. There can be no better example of the ABC's dedication to Australian stories, culture and experience than its activities throughout 2019-20. I trust you will find the same reflected within this report. Sincerely, Ita Buttrose AC, OBE Chair Letter to the Minister iLetter to the MinisterYvonne Strahovski as Sofie Werner in Stateless .

Who could have imagined how much Australia and the world would change because of COVID-19? Where will we be in another 12 months? Will our lives have returned to normal or the \"new normal\" whatever that is? Few, if anyone, know the answer but what I do know is that the ABC and its dedicated employees, who are passionate about public broadcasting, will still be doing what they do best - delivering news, entertainment and information to Australians wherever they live. They rely on us to do this because they know they can. During the year I posed the question what would Australia look like without the ABC? There are some who do wish that fate for Australia. They should be careful what they wish for because an Australia without the ABC would not be well informed and our country's future would be diminished. The ABC is part of the Australian fabric and has helped shape our nation since 1932. During that time, it has educated, informed and entertained millions of Australians. It has delivered compelling programs that never would be shown on commercial outlets. It will continue to do so. It has produced quality investigative news and current affairs as opposed to opinion-based news programs. It will continue to do so. Three of Australia's most important Royal Commissions - Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry, Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, and Aged Care Quality and Safety - were the result of Four Corners ' investigations. These Royal Commissions and their significant outcomes are a reminder of the value - dare I say the priceless value - that the ABC represents. I don't think there has been enough discussion about the value of the ABC, particularly its importance to Australian democracy.By keeping Australians informed about important issues such as irrigation's impact on our rivers, climate change, digital transformation, the high incidence of mental health illnesses, Indigenous people's need for a voice in our Constitution, gender and cultural equality, homelessness, the skills younger Australians will need for jobs of the future, and why our older citizens need better care, the ABC helps Australians to participate more fully in our democracy as informed citizens. A well-informed Australia is a clever and competent Australia that bases opinion on fact. The strength of the ABC and its relationship with the nation comes from the people who work for us. The creativity in the programs they produce, the dogged and independent journalism they pursue and the connection with Australians that they provide through conversations, are at the very heart of what the ABC delivers to its audiences. My thanks to them all for their resilience and commitment. The ABC has a statutory requirement to operate as efficiently as possible. We have a strong track record in identifying savings and reinvesting them in services. This is how we created ABC News 24, ABC iview and a range of packages to boost services in rural and regional Australia. It's worth remembering that the ABC serves a population just over one-third the size of the United Kingdom (over a landmass 32 times bigger), and does so with total funding of around one-seventh the size of the BBC's budget. The BBC receives the equivalent of $6.7 billion for a population of 67 million compared to the ABC's $1.065 billion funding for our population of 25 million. During times of crisis Australians turn to the ABC. During the summer bushfires we played a critical role in keeping people safe, with our teams in rural and regional communities working around the clock to make sure crucial information was available to people in danger from the fires. They were on the ground in almost all the fire zones and in communities, conducting emergency broadcasting to disseminate crucial and, at times, life-saving information.Foreword from the Chair 2 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Emergency broadcasting is a high-pressure job, requiring expert filtering and prioritising of information from fire and emergency services, government authorities, community organisations and listeners, often calling in from dangerous, stressful and unpredictable situations. There were times when the lives of our reporters were at risk and there were concerns for their safety and mental wellbeing. They witnessed heartbreaking human tragedy and while nothing compares to the anguish of people who were directly affected by the fires, covering the summer bushfires did have an impact on our teams to varying degrees. It would be impossible not to be affected in some way, just as it's impossible for any of us not to be affected by the impact of Coronavirus. At the time of writing Australians are continuing to turn to the ABC to keep up-to-date with the latest COVID-19 developments and hear the important messages from governments. They trust us to deliver the advice and information they are seeking.COVID-19 has forced us all to pause and reflect on the way we live. It also has focused our attention on older Australians and the quality of aged care. Many Australians are questioning whether or not we value our older citizens well enough. A little girl from Old People's Home for 4 Year Olds , one of my favourite ABC programs in the past year, summed up the situation succinctly. When asked why she thought a group of older men and women in an aged care facility looked so sad she said: \"They don't have anyone to play with them\". Out of the mouths of babes... how wise children can be.

Image: Christopher Lewis Snapshot of the ABC 2020 13The Year Ahead It has been a challenging year for all of us for many reasons, the COVID-19 pandemic just one of them. The bushfires across the nation last summer tested our teams to their best abilities , from our metro news rooms to our regional bureaux across the country. We will always ensure that Australians have access to vital information during times of crisis and as the nation recovers. Additionally, we will deliver resources to help communities prepare for emergencies and build resilience in the aftermath of such events. COVID-19 has tested us even further, changing the way we work and live. However, the ABC has stood strong during this turmoil. Throughout this momentous challenge we have adapted and continued to support all Australians, providing the valued news, information, investigations, entertainment, education, music, culture and conversations that have always been the hallmark of our relationship with them. They have relied on us to do this for the past 88 years and know that we are deeply committed to continuing to deliver these excellent services. I think they have never been more important. Earlier this year I launched the first-ever ABC Five-Year Plan, our 2020-2025 strategy to guide us as we accelerate our transformation from a traditional broadcaster to Australia's most trusted and valued digital content provider. We want to get closer, understand and reflect our nation's many and diverse cultures and interests. We want to become more local; to better reflect communities across the country, to listen to audiences and provide the content they ask for. The ABC stands by its deep and long-standing commitment to regional and rural Australia. As the commercial media industry withdraws, we will remain embedded as part of many communities across the country, connecting Australians wherever they live.The ABC will increase reporting for and from the outer-metropolitan and regional areas of Australia's cities. Having already opened a Parramatta office in Western Sydney in March 2020, we will move forward with decentralising our workforce and are committed to relocating more than 75% of content-makers out of the ABC Ultimo Centre in Sydney, over the life of the Five-Year Plan. The ABC has built its enviable reputation as the most trusted institution and provider of news, information and investigative journalism, and we aim to ensure that degree of trust remains unassailable. Central to our public standing is the clear impartiality that provides a foundation of trust between us and our audiences. The ABC's independence - its freedom from answering to vested interests - allows us to report without fear or favour. It makes us uniquely placed to pursue public interest journalism, keeping Australians informed on matters of importance crucial to the functioning of democracy. To that end, we will continue to champion law reform so that our journalists can do their jobs without fear of prosecution. We are committed to reflecting the spectrum of views across the country and discovering new voices from across the nation to better represent and reflect the diversity of contemporary Australian life. To continue on this path, the ABC will commission more stories that reflect the breadth of Australian experiences and perspectives, embracing our cultural, socio-economic and geographic diversity. In 2020-21, we also will continue to implement initiatives to increase the social and cultural diversity of our staff. Fundamental to this will be the commitment we have already made, set out in the ABC's Diversity and Inclusion Plan 2019-22 and Elevate Reconciliation Action Plan 2019-22. 14 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020In the coming year, the ABC will prioritise its goal to become Australia's premier digital media innovator and a leader in anticipating the on-demand and personalised ways people seek their information and entertainment. During 2020-21, we will improve personalisation across platforms and devices to provide an experience that reflects audiences' preferences and makes it easier than ever to find ABC content and services. This innovation, initially applied to ABC iview, will allow the audience to leave watching programs on one device and resume on another, helping to turn the service into the leading online showcase for our content. A key element of developing these personalised services will be ensuring privacy protections for audiences that are consistent not just with Australian law, but with global best practice. To make sure that we have the capabilities to deliver these services and to position the ABC to survive future changes, we will continue to modernise our technology base. I would like to thank all ABC staff for their hard work and dedication during this challenging year. In the year ahead, as the country continues to recover from the pandemic and the bushfires, we will continue that dedication and commitment. This year has shown that the future is never predictable, but we will continue to uphold the highest editorial values and deliver the most trusted public interest journalism, coverage and information for all Australians, everywhere.

In March 2020, 84% of Australians surveyed agreed ABC News 'is a valuable source of news to the Australian community' and 72% agreed it is 'Australia's most trusted source of news and current affairs'. 6 Turning to the ABC While news and media consumption were at an all-time industry high, ABC News, with its heritage and trust, experienced greater audience increases than most other players, especially digital coverage. ABC News became Australia's No 1 digital news brand in January and has remained there. In March, its unique digital audience of 15.2 million - 61% of the population - was a record for any digital news brand in Australia, and ABC News digital was ranked No. 1 for audience every day from 29 February to the end of the reporting period. TV and radio audiences also soared. The ABC NEWS channel recorded its highest results ever, reaching 4.45 million metropolitan Australians on broadcast in the last week of March, while its livestreams on YouTube and ABC iview were up more than 300% and 200% respectively on the 2019 average. 7 6 ABC Corporate Tracking Program. 7 OzTAM five-city metropolitan consolidated data; OzTAM VPM; YouTube Analytics. 18 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Shining a light Flagship ABC broadcast programs continued to produce Australia's leading in-depth investigative and current affairs journalism, breaking some of the year's biggest stories. Highlights included 7.30 's exclusive interview with barrister-turned-police informer - or 'Lawyer X' - Nicola Gobbo, and investigative piece 'The Final Race', which revealed many Australian racehorses were ending up at slaughterhouses. The latter produced public outcry, resulting in changes to the racing industry's management of racehorse rehoming and welfare. Four Corners , for decades Australia's leader in long-form investigative journalism, continued to evolve and strengthen its service with more quick-turnaround programs on current topics such as the bushfires, COVID-19 and the Hong Kong protests. Among its most impactful investigations of the past 12 months, 'Boys Club' exposed a toxic culture at Melbourne's exclusive St Kevin's College, including the grooming of students. Eye of the storm To cover the year's biggest international political story, ABC International established a 'pop-up' bureau in Hong Kong, rotating teams from the ABC's Asia bureaux and Australia to provide nearly six months of ongoing coverage of the protests against the increasing influence of Beijing. This allowed ongoing research and engagement with sources, delivering deeper insights into the people and forces involved, and increasing awareness of the ABC as a trusted source of information in the region. The ABC was on the ground on the biggest day of protests, when up to two million people made history. Reporters also sought out and profiled those opposed to the protests, the so-called 'silent majority' that Beijing hoped would mount an effective pushback, showing the significant damage the protests caused to economic activity. In co-production with the Asia-Pacific Network, social media explainers were created to examine competing narratives about the protests. In other news The Asia-Pacific Newsroom grew audiences, especially for its Chinese language output. The team produced content in Bahasa Indonesian and Tok Pisin as well as English. Between July 2019 and June 2020, there were 5.4 million page views of the Chinese service on the ABC NEWS website and app - 260% above the same period the previous year (1.5 million page views). 8 During the same period there were more than 26 million views of content published on Indonesian syndication partner websites, which is 5% up on the same period the previous year, 9 and 2.6 million page views of the ABC Bahasa Indonesian service on the ABC NEWS website and app, 101% above the previous year. 10 The ABC continued to have by far the largest international reporting operation of any Australian media organisation, with correspondents in Port Moresby, Bangkok, Jakarta, New Delhi, London, Washington, Beijing, Beirut, Jerusalem and Tokyo. The ABC also has a Pacific Affairs correspondent and a Pacific Beat reporter based in the Solomon Islands. During the year, reporters were on the ground as the coronavirus disaster unfolded around the globe. Other major stories covered by foreign bureaux included Brexit and Boris Johnson's UK election win, the Women's Soccer World Cup in France, the Rugby World Cup in Japan, the Bougainville independence referendum, mass student protests in Indonesia, the attempted impeachment of US President Donald Trump, the start of the US Presidential election battle and the Black Lives Matter protests. 8 Google Analytics (includes long-tail and homepage views). 9 Indonesian Syndication Partners.10 Google Analytics (includes long-tail and homepage views).

The show's host Ruby Cornish regularly receives feedback from parents on its impact:Factual impact Australia's Ocean Odyssey took viewers along Australia's eastern current from the Great Barrier Reef to Antarctica, revealing how ocean currents create life on our planet. The ABC produced complementary curriculum-aligned education materials using clips from the series aimed at upper primary and lower high school students, as well as stories of Australians involved in citizen science projects and how to get involved. A number of organisations hosted online Q&A discussions with their communities following the broadcast of the series including the Great Barrier Marine Foundation, the Sydney Institute of Marine Science and the WWF. Silent No More , a revelatory exploration of how #MeToo is changing Australia, saw veteran journalist Tracey Spicer speaking with Australians who had been affected by sexual harassment and assault. Through sharing their experiences, they addressed how the system must be reformed. Social and iview short series A Few Good Blokes was produced to support the conversation around Silent No More . It followed three Australian men as they worked supporting other men in their communities and exploring what it means to be a good role model. The three-part series had more than 2.5 million views on ABC social media and iview. Revelation was an important documentary series exploring abuse in the Catholic Church. For the first time, cameras were inside the courtroom as two of the Catholic Church's most notorious child abusers went on trial for sexually assaulting children in their care. In another first, Revelation featured interviews with paedophile priests, one from behind bars in a maximum-security prison.A trusted neighbour The ABC's international media services have promoted awareness and understanding of Australia across the globe for more than 80 years. In particular, the ABC has considerable experience in the Pacific and has an excellent reputation with audiences across the region. In 2019-20, its digital and broadcast services continued to create awareness, understanding and trust to serve as a foundation for Australia's endeavours to increase engagement with our Pacific neighbours. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the ABC's international media services provided reliable, practical and timely information to the peoples of the Pacific. 20 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Education for all ages ABC Kids Early Education launched as the trusted source on childhood development for parents, families, carers and the early childhood community.

ABC News responded swiftly to the pandemic, with teams mobilising nationally and around the world to cover the unfolding story in depth. Rolling news coverage on the ABC NEWS channel brought audiences live briefings and press conferences and trusted regular programs such as the 7pm News , 7.30, Four Corners , Foreign Correspondent , Q+A and AM explored related topics at length. The ABC also sought new ways to inform the public. New daily podcast Coronacast , hosted by Dr Norman Swan and Tegan Taylor, fielded more than 75,000 audience questions about the pandemic by the end of June, and went to the top of the Apple chart in Australia, amassing 7.7 million downloads from March to May with an average of 2.6 million per month. 11 Broadcast TV program The Virus and data journalism delivered by Casey Briggs provided extra, regular updates. The ABC also ran Government community service announcements which reached more than 8 million Australians, and the ABC's Audience Support team handled thousands of contacts requesting help. The needs of parents and children as they moved to homeschooling saw the ABC launch an expanded schedule of free, curriculum-linked education content, which ABC Education worked with state and territory education departments to deliver. ABC ME extended its educational programming from 14 April, including blocks of primary school and secondary school content. Education content on ABC iview recorded its highest ever numbers (daily users and sessions), averaging 84,000 users in the first few days. At the height of school closures during April 2020, the ABC Education website saw 766,000 users, an increase of 239% of users compared to April 2019.The ABC's network of bureaux and international correspondents was vital as the outbreak became a pandemic, providing audiences with firsthand reports from the epicentre in Wuhan, locked-down towns in northern Italy, protests in Beirut, the streets of Delhi and crowded clinics of Jakarta. Around Australia, local ABC teams responded to the new experiences and challenges facing their audiences with content that brought audiences together and helped them with day to day living during COVID-19. ABC Hobart introduced 'radio play', a twice weekly children's play segment mixing educational and entertaining activities for kids at home, while ABC Adelaide invited listeners to share messages of love and support for their relatives isolated in aged care facilities. Capital City teams across the country instigated Thank You Thursdays, shining a light on frontline workers. Messages of thanks were featured on-air and online. Consultation with the Council of the Aging and Dementia Australia on the needs of older Australians during COVID-19 saw Capital City and regional networks draw awareness to the National COVID-19 Older Person Support Line. ABC Radio also launched 'Getting On', a weekly national segment on Afternoons with Angela Catterns aimed at older Australians, while five short digital video stories highlighting ways to stay connected while isolated and socially distanced, featuring cast members from Old People's Home for 4 Year Olds , had more than 12 million views on social media.COVID-19 11 Podsights. 22 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020triple j Hack and News were a vital source keeping younger Australians informed, focusing on health advice, the social implications of COVID-19, and workplace and economic issues. For the youngest viewers, Play School fast tracked episodes designed for co-viewing by parents and toddlers to explain questions around social distancing, how to wash your hands and why playgrounds were closed. These programs delivered an overwhelmingly positive audience response with a combined total of more than 1.3 million views. The ABC also worked with NITV and First Nations Media radio organisations to ensure the message was distributed to as many communities around Australia as possible. Broadcast reach increased significantly across all platforms and then steadied, well above the 2019 averages. The ABC News channel recorded its highest-ever monthly reach in March 2020 with 6.4 million viewers, up 57% on March 2019. The pandemic necessitated innovative ways to cover news events. When COVID-19 forced cancellations of local Anzac Day services and marches, the ABC produced a live broadcast weaving together the many threads of community movements, RSL events, government departments and the Australian War Memorial. ABC TV coverage reached an audience of 2.9 million, plus there were 657,000 streams on the ABC listen app. 12 Audiences indicated they were looking for entertainment and distraction from the crisis at hand, and more than 200 hours of classic Australian screen content were added to ABC iview as a result, providing enhanced choice and variety.The ABC brought the Melbourne International Comedy Festival into homes with a special Comedy Care Package that achieved an overnight metropolitan audience of 420,000 - up from 335,000 in 2019. 13 Other morale-boosting new programs included At Home Alone Together , a comedic take on the lifestyle magazine genre that went from concept to screen in just six weeks, and Cuppa with Kumi from the Compass TV team, which addressed issues of community connection. As the devastating effects on local productions became clear, the ABC announced it would be supporting more than 200 Australian productions and new content ideas through its $5 million Fresh Start Fund, to help safeguard local content and creativity. Behind the scenes the corporation moved swiftly to safeguard coverage while prioritising the health and wellbeing of staff. During the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ABC developed highly efficient and effective remote working capabilities, with approximately 85% of ABC employees supported and prepared to successfully work from home. Essential editorial and production staff adopted strict protocols in the workplace and in the field to minimise health and safety risks and also to avoid any interruption to vital services. All teams quickly adapted to the constraints and risks inherent in covering the pandemic, via innovative approaches to gathering content, and leveraging social media platforms and other networks to reach people and continue to tell their stories. 12 OzTAM and Regional TAM, OzTAM VPM; GA data. 13 OzTam Metro Overnight DataL-R Bjorn Stewart and Ray Martin film At Home Alone Together . Content, services & communities 23Local bureaux The ABC's local stations and bureaux connect with communities across Australia, providing relevant content across a range of platforms, celebrating important local events, and supporting communities in times of need. Local teams undertake outside broadcasts (OBs) and events throughout the year, covering important regional issues and events and giving a platform to communities across the country. In February and March 2020, ABC Radio Brisbane broadcast for a day each from Ipswich, Logan, and Moreton Bay to share community perspectives in the lead up to the Queensland local council elections. Cairns and Townsville rural reporters took their radio audiences to a place rarely visited by the public - 5.8 kilometres down a narrow road to the end of the world's second longest jetty, the Lucinda Bulk Sugar Terminal in Far North Queensland. WA Regional Drive broadcast from the Dowerin Field Day, an agricultural event attended by more than 25,000 people in the Central Wheatbelt of WA, while Australia Wide and ABC Alice Springs teams broadcast from Uluru to mark the closing of the rock climb on 25 October 2019. Cultural events Local teams broadcast live from community cultural events and partnered with festivals to bring those experiences to wider audiences in the area and across the country. In September 2019, triple j took over the small regional town of Lucindale on the South Australian Limestone Coast providing another stellar line up of Australian artists for a large appreciative crowd at the One Night Stand . Headliners Hilltop Hoods, Meg Mac, Ocean Alley and G Flip were joined by 15,000 people at the free event, with $22,558 raised for the Stand Like Stone Foundation. Half the money raised was donated to help the Lucindale Area Pool reopening, and the remaining 50% was allocated to youth leadership scholarships.Local connections triple j's One Night Stand in Lucindale, SA.

Twenty-one choirs from across New South Wales performed at the Sydney Recital Hall, sharing stories and songs from diverse communities around Sydney and the state. The concert concluded with all 560 choristers performing Christine Anu's Kulba Yaday in Kalaw Kawaw Ya language from the north western island of the Torres Strait. In January 2020, ABC New England North West once again brought listeners all the action from the Tamworth Country Music Festival across a week of programming. Support for communities ABC local teams also supported their communities through charity events and fundraising. In 2019 and in its 31 st year, ABC Hobart's Giving Tree Appeal - the state's biggest Christmas appeal - raised more than $100,000, with a further $130,000 worth of gifts donated to be distributed to disadvantaged and vulnerable Tasmanians. The Queensland Gives Christmas Appeal raised more than $300,000 for the Queensland Rural Fire Service, with ABC Brisbane hosting a variety concert to a sell-out crowd of 2,000, staffed by 50 volunteers from ABC Brisbane. Approximately 7,000 visitors attended the Adelaide ABC Gardeners' Market in October, which included entertainment and ABC tours, raising more than $24,000 for the charity partner CanTeen. Capital City radio stations partnered with not-for-profit aid agency Foodbank during the year, encouraging the community to donate to their services, especially in times of crisis or need. ABC Alice Springs presenter Alex Barwick was part of the team covering the closing of the Uluru climb. Content, services & communities 25Communities strategy and engagement Increased quality and quantity of regional reporting was made possible through the three-year Connecting Communities project, which was completed in December 2019. The technology investment project boosted regional digital and video reporting capacity, resulting in an increase in content from regional bureaux across all platforms, especially digital and video, correlating with an increase in audience engagement and reach, meaning more communities being served. The ABC's Community Engagement team also continued their work throughout the year, which included projects increasing media skills in remote communities. For more see page 32. Stories from the outer city ABC news teams in the cities also connected with local communities throughout 2019-20. The Melbourne newsroom explored the challenges of living in Tarneit, on the city's fringe and one of the country's fastest growing areas, and in Queensland local teams spoke to Chinese-speaking residents in Sunnybank who were using WeChat to reach out to others in the community if they felt unsafe. Journalists from the Perth newsroom spent three days with Mandurah locals getting their thoughts on the big issues - producing content that attracted well over the average audiences for typical local digital stories. In March, the new Western Sydney newsroom opened, doubling the number of permanent News staff on location from three in the old office to six and adding the capacity to broadcast live radio programs in future. The newsroom is equipped for video and audio news production and editing and has space for 12 staff, including two Local Communities Reporters who will focus on finding and telling the stories of Western Sydney's many diverse communities. Under a partnership with Western Sydney University journalism students will also be able to do work experience in the newsroom as part of their course work.ABC listen experienced a 43% uplift in users accessing ABC local station livestreams (capital city and regional stations). New 'set up' features in the app included a location-based station finder, and peak periods for livestream engagement were during the bushfires, on Anzac Day, and regularly throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. 26 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Speaking to Australians Quality programming showcasing the stories of communities around Australia included Almost Australian , a three-part documentary series hosted by Miriam Margolyes. Miriam's 10,000 kilometre drive across the country to explore the 'Australian dream' included visits to towns, beaches, camping parks, and the outback, where she met a diverse range of Australians who shared their unique stories - farmers doing it tough during the drought, Chinese Australians, refugees from Afghanistan and Burma, and the sista girls of Tiwi Island. One particular conversation with Afghani refugee Moj inspired a large and emotional reaction on social media, with fellow Australians reaching out to share their support for the young man.On radio, Ockham's Razor , RN's 'science soapbox', travelled to Perth, Hobart, Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney in search of the best 10-minute talks and stories, and RN's Awaye expanded the 'Word Up!' broadcast series and podcast, reaching out to more language revival communities Kulkalgau Ya (Poruma or Coconut Island in the Torres Strait), Land, QLD) and Wurrung (Victoria).

Content, services & communities 27Australia's 2019-20 bushfire season was one of the worst on record with more than 17 million hectares burned, an estimated three billion wildlife killed and 33 lives lost. The season was the longest covered by the ABC and involved the largest number of staff ever to have worked on an emergency event. The fires began in August 2019 and by season's end, the number of emergency events covered by the ABC was almost triple that of the previous year. In 2019-20 the ABC covered 953 events compared to 375 in 2018-19 and 256 in 2017-18. ABC teams often worked around the clock to provide critical information and coverage to local communities. In the peak of the crisis, in the first two weeks of January 2020, ABC Gippsland broadcast 134 hours of rolling bushfire coverage; ABC Melbourne 83 hours; and New South Wales local teams nearly 300 hours.The ABC responded to this unprecedented increase in emergency bushfires by redirecting resources from around the country to provide support when and where it was needed. Significant logistical planning was required to deliver simultaneous emergency coverage at multiple locations. This meant calling staff back from leave, and moving staff from location to location across the summer period. During the peak of the coverage there were up to 140 journalists and operations staff on the front line drawn from state, network, regional and interstate newsrooms. NewsRadio and Radio Current Affairs abandoned their summer schedules and the 7.30 team returned from leave for a 1 January special. Around 1200 bushfire-related digital articles were published during the season, and in a two-week period from 24 December to 7 January the ABC NEWS channel produced 270 dedicated hours of live bushfire programming. Australians turned to the ABC in record numbers at this time. Independent research commissioned by the ABC showed that not only was the ABC the most trusted information source, but lives were saved as a result of people acting on information the ABC provided. 14 For many people, when digital and telecommunications failed in bushfire impacted areas, ABC Local Radio was the only way to access the timely information they needed to survive. 14 The ABC Bushfire Impact Research was conducted by Ruby Cha Cha between 17-27 March 2020. It involved a survey of 1630 people (aged 18-75 years). An additional survey of 373 people living in postcodes affected by the bushfires was also conducted along with a small face-to-face survey of 16 people also affected by the bushfires.Bushfire coverage Peter Drought in Colo, New South Wales. Image: Lily Mayers 28 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020ABC NEWS rose to become the top digital news site in the country, a position it held throughout the rest of the 2019-20 year. Audiences were up significantly across all other platforms with live streaming of Local Radio up 25% on last year, the ABC listen app up 63% on last year and the ABC Radio's Capital City network at its highest reach and share in three years. Audience response was constant across the summer, with appreciation of the ABC's coverage coming from the floors of Australian parliaments, from council chambers, and from audiences via phone, text, email and even handwritten thank you notes slipped under the windscreens of ABC vehicles. For the ABC's technical and operational teams, the 2019-20 season proved challenging. Service was lost from 18 transmission sites due to mains power outages, but in all cases services were quickly restored. Two towers were extensively damaged: one at Mt Wandera, servicing the Batemans Bay and Moruya region, and the other at Talbingo. At Batemans Bay, the ABC directed listeners to the neighbouring AM services for Nowra and Bega. Nowra's RN service was changed to carry ABC Radio emergency warnings and a temporary service for Batemans Bay was subsequently established to ensure the local community could access emergency broadcasting. At Talbingo, service was lost only after the town had been evacuated and restored as soon as it was safe to return to site.In the aftermath of the fires, a dedicated Bushfire Recovery Team was established to ensure the challenges faced by fire-ravaged communities were not forgotten. ABC teams focused on supporting impacted communities as they recovered from the summer bushfires, sharing their stories of resilience and recovery, and supporting local fundraising events for those impacted by the bushfires. The ABC also raised more than $13 million in partnership with the Red Cross and City of Sydney as part of the New Year's Eve donation drive. For more on NYE, see page 41. Following the bushfire season, the ABC redeveloped the Emergency Broadcasting website, providing greater detail of incidents and integrating with ABC Radio in readiness for the 2020-21 season.

They are now the primary means by which many people access news, entertainment and information. The ABC understands that to reach the most people in the most relevant way, content and services must be tailored for on-demand consumption, and fit for purpose for mobile delivery. Personalisation Today's audiences want content that appeals to their lifestyle, interests and behaviours, and is easy and convenient to access. The ABC is responding to the significant transition to greater personalised digital experiences with an evolving range of offerings across its platforms and products, enabling audiences to discover and access the most relevant content to watch, listen to, or read. Technological initiatives have included: single sign-on so audiences can access content on any device based on the ABC's understanding of them; bringing rich personalisation and product features to the ABC iview, listen and triple j experiences; and expanding digital emergency broadcasting. The ABC is also using audience and social data/analytics and investing in machine learning-based tools to learn more about audience preferences and offer more targeted services, including news alerts and analysis, and content recommendations. In May 2020, the ABC released a major update for ABC iview users on Apple TV, Android TV and Smart TVs providing them with a more synchronised and personalised experience. By logging in, users can watch ABC content from where they left off on their device - particularly useful for Australian families going through COVID-19 together to jump back into a program. This is the first time the ABC has introduced login on its big screen experience, laying the foundations for further rich personalisation features.Digital news To meet digital update needs, ABC News established the Audio Hub by pairing network radio producers and presenters with the NewsRadio team, allowing News to triple the number of on-demand in-brief news bulletins available for smart speaker devices. It also improved the quality and consistency of the national radio news bulletins, which are regularly the number one on-demand item on the ABC listen app. In late 2019 an on-demand video desk was created within the ABC NEWS channel team, to create more dynamic stories with creative graphics. The channel also reimagined programs like One Plus One to provide greater on-demand appeal, and worked with the ABC iview team to create a more thoughtfully curated news experience. The ABC NEWS website and app continued to develop during the year. The look and feel of both were refreshed, and the quality of the content on offer continued to improve with the assistance of sophisticated storytelling training rolled out to digital journalists across the ABC. Local stories on-demand Audio on-demand local bulletins were launched in six regional areas - Gippsland, North Queensland, South West WA, Great Southern, South East SA, and Riverina. The bulletins were distributed on the ABC listen app as well as through smart speakers, and the initiative is now set to be rolled out across all ABC regional bureaux.Evolving the digital audience experience 38 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020The volume of local digital news articles increased over the period, with local news a particular area of focus in regional areas where commercial options are declining. This resulted in significant increases in the number of articles published each week across the local bureaux - over the first six weeks of the strategy's implementation, the number of articles from local teams published to ABC News more than doubled on the 2019 average. 30 Digital natives In March 2020, the ABC launched an improved ABC Kids video app for preschool and younger school-aged viewers, timed to coincide with the launch of Series 2 of Bluey (with five bonus episodes on ABC iview). Along with recommendations and automatic play, the new app included features such as parental filters, parental timers for app usage, and the ability to watch content on the 'big screen'. Transitionary content was added for onward journeys to ABC ME. ABC Kids listen was also redesigned to align with the ABC Kids suite, and further development of the ABC ME video app, for primary-school-aged children, is continuing based on audience feedback and analytics. Play School's special for the National Simultaneous Storytime initiative premiered across multiple platforms - broadcast, ABC iview and Facebook - simultaneously. For kids and adults alike, ABC Education's digital interactive 'Spotting misinformation and disinformation ' made in collaboration with RMIT ABC FactCheck helped explain more about how to identify misinformation. A new version of the 'fake news' interactive 'Real, LOLZ, oops or fake?' proved popular again with audiences.Social Continuing to create bespoke social content showed sustained success throughout the period. Content-led experiments grew audiences and developed new creative talent on social platforms. Notable milestones and content innovations over the period included: ABC Indigenous once again experiencing exponential growth on Instagram with a 228% increase in audience, and 285% increase in engagement the ABC's TV+iview Facebook account exceeding 1 million followers triple j reaching 1.38 million YouTube subscribers, and triple j's Splendour In The Grass 2019 festival video of Tones & I clocking 81 million views around the world on YouTube Old People's Home for 4 Year Olds bespoke commissioned content attracting 4 million+ views and 1 million+ engagements #CONTENTtvshow, the vertical digital-first comedy program on all four major social platforms providing a world first for scripted comedy ABC Science's How Deadly series for YouTube featuring Ann Jones giving the popular reaction-style video format a specialist public service twist Cuppa with Kumi featuring Kumi Taguchi hosting a live and interactive show from the ABC TV+iview Instagram throughout the COVID-19 pandemic ABC Science's YouTube channel reaching more than 100,000 subscribers. 30 Story stats 2019, 2020.

It includes series such as English on the Go and Everyday English , and three quarters of Learn English's followers are aged between 18 and 34. This year, the ABC launched the free international streaming service ABC Australia iview, opening up more of its content to audiences around the world. The app for iOS and Android devices connects the ABC's global community with distinctive Australian stories, content and conversations from across genres, including entertainment, factual content, arts and educational programs. ABC Australia iview offers the ABC NEWS channel as a stream, which enabled audiences across the globe to access the channel via an app for the first time.\"From its earliest days the ABC has looked outwardly to report on the world around us and to advance Australia on the global stage. The Corporation has a proud record of achievement, telling Australian stories, reporting fairly and fearlessly and promoting Australian culture. We are the nation's trusted international voice, connecting the world with Australia.\" Ita Buttrose AC OBE, ABC Chair 40 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020On 31 December 2019, millions of Australians tuned in to the ABC's New Year's Eve coverage to show their support for those devastated by the summer bushfires. ABC messaging before and on the night of broadcast was centred around welcoming the new decade with great Australian music as we raised money to help people rebuild their lives. The ABC's New Year's Eve joint appeal with the Australian Red Cross and the City of Sydney ran from 26 December to 4 January, and raised more than $13 million 31 for disaster relief to bushfire- affected communities across the country. Funds raised through the joint appeal supported the Red Cross in providing recovery programs, practical support and emergency grants for those who lost homes in the 2019-20 bushfires. ABC TV hosts Zan Rowe and Charlie Pickering drove the call for donations while hosting the ABC's Party of the Decades concert, live from the Sydney Opera House. The concert starred some of Australia's top performers of the past and present, including singer-songwriter Marlon Williams, the Cruel Sea's Tex Perkins, Augie March's Glenn Richards and Russell 'The Real Thing' Morris. Leading into the main event, the ABC's New Year's Eve House Party - hosted by Susie Youssef and Nazeem Hussain and simulcast on ABC ME - featured games, dancing and music by artists such as Baker Boy, Shonen Knife and Regurgitator, as the countdown to the 9pm Family Fireworks began.The ABC's New Year's Eve coverage reached an audience of 3.6 million across metropolitan and regional markets and was the No. 1 network on the night, with a prime-time metropolitan share of 25.2% 32 - the best result recorded for the ABC since it began broadcasting the event in 2013. The coverage was live streamed 209,000 times on ABC iview - up 132% on the previous year 33 - as well as directly to ABC TV and iview's Facebook, YouTube and Twitter accounts. Coverage was also shared to 33 ABC and partner accounts, including the ABC's regional and capital city Facebook pages, enabling people around the country to share in the celebrations. The official hashtag #NYEABC trended No. 1 on Twitter during the night. As the clocked ticked over to midnight, ABC crews positioned around Sydney Harbour beamed the iconic fireworks to viewers in Australia and around the world, followed by a moving rendition of Auld Lang Syne . 31 https://about.abc.net.au/press-releases/abc-and-red-cross-bushfire-appeal-raises-13-3-million/ 32 OzTAM and Regional TAM consolidated 28 data, OzTAM VPM.33 OzTAM and Regional TAM consolidated 28 data; reach includes encore viewing.New Year's Eve 2019-20 Regurgitator playing Song Formerly Known As! to a bunch of random little people on ABC Kids might just be my highlight of 2019 #NYEABC - Paul Cochrane, Facebook NYE hosts Nazeem Hussain and Susie Youssef with band Regurgitator. Image: ABC Children's Content, services & communities 41The ABC works to produce content that explores and connects with diverse communities. Throughout the 2019-20 reporting period, the ABC attempted to establish a more inclusive workforce, and to encourage the production of stories that better reflected diverse Australian lives. The 'We Are Australian' campaign supported this reflection, bringing together Australians from across the country in a nation-wide choir - singing with each other though many were isolated at home. 34% of participants were culturally and linguistically diverse, and both a kids' and an AUSLAN version were created. Modern Indigenous stories Multi award-winning filmmaker and Arrernte/Kalkadoon woman Rachel Perkins' The End of Silence Boyer lectures examined how the Uluru Statement from the Heart provides a path to ending the \"great Australian silence\" on the rightful place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in this nation. Gulkula is a traditional ceremonial meeting ground of the Yolngu people of the North East Arnhem Land and was the site of Australia's largest Indigenous-led, Indigenous-programmed cultural exchange, the Garma Festival, in August 2019. The ABC was proud as the official media partner of Garma to again broadcast live from the festival ensuring conversations and celebrations travelled beyond the sacred Yolngu site. Live coverage including a broadcast of The Drum featuring a panel of high profile Indigenous leaders and change-makers, plus on-the-ground reports throughout the four-day gathering from local news teams and specialist digital reporters. In 2020 Play School welcomed Kiya to the program's 'family'. Kiya is the first Indigenous toy to belong to a specific area - in Kiya's case, Noongar Country in south-west Western Australia. Play School presenters Luke and Rachael also discussed racism on iview program 'Hand in Hand' - its causes, effects and what we can do to be a part of positive change - as an age-appropriate response to the Black Lives Matter protests around the globe. City communities Australians living in outer metropolitan areas of the capital cities - which are the most diverse places in the country - are less likely to use ABC services than those in inner cities or rural areas. 34 In response to the clear need for more reporting relevant to those communities, ABC News set its strategic course for the coming three years at a staff summit in Bankstown, New South Wales in September 2019. The key focus was to become a part of, and more substantially reflect, more of these communities. Progress was and continues to be made around ABC stories giving greater voice to the lives of Australians living in these areas. For more on this, see 'Stories from the outer city' page 26. In drama, The Heights Series 1 was awarded the Screen Producers Australia SDIN Award 2019 for excellence in and impact on diversity and inclusion. The program explores the relationships between the residents of inner-city neighbourhood Arcadia Heights and the rapidly gentrifying community that surrounds it, and the first two series were recently acquired by the BBC for broadcast in the UK. The final season of ABC ME children's program Mustangs FC continued to reflect the rich cultural heritage of Melbourne, with characters representing communities from Sudan, Vietnam, Serbia, Lebanon, Dutch, Indian, Ghanaian and Indigenous Australia, all exploring their hopes and dreams as young Australians set against the backdrop of their shared religion - football.Reflecting contemporary Australia 34 Nielsen CMV S02 & S05 National, Ppl 14+. 42 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Takeover Melbourne , an ABC initiative in partnership with Victorian state government agencies, local government authorities and the Centre for Multicultural Youth, was created to provide a platform to share the stories of Melbourne's young people aged 12 to 18. Takeover builds on the success of Heywire , which has been providing opportunities for young people in rural and regional Australia to tell their stories and develop ideas for change for more than 20 years. Storytelling entries to the project closed in June 2020. ABC producers will work with winners in 2020-21 to professionally produce their story for broadcast on ABC radio, television or online. 50:50 News stories greatly increased representation of women, with the 18-month old 50:50 project driving inclusion of women's voices and a commitment to content that is relevant to women. Approximately 45% of the talent chosen to appear in stories over the period were women, with the ultimate goal of 50% not far from achievement. Podcast Ladies We Need To Talk continued to provide a distinctive health, sex and relationships podcast made by and for women, which discussed topics that have been traditionally taboo. \"There's good reason the ABC podcast Ladies, We Need to Talk is now in its fourth series.

The show followed a unique social experiment that set out to see if the health and wellbeing of very young and older Australians would be improved through the simple idea of spending quality time together in an aged care facility. The voices of the participants took centre stage, generating crucial conversations about the way in which we treat elderly Australians. The complementary Ageless Friendships digital series had almost 12 million views across ABC social media. Via a partnership with Playgroup Australia's 'Ageless Play', almost 5000 enquiries were received from individuals, families, aged care facilities, retirement villages and early learning centres interested in either joining or starting a new intergenerational playgroup. The number of such groups more than doubled since the program aired, from 40 to almost 100 new groups. 35 35 Playgroup Australia. Old People's Home for 4 Year Olds , Episode 1.

The ABC's original format, award-winning question-and-answer program You Can't Ask That won the AACTA inaugural award for Factual Entertainment in 2019. In accepting the award on behalf of the ABC, participant Vickie Roach - Yuin woman, of the stolen generations, and a domestic violence survivor - noted that people with lived experience like her deserved the right to be seen on Australian screens, but most importantly they deserve to be heard.

The project encouraged Australians to participate in open discussions about the issues that mattered to them most. Working in conjunction with Vox Pop Labs and an academic panel, the ABC conducted the Australia Talks National Survey, which collected the views of more than 54,000 Australians from every part of the country. The survey consisted of approximately 490 questions, and gathered information about Australians' experiences, opinions and feelings on a range of topics and issues. From the data, an online tool was developed, which could be accessed by all audiences. After answering a selection of survey questions, each respondent received a personalised snapshot of how they fit in modern Australia: abc.net.au/australiatalks . The tool was made available in four languages - English, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese and Arabic. Across six weeks, the ABC brought the survey data to life in its content, with major findings and themes driving the national conversation across ABC TV, radio and online. The project included innovative content initiatives, including reporting embeds in suburban corridors, and held in-person events to discuss the key issues uncovered by the survey in dozens of locations across the country.The initiative received record-breaking audience engagement: 438,000 people completed the online tool. 15 million page views were recorded across digital articles. 898,000 people tuned into the live TV event program. More than 30% of Australians indicated they had engaged with Australia Talks in some way (via an independent audience survey).

In addition to this, the ABC Principles set clear expectations about working at the ABC as individuals, as leaders and together across teams. The ABC Principles are: We are ABC Straight Talking People Focused Accountable Open and Transparent In early 2020, as a continued commitment to creating and supporting a positive culture, reflection on the ABC Principles was integrated into performance planning and appraisal processes for all employees. This ongoing reinforcement of the Principles ensures they will continue to contribute to the ABC being a great place to work. The embedding of ABC values and standards of workplace behaviour over the reporting period was supported through an expansion of the training programs available via the ABC's online learning and development system as well as induction. Regular employee and leader communication and the sharing of information within and across teams was encouraged, and regular Leadership Team metropolitan and regional visits were undertaken to improve leadership visibility. Throughout the year, ABC employees examined opportunities to operate as efficiently as possible, while taking responsibility to deliver results for the ABC and its audiences.Employee engagement The ABC's most recent Employee Engagement survey was completed in late 2019 and provided employees with an opportunity to provide feedback to the ABC on a wide variety of matters. The survey assessed overall engagement, providing management with significant insight into successful working strategies and also information on challenges and opportunities for improvement. More than 3,000 staff completed the survey. The ABC's employee engagement score for the year was 69%, compared with the Australian benchmark of 70%. In 2019-20 the ABC launched its internal People Hub system, a staff service centre that included Onboarding, Learning and Performance & Goals modules. The system simplifies and automates people processes, while enhancing the learning and performance experiences of both employees and managers. Another year on from the content teams restructure, ABC People & Culture engaged with a cross-divisional team to co-design ways of working aimed at improving clarity in roles and decision-making. The ABC Mentoring program attracted more than 200 applications in total over 2019-20, for mentors and mentees. Increased need for remote learning throughout the pandemic saw expanded content for leaders and teams, while the creation of a Wellness Hub also supported the physical and mental wellbeing and development of ABC staff.ABC People Inside the ABC 63Further expansion of learning was a strong focus in 2019-20 and the organisation saw an increase in learning options and strong participation levels across all areas.

For information on the impact of COVID-19 on training at the ABC, see page 87. Targeted training Technological change The Learning and Development team continued to work closely with project teams across the organisation to plan for change and support ABC staff through those transitions. The most significant technological change in 2019-20 was the introduction of a new online performance management tool, which replaced the existing paper-based process. The successful implementation of this change required that a significant number of employees be upskilled quickly and effectively. To ensure that this was successful, a multi-modal approach was utilised, using a combination of face-to-face, virtual and online learning to ensure that staff had the skills and knowledge required to effectively transition to this new platform, as well as the on-the-job support they needed to embed those skills. Editorial standards Training in relation to editorial standards remains a critical component of learning and development at the ABC. Editorial training starts with an introductory online course and is supplemented with targeted face-to-face and virtual sessions that build on those introductory concepts. The sessions enable staff to explore how editorial standards apply to specific circumstances and contexts at the ABC. In 2019-20 there were 892 completions of the online introductory module, representing 661 hours of training. A further 851 completions were recorded for the supplementary face-to-face/virtual sessions, representing an additional 1352 hours of training. Focus areas for 2019-20 included editorial standards in relation to reporting on key current affairs subjects such as hate speech and climate science. Bullying, harassment and discrimination Bullying, harassment and discrimination continued to be important focus areas for learning in 2019-20, with 2057 learning hours delivered in relation to these important topics across the period. A total of 1,594 completions of learning related to bullying, harassment and discrimination were recorded over the year. In 2019-20 the existing online introductory course, which is compulsory for all new employees, was reviewed and updated to ensure it remained aligned with best practice and current legislative requirements. Capability, development and training 64 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Additional online content was developed and rolled out to further enhance employees' skills and knowledge in relation to specific at-risk groups, such as people with disabilities and Indigenous Australians. Attendant to the online content were a number of face-to-face/virtual sessions which were delivered to employees covering topics such as cultural awareness, prevention of bullying and harassment, and LGBTQI awareness. Leadership The ABC's two flagship leadership development courses, Activate Your Leadership and Accelerate Your Leadership, were strongly subscribed across 2019-20, with 89 leaders attending these courses throughout the year. Senior leadership was a key focus, with a successful leadership conference organised during the year providing an invaluable opportunity for senior leaders to come together to build networks and collaborate on critical strategic planning activities. Across 2019-20 leaders were also provided with access to bespoke learning workshops designed to equip them with critical skills in areas such as staff development, resilience, collaboration and inclusiveness.In 2019-20 the ABC looked to expand the reach of its leadership development to include not just people leaders, but also knowledge leaders (subject matter experts), piloting a new program designed to enhance the effectiveness of these subject matter experts and ensure that this critical group were effective and engaged. Learning support - extreme events Using learning to support and enhance ABC employees' ability to manage work and personal issues has always been an important focus, however the extreme bushfire events and emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic during early 2020 required a response beyond the usual offering. During this time additional learning and support materials relating to mental health, coping with anxiety, resilience and working from home were quickly developed and/or sourced and rolled out to all employees. The materials were made available via online and virtual delivery to ensure they were easily accessible to staff regardless of their location, and continued related communications ensured employees were consistently aware of support availability.

Inside the ABC 65The ABC considers diversity a strategic priority. As the national broadcaster, the ABC has a responsibility to reach all Australians, and its key aim is to reflect the rich diversity and perspectives of Australia's many communities, from Indigenous Australians through to new and emerging communities. In line with the ABC's Charter, the Corporation strives to provide broadcasting programs that contribute to a sense of national identity and reflect the cultural diversity of the Australian community. Diversity & Inclusion Plan The ABC is required by the Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Act 1987 (the EEO Act) to develop a program designed to eliminate discrimination and promote equal opportunity for women, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people from a non-English speaking background, and people with disabilities. The Diversity & Inclusion Plan 2019-22 provides a strategic roadmap to guide the ABC in developing an inclusive culture throughout the Corporation. The plan sets out the ABC's vision for diversity and inclusion and is centred around three goals: recruiting, developing, and retaining a diverse workforce fostering an inclusive, collaborative, and accountable workplace culture reflecting and representing the diversity of the Australian community in the content and the services the ABC provides. The ABC has set itself the following workforce targets under the plan, which it aims to reach by September 2022: 1. 15% Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) executives6. 3.6% Indigenous employeesDiversity & Inclusion Standing Committee (DISC) The Diversity and Inclusion Standing Committee (DISC) supports and makes recommendations on diversity and inclusion matters to the ABC Leadership Team. Members of the DISC are senior representatives of ABC divisions (who lead their divisions in implementing the plan), the Chair-people of the ABC's Employee Network Groups and the Chair of the Bonner Committee. The meetings are co-chaired by two members of the Leadership Team. The work of the DISC highlights the importance of diversity and inclusion as a strategic priority for the ABC and helps to prioritise diversity at the highest level of the Corporation. The DISC ensures a coordinated ABC-wide approach to improving diversity and inclusion outcomes. The DISC also inputs into the development of the Diversity & Inclusion Plan, shares best practice, and identifies solutions where needed. Media cadetships The Media Cadetship program launched in 2018 was aimed at under-represented groups in the media industry and was designed to help talent overcome traditional barriers to entering the industry. A successful program was held in 2018-19 which saw cadets contribute to ABC content making through a range of activities including writing articles, recording interviews, and assisting with TV recordings.Diversity 66 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020The program was reviewed as a part of a comprehensive review into the ABC's entry level programs in 2019-20, and is proposed to be relaunched in 2020-21. Indigenous employment The Elevate Reconciliation Action Plan 2019-2022 (RAP) strengthens the ABC's commitment to Indigenous content across its platforms, and continues to support employment and business opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander individuals and organisations in order to build closer relationships with Indigenous communities. The RAP includes specific actions relating directly to Indigenous employment. These include: ensuring all ABC divisions develop an action plan for reaching Indigenous employment and other RAP targets ensuring the proportion of Indigenous staff is at least as high as the proportion of the Australian Indigenous population; the ABC's Indigenous employment target for 2022 is 3.6% increasing the number of Indigenous employees in content making, editorial and management decision making roles at senior levels encouraging awareness of potential careers at the ABC and in the wider media sector among secondary and tertiary students career development planning and support opportunities for Indigenous employees maximising the retention of Indigenous employees contributing to the growth of Indigenous employment in the wider media industry increasing opportunities for Indigenous suppliers to work with the ABC. Apart from its employment objectives, the RAP also includes a new commitment to embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages, voices, and names within the ABC's programs, so this may become a part of the vocabulary of the nation.The Bonner Committee is the ABC's primary advisory body on issues relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff, content, and communities. It is also responsible for monitoring progress against the RAP. Its members are a mix of Indigenous and non-Indigenous staff drawn from around the country. The Chair reports to the Managing Director on matters arising from the Committee's work. Gender profile In 2019-20, the ABC sustained a gender balanced workforce and leadership teams. 53.3% of ABC employees were women as at 30 June 2020, compared with 52.9% as at 30 June 2019. In executive roles, 50.7% were occupied by women as at 30 June 2020 compared with 48.9% as at 30 June 2019. Key elements of the ABC's gender equality strategy as contained in the Diversity and Inclusion Plan 2019-22 are as follows: The ABC is committed to 20% representation of women in technologist roles and 50% representation of women in executive roles. The ABC is committed to the development and progression of women and men in under-represented roles. The ABC is committed to identifying and addressing any gender pay equity gaps and has committed to carry out regular gender pay equity analysis. The regular assessment of gender pay information will allow us to identify any pay gaps and implement strategies to address them. The ABC embraced International Women's Day in March 2020 by showcasing female broadcasters leading up to and throughout the day. Highlights included an all-female line-up across capital city Local Radio, ABC Classic and RN, as well as 24 hours of songs, stories, and discussions from female artists and presenters on triple j, Double J and triple j Unearthed . Inside the ABC 67Other diversity initiatives The ABC's Employee Network Groups were established in 2019-20 and now meet regularly. A suite of diversity training packages were created and promoted across the organisation. These packages included: cultural awareness training disability awareness training LGBTQI+ awareness training.

The remainder are represented by Health and Safety Representatives or other agreed arrangements. Work-related WHS incidents In 2019-20, a total of 185 work-related incidents were reported (179 in 2018-19). Four incidents were notified to Comcare by the ABC. An incident is notifiable to Comcare if it results in death, medical treatment as an inpatient in a hospital, immediate treatment for a serious injury, infection with a prescribed illness, or if it involves a dangerous occurrence. The ABC must ensure notification is made to Comcare, and the ABC Board, immediately after becoming aware that a notifiable incident has occurred.

During 2019-20 there were no investigations conducted by Comcare as a result of any Comcare-notified incidents. Workers compensation claims Of the 185 work-related incidents reported in 2019-20, eight resulted in workers' compensation claims being accepted by Comcare (compared with 18 in 2018-19). Analysis of the accepted claims in 2019-20 shows injuries/conditions were primarily due to mental stress, followed by physical injuries from falls or body stressing in the workplace or in the course of work.Workers compensation premiums The ABC's workers' compensation premium for 2019-20 was $2,376,564 (ex GST). Comcare have provided the ABC with an indicative premium calculation for the 2020-21 year of $2,705,273. The overall Commonwealth premium rate for all Commonwealth Agencies decreased from 1.06% to 0.85 % in 2019-20. The ABC's indicative prescribed premium rate for 2020-21 is .57% (up from .53% in 2019-20). The slight increase reflects the costs of claims across the scheme and higher than expected ABC claims costs for the 2018-19 year.

Employees appointed to international bureaux are provided with a dedicated clinician for the duration of their appointment, and in 2019-20 the ABC continued to offer professional assistance and counselling services through redundancy and career transition specialists Trevor-Roberts. Enforceable Undertaking The ABC entered into an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) with the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) in June 2020 in connection with underpayments to some ABC employees. The underpayments resulted from the practice in some areas of the ABC of paying casual employees flat rates of pay designed to be high enough to compensate for penalty rates and overtime provided for by the Enterprise Agreement. In some cases the flat rates were insufficient to do this and resulted in people being paid less than they were entitled to. The ABC took immediate steps to rectify the error and improve its systems to ensure future compliance. The ABC has also apologised to impacted current and former employees. In total, 1,907 ABC employees were underpaid $12,029,038. The ABC has paid affected employees 5.25% interest on back-payments, superannuation, and 5.25% interest on superannuation. As part of the EU, the ABC has committed to a number of measures to ensure future compliance with Commonwealth workplace relations laws, including: provisioning an independent audit to identify past and current impacted staff, with the audit methodology subject to independent review ongoing monthly engagement with the FWO regarding the progress of the audit rectification of all underpayments to past and current employees, and the provision of reimbursement of costs associated with seeking independent financial advice for employees owed $15,000 and above implementation of an electronic record keeping system to accurately record rosters and actual time worked for all staff ensuring that all future offers of employment will include an anticipated classification level, schedule, band, pay point, and an hourly rate or salary range, as applicable provision of training to responsible individuals regarding the rights and responsibilities of employers under relevant Commonwealth workplace laws and instruments provisioning annual audits conducted by an independent expert to confirm ongoing compliance with Commonwealth workplace laws. Inside the ABC 71ABC Editorial Policies The ABC Editorial Policies and associated guidance outline the principles and set the standards that govern ABC content. They are a day-to-day reference point for content makers and are critical to the ABC's ability to meet its statutory obligations and the expectations of audiences. They provide the basis for the ABC Code of Practice, which the ABC provides to the industry regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). In addition, the Editorial Policies give practical shape to statutory obligations in the ABC Act, in particular the obligations to provide services of a high standard; maintain independence and integrity; and ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is accurate and impartial according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. Editorial management and guidance No changes were made to the Editorial Policies or the Code of Practice in 2019-20. However, there were several new and updated guidance notes, which follow below: New guidance notes Reporting and portraying disability in ABC content https://edpols.abc.net.au/guidance/reporting-and-portraying-disability-in-abc-content/ (issued 3 July 2019) Hate speech, terrorism & mass killings https://edpols.abc.net.au/guidance/hate-speech- terrorism-mass-killings/ (issued 26 November 2019) Dealing with trauma and survivors of trauma https://edpols.abc.net.au/guidance/dealing- with-trauma-and-survivors-of-trauma/ (issued 4 June 2020)Updated guidance notes External work and editorial conflicts https://edpols.abc.net.au/guidance/external-work-and-editorial-conflicts/ (revised 12 February 2020 - minor change to the section on consistency and record keeping re: timeliness and pre-approval) Differentiating between factual reporting, analysis and opinion https://edpols.abc.net.au/guidance/differentiating-between-factual-reporting-analysis-and-opinion/ (revised 19 February 2020 - addition of an analysis vs opinion checklist) Credits https://edpols.abc.net.au/guidance/credits/ (revised 30 April 2020 - extensive revision including podcasts, acknowledgment of country) Accessibility https://edpols.abc.net.au/guidance/ accessibility/ (revised 22 June 2020 - adding in audio description changes) Editorial reviews The ABC consistently reviews its own performance against the editorial standards. Content makers and program teams regularly review their own work, and the ABC also commissions reviews that are independent of content makers and carried out by a range of internal and external reviewers. The 2019-20 reviews and ABC responses to those reviews are published on the ABC's corporate website: http://about.abc.net.au/howthe-abc- is-run/what-guides-us/abc-editorialstandards/editorial-reviews/ .Editorial Quality 72 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Corrections and clarifications The ABC publishes a Corrections and Clarifications page on its corporate website which lists corrections and clarifications made to ABC content across radio, television and digital platforms, whether as a result of complaints or for any other reason: https://www.abc.net.au/news/corrections/ In 2019-20, 51 corrections or clarifications were published on the Corrections and Clarifications page on the ABC's website (46 in 2018-19). Where online transcripts existed, editor's notes and corrections to copy were also published. Election Coverage Review The Election Coverage Review Committee (ECRC) is convened during each federal, state or territory election campaign to monitor ABC coverage and ensure ABC editorial standards are met. The Committee is chaired by the Editorial Director or a senior editorial policy advisor and comprises representatives from all relevant ABC divisions. It is principally a committee of review and does not supplant the usual lines of editorial authority in each division during an election campaign. For federal elections, the ECRC reviews externally commissioned share of voice data to ensure appropriate editorial balance is maintained and no single political party is disproportionately represented. This is done while recognising that there are a range of factors which can and will affect the amount of time or share of voice of each party.For state and territory elections, the ECRC monitors content, internal records and feedback to ensure editorial balance. Audience complaints related to election coverage are reviewed by the Committee and the Chair of the ECRC is also responsible for administering the free broadcast time allocated to eligible political parties. Broadcast slots are provided on television and radio for policy announcements by political parties who meet the eligibility criteria. The ECRC did not convene in 2019-20. Inside the ABC 73Project update 2019-20 Ultimo Cladding and Fire Safety Project The removal and replacement of combustible cladding in the ABC's Ultimo site, with associated Fire Engineered Solutions, is on schedule for completion in August 2020. Over the year, the project: completed the atrium cladding and roofing replacement utilising scaffolding, hoarding and tower crane installation, all while ensuring that the content and broadcast operations at Ultimo remained 100% operational for the full duration of works replaced 100% of non-compliant cladding and insulation throughout all elevations of Building B via cantilevered swing stages and scaffold installations constructed a dedicated fit-out to operate as a project swing space as necessary to relocate approximately 600m 2 of occupied co-located teams, avoiding abortive and inefficient offsite costs.National Security Project The National Security Project will deliver an integrated security solution to protect the ABC's people and assets. It will establish the ABC's security requirements, including access control and CCTV across all ABC sites, and found a national standard and Master Specification for security installations in ABC locations. The project is staged to deliver improvements across all sites progressively over the next two financial years. Security upgrades are underway and detailed designs are complete for two major capital city sites. Backbone infrastructure is complete and ready for the connection of sites as they are brought online. Procurement of all security devices for metropolitan sites is complete.Infrastructure 74 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Audiences In order to communicate the strength and value of the ABC's offering to all Australians, ABC Audiences' brand and marketing activities in 2019-20 worked towards dual objectives: to increase awareness and engagement with lighter audiences and deepen the relationship with core ABC audiences by moving them across platforms, ultimately building sustainable audiences for the ABC. Strategies employed to achieve this included: offering a more personalised digital experience, in line with audience expectations, with new ways to discover and consume content prioritising the most relevant, distinctive and diverse Australian stories; stories that contribute to a sense of national identity continuing to play a valuable role in Australian society by providing news, information and education in a trusted space building community connections across locations and interests. The largest wholesale project for Audiences during 2019-20 was the formation and co-sponsorship of the personalised audience experience (PAX) project, aimed at better surfacing content of interest and relevance to audiences. Strategy In 2019-20, Strategy coordinated the development of the ABC Five-Year Plan 2020-2025, conducting extensive analysis of the ABC's operating environment, audience trends, and future scenarios. The team also assisted the content divisions with the development of their strategic plans, while ensuring alignment with other divisions' planning and the overarching Five-Year Plan as it developed. Content Ideas Lab (CIL) set up a Content Innovation team, whose main focus was to pilot new content formats, distribution methods and ways of working. The work aimed to answer key questions about the future to ensure organisational preparedness, and surface learnings that could be passed on to the rest of the Corporation.The CIL team developed an approach to commissioning content innovation ideas that ensured pilots had an alignment to strategy, audience research and trends, and that they involved collaboration with teams across the ABC. Legal Services In 2019-20, ABC Legal provided quality legal services to the whole of the Corporation through the dedicated work of its specialist teams, including through: 24/7 prepublication advice to content makers across the ABC on programs, podcasts and investigations, together with the delivery of legal training to over 3000 content makers handling 100 legal complaints, defending defamation claims and managing litigation, including the aftermath of the Australian Federal Police raids and challenging suppression order applications making and contributing to submissions on law reform matters including appearing at hearings and inquiries (see Appendix 10 on page 200 for a list of submissions) regulatory advice work on privacy, freedom of information, public interest disclosure, the ABC Act and the PGPA Act contracting finance, production and rights agreements for 124 productions negotiating technology contracts and the acquisition of hardware, software and support services advising on construction matters and property management and maintenance contracts assisting ABC Commercial with content licensing, book and magazine publishing, and music recording, licensing and publishing agreements undertaking copyright clearances, rights assessments for re-use and supply, and the coordination of repeat fees and residuals for myriad programs and services.Corporate services Inside the ABC 7576 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020ABC Head of International Strategy David Hua (second from right) on the panel at the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU) General Assembly in December 2019.Responsibility Contents Corporate responsibility 78 Environmental responsibility 82 Social responsibility 86Responsibility 77The ABC is committed to corporate responsibility and aims to deliver content with integrity, diligence and transparency, and to act in the interests of citizens. Delivering products and services that satisfy the needs and expectations of audiences, and that meet the ABC's editorial standards, is the essence of the ABC's existence. The ABC is committed to fulfilling its corporate objectives across all business and media activities in a manner that is ethically and financially responsible, and in particular pursues environmentally and socially responsible business practices. The values of integrity, respect, collegiality and innovation are the foundation of the ABC's activities. Reporting performance The ABC reports its corporate responsibility and sustainability performance each financial year in the Annual Report, with additional information available in the Diversity & Inclusion Report, and then throughout the year on the Corporate Responsibility webpage at http://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/ whatguides-us/corporate-responsibility/ . Other than references to the ABC's international activities, the Annual Report is limited to domestic operations within the direct control of the ABC. Sustainability information about the ABC's investments in MediaHub Australia Pty Limited, Freeview Australia Limited and National DAB Licence Company Limited is not included in the report. Any additional limitations to the scope or completeness of particular data are identified within the reported data. Stakeholder inclusiveness The ABC provides varied opportunities for its audiences and other stakeholders to provide input into the content and activities of the Corporation. In 2019-20, mechanisms for engaging with external stakeholders included: the ABC Corporate Tracking Program the ABC Quality & Distinctiveness Study (via YourABC) formal audience contacts and complaints processes - see page 101 ABC Advisory Council processes see pages 94-98 online feedback mechanisms specific to ABC content areas the ABC's social media properties. Protecting freedom of expression Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognises freedom of expression as a fundamental human right. Freedom of expression is enshrined in the ABC Editorial Policies. The ABC's commitment to impartiality and diversity of perspectives reflects the importance of diverse sources of reliable information and a plurality of views within a healthy democracy. In pursuing impartiality, the ABC is guided by the following: a balance that follows the weight of evidence fair treatment open-mindedness opportunities over time for principal relevant perspectives on matters of contention to be expressed. The ABC seeks to balance the public interest in disclosure of information and freedom of expression with respect for privacy.Corporate responsibility 78 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Press freedom The ABC remained an active and passionate participant in law reform initiatives throughout 2019-20, including as an active member of the Right to Know Coalition, and by way of submissions given to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's (PJCIS) inquiry into the impact of the exercise of law enforcement and intelligence powers on the freedom of the press, and the Senate's inquiry into press freedom, conducted by the Environment and Communications References Committee. The importance of the ABC's involvement with those inquiries was highlighted by the decision of the Federal Court in February 2020 following formal proceedings brought by the ABC against the AFP arising from the latter's raid on ABC premises in 2019. The Court's decision expressly confirmed that those issuing search warrants in Australia are not required to consider the importance of public interest journalism or the protection of confidential sources. In a disturbing development, the AFP have now referred a brief of evidence concerning journalist Dan Oakes to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The ABC notes the PJCIS's explicit recognition of the value and importance of public interest journalism to this country. The report endorses a scheme that would require public interest journalism and the protection of confidential sources to be considered as relevant factors before a warrant is issued, and supports greater transparency by way of reporting from intelligence agencies and law enforcement. The ABC will continue the fight for a better standard of media protection for journalists and their sources in line with international best practice. Accessibility of content and services The ABC's purpose is to serve all Australians through media services that reflect the cultural diversity of Australia. Diversity is front of mind in the ABC's decision-making when working to create and sustain products, systems and services that are accessible for all Australians. Through investment in digital platforms and the continuation of broadcast radio and television, the ABC make its content accessible, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, social background or disability. Across the ABC's digital platforms - including mobile broadcasting, regional delivery and integrated online channels - ongoing evaluation and testing of technologies continues to expand distribution and ensure everyone can easily access ABC content no matter where they live. Further, an internal accessibility expert advises and trains ABC staff on accessibility values and skills, across print as well as all visual and audio mediums, so that content in any form can by enjoyed by all Australians. Audio descriptions (AD) were launched across ABC TV in late June 2020, with an AD programs weekly schedule added to the EPG on audiences' televisions. Appreciation from social media included: \"I was pleased to watch Bran Nue Dae, in an Australian accent\" \"I told all my friends about AD\"And from feedback sessions with Blind Citizens Australia: \"Thank you for the kids programming - it allows them to be a part of the social conversation.\" \"AD includes us in the culture of our society.\" Responsibility 79In 2019-20, captioning functionality was added to programs housed online such as Catalyst , Compass and short-form science content, and video content produced for the Media Literacy website had subtitles and closed captioning added. ABC Health on Instagram prioritised accessibility by using alternative text on all images, choosing high-contrast colours for images and ensuring hashtags were screen-reader friendly.

The ABC's Editorial Policy framework sets out guidelines to protect vulnerable audiences such as children. Advice and training in the ABC Editorial Policies is delivered on an ongoing basis (see page 64. Upward referral - a key concept within the policies - ensures complex decisions are not made in isolation. All television programs other than news, current affairs and sporting events, are classified and scheduled for broadcast in accordance with the ABC's Associated Standard on Television Program Classification. The ABC ensures that graphic or distressing news content is preceded by a warning, to give readers, listeners or viewers the opportunity to avoid the content if they choose. triple j has strategies in place to ensure its younger audiences are protected from harm. Editorial content which is likely to cause harm or offence to younger sections of the audience is scheduled in appropriate time periods such as later in the evening. Warnings are given before playing music containing language or content that is assessed as likely to offend the triple j audience and prior to other types of content which risk causing harm to vulnerable audiences. Content created especially for children and available on ABC iview or apps is accompanied by classification advice and warnings where appropriate. As with broadcast, children's content on digital properties is restricted to G and PG. Classification has progressively exhibited heightened sensibilities with respect to editorial concerns in children's programming, which has led to a significant increase in the number of episodes being referred for review. There is far greater oversight of children's programming in terms of the content's compliance with non-classification matters, such as ABC Editorial Policies.Both the ABC KIDS iview and ABC ME apps, along with the main iview service, include a parental filter so parents can control their children's viewing boundaries. The ABC's websites and apps for children follow strict protocols to minimise risk to children and protect their privacy. The ABC believes online protection of children and young people under the age of 18 is a shared responsibility between the ABC, the parent or guardian, and the child, and aims to ensure that children and young people who engage with the ABC's online spaces understand the possible risks they face and how to minimise them.

The nature of ABC business, and in particular its reliance on technology, necessarily involves high levels of energy consumption. This is reflected in energy use figures for New South Wales where there is a significant concentration of the ABC's workforce and production. Even during the pandemic, many ABC workers were still in office locations, keeping broadcast operations running. Energy reduction initiatives in 2019-20 included: All new lighting installations and replacements were carried out using LED energy efficient bulbs, including major halogen-to-LED replacement projects at Southbank (Victoria) in the Iwaki Auditorium - saving 34kW of heating - and more than 40 edit suites and radio studios, and halogen flood lighting being replaced with an LED lighting system in the Hobart site. All ABC staff were encouraged to turn off computers, printers, lights, and non-essential equipment at the end of the shift, especially over holiday periods. All new air conditioner replacements are programmed with operational running times to match building occupancy times. Building Management Systems were regularly reviewed and updated to ensure alignment with operational requirements.

Notes: The waste disposal data that informs this report is sourced from billing information of the ABC's waste contractors for the capital cities only. This method is identical to that used to report for the 2018-19 financial year. In 2019-20, personal under-desk bins in Adelaide, Canberra, Darwin, Perth and all New South Wales regional sites were removed, and Eco Bin Stations were introduced to the workplace. The stations consist of three bins - red for general waste, yellow for recycling and green for organic matter - all with compostable bin liners and colour coded instructional posters. Benefits have included cleaners spending less time removing waste and relining personal bins, less money spent on liners, and more waste being recycled. Centralised waste separation streams were also introduced to offices in Tasmania, and in Hobart, chickens were introduced to the site to consume organic waste. In Victoria, the Southbank water fountain has thus far diverted 8,055 plastic bottles from landfill, and Bendigo bathroom and kitchen renovations included installation of water efficient tapware and cisterns. In Wodonga, the grounds reinstatement included drought tolerant Indigenous plantings and a bathroom renovation included installation of water efficient taps and cisterns.

Responsibility 83Environmental sustainability in the supply chain Travel and transport In 2020, reducing or even cancelling travel to or for work, as a result of COVID-19 response restrictions, became a reality for a large portion of ABC staff. However, the nature of the ABC's operations, in particular its news and current affairs activities, usually necessitates frequent domestic and international travel. As with other years, the ABC continued to encourage employees with to reduce domestic travel as much as possible. Employees are encouraged to consider alternatives to travel where appropriate, for instance utilising video conferencing. Usage of this medium of correspondence has of course soared during the pandemic, in particular during lockdown periods in capital cities. Staff are also urged to use sustainable travel methods to get to and from work when they come to the office, such as walking, cycling or taking public transport. End-of-trip facilities for employees including secure bike parking, showers and lockers are provided at most capital city and some regional sites, and information about public transport is provided for staff on the ABC intranet. When it comes to domestic travel, the ABC views every vehicle replacement as an opportunity to improve the fleet's environmental profile by considering if there is a need to replace the vehicle or whether there is a hybrid alternative that meets operational requirements. Travel by air There was a 27.4% decrease in kilometres flown by ABC employees in 2019-20, compared to the previous year, due largely to travel restrictions imposed in Australia during the first half of 2020. Air travel 2019-20 Category 2019-20 2018-19 Difference Domestic kms -27.4% Domestic fleet travel The number of domestic fleet kilometres travelled in 2019-20 decreased 2% on the distance travelled in 2018-19. Of the 298 vehicles in the ABC Fleet (decreased from 311 in 2018-19) 264 were leased and 34 were owned. Twenty-two were hybrid vehicles, which equates to 7.4% of the total fleet.

The EPBC Act sets out the ABC's responsibilities to protect and conserve the Commonwealth Heritage values of places that it owns or controls. The Strategy is intended to inform the Minister and the Australian Heritage Council of the identification, assessment and monitoring of those places. The ABC's 2018-2021 Strategy is available online . Water In 2019-20, The ABC's water consumption was reduced overall by 27% on the previous period.

The Adelaide air cooled chiller was also out of service for a large proportion of the year. During this time, the water-cooled units were used, which raised the use of water at the Collinswood building. Darwin experienced two significant water leaks during period: in the gardens and under the main building. Responsibility 85Times of emergency The ABC provides intensive, widespread emergency broadcasting services for Australians in times of crisis. There is not doubt that 2019-20 brought major upheaval in the form of domestic natural disasters as well as global upheaval in the form of the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout an unprecedented 2019-20 bushfire season, the ABC undertook emergency broadcasting for more than 900 events, compared to 371 in the previous year. Details can be found on pages 28-29. Content impact The ABC's content-making teams make a difference for their audiences through the impact of the content they create and in the communities they engage with, work with and portray. Delivering effective environmental, cultural and social change is part of what drives ABC content makers. Details of the ways in which ABC content reached and influenced diverse Australian communities in 2019-20 can be found in the chapter 'Content, services & community' on page 16. Social responsibility in the community Community service announcements The ABC's Local Radio services broadcast community service announcements (CSAs) to provide information to assist local communities. In 2019-20, CSAs were developed in consultation with emergency agencies across the country to broadcast during the bushfires in 2019-20. With the advent of the pandemic Local Radio services broadcast CSAs providing information on the National COVID-19 Older Person Support Line, which is aimed at older Australians who may not have access the latest COVID-19 information via online sources. Over the year, the ABC also created emergency CSAs and health messaging in a range of Indigenous languages.Humanitarian appeals The ABC works with Australian and international aid agencies during crises and humanitarian aid appeals when it is appropriate and possible to do so, highlighting the work of these agencies as they attempt to provide shelter, food, education, healthcare and other forms of relief. The ABC Appeals website at http://www.abc.net.au/appeals/ provides information about current crises and suggests appropriate agencies to which audiences can donate. In 2019-20 the ABC supported domestic and international organisations in their efforts to provide Bushfire Recovery Relief and COVID-19 Relief. Connecting with communities The ABC connects with communities of Australians through a wide range of its broadcasting and services, as well as via regional projects facilitated by ABC Community Engagement. These programs are aimed at bringing the ABC to life, and in 2019-20, the team's focus was to reach younger Australians, their families and their wider communities in a way that was both meaningful and beneficial. Examples of these projects in 2019-20 included: Remote Media Literacy Project In 2019, ABC Community Engagement received grant funding from the Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism and Ideas to support the expansion of its regional schools project into a specialised media literacy education program for remote schools. A suite of materials was delivered in classrooms as a series of workshops over six months, and to date the project has trained 11 ABC journalists in a range of skills including classroom delivery, core media literacy concepts, engagement tools and effective evaluation techniques. The program identified issues relevant to each regional locality to inform the content of the workshops, and the sessions were well received by students, educators and local communities.Social responsibility 86 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020 Regional Schools Program The Regional Schools Program is a network of 552 primary and secondary schools around Australia in regional, rural and remote areas. Each school has a direct and established relationship with ABC Community Engagement and schools were chosen with a view to maximising geographical reach and representing diversity across inner/outer regional and remote/very remote areas. In 2019, engagement focused on pairing regional offices with primary and secondary schools in their area. International development (ABCID) ABC International Development (ABCID) uses the ABC's strengths to improve citizens' access to media content and services in the Indo-Pacific region. Throughout 2019-20, the ABCID team continued to provide expertise, training, technical and program support to assist partner organisations in the region in pursuing quality journalism and storytelling, and building strong connections with their communities. Local, regional and international development donors supported the Corporation's regional presence and engagement. In 2020, COVID-19 posed a challenge for all training and support activities, which were adapted to be delivered remotely from March onwards. ABCID projects in 2019-20 included: Media Development Initiative The MDI project supports Papua New Guinean media to promote greater diversity of citizen voices and increase accountability of decision-makers. MDI activities in 2019-20 included training in talkback radio, supporting national press clubs, encouraging journalism research through background briefings and the development of drama formats for initiating discussions on local issues. The project focussed on assisting media responses to COVID-19 from April 2020 onwards, including producing public service announcements, and comic strips promoting social distancing and handwashing. Pacific Media Assistance Scheme (PACMAS) The PACMAS program aims to facilitate greater discourse across government, business and civil society on key issues affecting development, economic growth, and security in the Pacific. PACMAS capacity development activities include training of trainers for economic and business reporting, and mentoring and training journalists to cover regional events. In 2019-20, PACMAS trained 190 media professionals - with more than 200 pieces of mentored content published in the Pacific - and provided support and guidance for media professionals to ensure safe journalism practices while reporting on COVID-19 across the region. Women in News and Sports (WINS) The WINS program aims to address the under-representation of women in sports media in the Indo-Pacific, with an overall goal of increasing opportunities for women in sports journalism. In 2019-20, the ABC continued to contribute its expertise in sports broadcasting to help train and mentor women journalists in the region, opening up opportunities for them to cover major regional sporting events. For more details on the way in which ABC staff interact with and represent communities, see Local connections at page 24. Responsibility 87International relations The ABC contributes to a number of international bodies that foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing between public-service media organisations. During the period, the ABC's Managing Director David Anderson became an inaugural member of the Global Task Force (GTF) for public media, a group of eight leaders of major public media services from around the world formed to defend the values and the interests of Public Media. The ABC also continued to participate in the Public Media Alliance (PMA), the largest global association of public media organisations, holding a seat on the PMA Board, participating in the 2019 Public Broadcasters International (PBI) conference in Helsinki, Finland and providing a representative on the PBI Steering Committee. The ABC's Head International Strategy David Hua spoke at the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union's (ABU) General Assembly in December 2019, and was separately appointed Chair of the ABU Radio Committee. David also met with other members of the DG7 - a group of public broadcasters from democratic countries with an international broadcasting function.Social responsibility in the supply chain Each year the ABC engages with suppliers to procure goods and services to meet its obligations under the ABC Charter. Through this spend the ABC has an opportunity to facilitate and promote social and sustainable outcomes. While traditionally the ABC's focus has been on environmental opportunities within its supply chain, this focus is now expanding to address a much wider range of social and sustainability issues like diversity, labour practices and human rights. In 2019-20 the ABC published a Social and Sustainable Procurement Strategy, guided by the ISO 20400:2017 Sustainable Procurement Guidance , which is driving its multi-faceted approach to social responsibility within its supply chain. This has included the development of an ABC Supplier Code of Conduct which can be found at the Doing business with the ABC section of the ABC's website (https://about.abc.net.au/talk-to-the-abc/doing-business-with-the-abc/). By producing this Code, the ABC is demonstrating the values and behaviours it expects to be mirrored by all suppliers within its supply chain. This includes an expectation that the ABC's suppliers will take measures to ensure their supply chains are free from exploitation including modern slavery practices which are major violations of human rights and serious crimes and include trafficking in persons, slavery, slavery-like practices (including forced labour and forced marriage) and the worst forms of child labour. The ABC will publish a Modern Slavery Statement in March 2021 in accordance with the Australian's Governments extended reporting deadline under the Modern Slavery Act 2018 .

Either the ABC Board Chair or the Managing Director, or both, met with the Advisory Council at each Council meeting. ABC Leadership Team members and executives also met with the Council to discuss programming-related matters. Over the year, the Council conducted workshops into ABC Life and ABC iview. Advisory Council members were asked to 'immerse' themselves in the platform content over a 2-3 week period and to canvass sentiment in their communities in order to provide feedback. The Advisory Council also provided feedback on selected news and current affairs program episodes and participated in discussions regarding the ABC Content Plan, the ABC Australia iview app, Australia Talks and strategies by the News, Regional & Local, and Audiences teams to reach more Australians. Council members played a key role in representing and facilitating discussion between the ABC and the community at events including the Heywire Regional Youth Summit and Australia Talks community events. Recommendations In 2019-20, the Advisory Council made a recommendation to the Board in relation to its immersive workshop into the ABC listen app. The Council provided a report to the Board on its immersion on ABC Life. No recommendation was made in relation to ABC Life. ABC listen app The aim of the workshop conducted in February 2019 was to provide the ABC listen team with clear and specific feedback about the value and performance of the app, its curation and content and to provide recommendations on how the service could be improved.Members reported a positive experience of the app. Comments included: \" One of the best kept secrets of the ABC \"; \"A hidden treasure \". Members sought out content that they may not have typically listened to and many found content that they liked, such as live sports coverage through ABC Grandstand, the latest News bulletin and a broad range of podcast material. Members reported that awareness of the app in their communities was low even among regular consumers of ABC content, except for people who listen to podcasts. However, once people had downloaded it, they were pleasantly surprised by the offering and wanted to continue using the app. The Council commended the ABC listen app team on the depth and breadth of audio content available via the app. The Council recommended: greater promotion to increase awareness of the app and the audio content available to all Australians development of the app to make content easier to discover the addition of functionality to allow users to personalise their experience better 'how to' instructions to make users aware of the functions of the app. These recommendations have been taken into account in a number of initiatives put in place by the ABC listen team since the Advisory Council workshop, including: Promotion: The app received extensive promotion as the destination for live radio streaming for content including the Australian Summer cricket seasons, Cricket World Cup and The Ashes, Local Radio Breakfast programming, Anzac Day, and Federal Election and Australia Votes content. Targeted state-based messaging promoted the app as the listening destination for content including State Election campaigns, AFL and NRL coverage. Teams across platforms have been provided with tools and encouraged to cross-promote listen app content. Links and banners have been used to direct audiences to relevant content. Accountability 97Discoverability: The search functionality has been improved to help listeners find programs based on keywords and to find episodes and radio stations. A new 'continue listening' feature has been added that allows users to easily find programs they haven't finished. Personalisation: Recommendations now enable discovery of 'popular' and 'trending' content, and will become increasingly personalised as the ABC extends its personalisation capability. Better 'how to' instructions: A 'set up' function has been added to teach new users how to get the most out of their experience, including a location-based station finder. The team continues to add new content that responds to audience data and insights and informs and entertains. Content has been provided in response to COVID-19, Your Mental Health and Walking Together; stations livestream events such as ABC RN's Big Weekend of Books and national listening events.ABC Life The Advisory Council participated in a workshop with the ABC Life team in June 2019. The aim of the workshop was to provide the ABC Life team with clear and specific feedback about the value and experience of ABC Life. In October 2019, the ABC Life team provided an update to the Council on developments and improvements since the workshop. The Advisory Council noted that the service was still developing, and several initiatives were underway. It did not make a recommendation to the Board. Feedback provided by the Advisory Council was that the content was light, uplifting and positive and appealing to young women. However, the content would need to compete for attention in a crowded market with a difficult to reach target audience. To be distinctive, the content needed strong alignment with the ABC brand as a trusted source free of commercial interests. 98 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020The Board recognises that risk management and internal compliance and control are key elements of effective governance. The ABC's Risk Management and Resilience policies describe the manner in which the ABC: consistently applies processes to recognise and manage risks and disruptions confers responsibility on ABC employees at all levels to identify, manage, review and report on risks relating to the objectives those staff are accountable for delivering. Risk is inherent to the ABC's operations, whether it be related to ongoing disruption in the media and entertainment sectors, shifting audience behaviours in response to new technologies, or responding to the recent challenges associated with COVID-19. The ABC uses a standardised enterprise-wide risk management process for the identification, assessment, monitoring and management of significant risks. Disruption is managed by using the Prevention, Preparedness, Response and Recovery model. The Risk and Resilience function is responsible for the ABC's risk management and resilience process, development of risk management and resilience capability, and providing risk management reports and resilience information to the Leadership Team and the Audit & Risk Committee.In 2019-20, the Audit & Risk Committee reviewed the Corporation's risk profile for the Group and received reports from management on the effectiveness of the Corporation's management of its principal risks. The reported risks considered the ABC's health and safety, audience and reputation, financial, legal and compliance, and technology exposures. Reports were also provided overviewing the resilience actions taken to manage the operational disruption and mitigate the consequences of COVID-19. A review of the Corporation's risk appetite is underway. The Risk Appetite is designed to support and inform Board and Management decision-making in accordance with the recently released Five-Year Plan. For more on the activities of the Audit & Risk Committee, see Appendix 2 on page 177. Insurance The ABC has acquired appropriate insurances from Comcover, including Directors and Officers liability insurance. The premium for Directors and Officers liability insurance was $228,278. The ABC has indemnified each board member for legal costs and liabilities incurred in their capacity as a board member of the ABC under a Deed of Access & Indemnity. Board members were permitted to vote on the Deed pursuant to a declaration by the Minister for Communications under section 15 of the PGPA Act.Risk Accountability 99Group Audit is a key component of the ABC's governance framework. Group Audit reports to the Audit & Risk Committee and contributes to the achievement of the Corporation's goals and objectives by: providing objective assessment and assurance of the design and operation of the ABC's risk management and internal control system, including recommending improvements to management playing a role in developing and maintaining a culture of accountability and integrity, including undertaking investigations in relation to fraud or public interest disclosure allegations being responsive to the Corporation's changing requirements and applying a continuous improvement mindset, including utilising technologies and data to efficiently assess control performance. Group Audit prepares and delivers the ABC's Audit Plan, which is approved by the Audit & Risk Committee. A risk-based audit approach is used to ensure Group Audit focuses its work on the Corporation's key objectives and operational areas. Audits are conducted in a manner that conforms to international auditing standards. In 2019-20, Group Audit completed 24 audit assignments (25 in 2018-19), covering editorial, content delivery, finance, information technology, health and safety, and project management processes. Group Audit uses in-house employees and external providers to deliver. External providers enable access to expertise in specialist areas, supplementing internal resources and experience. Group Audit liaises with the ABC's external auditors the ANAO, and its nominated representative, KPMG. This includes seeking advice on proposed areas of focus, the identification of areas of potential external audit reliance on audits undertaken by Group Audit and ensuring minimal duplication of audit coverage.The ABC is required to comply with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) in the Privacy Act 1988 . The ABC Privacy Policy is published on the Privacy page of the ABC corporate website. The Policy sets out the kind of information the ABC collects, the circumstances in which the ABC may use and disclose such information, how individuals may access their personal information, and how and to whom individuals may complain about a breach of privacy. Data breach notification Data breach notification laws make it mandatory for the ABC to report a data breach that is likely to result in serious harm to any affected individuals. Notification must be made to the affected individuals and the regulator. In 2019-20 the ABC did not experience any data breaches that required notification to the Privacy Commissioner.Audit Privacy 100 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Audience and Consumer Affairs Written complaints that are potentially editorial - about issues such as factual inaccuracy, bias or inappropriate content - are referred to Audience and Consumer Affairs, a unit independent of ABC program areas. Where a written complaint suggests that the ABC may have breached its Editorial Policies or Code of Practice, Audience and Consumer Affairs further assesses the complaint to determine appropriate handling in accordance with the ABC Complaint Handling Procedures. Audience and Consumer Affairs may investigate the complaint and determine whether ABC editorial standards have been met. Where the matters raised are less serious, Audience and Consumer Affairs may refer the complaint for direct handling to the content area responsible. In cases where a complaint is investigated and the ABC's editorial standards have not been met, the complaint will be upheld (either fully or in part). Complaints can also be resolved where prompt action is taken to remedy a matter. Overall complaint handling During 2019-20, Audience and Consumer Affairs assessed and finalised 6,057 written complaints. The unit provided a personal response to 2,422 of these complaints while 2,137 complaints were referred to other areas of the Corporation for direct response. No substantive response was required for 1,498 complaints. Editorial complaint handling Of the 6,057 complaints assessed by Audience and Consumer Affairs, 3,252 were determined to be editorial (raising 3,461 issues). The unit investigated 1,538 editorial complaints (raising 1,743 issues), provided responses to 32 editorial complaints that did not require investigation, referred 1,679 editorial complaints to content areas for direct response, and closed 3 editorial complaints without response.Nature of editorial complaint issues 2019-20 Subject Issues % total Factual inaccuracy 922 26.6% Bias (other than party political)* 819 23.7% Inappropriate content 657 19.0% Party political bias 360 10.4% Lack of balance 293 8.5% Unfair treatment 253 7.3% Other 157 4.5% Total 3461 100.0% * Includes claims of bias in relation to issues such as international coverage, sport and religion. Outcome of investigated complaints During 2019-20, 104 editorial complaint issues were upheld (6% of all investigated issues) in cases where Audience and Consumer Affairs determined that ABC editorial standards had not been met. A further 424 issues were resolved (24.3% of all investigated issues) after the relevant content area took prompt and appropriate action to remedy the cause of the complaint. 239 of these resolved complaints were in relation to one episode of Q&A : https://about.abc.net.au/ complaints/qa-13/ All findings in relation to upheld and resolved complaints are brought to the attention of the senior editorial staff responsible. In 2019-20, actions taken in response to upheld and resolved complaints included written apologies to complainants; on-air corrections; counselling or other action with staff; removal of inappropriate content or correction of material on ABC Online; and reviews of and improvements to procedures. Summaries of upheld and resolved complaints are published on abc.net.au as individual complaints are finalised, providing timely access to complaint decisions. The ABC also publishes a quarterly statistical overview of audience contacts on its website.Editorial complaints management Accountability 101Timeliness Audience and Consumer Affairs seeks to respond to all complaints as quickly as possible, and aims to respond within 30 days of receipt, in accordance with the timeliness standard for complaint handling that is specified in the ABC's Complaint Handling Procedures. Of the 2,422 complaints that Audience and Consumer Affairs responded to directly between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020, 2,081 (85.9%) received responses within 30 days. Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) Members of the public who complain to the ABC about matters covered by the ABC Code of Practice and who are dissatisfied with the ABC's response, or who do not receive a response to their complaint within 60 days, may seek review from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). During 2019-20, the ACMA advised the ABC that it had finalised investigations into 2 such matters (compared to 7 in 2018-19). The ACMA found that an episode of Compass breached standards 6.1 (privacy) and 7.5 (avoid causing undue distress) of the ABC Code of Practice. The ACMA was satisfied with the remedial action taken by the ABC to address the breach.During 2019-20, the ACMA also finalised an own-motion investigation into whether Australian television broadcasters breached content rules in covering the March 2019 Christchurch terrorist attack. The investigation report made no criticism of the ABC and it was clear that, by comparison with some other broadcasters, the approach taken by the ABC was careful and consistently appropriate. The ACMA made no breach findings in relation to any broadcaster. Commonwealth Ombudsman The Ombudsman's office did not notify the ABC of any investigations into the ABC's handling of complaints that it commenced or finalised during the 2019-20 reporting period. 102 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Annual Performance Statements 103Siobhan Heanue in Afghanistan.Annual Performance StatementsReporting period 1 July 2019 - 30 June 2020 Introductory Statement We, the ABC Board, as the accountable authority of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), present the 2019-20 annual performance statements of the ABC, as required under paragraph 39(1)(a) of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (the PGPA Act). In our opinion, these annual performance statements are based on properly maintained records, accurately reflect the performance of the entity, and comply with subsection 39(2) of the PGPA Act. Purpose The ABC's purpose is to fulfil its functions as set out in the ABC Act, particularly the ABC Charter. Pillar 1: Distinctive content for all Australians Audience recognition of the high quality and distinctiveness of ABC programs indicates that the organisation is delivering on its core strategic goals. The trust with which Australians regard the ABC indicates the standard of its content at a time of declining trust in institutions and in media organisations in particular.

Analysis: Target not met. Supporting Australian Music plays an integral part in delivering the ABC's charter obligation of \" Encouraging and Promoting Australian Performing Arts \". Music stations have specific Australian music programming targets to enable this, which were exceeded across all ABC Radio stations in 2019-20. Focus periods specifically promoted Australian music such as Australian Music month in November. In 2019-20, the ABC also achieved its highest ever recorded engagement with triple j's Hottest 100, with 38% of the Australian adult population (6.7 million people) engaging with the countdown. 2019-20 has been a year where we have enhanced distribution of Australian music, with triple j, triple j unearthed and ABC Classic being added to the digital TV Footprint. The ABC plans to address this perception measure in the coming year by increasing the promotional work of these key activities and increasing communication of the ABC's commitment to Australian music.

The ABC has in place an independent complaints handling system which is transparent and responsive to concerns raised by audiences. This is an essential tool to maintaining and build the trust that is necessary for the ABC to fulfil its role as an independent, impartial and valued public broadcaster. During the year the majority of editorial complaint issues that were investigated by Audience and Consumer Affairs were not upheld (69.7%). Upheld cases reflect those where Audience and Consumer Affairs determined that ABC editorial standards had not been met. Resolved cases represent instances where the relevant content areas took prompt and appropriate action to remedy the cause of the complaint. (239 of these resolved complaints were in relation to one episode of Q+A: https://about.abc.net.au/complaints/qa-13/ ). Summaries of all complaint issues finalised as upheld or resolved were published on abc.net.au. In accordance with the ABC's Complaint Handling Procedures, Audience and Consumer Affairs exercised its discretion to refer an additional 1,679 editorial complaints to content teams for direct response. A further 35 editorial complaints that did not require investigation were handled directly by Audience and Consumer Affairs.

An erosion of trust has been experienced across all media organisations in Australia and public broadcasters globally. This trend has impacted the ABC's trust score however the ABC remains the most trusted media source in Australia. High levels of trust were evident through the 2019-20 bushfire season with independent research which showed that the ABC was the most used and trusted broadcast service information source for the Australian community during this period. Specifically, ABC News TV had a trust level of 98%, ABC News online of 97%, ABC TV of 97% and ABC Local Radio of 96%. 88 The ABC will continue its important work in providing information that the Australian public can trust. 88 ABC Bushfire Impact Research 2019/2020; Audiences were asked to respond to the question: \"Please indicate whether you tended to trust or tended not to trust the information that they provided during the bushfire crisis.\" 106 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Measure Measure Source Data Source2019-20 Target2019-20 Result2018-19 Result Overall value 89 90Program 1.1, 2019-20, p77ABC Corporate Tracking Study82% 78% 82% Analysis: Target not met. The decline in perception of value was impacted by a 3% increase in respondents who 'did not know' whether the ABC provides a valuable service to the Australian community. This awareness gap is more present in younger Australians. Perceptions of value will be improved by increasing community awareness of the ABC and the range of platforms and services that we provide. This will be driven by the ABC's recently launched 'Five Year Plan', which prioritises addressing audience gaps. Pillar 3: Reaching and Engaging More People Reach Reach measures the percentage of Australians who have used ABC services in a given timeframe. This indicates the effectiveness of, and engagement with ABC programming.

Strong performance was observed through the bushfire season and COVID-19 Pandemic, where news services grew significantly. The change in audience behaviours in response to COVID-19 also demonstrated strong growth in non-news platforms. The average time spent per user is a measure of the engagement that a user has with the ABC's digital products. The COVID-19 pandemic influenced audience time spent on digital platforms and showed growth in the use of Smart TV applications. 89 The ABC Corporate Tracking Study is an online survey conducted three times during the year requesting information from a nationally representative sample of people aged 18 to 75. As part of this survey, respondents are asked whether they value the ABC and its services to the community. 90 The Overall Value measure is obtained from the Portfolio Budget Statement 2019-20. Upon assessment and revision of the organisation's performance measures, Overall Value was not included in the 2019-20 ABC Corporate Plan.

Net Weekly Reach is a measure of the total proportion of Australian adults who have watched, read or listened to ABC content across an average week. The fragmentation of the media landscape and launch of new global players into the Australian market has resulted in the erosion of broadcast television viewing. This has impacted the ABC's net weekly reach with results showing 66.8% in August 2019 and 67.2% in December 2019.

The remainder of the population has access via VAST. 95 With the extension of digital radio terrestrial services to Canberra, Darwin and Hobart, the result is based on the criterion of 'Degree to which the eight state and territory capital cities have access to ABC digital radio transmissions.' 96 VAST transmission can reach all homes in Australia, so digital coverage is 100%. The appropriate equipment (including a satellite dish) is required to access radio and television services via VAST. 97 See above footnote 8 re: VAST transmission.

BAI Communications Transmission Network (ABC Transmission Contractor): The transmission network performance data is reported by BAI Communications in the period 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020. This is a contracted deliverable and is measured against the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for each service, network, or sub national network. The data is regularly reviewed and authenticated by ABC Transmission Network Services. There are 13 Class E digital radio services that are provided by BAI Communications for the ABC where contract performance is not measured as a target of overall uptime. These services are provided to equalise audience experience across both national and commercial and community broadcasters. 3. Total Network Availability shows the impact of all outages on the overall network: This reflects all faults across the transmission networks regardless of severity or cause or whether subject to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) or not. The vast majority of these faults are services not meeting full specification such as lower transmission power as agreed by the ABC on a case by case basis. 4. Total 'On-Air' Availability: The figures show 'off-air' occurrences where no service was provided due to faults and/or maintenance activity. It is important to note that the majority of maintenance activity is undertaken after midnight to reduce audience impact. Annual Performance Statements 111Pillar 4: Building a great place to work Culture The progress towards building a great place to work and ensuring a creative environment can be gauged by the engagement of the people working within the public broadcaster. As Australia's largest creative employer, improvements in this measure indicate the ABC is becoming a more creative environment which in turn will enable even better content.

Within moderate range (69% compared with Australian benchmark of 70%)The 2018-19 engagement survey was deferred following the departure of the former Managing Director and former Chair in September 2018. Analysis: Target met. The ABC conducted an engagement survey in November 2019. The survey (administered by Qualtrics) used five questions to determine the overall engagement of the workforce. The engagement score was within the Australian benchmark moderate range of 70%. Engagement increased significantly from the employee survey conducted in 2017, which showed a 46% engagement score. In addition, the survey showed that employees are proud to work for the ABC with a 91% favourable response, 11% higher than the comparable Australian benchmark.

Financial Outcome 2019-20 The ABC incurred a deficit for the financial year ending 30 June 2020 due to additional expenses recognised on implementation of AASB 16 Leases , as well as allowance for the provision of redundancies. These redundancies are part of ongoing savings required to address the impact of the Federal Government's indexation pause on the ABC's General Operational Activities base funding, announced in the 2018 Federal Budget.Sources of Funds 2019-20 The ABC was allocated $1,062.3 million in the April 2019 Federal Budget. The financial year 2019-2020 is the first year of the triennium funding period and was therefore the first year impacted by the indexation pause on ABC General Operational Activities. The impact of the indexation pause was a reduction of $14.6 million compared to what the ABC would otherwise have received. An amount of $14.3 million is included within the 2019-20 funding which represents the first year of a three-year continuation of the Enhanced Newsgathering program announced in the Budget. This program was established in 2013. The ongoing annual impact of efficiency savings previously announced in the 2014-15 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook was reduced by $14.4 million in 2019-20 compared to the amount in 2018-19. The ABC also received $58.4 million from other sources, including ABC Commercial, during the year.

Application of Funds The chart 'Split of actual expenses 2019-20' broadly represents how the ABC allocates its funds by cost category. The Year Ahead Revenue from Government 2020-21 is the second year of the current funding triennium, and the second year of the three-year continuation of the Enhanced Newsgathering program. It is also the second year impacted by the three-year pause to indexation of ABC General Operational Activities base funding, announced by Government in the May 2018 Budget as part of the 'Funding for Australian Film and Television Content and the National Broadcasters' measure. This results in a reduction of $27.8 million in 2020-21 with an ongoing reduction to the funding base of $41.3 million per annum in future years beyond 2021-22. Due to the impact of COVID-19 and the Government's response, the Federal Budget 2020-21 was delayed from May until 6 October 2020. The preliminary ABC's funding for the 2020-21 financial year below is based on amounts published in the April 2019 Budget: $m Total revenue from Government per Outcome 11,065.4 Less Transmission and Distribution Services186.6 Total Revenue from Government available for ABC General Activities878.8 The chart 'ABC Revenue from Government by Programme 2020-21' broadly represents the ABC's budgeted appropriation of funds by programme for the 2020-21 financial year. Financial Statements 117Budget Strategy The budget environment faced by the ABC and the broader economy has been dominated by the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic. The Federal Budget has been delayed from its annual early May schedule until 6 October to accommodate the Government's COVID-19 response strategies. At the time of writing the ABC budget has been predicated on funding estimates included in the April 2019 Budget. As outlined above, 2020-21 represents the second year of continued Enhanced Newsgathering funding as well as the second year impacted by the operational funding indexation pause. Whereas the Enhanced Newsgathering facilitates continuation of existing news activity, the funding reduction from the indexation pause comes on top of the ABC/SBS Efficiency Savings measure previously announced in 2014-15 Budget, and places additional pressure on the ABC's budget strategy in 2020-21 and coming years. In framing the 2020-21 Budget, the ABC seeks to position itself to achieve the goals and objectives set out in the ABC Five-Year Plan 2020-2025, released in June 2020. This includes implementation of savings initiatives necessary to operate in the reduced funding environment while reshaping the organisation and focusing resources to the ABC Five-Year Plan's priority initiatives. This includes maintaining essential television and radio services while focusing on increased digital innovation, and delivering on-demand and personalised services, thereby meeting the increasing expectation of audiences to be able to watch, read and listen to the ABC when and where it suits them. The ABC remains committed to prioritising available resources to enable it to most effectively deliver on its Charter obligations and remain relevant to audiences in Australia's cultural and media landscape into the future. 118 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020$1,268 $879$ Millions Years6006507007508008509009501,0001,0501,,1001,1501,2001,2501,3001,350 20/2119/2018/1917/1816/1715/1614/1513/1412/1311/1210/1109/1008/0907/0806/0705/0604/0503/0402/0301/0200/0199/0098/9997/9896/9795/9694/9593/9492/9391/9290/9189/9088/8987/8886/8785/86ABC Operational Revenue from Government including Capital indexed at 2019-20 levels - December 2019, six months CPI Index - 30.7% reduction from 1985-86 to 2020-21.Comparative Revenue from Government The 2020-21 operational revenue from Government of $879 million represents a decrease in real funding of $389 million or 30.7% since 1985-86 as depicted in the chart 'ABC Operational Five-year analysis 2020 Equity (d) 52% 76% 76% 77% 75% (a) Net cost of services is total expenses less total income.

The financial statements of the Entity , which I have audited, comprise the following as at 30 June 2020 and for the year then ended: Statement by the Directors and Chief Financ ial Officer; Statement of Comprehensive Income; Statement of Financial Position; Statement of Changes in Equity; Cash Flow Statement; and Notes to the financial statements , comprising a s ummary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. Basis for o pinion I conducted my audit in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards, which incorporate the Australian Auditing Standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of the Entity in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements for financial statement audits conducted by the Auditor -General and his delegates . These include the relevant independence requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) to the extent that they are not in conflict with the Auditor- General Act 1997 . I have also fulfilled my other responsibilities in accordance with the Code. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. Accountable Authority's responsibility for the f inancial statements As the Accountable A uthority of the Entity , the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Board is responsible under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (the Act) for the preparation and fair presentation of annual financial statements that comply with Australian Accounting Standards - Reduced Disclosure Requirements and the rules made under the Act. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Board is also responsible for such internal control as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Board is responsible for assessing the ability of the Entity to continue as a going concern, taking into account whether the E ntity's operations will cease as a result of an administrative r estructure or for any other reason. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Board is also responsible for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the assessment indicates that it is not appropriate . 120 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Auditor's r esponsibilities for the audit of the f inancial s tatements My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards will always detect a materi al misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also: identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness o f the Entity's internal control; evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Accountable Authority; conclude on the appropriateness of the Accountable Authority's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obt ained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the E ntity's ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor's report. However, future events or cond itions may cause the E ntity to cease to continue as a going concern; and evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. I communicate with the Accountable Authority regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.

(a) Original Budget as reflected in the May 2019 Portfolio Budget Statements for the ABC. Financial Statements 1291. Explanation of Major Variances between Actual Results and Original Budget Explanations are provided for significant variances between actual results and the original budget, as reflected in the May 2019 Portfolio Budget Statements (PBS) of the ABC. Significant variances are typically greater than $20,000,000 though they include variances which are relevant to the performance of the ABC, not merely numerically significant variances between the original budget and the actual amounts. The budget is not audited. The ABC's total comprehensive loss for the financial year to June 2020 was $18,361,000. This result was $7,231,000 unfavourable against the budgeted total comprehensive loss of $11,130,000. The primary factor which contributed to this total variance was the net negative impact of the property portfolio revaluation ($9,967,000). The original budget did not incorporate this factor in due to the inherent uncertainty of the outcome of the revaluation process. The valuation was conducted by expert valuers and is accounted for in accordance with AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement and AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment . The result also includes the impact of the introduction of leases under new accounting standard AASB 16 Leases which was introduced on 1 July 2019. This is discussed in further detail in Note 1B below. Finally, the ABC commenced a significant restructuring process in June 2020 which accounts for the remainder of the deficit, discussed in further detail in Notes 1C and 1L below. A. Timing of original budget The original budget was prepared prior to the completion and approval of the ABC's internal budget by the ABC Board. Differences between the original budget and the ABC's internal budget allocations may result in amounts being reflected in different line items between the original budget and the actual results at 30 June 2020.B. Implementation of new accounting standard New accounting standard AASB 16 Leases was effective for the financial year to June 2020 and has had a material impact on a number of balances within the Statement of Comprehensive Income, Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Cash Flows. AASB 16 effectively removes the classification of operating lease and requires lessees to recognise a lease liability and a corresponding \"right-of-use\" asset for all leases, with some limited exceptions. The ABC leases the following categories of assets that fall under the definition of AASB 16: A Satellite transponder for digital television distribution. Decoder boxes and dishes for satellite downlink services. Transmission facility assets for digital terrestrial television transmission. Transmission facility assets for terrestrial radio transmission. Properties around Australia and overseas leased from various vendors, including Leasehold property leases which the ABC has pre-paid. Vehicles. Leasehold land, previously classified under (ABC owned) Property, plant and equipment. This change took a substantial portion of transmission and distribution costs that previously were recognised as supplier expenses and created a number of right-of-use assets and associated finance lease liabilities that are now recognised in the Statement of Financial Position. (Refer to Notes 1D, 1E, 1I and 1K for further commentary). The net impact on the Statement of Comprehensive Income due to the adoption of AASB 16 is negative $2.9m.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2020 130 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020In line with Department of Finance guidelines, the 2020 budget did not incorporate the effect of this standard. C. Employee benefits Employee benefits expenses are higher than the original budget primarily due to the recognition of a provision for restructuring costs of $31,700,452. Refer to Note 10A Employee provisions for further commentary. D. Suppliers Supplier expenses are lower than the original budget primarily due to the impact of AASB 16 Leases in the financial statements. Significant expenses related to transmission and distribution contracts, as well as property and vehicle lease expenses were previously recorded in this category. These lease payments are now substituted by depreciation on ABC right-of-use assets and interest costs on the associated lease liabilities (refer to Notes 1B and 1E). Supplier expenses are also lower than the original budget due to the implementation of savings initiatives. These savings in suppliers have been quarantined to offset against the cost of restructuring (refer to Notes 1C and 1L). E. Depreciation on ABC right-of-use assets This is a new category on the Statement of Comprehensive Income, recognised as a result of the implementation of AASB 16 Leases . A depreciation charge is now recognised on all right-of-use assets recognised in the Statement of Financial Position (refer to Notes 1B and 1I). F. Other investments The balance of Other investments is higher than the original budget as there was a net cash inflow during the year on the ABC's operational result. Delays driven by COVID-19 reduced the cash outflow on both capital projects and program productions. This was combined with lower operational cash outflow via reduced activity, most particularly in reduced travel activity. There was also a net cash inflow in relation to the Ultimo cladding project, as significant reimbursement from Comcover for project costs was received.G. ABC-owned land The balance of ABC-owned land was higher than budget due to a full independent assessment of the ABC's property portfolio performed in June 2020. Refer to Note 6A ABC owned land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles - Recognition and measurement for further commentary. H. ABC-owned buildings (including improvements) The balance of ABC-owned buildings was lower than budget due to the revaluation process noted above in Note 1G. The ABC received advice that our building assets should be revalued downwards in accordance with expert assessment and market comparison. I. ABC right-of-use assets - Land, buildings (including improvements) and plant and equipment These asset categories were created as a result of the implementation of AASB 16 Leases . They were recognised in the Statement of Financial Position from 1 July 2019 and are now depreciated over the term of the lease (refer to Notes 1B and 1E). A corresponding lease payable liability has also been raised in the Statement of Financial Position (refer to Note 1K). J. Suppliers The balance of Suppliers payable is higher than the original budget as there was a higher volume of capital project activity in June 2020 compared to the same time in the prior year, upon which the budget was based. This was driven by a number of projects accelerated in June as COVID-19 restrictions were relaxed across many jurisdictions. K. Lease liability This liability category was created as a result of the implementation of AASB 16 Leases . It was recognised in the Statement of Financial Position from 1 July 2019 and is reduced as payments are made to suppliers. It largely offsets the right-of-use assets created (refer to Notes 1B and 1I). Financial Statements 131Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20201. Explanation of Major Variances between Actual Results and Original Budget (continued) L. Employee provisions The balance of Employee provisions was higher than budget, primarily due to the recognition of a provision for restructuring costs (refer to Note 1C). The variance has also been impacted by the actual opening balance on 1 July 2019 being higher than the budgeted opening balance. This was due to the recognition of an additional provision related to estimated historical entitlements owed to casual employees which was not factored into the budget. M. Cash Flow Statement Movements in the Cash Flow Statement including higher than budgeted Net cash from operating activities, higher than budgeted Net cash used in investing activities and higher than budgeted Net cash used in financing activities are largely reflective of the explanations provided in Notes 1B, 1D and 1K. In addition, the Cash Flow Statement shows the gross amounts related to the purchase and proceeds of investments separately under investment activities whilst the original budget shows a net figure against Purchase of investments. As noted at Note 1F, a net cash inflow has been experienced due to delays driven by COVID-19 on both capital projects and program productions. The ABC expects a larger cash outflow in 2021 financial year, in particular due to the restructuring costs referenced in Note 1L being paid. 132 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 20202. Overview The Corporation is a Corporate Commonwealth, not-for-profit entity. Its functions are set out in section 6 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 . Those functions are reflected in the statement of purpose in the ABC Corporate Plan 2019-20, which was prepared in accordance with section 35 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act). The Corporation sets out to achieve one outcome: inform, educate and entertain audiences throughout Australia and overseas through innovative and comprehensive media and related services. The continued existence of the Corporation in its present form and with its present programs is dependent on Government policy and on continued funding by Parliament. Accounting Framework The principal accounting policies adopted in preparing the financial statements of the Corporation are stated to assist in a general understanding of these financial statements. Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements The financial statements are general purpose financial statements as required by section 42 of the PGPA Act. The financial statements and notes have been prepared in accordance with; PGPA (Financial Reporting) Rule 2015 (FRR); and Australian Accounting Standards - Reduced Disclosure Requirements issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that apply for the reporting period. The Corporation's financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis and in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for certain assets and liabilities which are at fair value. Except where stated, no allowance is made for the effect of changing prices on the results or the financial position.The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars and values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars unless otherwise specified. Significant Accounting Judgements In the process of applying the accounting policies listed throughout the financial statements and accompanying notes except as noted, the Corporation has taken the fair value of freehold land to be the market value of similar locations and the fair value of freehold buildings to be the depreciated replacement cost, as determined by an independent valuer. In addition, the Corporation has taken the fair value of plant, equipment and intangibles to be the depreciated cost which is representative of depreciated replacement cost. Significant Accounting Estimates and Assumptions The Corporation has applied estimates and assumptions to the following: Depreciation, as detailed in Note 3C Depreciation and amortisation , and Note 6A ABC owned land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles ; Program amortisation, as detailed in Note 3E Program amortisation , and Note 6D Inventories ; Impairment of financial instruments, as detailed in Note 3H Impairment loss on financial instruments ; Impairment of non-financial assets, as detailed in Note 3I Write-down and impairment of other assets ; Valuation of land, buildings, plant and equipment, as detailed in Note 6A ABC owned land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles ; Leased assets and lease liabilities, specifically identification of lease assets and lease liabilities where the ABC has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits, as detailed in Note 6B Right-of use assets ; Financial Statements 133Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20202. Overview (continued) Provision for make good and Provision for building maintenance (cladding), as detailed in Note 9 Other Provisions ; and Employee provisions detailed in Note 10 Employee Provisions . No other accounting assumptions or estimates have been identified that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. New Accounting Standards The following standards were applied from 1 July 2019. AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers /AASB 2016-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Australian Implementation Guidance for Not-for-Profit Entities and AASB 1058 Income of Not-For- Profit Entities. The ABC has adopted AASB 15 with a date of initial application of 1 July 2019. AASB 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much, and when revenue is recognised. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including AASB 118 Revenue , AASB 111 Construction Contracts and Interpretation 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes . The core principle of AASB 15 is that an entity recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. AASB 1058 is relevant in circumstances where AASB 15 does not apply. AASB 1058 replaces most of the not-for-profit (NFP) provisions of AASB 1004 Contributions and applies to transactions where the consideration to acquire an asset is significantly less than fair value principally to enable the entity to further its objectives, and where volunteer services are received. The details of the changes in accounting policies, transitional provisions and adjustments are disclosed below and in the relevant notes to the financial statements. The ABC adopted AASB 15 and AASB 1058 using the modified retrospective approach, under which the cumulative effect of initial application is recognised in retained earnings at 1 July 2019 and the comparative information presented for 2019 is not restated. The ABC's adoption of AASB 15 and AASB 1058 had no cumulative effect on prior year earnings, therefore no adjustment was made to retained earnings at 1 July 2019. Under the new income recognition model the ABC assessed potential income to determine whether an enforceable agreement exists and whether the promises to transfer goods or services to the customer are 'sufficiently specific'. Where an enforceable agreement exists and the promises are 'sufficiently specific' (to a transaction or part of a transaction), the ABC applied the general AASB 15 principles to determine the appropriate revenue recognition. If these criteria were not met, the ABC considered whether AASB 1058 applies. Under AASB 1058, the ABC is required to recognise volunteer services at fair value if those services would have been purchased if not provided voluntarily, and the fair value of those services can be measured reliably. The ABC did not receive any material services of this nature in financial year 2019-20. In relation to AASB 15, the ABC elected to apply the new standard to all new and uncompleted contracts from the date of initial application. Under AASB 1058, the ABC recognises Revenue from Government based on when control of the funds passes to the Corporation or when the Corporation has an enforceable right to receive funds. Based on the ABC's assessment, there were no differences between the amounts prepared under AASB 15 and AASB 1058 and the amounts that would have been presented had AASB 15 and AASB 1058 not been adopted. 134 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020AASB 16 Leases AASB 16 became effective on 1 July 2019. This new standard has replaced AASB 117 Leases, Interpretation 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease , Interpretation 115 Operating Leases\u2014Incentives and Interpretation 127 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease . AASB 16 provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring the recognition of assets and liabilities for all leases, together with options to exclude leases where the lease term is 12 months or less, or where the underlying asset is of low value. AASB 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting in AASB 117, with the distinction between operating leases and finance leases being retained. The details of the changes in accounting policies, transitional provisions and adjustments are disclosed below and in the relevant notes to the financial statements. Application of AASB 16 Leases The Corporation has adopted AASB 16 using the modified retrospective approach, under which the cumulative effect of initial application is recognised in retained earnings at 1 July 2019. Accordingly, any comparative information presented for 2019 is not restated, that is, it is presented as previously reported under AASB 117 and related interpretations. AASB 16 provides for certain optional practical expedients, including those related to the initial adoption of the standard. The Corporation applied the following practical expedients when applying AASB 16 to leases previously classified as operating leases under AASB 117: Apply a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics; Exclude initial direct costs from the measurement of right-of-use assets at the date of initial application for leases where the right-of-use asset was determined as if AASB 16 had been applied since the commencement date; Reliance on previous assessments on whether leases are onerous as opposed to preparing an impairment review under AASB 136 Impairment of assets as at the date of initial application; and Applied the exemption not to recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases with less than 12 months of lease term remaining as of the date of initial application. As a lessee, the Corporation previously classified leases as operating or finance leases based on its assessment of whether the lease transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. Under AASB 16, the Corporation recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases. However, the Corporation has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for some leases of low value assets based on the value of the underlying asset when new or for short-term leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. On adoption of AASB 16, the Corporation recognised right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in relation to leases of office space and vehicles, which had previously been classified as operating leases. Additionally, the Corporation assessed certain costs, previously considered service charges, against the relevant criteria contained in the standard, to determine whether right-of-use leases existed within these costs. In particular, the Corporation assessed various contracts against the \"substantially all of the economic benefits from use\" test as per paragraphs B21 - B23 of the standard. This was pertinent to contracts previously considered to be service charges, especially those costs associated with using the assets of service providers to distribute and transmit ABC radio and television services. The major premise of this test was whether the ABC shared transmission and distribution assets with other broadcasters or users to the extent that the ABC receives less than substantially all the economic benefits of the asset. Financial Statements 135Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20202. Overview (continued) Application of AASB 16 Leases (continued) Prior to the adoption of AASB 16, the majority of the ABC's leases assets as identified above, were previously recognised as service costs which were expensed on a straight-line basis over the period of service provision. The lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the Corporation's incremental borrowing rate as at 1 July 2019. The Corporation's incremental borrowing rate is the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent creditor under comparable terms and conditions. The weighted-average rate applied was 1.11%. The right-of-use assets were measured as follows: Office space: measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments; Leasehold Land: The ABC has four leasehold land properties, the two material ones being the Brisbane and Canberra offices. These were measured at book value as at 1 July 2019, in line with the Public Governance and Accountability (Financial Reporting) Rule 2015 : All other leases: the carrying value that would have resulted from AASB 16 being applied from the commencement date of the leases. The Corporation's transmission right-of-use assets are subject to long lease terms, with some contractual elements expiring in 2044. The length of the lease terms and the resultant contractual liability has contributed to a large liability and right-of-use asset in the ABC's Statement of Financial Position. Upon transition, the right-of-use assets were measured at the carrying value of the lease liability. The following table reconciles the Corporation's minimum lease commitments disclosed in the entity's 30 June 2019 annual financial statements to the amount of lease liabilities recognised on 1 July 2019: $'000 Minimum operating lease commitment at 30 June 20196,688 Less short-term leases not recognised under AASB 16(3,091) Plus right of use asset leases previously recognised as service contracts 735,622 Undiscounted lease payments 739,219 Less: effect of discounting using the incremental borrowing rate as at the date of initial application(47,060) Lease liabilities recognised at 1 July 2019692,159 Income Tax The Corporation is not subject to income tax pursuant to section 71 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 . Two of the Corporation's controlled entities, Music Choice Australia Pty Ltd and The News Channel Pty Limited, while subject to income tax, have been inactive up to and including 30 June 2020. The Corporation's interests in MediaHub Australia Pty Limited, Freeview Australia Limited and National DAB Licence Company Limited are subject to income tax. ABC AustraliaPlus (Shanghai) Cultural Development Co. Ltd, incorporated in the People's Republic of China, is not subject to Australian income tax. Any income tax benefit or expense, asset or liability, presented in the financial statements and accompanying notes, is attributable to joint operations. Any income tax benefit or expense is recorded as Income tax benefit/(expense) attributable to joint operations in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. A tax asset is recorded in the Statement of Financial Position in Tax assets. 136 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Goods and Services Tax (GST) Revenues, gains, expenses and losses are recognised net of the amount of GST except where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). In these circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the revenue or expense. Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amount of GST receivable from the ATO is included as a financial asset in the Statement of Financial Position while any net amount of GST payable to the ATO is included as a liability in the Statement of Financial Position in Other payables . Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) The Corporation is subject to Australian FBT. Events after Reporting Period The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented uncertainty, in particular the continued lack of market transactions which are ordinarily a strong source of evidence for determining the fair value of business assets. Actual economic events and conditions in future may be materially different from those estimated by the Corporation at the reporting date. In the event that COVID-19 impacts are more severe or prolonged than anticipated, the business of the Corporation including but not limited to the valuation of properties may be adversely impacted. At the date of issuing the financial statements, an estimate of the future impact of COVID-19 on the Corporation's business including but not limited to property assets cannot be made as this will depend on the magnitude and duration of the economic downturn, where the full range of possible effects are currently unknown.

In 2020, KPMG earned additional fees of $3,674 (2019 $5,500) for services that were separately contracted by the Corporation. 138 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Recognition and measurement Employee benefits Refer to Note 10 Employee Provisions . Suppliers - Income tax benefit/(expense) attributable to joint operations The classification of tax benefit/(expense) attributable to joint operations was reviewed and a reclassification was made to comparative disclosures to enhance presentation. Income tax benefit/(expense) attributable to joint operations of $73,000 (2019 ($28,000)) which was previously classified as Suppliers expense is now classified as Income tax benefit/(expense) attributable to joint operations . Operating leases Operating lease payments are expensed on a straight-line basis which is representative of the pattern of benefits derived from the leased assets. Operating lease payments apply to assets exempted from the provisions of AASB 16 Leases and include: Assets where the lessor has substantive substitution rights over the asset being leased; Assets where the contractual lease term does not exceed 12 months; Assets which do not confer substantially all of the economic benefits and risks to the Corporation; and Low value assets.Depreciation on ABC owned assets Depreciable property, plant and equipment assets are depreciated to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the improvements or the unexpired period of the lease. Depreciation rates are initially based on their useful lives, reviewed each year and adjusted as appropriate. Depreciation rates applying to each class of depreciable asset are referenced in Note 6A ABC owned land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles . Amortisation of ABC owned intangibles Intangibles comprise software for internal use. These assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Software is initially recognised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over anticipated useful lives between 3-8 years (2019 3-8 years). The amortised cost is considered to approximate fair value. These assets are assessed annually for potential impairment.

The Corporation's right-of-use assets, as identified under AASB 16 Leases, is depreciated evenly over the remaining contractual period. Amortisation of purchased programs Purchased program inventory is amortised in accordance with the policy for amortisation of produced programs. Subsequent sales of residual rights are recognised in the period in which they occur. 140 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Amortisation of produced programs The cost of produced television program inventory is amortised as follows: News, Current Affairs, Live Programs, Factual and Entertainment programs based on current topics - 100% on first screening; Childrens, Education and Movies - straight line over three years from completion of production; iview-only programs - 100% on first release; and Programs not covered above - 100% on first screening. In addition to the above, programs that are assessed as no longer having any service potential are 100% expensed at the time of the assessment. The costs of programs produced for Radio and ABC International are expensed as incurred. Such programs are normally broadcast soon after production, stock on hand at any time being minimal. Refer to Note 6D Inventories regarding inventory valuation. Finance costs All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred. Interest costs on the liability attributable to right-of-use assets Interest is calculated on the monthly outstanding balance of the lease liability (refer Note 8B Lease liability ). Assumptions surrounding uncertainty - Interest costs on the liability attributable to right-of-use assets The valuation of the lease liability is influenced by the discount rate, as advised, on a quarterly basis, by the Commonwealth Department of Finance. The carrying balance of this item is reviewed regularly and an assessment is made of the potential impact of a change in discount rates on this balance. The corresponding interest charged on the outstanding balance is a function of the incremental borrowing cost derived from the discount rate.Given the large balance as per Note 8B Lease liability , the ABC's financial performance is sensitive to movements in the incremental borrowing rate. Impairment loss on financial instruments Under AASB 9 Financial Instruments , impairment of financial assets is provided for on the basis of future expected credit losses (ECLs) rather than as and when existing debts are deemed to be impaired. It also allows for the expectation of credit losses to be adjusted in response to certain factors, for example prevailing or anticipated market conditions. Write-down and impairment of other assets Where indications of impairment exist, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment adjustment is made if the asset's recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Where the future economic benefit of an asset is not primarily dependent on the asset's ability to generate future cash flows, and the asset would be replaced if the Corporation were deprived of the asset, its value in use is taken to be its depreciated replacement cost. At 30 June 2020, the Corporation had performed and was continuing to perform assessments to determine the extent of any indications that assets may be impaired and the resultant financial impact has been incorporated in the financial statements.

Therefore, royalty income is recognised at a 'point in time'. Content sales Licence fees from program content are recognised on the latter of the start of the licence period (taking into account any holdback dates) or when the ABC's performance obligations have been satisfied. For content sales the performance obligation will generally be to deliver the associated program to the customer, therefore income is recognised 'episodically' - on delivery of each episode. Joint Operations Revenue attributable to joint operations represents the ABC's 50% share of MediaHub's revenue. This revenue comprises services fees recognised 'over time' as the services (predominantly for broadcast presentation and playout) are provided. Upon implementation of AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers , the classification of revenue disaggregation were reviewed and certain reclassifications were made to comparative disclosures to enhance presentation. Revenue from Joint Operations of $11,219,000 (2019 $11,037,000) which was previously classified as Other Revenue is now classified as Rendering of services .Grants and Services Contracts Revenue for grants and services contracts with specific performance obligations (primarily for international aid and development projects) is recognised 'over time' as services are provided, on an expense reimbursement or on a stage of completion basis. Pursuant to AASB 1058 Income for Not-for-Profit Entities , Grants from Government departments without specific performance obligations are recognised as income in the financial year that they relate to. Co-productions Co-production income is recognised on delivery of the related materials or on a stage of completion basis, depending on the nature of the contract with the customer. Other Contract Revenue Other contract revenue includes items such as commissions and distribution fees which are recognised at the later of when the subsequent sales or usage occurs. Interest Revenue Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest method and if not received at balance date, is reflected in the Statement of Financial Position as a receivable.

Rental income from the lease of ABC owned or controlled premises is recognised as lease income under AASB 16 Leases and disclosed separately to other revenue from customers disclosed under AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Gains or losses on disposal of assets Gains or losses from disposal of assets are recognised when control of the asset has passed to the buyer. Foreign currency transactions The Corporation enters into foreign currency hedging arrangements to protect its purchasing power in relation to foreign currency exposures. Revenues and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies are converted to Australian dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction or at the hedged rate. All gains and losses are taken to surplus/(deficit).

GST payable to the ATO is disclosed separately. Lease terms are typically between 1 to 5 years in duration and income is subject to increases in accordance with CPI or other agreed increment. Operating lease revenue is earned via leasing of spare capacity within the ABC's properties and resources. The ABC leases out spare capacity only on assets it controls. There are no rights-related risks associated with the underlying assets that are being leased. Financial Statements 145Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2020Financial Position Recognition and measurement Acquisition of assets Assets are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition except as stated below. The cost of acquisition includes the fair value of assets transferred in exchange and liabilities undertaken. Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are initially recognised as assets and income at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Fair value measurement of assets and liabilities The Corporation has adopted the following general policies relating to the determination of fair value of assets and liabilities. The fair value of land is determined by reference to the market value of the land component of ABC property because it is possible to base the fair value on recent sales of comparable sites. The Corporation's independent valuers detail these reference sites in valuation reports for respective properties. The fair value of buildings, plant, equipment and intangibles is determined by reference to depreciated replacement cost as they are typically specialist in nature, with broadcasting in mind. Generally, the fair value of the Corporation's other financial assets and liabilities is deemed to be their carrying value as it approximates fair value. The fair value of long-term loans is the net present value of future discounted cash flows arising. AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level in accordance with the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 - unobservable inputs for an asset or liability.The Corporation does not hold any assets or liabilities measured at fair value that are classified as Level 1 inputs (i.e. with reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities). The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, financial assets and non-interest-bearing financial liabilities (except for derivatives used for hedging) of the Corporation, are measured at amortised cost that approximates their fair value. There have been no recurring fair value measurements transferred between the respective levels for assets and liabilities to 30 June 2020. Presentation in the financial statements The aforementioned is summarised on the following table. Measurement of right-of-use assets and accompanying liability under AASB 16 Leases Leased right-of-use assets are capitalised at the commencement date of the lease and comprise of the initial lease liability amount, initial direct costs incurred when entering into the lease less any lease incentives received. On initial adoption of AASB 16 the Corporation has adjusted the right-of-use assets at the date of initial application by the amount of any provision for onerous leases recognised immediately before the date of initial application. Following initial application, an impairment review is undertaken for any right-of-use asset that shows indicators of impairment and an impairment loss is recognised against any right-of-use asset that is impaired. Lease right-of-use assets continue to be measured at cost after initial recognition in Commonwealth agency, GGS and Whole of Government financial statements.

Receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that are held for the purpose of collecting the contractual cash flows where the cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, that are not provided at below-market interest rates, are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method adjusted for any loss allowance. In respect of the Receivables balance, the ABC has adopted the modified retrospective provisions of AASB 15 and has not classified the prior year's balances between Contract assets and Receivables . These are included in current assets, unless they mature more than 12 months after the Statement of Financial Position date, in which case they are classified as non-current assets. Other receivables As at 30 June 2020, Other receivables includes forward exchange contracts at fair value through surplus/(deficit) of nil (2019 $62,159). Under the fair value measurement hierarchy, these are Level 2 financial instruments as defined earlier under Fair value measurement of assets and liabilities . The balance represents estimated future cash flows, based on market forward exchange rates at 30 June 2020 and the forward contract rate, discounted by the observable yield curves of the respective currencies. The above amount reflects a 1.1% average depreciation (2019 2.2%) of the Australian dollar against those currencies for which forward exchange contracts have been taken out, where the market forward rate at 30 June 2020 is lower than the contracted rate. Insurance recoveries At 30 June 2020, Receivables (Goods and services) included $11,307,284 (2019 $13,727,176) for amounts invoiced to Comcover for insurance recoveries relating to expenditure incurred on the remediation of the ABC's Ultimo building. At 30 June 2020, Other receivables - Other, including receivables attributable to joint operations included $3,133,819 (2019 $29,544,550) for insurance recovery amounts yet to be invoiced. The total Receivables amount recognised in respect of the insurance recovery for the ABC Ultimo remediation works is $14,441,103 (2019 $43,271,726). This represents the amount that the ABC has invoiced. Financial Statements 149Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20205.

The carrying amount is reduced by way of an impairment allowance account. The loss is taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Bad and doubtful debts The Corporation assesses the likelihood of recovery of those debts, factoring in past bad debts experience. Bad debts are written off when identified. Impairment and adoption of AASB 9 Financial Instruments The ABC calculates an expected credit loss (ECL) provision, based on historical rates of credit impairment, adjusted for any external factors likely to impact the rate of impairment. The carrying value of the ECL provision is monitored against the value of debts likely to be considered at risk of being non-recoverable. At 30 June 2020, the balance of the ECL provision is $382,919 (2019 $141,844). For the year to 30 June 2020, this amount was sufficient to cover outstanding debt attributable to customers at risk of non-recoverability, which totalled $360,018 (2019 $132,284). 150 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Assumptions surrounding uncertainty - impairment of financial assets The Expected Credit Loss model was validated through an assessment of each of the ABC's trade debtors at 30 June 2020. Estimation assumptions are adjusted as economic and industry sector operating conditions dictate. Other investments (held to maturity financial assets) Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity dates that the Corporation has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity investments. Under AASB 9 Financial Instruments , held-to-maturity investments are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment, with revenue recognised on an effective yield basis. Surplus cash is invested into short term investments with maturities at acquisition date of greater than three months. These investments are due to be recovered within twelve months.

The fair value of land is determined based on market comparability, using recent sales history for comparable sites as referenced by independent valuers. Expert valuers undertook a comprehensive valuation of the ABC portfolio of Australian properties. Consequently a revaluation increment of $32,488,383 (2019 $28,000,000) for land was credited and a decrement of $42,455,027 (2019 increment of $7,465,134) for buildings, fit-out and site improvements was debited to the asset revaluation reserve and included in Changes in asset revaluation reserve within Other Comprehensive Income in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, Reserves within the Statement of Financial Position and Net revaluation of land and buildings in the Statement of Changes in Equity. In addition, leasehold land was re-classified under right-of-use assets and presented as such. This was reflected in the preceding table under Transfers/reclassifications. Level 3 non-financial assets comprise buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles, with no observable market data for the assets. Given the specialised nature of the Corporation's buildings, valuation is determined with reference to depreciated replacement cost, which is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value. The carrying value of the Corporation's plant and equipment represents its depreciated replacement cost, which is considered to be a reasonable approximation of its fair value. The carrying value of the Corporation's software for internal use represents its amortised replacement cost, which is considered to be a reasonable approximation of its fair value. Asset recognition threshold Purchases of land, buildings, plant, equipment and intangibles are recognised initially at cost in the Statement of Financial Position. Purchases costing less than $2,000 are expensed in the year of acquisition except where they form part of a project or group of similar items, which are significant in total. Revaluations Following initial recognition at cost, the fair value of property, plant, equipment and intangibles is measured based on depreciated replacement cost. Valuations are conducted with sufficient frequency to ensure that the carrying amounts of assets do not materially vary from the assets' fair values as at the reporting date. The regularity of independent valuations depends upon the volatility of movements in market values for the relevant assets. Revaluation adjustments are made on a class basis. Any revaluation increment is credited to equity under the heading of revaluation reserve except to the extent that it reverses a previous revaluation decrement of the same asset class, previously recognised through surplus/(deficit). Revaluation decrements for a class of assets are recognised directly through surplus/(deficit) except to the extent that they reverse a previous revaluation increment for that class. Any accumulated depreciation at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the asset restated to the re-valued amount. Impairment of non-current assets The aforementioned classes of assets are being subjected to an assessment as to indicators of impairment under AASB 136 Impairment of Assets as at 30 June 2020. Impairment is assessed with consideration of the asset's remaining service value. Disposals An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future economic benefits are expected.

On initial adoption of AASB 16 the Corporation has adjusted the right-of-use assets at the date of initial application by the amount of any provision for onerous leases recognised immediately before the date of initial application. Following initial application, an impairment review is undertaken for any right-of-use asset that shows indicators of impairment and an impairment loss is recognised against any right-of-use asset that is impaired. Right-of-use assets continue to be measured at amortised cost after initial recognition.Land The ABC's right-of-use land is measured at amortised cost, in accordance with the requirements of the PGPA (Financial Reporting) Rule 2015 . Buildings Right-of-use buildings largely consists of the ABC's Australian regional broadcasting offices for transmission of the undertaking of services provided by Local Radio and the ABC's overseas reporting bureaux. Under AASB 16 Leases , the right-of-use asset is measured as the present value of the liability to pay future contractual lease payments. 154 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Plant and equipment Under AASB 16, right-of-use plant and equipment is measured as the present value of the liability to pay future contractual lease payments and were identified as the following: A Satellite transponder for digital television distribution; Decoder boxes and dishes for satellite downlink services to support television transmission; Transmission facility assets for digital terrestrial television transmission: Transmission facility assets for terrestrial radio transmission; and Vehicles.

Non-Financial Assets (continued) Recognition and measurement (continued) Inventories (general) Inventories held for resale are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Inventories not held for resale are valued at the lower of cost, adjusted for any loss in service potential, based on the existence of a current replacement cost that is lower than the original acquisition cost or other subsequent carrying amount. Produced programs Television programs are produced for domestic transmission and include co-production fees, direct salaries and expenses and production overheads allocated on a usage basis to the program. Production overheads not allocated to programs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. External contributions received in respect of co-production of television programs are offset against production costs which are recorded as Inventories in the Statement of Financial Position. Write-down of inventory held for distribution When inventories held for distribution are distributed, the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense. The amount of any write-down of inventories for loss of service potential, and all losses of inventories are recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories arising from a reversal of the circumstances that gave rise to the loss of service potential will be recognised as a reduction in the value of inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs.Write-down of retail inventory The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value and all losses of inventory are recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories arising from an increase in the net realisable value will be recognised as an inventory expense reduction in expense in the period in which the reversal occurs. Tax assets The classification of a tax asset attributable to joint operations was reviewed and a reclassification was made to comparative disclosures to enhance presentation. Share of tax asset attributable to joint operations of $4,635,000 (2019 $4,561,000) which was previously classified as Other non-financial assets is now classified as Tax assets . 156 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 20207.

The loan facility entered into with the Department of Finance was to cash-flow the construction of a purpose-built facility in Southbank, Victoria. The total loan facility and all interest due has been fully extinguished, with the final tranche of $10,000,000 being paid in June 2020, ahead of its scheduled repayment in June 2021 (2019 $30,000,000). Share of loans in joint operations represents the ABC's 50% share of MediaHub's loan balances with the ANZ Banking Corporation. At 30 June 2020, MediaHub had drawn loans under six facilities with ANZ Banking Corporation, with an aggregate balance of $4,459,335 (2019 $5,441,667). The ABC's share, as reflected in its Statement of Financial Position, is $2,229,667 (2019 $2,720,834). These facilities are generally repayable over 5 years. The facility is provided on an average variable interest rate to 30 June 2020 of 2% (2019 3%).Lease liability Note 8B Lease liability is the present value of future contractual payments, for the remining life of the contracts. The undiscounted value of future lease payments is $680,837,524 (1 July 2019 $748,602,493). The average discount rate, determined with reference to the Commonwealth Department of Finance incremental borrowing rates, issued quarterly, was approximately 1.11%. The incremental borrowing rate used for each lease approximated the start date for each lease. Assumptions surrounding uncertainty - Lease liability The valuation of the lease liability is influenced by the discount rate, as advised, on a quarterly basis, by the Commonwealth Department of Finance. The carrying balance of this item is reviewed regularly and an assessment is made of the potential impact of a change in discount rates on this balance. The corresponding asset value as disclosed in Note 6B Right-of-use assets , is based on the value of the liability, being the net present value of the contractual cash-flows. 158 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 20209.

The provision for make good represents the estimated cost to make good leased properties at the end of the lease term. The estimated cost is based on management's best estimate of the cost to make good each site, plus an allowance for inflation. During the year, the ABC provided nil further amounts (2019 $19,508,687) for remediation works to replace the external cladding on the Ultimo, NSW building, to ensure compliance with the current BCA Fire Safety Standards. For the year to 30 June 2020, expenditure incurred on this project was $28,720,541 (2019 $17,601,011), resulting in a balance in the provision of $3,892,070 (2019 $32,612,612).

Where an employee has a current entitlement to leave (i.e. is presently entitled to take the leave), the value of that entitlement is included in the employee provisions expected to settle in no more than 12 months. Where the Corporation expects that an employee will be entitled to leave in the future but is not yet entitled to that leave, the value of the leave is included in the employee provision expected to settle in more than 12 months. (b) A provision is made for estimated historical salary and wages and superannuation entitlements owed to certain employees. This estimate is based on an extrapolation of entitlements calculated for a portion of potentially affected employees and factors-in risks and uncertainties associated with the settlement of the liability. The provision for superannuation also includes an amount in respect of an outstanding employer contribution to a defined benefit superannuation scheme. Recognition and measurement Liabilities for short-term employee benefits and termination benefits expected within twelve months of the end of reporting period are measured at their nominal amounts. Other long-term employee benefits are measured as the net total of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period minus the fair value at the end of the reporting period of plan assets (if any) out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Leave Leave liabilities are calculated based on employees' remuneration at the estimated salary rates that will apply at the time the leave is taken, including the employer superannuation contribution rates to the extent that the leave is likely to be taken during service rather than paid out on termination. The calculation is based on the anticipated length of time taken for an employee to fully settle his/her leave entitlement.The liability for long service leave has been determined by reference to the work of an actuary, PricewaterhouseCoopers Securities Ltd. The liability for long service leave is the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by the Corporation resulting from employees' services provided up to 30 June 2020. The estimate of the present value of the liability as at March 2020 considers attrition rates and pay increases through promotion and inflation. A discount rate of 0.6% per annum was applied to calculate the present value of the liability (2019 1.2%). This discount rate is based on the Commonwealth Government bond yield for a bond with a similar term to the liability. Redundancy A provision is made for separation and redundancy benefit payments. The ABC recognises a provision for termination when it has developed a detailed formal plan for the terminations and has informed those employees affected that it will carry out the terminations. 160 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Superannuation ABC employees are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS), Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS), the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan Scheme (PSSap) or another non-Commonwealth Superannuation fund. The CSS and PSS are defined benefit schemes for the Australian Government. The PSSap and other non-Commonwealth funds are defined contribution schemes. The liability for defined benefits is recognised in the financial statements of the Australian Government and is settled by the Australian Government in due course. This liability is reported in the Department of Finance's administered schedules and notes. The Corporation makes employer contributions to the employee defined benefit superannuation schemes at rates determined by an actuary to be sufficient to meet the current cost to the Government of the superannuation entitlements of the Corporation's employees. The Corporation accounts for the contributions in the same manner as contributions to defined contribution plans. The liability for superannuation recognised as at 30 June 2020 represents outstanding contributions at the end of the period. Expenses Expenses attributable to the aforementioned employee benefits and provisions are reported in Note 3A Employee benefits . Assumptions surrounding uncertainty - Measurement of leave liabilities The discount rates used in valuing leave liabilities are based on Australian government bond rates with maturities that closely align with the length of the liability. The ABC regularly reviews leave liabilities and impact of any adjustment to bond rates on these balances. Leave liabilities are also impacted by assumptions surrounding future salary inflation. The ABC regularly monitors factors that are likely to impact future salary inflation.11. Key Management Personnel Remuneration Key management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive or otherwise) of the Corporation.

Financial Instruments (continued) 13.2 Categories of Financial Instruments (continued) Recognition and measurement Financial Instruments Financial Assets The Corporation classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through surplus (deficit); held-to-maturity investments; and loans and receivables. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets are recognised and derecognised upon trade date. Effective Interest Method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period. Income is recognised on an effective interest rate basis except for financial assets that are recognised at fair value through surplus (deficit). Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) or surplus/(deficit) Financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through surplus/(deficit) where the financial assets: have been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future; are derivatives (except for derivative instruments that are designated as, and are highly effective hedging instruments); or are parts of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Corporation manages together and have a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. Forward exchange contracts in this category are classified as current assets. Financial assets at fair value through surplus/ (deficit) are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in surplus/(deficit). The net gain or loss recognised in surplus/(deficit) incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset. The Corporation's financial assets in this category are forward exchange contracts which are derivative financial instruments. Gains and losses on these items are recognised through surplus/(deficit) except if they are classified as a cash flow hedge where they are recognised in the hedging reserve within equity. 168 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 202013.2B Net gains or losses from financial assets and liabilities Notes2020 $'0002019 $'000 Other investments (held to maturity) Interest on term deposits with an original maturity date greater than 90 days4B 3,742 4,651 Net foreign exchange gain 4E 614 219 Net gain on other investments 4,356 4,870 Loans, receivables and cash Interest 4B 382 765 Net gain from loans and receivables 382 765 Net gains from financial assets recognised in Statement of Comprehensive Income4,738 5,635 Financial liabilities at amortised cost Interest and finance costs 3F (558) (951) Interest cost on lease liability 3G (7,407) - Net loss from financial liabilities - at amortised cost (7,965) (951) Net loss from financial liabilities recognised in Statement of Comprehensive Income(7,965) (951) Recognition and measurement (continued) Financial Instruments (continued) Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. These liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective interest basis. Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contracts are entered into and are subsequently revalued to reflect changes in fair value. Forward exchange contracts are carried as assets when their net fair value is positive and as liabilities when their net fair value is negative. For the purpose of hedge accounting, the Corporation's hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable either to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset, liability or to a highly probable forecast transaction.At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Corporation formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Corporation wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Corporation will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flow attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow hedge is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in surplus/(deficit). Financial Statements 169Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 202013. Financial Instruments (continued) Amounts taken to equity are transferred to surplus/(deficit) when the hedged transaction affects the surplus/(deficit), such as when hedged income or expenses are recognised or when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to surplus/(deficit). If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain until the forecast transaction occurs. If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to surplus/(deficit). 13.3 Financial Risk Management The Corporation's financial risk management policies and procedures are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Corporation, to set appropriate risk limits and controls to monitor risks and adherence to limits. The Corporation's policies are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in the Corporation's activities. There has been no change in the policies from the previous year. Compliance with policies and exposure limits are reviewed by the Corporation's internal auditors on a regular basis. To meet the Corporation's regular financial risk management objectives, surplus cash is invested in short term, highly liquid investments with maturities at acquisition date of greater than three months. These investments are included as other receivables . The Corporation's Treasury function provides advice and services to the business, coordinates access to foreign currency contracts and monitors and assesses the financial risks relating to the operations of the Corporation through internal risk reports. Where appropriate, the Corporation seeks to minimise the effects of its financial risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Corporation's policies, approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and investment of funds. The Corporation does not enter into trade financial instruments for speculative purposes. Under Section 25B of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983, the Corporation's Foreign Exchange Policy is conducted to reduce or eliminate risk on the Corporation's known exposures and activities and will be recorded under accepted accounting standards. The Corporation's aims, by entering into foreign currency hedging arrangements are outlined in Note 4 Expenses and the Financial Position section under \" Foreign currency transactions \". 13.4 Fair Values of Financial Instruments Forward exchange contracts The fair value of forward exchange contracts is taken to be the unrealised gain or loss at balance date calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. At 30 June 2020 this was a net payable of $143,747 (2019 receivable of $62,159). The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (such as over-the-counter derivatives) are determined using a Level 2 technique based on the forward exchange rates at the end of the reporting period using assumptions that are based on market conditions at the end of each reporting period. Loans The fair values of long-term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on current interest rates for liabilities with similar risk profiles. At 30 June 2020, the Corporation's loan facility with the Department 170 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020of Finance has been fully extinguished (2019 $30,000,000). This was to cash-flow the construction of the now complete purpose-built facility in Southbank, Victoria. The Corporation repaid $30,000,000 during the year to 30 June 2020 (2019 $20,000,000), thus extinguishing the loan. 13.5 Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Corporation. Credit risk arises from the financial assets of the Corporation, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, short term investments and derivative instruments. The Corporation has a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Corporation assesses credit ratings through independent ratings agencies and if not available, uses publicly available financial information and its own trading record to rate customers. The Corporation manages its credit risk by undertaking credit checks on customers who wish to take on credit terms. The Corporation has policies that set limits for each individual customer. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable. The Corporation has no material concentration of credit risk with any single customer as the Corporation has a large number of customers spread across a range of industries and geographical areas. The credit risk arising from dealings in financial instruments is controlled by a strict policy of credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. The Corporation does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with credit ratings of at least A- as assigned by Standard & Poor's.The Corporation's maximum exposure to credit risk at reporting date in relation to each class of recognised financial assets is the carrying amount, net of the expected credit loss provision, of those assets as indicated in the Statement of Financial Position. Credit exposure of foreign currency and interest rate bearing investments is represented by the net fair value of the contracts. 13.6 Hedging Instruments The following table sets out the gross value to be received under forward exchange contracts, the weighted average contracted exchange rates and the settlement periods of outstanding contracts for the Corporation. Sell Australian DollarsAverage Exchange Rate 2020 $'0002019 $'000 2020 2019 Buy USD Less than 1 year 5,567 2,669 0.6705 0.7133 Buy GBP Less than 1 year 949 176 0.5253 0.5627 Buy EUR Less than 1 year 42 - 0.5945 - General hedges The Corporation enters into forward exchange contracts to cover foreign currency payments when exposures less than $50,000, of a recurrent nature and with varying foreign currency amounts and payment dates are incurred. General cover is typically held between 20% and 80% of estimated exposures for USD, GBP and EUR subject to market conditions. At balance date, the Corporation held forward exchange contracts to buy USD, GBP and EUR. Gains/losses arising from general hedges outstanding at year end have been taken to surplus/(deficit). The net loss is $144,890 (2019 net gain of $58,648) on general hedges of anticipated foreign currency purchases, outstanding as at 30 June 2020.

Regulatory Framework The ABC Board is required, under paragraph 8(1) (e) of the ABC Act, to develop a code of practice relating to its television and radio programming, and to notify this code to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (\"the ACMA\"). A complaint alleging the ABC has acted contrary to its Code of Practice in its television or radio programming may be made to the ABC. A complainant is entitled under section 150 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) (\"the BSA\") to take their complaint to the ACMA if, after 60 days, the ABC fails to respond to the complainant or the complainant considers the ABC's response is inadequate. The ACMA has a discretionary power to investigate a complaint alleging the ABC has, in providing a national broadcasting service, breached its Code of Practice. Section 151 of the BSA provides that the ACMA may investigate the complaint if it thinks that it is desirable to do so. The ACMA's jurisdiction under sections 150-151 does not encompass the ABC's print content or content disseminated by the ABC over the internet or through mobile devices. However, the eSafety Commissioner has separate jurisdiction under Schedule 7 to the BSA in relation to content hosted on websites or transmitted through mobile services where that content is either \"prohibited content\" 1 or \"age-restricted content\".2 The eSafety Commissioner is empowered under Schedule 7 to require content service providers and content hosts to remove or prevent access to these types of content. The ABC voluntarily complies with the Content Services Code, which is registered as an industry code with the eSafety Commissioner under clause 85 of Schedule 7 to the BSA.The Content Services Code does not apply to content delivered through online or mobile services where that content has been previously transmitted on radio or television. Except as expressly provided by the BSA, the regulatory regime established by the BSA does not apply to the ABC: subsection 13(5) of the BSA, and section 79 of the ABC Act. II. Scope of the Code The requirements of this Code are set out in the sections dealing with Interpretation and Standards in Part IV and the Associated Standard in Part V. The Standards in Part IV apply to radio and television programs broadcast by the ABC on its free-to-air television or radio broadcasting services. The Associated Standard in Part V applies only to television programs broadcast by the ABC on its domestic free-to-air television services. Complaints about content on the services named above fall within the scope of the Code except where: the complaint concerns content which is or becomes the subject of legal proceedings; the complaint was frivolous or vexatious or not made in good faith; the complainant does not have a sufficient interest in the subject matter of the complaint, where the complaint alleges a breach of Fair and honest dealing (Standards 5.1-5.8) or Privacy (Standard 6.1). 1 Prohibited content essentially involves content that is classified either as RC (Refused Classification) or X18+. This includes real depictions of actual sexual activity, child pornography, detailed instruction in crime, and violence or drug use. 2 Age-restricted content involves content classified as R18+ or MA15+ that is delivered through a mobile device or through a service that provides audio or video content for a fee. This type of content must be subject to a restricted access system, i.e. measures put in place to protect children under the age of 15 from exposure to unsuitable material. This category of content includes material containing strong depictions of nudity, implied sexual activity, drug use or violence, very frequent or very strong coarse language, and other material that is strong in impact. 180 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020 the complaint was lodged with the ABC more than six weeks after the date when the program was last broadcast by the ABC on its free-to-air radio or television services, unless the complaint is accepted for investigation on the grounds that is appropriate to do so, having regard to: -the interests of the complainant in the subject matter of the complaint; -the seriousness of the alleged breach; -the reason(s) for the delay; -the availability of the program content which is the subject of the complaint; and -any prejudice the delay may otherwise have on the ability to investigate and determine the matter fairly. III. Resolved Complaints The ABC seeks to comply fully with the Code and to resolve complaints as soon as practicable. A failure to comply will not be a breach of the Code if the ABC has, prior to the complaint being made to the ACMA, taken steps which were adequate and appropriate in all the circumstances to redress the cause of the complaint. To illustrate, a failure to comply with Standards 2.1 or 2.2 (Accuracy) will not be taken to be a breach of the Code if a correction or clarification, which is adequate and appropriate in all the circumstances, is made prior to or within 30 days of the ABC receiving the complaint. IV. Principles and Standards Preamble The ABC belongs to the Australian people. Earning and retaining their trust is essential to fulfilling the ABC's charter and its responsibilities under the ABC Act to provide innovative and comprehensive services of a high standard to Australian and international audiences. The principles and standards set out below are the means by which the ABC seeks to meet these obligations.They uphold the fundamental journalistic principles of accuracy and impartiality, to protect the ABC's independence and integrity. They recognise that ABC content must be created in a way that is respectful towards audiences and mindful of community standards in areas like harm and offence. At the same time, they recognise that the ABC needs to be adventurous, brave and creative: Adventurous in encouraging new and sometimes confronting forms of art and entertainment. Brave in reporting without fear or favour, even when that might be uncomfortable or unpopular; and Creative in finding new ways of telling Australian stories, reflecting Australian culture and sharing in the Australian conversation. By holding to these principles and standards, the ABC seeks to be accountable to the Australian people who fund us. 1. Interpretation In this Code, the Standards must be interpreted and applied in accordance with the Principles applying in each Section. From time to time, the ABC publishes Guidance Notes which do not in themselves impose obligations on the ABC, but which may be relevant in interpreting and applying the Code. The Standards in Parts IV and V are to be interpreted and applied with due regard for the nature of the content under consideration in particular cases. The ABC is conscious that its dual obligations - for accountability and for high quality - can in practice interact in complex ways. It can be a sign of strength not weakness that journalism enrages or art shocks. The Standards are to be applied in ways that maintain independence and integrity, preserve trust and do not unduly constrain journalistic enquiry or artistic expression. Appendices 1812. Accuracy Principles: The ABC has a statutory duty to ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is accurate according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. Credibility depends heavily on factual accuracy. Types of fact-based content include news and analysis of current events, documentaries, factual dramas and lifestyle programs. The ABC requires that reasonable efforts must be made to ensure accuracy in all fact-based content. The ABC gauges those efforts by reference to: the type, subject and nature of the content; the likely audience expectations of the content; the likely impact of reliance by the audience on the accuracy of the content; and the circumstances in which the content was made and presented. The ABC accuracy standard applies to assertions of fact, not to expressions of opinion. An opinion, being a value judgement or conclusion, cannot be found to be accurate or inaccurate in the way facts can. The accuracy standard requires that opinions be conveyed accurately, in the sense that quotes should be accurate and any editing should not distort the meaning of the opinion expressed. The efforts reasonably required to ensure accuracy will depend on the circumstances. Sources with relevant expertise may be relied on more heavily than those without. Eyewitness testimony usually carries more weight than second-hand accounts. The passage of time or the inaccessibility of locations or sources can affect the standard of verification reasonably required. The ABC should make reasonable efforts, appropriate in the context, to signal to audiences gradations in accuracy, for example by querying interviewees, qualifying bald assertions, supplementing the partly right and correcting the plainly wrong.Standards: 2.1 Make reasonable efforts to ensure that material facts are accurate and presented in context. 2.2 Do not present factual content in a way that will materially mislead the audience. In some cases, this may require appropriate labels or other explanatory information. 3. Corrections and clarifications Principles: A commitment to accuracy includes a willingness to correct errors and clarify ambiguous or otherwise misleading information. Swift correction can reduce harmful reliance on inaccurate information, especially given content can be quickly, widely and permanently disseminated. Corrections and clarifications can contribute to achieving fairness and impartiality. Standards: 3.1 Acknowledge and correct or clarify, in an appropriate manner as soon as reasonably practicable: a. significant material errors that are readily apparent or have been demonstrated; or b. information that is likely to significantly and materially mislead. 4. Impartiality and diversity of perspectives Principles: The ABC has a statutory duty to ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is impartial according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. Aiming to equip audiences to make up their own minds is consistent with the public service character of the ABC. A democratic society depends on diverse sources of reliable information and contending opinions. A broadcaster operating under statute with public funds is legitimately expected to contribute in ways that may differ from commercial media, which are free to be partial to private interests. 182 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Judgements about whether impartiality was achieved in any given circumstances can vary among individuals according to their personal and subjective view of any given matter of contention. Acknowledging this fact of life does not change the ABC's obligation to apply its impartiality standard as objectively as possible. In doing so, the ABC is guided by these hallmarks of impartiality: a balance that follows the weight of evidence; fair treatment; open-mindedness; and opportunities over time for principal relevant perspectives on matters of contention to be expressed. The ABC aims to present, over time, content that addresses a broad range of subjects from a diversity of perspectives reflecting a diversity of experiences, presented in a diversity of ways from a diversity of sources, including content created by ABC staff, generated by audiences and commissioned or acquired from external content-makers. Impartiality does not require that every perspective receives equal time, nor that every facet of every argument is presented. Assessing the impartiality due in given circumstances requires consideration in context of all relevant factors including: the type, subject and nature of the content; the circumstances in which the content is made and presented; the likely audience expectations of the content; the degree to which the matter to which the content relates is contentious; the range of principal relevant perspectives on the matter of contention; and the timeframe within which it would be appropriate for the ABC to provide opportunities for the principal relevant perspectives to be expressed, having regard to the public importance of the matter of contention and the extent to which it is the subject of current debate.Standards: 4.1 Gather and present news and information with due impartiality. 4.2 Present a diversity of perspectives so that, over time, no significant strand of thought or belief within the community is knowingly excluded or disproportionately represented. 4.3 Do not state or imply that any perspective is the editorial opinion of the ABC. The ABC takes no editorial stance other than its commitment to fundamental democratic principles including the rule of law, freedom of speech and religion, parliamentary democracy and equality of opportunity. 4.4 Do not misrepresent any perspective. 4.5 Do not unduly favour one perspective over another. 5. Fair and honest dealing Principles: Fair and honest dealing is essential to maintaining trust with audiences and with those who participate in or are otherwise directly affected by ABC content. In rare circumstances, deception or a breach of an undertaking may be justified. Because of the potential damage to trust, deception or breach of an undertaking must be explained openly afterwards unless there are compelling reasons not to do so. Standards: Dealing with participants 5.1 Participants in ABC content should normally be informed of the general nature of their participation. 5.2 A refusal to participate will not be overridden without good cause. Opportunity to respond 5.3 Where allegations are made about a person or organisation, make reasonable efforts in the circumstances to provide a fair opportunity to respond. Appendices 183Attribution and sources 5.4 Aim to attribute information to its source. 5.5 Where a source seeks anonymity, do not agree without first considering the source's motive and any alternative attributable sources. 5.6 Do not misrepresent another's work as your own. Undertakings 5.7 Assurances given in relation to conditions of participation, use of content, confidentiality or anonymity must be honoured except in rare cases where justified in the public interest. Secret recording and other types of deception 5.8 Secret recording, misrepresentation or other types of deception must not be used by the ABC or its co-production partners to obtain or seek information, audio, pictures or an agreement to participate except where: (a) justified in the public interest and the material cannot reasonably be obtained by any other means; or (b) consent is obtained from the subject or identities are effectively obscured; or (c) the deception is integral to an artistic work. In all cases, the potential for harm must be taken into consideration. 6. Privacy Principles: Privacy is necessary to human dignity and every person reasonably expects that their privacy will be respected. But privacy is not absolute. The ABC seeks to balance the public interest in respect for privacy with the public interest in disclosure of information and freedom of expression. Standards: 6.1 Intrusion into a person's private life without consent must be justified in the public interest and the extent of the intrusion must be limited to what is proportionate in the circumstances.7. Harm and offence Principles: The ABC broadcasts comprehensive and innovative content that aims to inform, entertain and educate diverse audiences. This involves a willingness to take risks, invent and experiment with new ideas. It can result in challenging content which may offend some of the audience some of the time. But it also contributes to diversity of content in the media and to fulfilling the ABC's function to encourage and promote the musical, dramatic and other performing arts. The ABC acknowledges that a public broadcaster should never gratuitously harm or offend and accordingly any content which is likely to harm or offend must have a clear editorial purpose. The ABC potentially reaches the whole community, so it must take into account community standards. However, the community recognises that what is and is not acceptable in ABC content largely depends upon the particular context, including the nature of the content, its target audience, and any signposting that equips audiences to make informed choices about what they see, hear or read. Applying the harm and offence standard, therefore, requires careful judgement. What may be inappropriate and unacceptable in one context may be appropriate and acceptable in another. Coarse language, disturbing images or unconventional situations may form a legitimate part of reportage, debate, documentaries or a humorous, satirical, dramatic or other artistic work. Standards: 7.1 Content that is likely to cause harm or offence must be justified by the editorial context. 7.2 Where content is likely to cause harm or offence, having regard to the context, make reasonable efforts to provide information about the nature of the content through the use of classification labels or other warnings or advice. 184 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 20207.3 Ensure all domestic television programs - with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events - are classified and scheduled for broadcast in accordance with the ABC's Associated Standard on Television Program Classification. 7.4 If inadvertent or unexpected actions, audio or images in live content are likely to cause harm or offence, take appropriate steps to mitigate. 7.5 The reporting or depiction of violence, tragedy or trauma must be handled with extreme sensitivity. Avoid causing undue distress to victims, witnesses or bereaved relatives. Be sensitive to significant cultural practices when depicting or reporting on recently deceased persons. 7.6 Where there is editorial justification for content which may lead to dangerous imitation or exacerbate serious threats to individual or public health, safety or welfare, take appropriate steps to mitigate those risks, particularly by taking care with how content is expressed or presented. 7.7 Avoid the unjustified use of stereotypes or discriminatory content that could reasonably be interpreted as condoning or encouraging prejudice. 8. Children and young people Principles: The ABC aims to provide children and young people (under the age of 18) with enjoyable and enriching content, as well as opportunities for them to express themselves. Children and young people participate and interact with the ABC in various ways - as actors, presenters, interviewees, subjects, content makers and audience members. The ABC has a responsibility to protect children and young people from potential harm that might arise during their engagement with the ABC and its content. The ABC shares this responsibility with parents/guardians and with the child or young person him/herself.In particular, the ABC recommends that parents/guardians supervise children and young people's access to content, their participation in interactive services, and their exposure to news and current affairs. It is not always possible to avoid presenting content that may be distressing to some audience members. Standards: 8.1 Take due care over the dignity and physical and emotional welfare of children and young people who are involved in making, participating in and presenting content produced or commissioned by the ABC. 8.2 Before significant participation of a child or young person in content produced or commissioned by the ABC, or in interactive services offered by the ABC, consider whether it is appropriate to obtain the consent of both the child/young person and the parent/guardian. 8.3 Adopt appropriate measures wherever practicable to enable children and young people, or those who supervise them, to manage risks associated with the child/young person's participation with, use of and exposure to ABC content and services designed for them. 8.4 Take particular care to minimise risks of exposure to unsuitable content or inappropriate contact by peers or strangers. V. Associated Standard: Television Program Classification Status of Associated Standard This Associated Standard is approved by the ABC Board and is binding. It is for consideration by relevant editorial decision-makers when providing advice on compliance and by complaints bodies when dealing with complaints. The Associated Standard is provided to assist interpretation of or otherwise supplement the standard in the Editorial Policies to which the Associated Standard relates. Appendices 185This Associated Standard forms part of the Code of Practice notified to the Australian Communications and Media Authority under section 8(1)(e) of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 . Key Editorial Standard 7.3 Ensure all domestic television programs - with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events - are classified and scheduled for broadcast in accordance with the ABC's Associated Standard on Television Program Classification. Principles: The ABC applies the classifications listed below to the broadcast of all its domestic television programs with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events. The ABC classifications are adapted from the Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games issued by the Classification Board made under the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. The guiding principle in the application of the following classifications is context. What is inappropriate and unacceptable in one context may be appropriate and acceptable in another. Factors to be taken into account include: the artistic or educational merit of the production, the purpose of a sequence, the tone, the camera work, the intensity and relevance of the material, the treatment, and the intended audience. Standards: 7.3.1 Television Classifications G - GENERAL G programs may be shown at any time. G programs, which include programs designed for pre-school and school-aged children, are suitable for children to watch on their own. Some G programs may be more appropriate for older children.The G classification does not necessarily indicate that the program is one that children will enjoy. Some G programs contain themes or storylines that are not of interest to children. Whether or not the program is intended for children, the treatment of themes and other classifiable elements will be careful and discreet. Themes: The treatment of themes should be discreet, justified by context, and very mild in impact. The presentation of dangerous, imitable behaviour is not permitted except in those circumstances where it is justified by context. Any depiction of such behaviour must not encourage dangerous imitation. Violence: Violence may be very discreetly implied, but should: have a light tone, or have a very low sense of threat or menace, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Sex: Sexual activity should: only be suggested in very discreet visual or verbal references, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Artistic or cultural depictions of nudity in a sexual context may be permitted if the treatment is discreet, justified by context, and very mild in impact. Language: Coarse language should: be very mild and infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Drug Use: The depiction of the use of legal drugs should be handled with care. Illegal drug use should be implied only very discreetly and be justified by context. 186 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context should be: infrequent, and not detailed, and not gratuitous. PG - PARENTAL GUIDANCE (Parental Guidance recommended for people under 15 years) Subject to the Implementation Guidelines at 7.3.2, PG programs may be shown in accordance with Time Zone Charts at 7.3.5. PG programs may contain themes and concepts which, when viewed by those under 15 years, may require the guidance of an adult. The PG classification signals to parents that material in this category contains depictions or references which could be confusing or upsetting to children without adult guidance. Material classified PG will not be harmful or disturbing to children. Parents may choose to preview the material for their children. Some may choose to watch the material with their children. Others might find it sufficient to be accessible during or after the viewing to discuss the content. Themes: The treatment of themes should be discreet and mild in impact. More disturbing themes are not generally dealt with at PG level. Supernatural or mild horror themes may be included. Violence: Violence may be discreetly implied or stylised and should also be: mild in impact, and not shown in detail. Sex: Sexual activity and nudity in a sexual context may be suggested, but should: be discreet, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Verbal references to sexual activity should be discreet. Language: Coarse language should be mild and infrequent.Drug Use: Discreet verbal references and mild, incidental visuals of drug use may be included, but these should not promote or encourage drug use. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context should not be detailed or gratuitous.M - MATURE (Recommended for people aged 15 years and over) Subject to the Implementation Guidelines at 7.3.2, M programs may be shown in accordance with the Time Zone Charts at 7.3.5. The M category is recommended for people aged over 15 years. Programs classified M contain material that is considered to be potentially harmful or disturbing to those under 15 years. Depictions and references to classifiable elements may contain detail. While most themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in the M category - the less explicit or less intense material will be included in the M classification and the more explicit or more intense material, especially violent material, will be included in the MA15+ classification. Themes: Most themes can be dealt with, but the treatment should be discreet and the impact should not be strong. Violence: Generally, depictions of violence should: not contain a lot of detail, and not be prolonged. In realistic treatments, depictions of violence that contain detail should: be infrequent, and not have a strong impact, and not be gratuitous. Appendices 187In stylised treatments, depictions of violence may contain more detail and be more frequent if this does not increase the impact. Verbal and visual references to sexual violence may only be included if they are: discreet and infrequent, and strongly justified by the narrative or documentary context. Sex: Sexual activity may be discreetly implied. Nudity in a sexual context should not contain a lot of detail or be prolonged. Verbal references to sexual activity may be more detailed than depictions if this does not increase the impact. Language: Coarse language may be used. Generally, coarse language that is stronger, detailed or very aggressive should: be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Drug Use: Drug use may be discreetly shown. Drug use should not be promoted or encouraged. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context may be shown but depictions that contain any detail should not be gratuitous. MA15+ - MATURE AUDIENCE (Not suitable for people under 15 years) Subject to the Implementation Guidelines at 7.3.2, MA15+ programs may be shown in accordance with the Time Zone Charts at 7.3.5. MA15+ programs, because of the matter they contain or because of the way it is treated, are not suitable for people aged under 15 years. Material classified MA15+ deals with issues or contains depictions which require a more mature perspective. This is because the impact of individual elements or a combination of elements is considered likely to be harmful or disturbing to viewers under 15 years of age. While most themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in the MA15+ category - the more explicit or more intense material, especially violent material, will be included in the MA15+ classification and the less explicit or less intense material will be included in the M classification. Themes: The treatment of themes with a high degree of intensity should not be gratuitous.Violence: Generally, depictions of violence should not have a high impact.In realistic treatments, detailed depictions of violence with a strong impact should: be infrequent, and not be prolonged, and not be gratuitous. Depictions of violence in stylised treatments may be more detailed and more frequent if this does not increase the impact. Depictions of sexual violence are permitted only if they are not frequent, prolonged, gratuitous or exploitative. Sex: Sexual activity may be implied. Depictions of nudity in a sexual context which contain detail should not be exploitative. Verbal references may be more detailed than depictions if this does not increase the impact. Language: Coarse language may be used. Coarse language that is very strong, aggressive or detailed should not be gratuitous. Drug Use: Drug use may be shown but should not be promoted or encouraged.More detailed depictions should not have a high degree of impact. Nudity: Nudity should be justified by context. 7.3.2 Implementation Guidelines The time zones for each program classification are guides to the most likely placement of programs within that classification. They are not hard and fast rules and there will be occasions on which programs or segments of programs appear in other time zones. 188 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2020There must be sound reasons for any departure from the time zone for a program classification. Possible reasons might include, for example, the need to schedule programs which are serious presentations of moral, social or cultural issues, in timeslots most suitable for their target audiences. Programs, including those having a particular classification under the Classification Board's Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games, may be modified so that they are suitable for broadcast or suitable for broadcast at particular times. Broken Hill in New South Wales shares a time zone with South Australia but ordinarily receives the ABC's New South Wales TV services. Given the time zone difference, some programs are broadcast outside their classification time zone. 7.3.3 Television Classification Symbols The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA15+ program (except for news, current affairs or sporting events) being shown will be displayed at the beginning of the program. The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA15+ program (except for news, current affairs or sporting events) being promoted will be displayed during the promotion. 7.3.4 Consumer Advice Audio and visual consumer advice on the reasons for an M or MA15+ classification will be given prior to the beginning of an M or MA15+ program. 7.3.5 Classification of Live Content Many live programs fall into the classification exemption categories (news, current affairs and sporting events). Some, such as live music or comedy programs, do not fall into the exemption categories and pose a particular challenge to classify accurately. The ABC makes reasonable efforts to classify these programs accurately by reviewing scripts, lyrics, outlines, and any pre-recorded material, and briefing program makers and talent as required.A failure to provide an accurate classification symbol or consumer advice prior to a live (or as-live) program will not be regarded as a breach of standards as long as reasonable efforts were made to classify it and appropriate steps are taken to mitigate any harm or offence.

Commonwealth entities are required to present remuneration for key management personnel, senior executives and other highly paid staff, as defined in the PGPA Rule. Key management personnel Key management personnel (KMP) are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive or otherwise) of that entity. The Corporation determined KMP as the members of the Board, the Managing Director, Content Team Directors and the Chief Financial Officer. Senior executives Senior executives are employees employed in a position equivalent to classification Groups 9 to 11 of the table in Schedule 1 to the Public Service Classification Rules 2000. The Corporation determined senior executives as executive directors who are not KMP (Senior Executives) . Other highly paid staff Other highly paid staff are employees who are neither KMP nor senior executive and whose total remuneration paid during the year exceeded $225,000 (Other Highly Paid Staff) .Total remuneration Total remuneration is defined in the PGPA Rule as the sum of the following (calculated on an accrual basis): a) base salaryb) performance pay and bonusesc) other benefits and allowancesd) superannuation contributions (made by the employer) e) long service leavef) other long-term benefitsg) termination benefits. Executive and employee remuneration policy At the core of the ABC's approach to remuneration is a need to ensure the Corporation can realise its strategic priorities through an ability to attract and retain employees who deliver on its priorities and deliver value for audiences into the future. Appendices 193Remuneration principles and framework Remuneration principles Remuneration frameworkEquitable We ensure our remuneration approach is consistent and equitableMarket competitive We attract and retain the best talent to meet our current and future workforce needsPerformance aligned We recognise and reward for contribution to performance goals and targetsTransparent We have a transparent and disciplined approach to managing remuneration decisions and costs Fixed remuneration At risk remuneration Element Fixed remuneration comprises base salary, superannuation and benefits.Executive KMP, Senior Executives and some Other Highly Paid Staff are eligible to receive an at-risk payment for the achievement of performance targets. The Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal (the Tribunal), consented to the removal of at-risk pay for the Managing Director (MD) from 1 June 2018. Performance Reviewed annually to reflect the experience, competence and contribution of individuals whilst remaining conservatively competitive against the market.For Executive KMP and Senior Executives, half of the at-risk opportunity is linked to ABC corporate objectives and half is linked to individual objectives. Some Other Highly Paid Staff are eligible to receive an at risk payment for the achievement of performance targets, some are eligible to be paid a performance bonus in accordance with the terms in the Senior Employment Agreement 2016 and some are eligible to be paid a bonus in accordance with the ABC Enterprise Agreement 2019-22.

Statutory superannuation is paid in addition to the fees set by the Tribunal. The Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal determination for the relevant period set the following ABC Board fees: Chair: $178,190 Deputy Chair: $87,970 Member: $58,670Key management personnel remuneration Key management personnel (KMP) are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive or otherwise) of that entity.
