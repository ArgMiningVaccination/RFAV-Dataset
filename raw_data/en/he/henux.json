Testing for HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc. Testing not requirement for vaccination, and in settings where testing is not feasible, vaccination of recommended persons should continue.The first dose of HepBvaccine should typically be administered immediately after collection of the blood for serologic testing. Prevaccinationtesting is recommended for the following persons:household, sexual, or needle-sharing anti-HBc) is also recommended for the following persons:persons born in countries of high and intermediate HBV endemicity (HBsAg prevalence 2%);U.S.-born persons not vaccinated as infants whose parents were born in countries with high HBV endemicity (8%);persons needing immunosuppressive therapy, including chemotherapy, immunosuppression related organ transplantation, and immunosuppression for rheumatologic or gastroenterologicdisorders; anddonors of blood, plasma, organs, tissues, or semen.All pregnant women should be tested for HBsAg during each pregnancy.Pregnant women with positive HBsAg tests should be tested for HBV DNA.SchillieMMWR 2018: 67Re-Testing HBsAg-Negative Pregnant Women At time of admission to hospital for delivery if:Injection drug useMore than 1 sex partner in previous 6 monthsHBsAg-positive sex partnerEvaluation or treatment for a sexually transmitted diseaseWith clinical hepatitisPermissive Language to Delay Birth DoseExisting Language On a case-by-case basis and only in rare circumstances, the first dose may be delayed until after hospital discharge for an infant who weighs 2,000 grams and whose mother is HBsAg-negative.Revised Language (new recommendation)-Permissive language removedRemoval of Permissive LanguageUniversal birth dose prior to hospital discharge serves as a safety net to prevent HBV transmission for infants not identified due to errors in:Maternal HBsAgtestingTranscription of maternal HBsAgtest resultsReporting maternal Series \u00a7Recommended for all infants\u00a7Completed at:6 months of age for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers6-18 months of age for infants born to HBsAg-negative mothers15Postvaccination Serologic Testing (PVST)\u00a7Recommended for infants born to:HBsAg-positive mothers Mothers whose HBsAg status remains unknown indefinitely (e.g., infants safely surrendered shortly after birth) (new recommendation)\u00a7Performed after completion of HepBvaccine series (age 9-12 months) (new recommendation) and at least 1 month after last HepBvaccine dose (to avoid detecting HBsAgfrom vaccine)HBsAgAnti-HBs\u00a776%* (8,558/11,310) of infants born in 2014 in PHBPP received PVST*Excludes Philadelphia, preliminary and subject to change Summary of Revised ACIP Guidance for Perinatal HBV Transmission\u00a7Testing HBsAg-positive pregnant women for HBV DNA to guide maternal antiviral therapy\u00a7Universal HepBvaccination within 24 hours of birth for infants 2,000 grams\u00a7Removal of permissive language for delaying birth dose \u00a7Postvaccinationserologic testing for infants whose maternal HBsAgstatus remains unknown indefinitely\u00a7Single-dose revaccination for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers not responding to the initial vaccine series HBV VaccinesAvailable since 1980sInitially plasma derived, then yeast derivedGradual implementation of recommendations to vaccinate decreased reported acute HBV in USAhigh risk groupsChildren of HBsAg positive mothersAll childrenAdolescentsImmune compromised We have not yet gotten to saying \"universal vaccination\" but its closeVaccination Candidates 1.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
