Approximately three percent of people in the United States and up to 2.8 percent in India deal with this condition that causes the skin to inflame, thicken and get a scaly appearance ( [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34190957/)). People suffering from psoriasis are often embarrassed by their skin condition besides being plagued by a variety of symptoms, such as pain, itching, cracked, [broken skin](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/skin-fissure/), painful and inflamed joints, and [blisters](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/effective-home-remedies-to-treat-blisters-on-your-tongue/) filled with pus. These symptoms can lead the person to turn into a recluse, shun social gatherings, get depressed and even have suicidal thoughts ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3890931/)). According to the [American Academy of Dermatology Association (AAD)](https://www.aad.org/media/stats-numbers#:~:text=Acne,to%2050%20million%20Americans%20annually.&text=Acne%20usually%20begins%20in%20puberty,experience%20at%20least%20minor%20acne), 7.5 million Americans have psoriasis. It is estimated that 80% experience mild to moderate psoriasis, while 20% experience moderate to severe psoriasis that affects more than 5% of their bodies. It is further estimated that 80% to 90% of people with psoriasis experience plaque psoriasis (raised red skin with silver-white scales). [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448194/)). Conventional Treatment For Psoriasis Psoriasis can affect the face, scalp, chest, elbows, fingernails, genitals, [toenails](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/home-remedies-to-get-rid-of-ingrown-toenail-pain/), knees, soles, lower back, and legs.

However, as the disease progresses, the potency of the medications also increases. It is not unheard of for psoriasis patients to be prescribed corticosteroidsi [X]A type of medication that is used to treat the itchiness and inflammation associated with psoriasis. and anti-malarial medications. This can result in a lot of undesirable and unpleasant side effects ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6471628/)).

It can be used to treat psoriasis on the nails, behind the ears and in the groin region, neck, and the bend of elbows and knees. Usually, this remedy is prescribed to obese patients and those who suffer from constipation and/or are sensitive to cold temperatures. 4. Mezereum This medication is prepared using the bark of the spurge olive tree, also known as mezereum. It can treat skin and scalp psoriasis quite effectively.

Arsenic Album This remedy is for psoriatic patients who experience an improvement in their condition under warm conditions and a worsening of the psoriasis in cold and wet conditions. 7.

Usually, patients with such eruptions feel better after taking a cold bath, and experience a worsening of their condition in the heat. 8. Calendula Many times, homeopathic doctors can prescribe calendula for psoriasis. While this is not a remedy, it can soothe the inflammation that psoriasis causes ( [4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322537963_Natural_Green_Alternatives_to_Psoriasis_Treatment-_A_Review)).
