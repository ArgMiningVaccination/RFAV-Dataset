Salmonella continues to be one of the top causative agents of infectious intestinal disease. Between 1981-1991, the incidence of salmonellosis rose by approximatel y 170% remaining high throughout the 1990's. 2. In 1991 the ACMSF agreed to set up a working group to consider the extent to which eggs were re sponsible for the rise in human salmonellosis. The report was pub lished in 1993 concluding that much of the increase was due to Salmonella Enteritidis mostly phage type 4 (PT4). 3. The ACMSF set up the second Salmonella in eggs working group in 1998 to look at initiatives such as vaccination and biosecurity, instigated in order to reduce the incidence of Salmonella in eggs produced by commercial laying flo cks. The working group also examined why Salmonella prevalence of UK eggs failed to drop between the 1991and 1995/96 egg surveys. 4. The Second Report on Salmonella in Eggs was published in 2001. The Report concluded that based on data supplied by the egg industry, the prevalence of Salmonella in eggs had dropped since the 1995/96 survey and recommended that this should be confirmed through an official survey in order to quantify t he impact of the interventions put in place. 5. The Agency responded to this and to a subsequent increase in cases of Salmonella Enteritidis non-PT4, associ ated with non-UK eggs, by commissioning a series of egg resear ch projects and surveys to understand Salmonella infection in laying hens, mechanisms of contamination in eggs, use of eggs and kitchen practices, and to measure the prevalence of Salmonella in eggs available to the UK consumer 1 1 Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (2004) Annual Report, p16-17 6. The egg surveys commissioned by the Agency were: \u00be 2003 UK wide survey of Salmonella contamination in UK produced eggs sold at retail (FSA project - B18007)2 \u00be 2005/6 Survey of Salmonella in non-UK produced shell eggs on retail in the North West of England and London (FSA project - B18012)3 \u00be 2005/7 UK wide survey of Salmonella contamination in eggs used in catering premises (FSA project -B18017)4 Table 1: Overview of Salmonella prevalence reported in FSA egg surveys 2003 UK (n=4,753) prevalence 1 in 290 1 in 30 n/a* *not applicable as eggs are not usually purchased in boxes of 6 for use in catering 7. The 2003 and 2005/07 su rveys confirm that the Salmonella prevalence in UK produced eggs available for use in catering and on retail sale is lower than the prevalence found in the 1991 and 1995/6 surveys. It has remained at the same level (l ess than 0.4%) between 2003 and 2005/6. The non-UK egg survey (2005/06) shows that, depending on the country of origin, the consumer was up to ten times more likely to purchase eggs with Salmonella on them if they we re of non-UK origin. 8. Of the positive samples fr om the 2003 UK retail survey Salmonella was detected on the shell for UK pr oduced eggs indicating a possible environmental contamination event; none of the eggs were contents positive. 9. In the catering egg survey, one of the six positive samples was shell and contents positive, the others we re shell positive. The shell and contents positive egg samp le was UK produced and S. Enteritidis PT4 was found on the shell and in the contents. 2 Food Standards Agency (2004).

In the 2005/06 non-UK egg survey, 10 of the 157 Salmonella positive samples were found to be contents posit ive indicating that some laying flocks were likely to have systemic infection with Salmonella .

The UK retail egg and catering egg surveys show that very few samples were Salmonella positive; with S. Enteritidis PT4 still the prevalent phage type in UK produced eggs w hen compared to other phage types. However, in non- UK eggs other phage types of S. Enteritidis appear to be more prevalent such as PT1. Key findings UK egg survey (2003) 12. All the Salmonella positive samples were obtained from egg shells which may have occurred as a result of random contamination from the production environment. 13. On an England only comparison, t here has been a 3-fold reduction of Salmonella contamination since the 1995/96 survey. This drop is likely to reflect the measures introduced by the UK egg industry to control Salmonella in laying flocks and hen houses. 14. When comparing data from England, the prevalence of S. Enteritidis has fallen sharply since the 1995/ 96 egg survey (from 0.82% to 0.28%). Non-UK egg survey (2005/6 15. The survey provided a measured estimate of Salmonella prevalence in non-UK eggs available at the retail le vel. The majority of the eggs sampled were from Spain therefore this survey did not provide an accurate picture of no n-UK eggs in general. 16. Of the 157 Salmonella shell positive samples found, 10 were shell and contents positive. The estimated prevalence of Salmonella was measured at 3.3% from eggs sold at retail in London and the north west of England. S. Enteritidis was only reco vered from Spanish eggs with nine different serotypes repor ted. The majority of the S. Enteritidis isolated showed resistance to nalidixic acid with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (NxCp L) or resistance to ampillicin (A). 17. The levels of Salmonella found in layer flocks are to be reduced according to set targets at the EU level by 20095. Through this, it is hoped that the Salmonella prevalence in all EU produced eggs should decrease as interventions and controls are put into place. Catering egg survey (2005/7) 18. The majority of the eggs sampled were of UK origin and the prevalence reported was similar to the UK egg survey (less than 0.4%). Six samples of eggs were found to be shell positive for Salmonella of which one was shell and contents positive. 19. Several risk areas were highlight ed in the kitchen practices element of this survey. These included egg stor age at ambient temperature, poor stock rotation, potential for cross- contamination from mixing bulked eggs and the pooling of eggs not int ended for immediate service. In June 2007, ACMSF considered that fu rther food hygiene training and advice to food handlers and catere rs might reduce egg-associated S. Enteritidis infections. Outcomes 20. Following the presentation to ACMSF of the findings from the UK egg survey in 2004, the Committee r equested more information on non-UK eggs and confirmation that egg stam ping was being widely used, to support its work to consider the risks of raw or undercooked eggs1. 21. The Agency has now pr ovided information on eggs available to the UK consumer. The surveys have shown that Salmonella in UK produced eggs remain low; however Salmonella contamination in non-UK 5 European Commission (EC) (2006a) Commissio n Regulation (EC) No. 1668/2006 of 31 July 2006 implementing Regulation (EC) 2160/2003 as regards a Community target for the reduction of the prevalence of certain Salmonella serotypes in laying hens of Gallus gallus and amending Regulation (EC) No 1003/2005. Official Journal European Union L211, 4-8 produced eggs can be high albeit this will depend on the country of origin. 22. Egg stamping was made compulso ry in 2005. This provides information on the production type, count ry of origin and the producer identification code. On-shell egg st amping has helped the consumer to make an informed choice when purc hasing eggs. It also enabled the Agency to effectively perform a survey of non-UK eggs and eggs used in catering premises. Issues for consideration The Agency's current advice on eggs 23. The Agency advises that people in risk groups should only consume eggs that have been c ooked until white and yo lk are solid. When preparing dishes containing eggs, the dish should be cooked until piping hot or until it has reached 70\u00b0 C for 2 minutes. In relation to people outside the risk groups, the Agency recognises that many people like to eat eggs with runny yolks and does not discourage them from doing so. 24. Attached for information at Anne x A is the advice which has been previously provided to caterers. Th is leaflet was first issued in 2002 and requires updating to be in lin e with current legislation. 25. Attached for information in Annex B is the UK egg production, import and consumption figures for 2006. 26. In light of the evidence provid ed in this review paper, and at the recommendation of the ACMSF Work ing Group on Surveillance, the FSA seeks the Committees' view on whether the Agency's egg advice remains appropriate or whether it requires revision.
