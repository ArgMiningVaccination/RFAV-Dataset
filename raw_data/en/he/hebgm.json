Gift Ideas to Clear Away Negative Energy 1) [Singing Bowl](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=639903&clickref=spiritual+healing&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F980190962%2Fsale-end-tonighttibetan-4-hand-beaten) Each bowl has its own pitch, and each pitch is associated with healing a particular chakra. Chakra healing is a spiritual practice which involves healing and balancing the energy of each chakra. A Tibetan Singing Bowl is a great gift for spiritual people who want to balance their chakras and bodily energy. 2) [Clear Quartz Crystal](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=639903&clickref=spiritual+healing&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F941265681%2Fclear-quartz-tower-natural-clear-quartz) Clear quartz is the ultimate spiritual healer. Clear quartz amplifies a person's energy, by absorbing, storing, and releasing it. It helps to balance the entire body and can even help protect the immune system. A spiritual person can sit the crystal near them during meditation or sleep to really absorb that positive energy and cleanse the muddled energy. When looking for clear quartz as a gift idea, they come in all different sizes, shapes, and clarities. You can get it raw, in the shape of a tower, or as a crystal ball. I personally prefer a tower shape, as you can appreciate the clarity of the quartz without being too processed or perfectly formed.

The Himalayan salt lamps generate their own heat and create an ambient, orangey glow. They are generally maintained in a wooden or ceramic base. Supposedly, a Himalayan salt lamp releases negative ions, which can help with cleansing the air and relieving stress or depression. However, scientifically there is no basis for this. That doesn't mean that a himalayan salt lamp can't provide different health benefits for the people who use them. Himalayan salt lamps give off a warm, orange light which has been [proven to help alertness and cognitive brain function](https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/2290-orange-light-helps-thinking). If you're looking for a gift that actually puts off negative ions and cleanses the surrounding air, try one of these [negative ion air purifiers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YN9385D/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07YN9385D&linkCode=as2&tag=wildsimplej07-20&linkId=3cf5232aefd9e36b33171944c5e63e00) instead.

They're a string of beads worn around the wrist, arm, or ankle which is used in meditation practice. Mala beads come in different stones with their own meanings. The [first mala bead necklace here is a more expensive option from Etsy](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=639903&clickref=spiritual+healing&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F900060439%2Fmadagascarian-rose-quartz-mala-necklace), and the [lower mala bead necklace is a less expensive one from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H3BTVJ9/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07H3BTVJ9&linkCode=as2&tag=wildsimplej07-20&linkId=2b26b60f251ea0bf03723e75ad240b09). Mala beads can be used during any kind of meditation to help focus the mind on the words being spoken or chanted. By concentrating on one bead at a time while chanting or counting mantras, it is believed that your intentions will manifest themselves more quickly and successfully. When looking for a set of mala beads, make sure you get something with natural stone or beads (not plastic). These mala beads are made of rose quartz, which is an excellent stone for your fourth chakra, or heart chakra. Rose quartz crystal energy can help with opening our hearts and developing compassion. Some other crystals to consider: moonstone for the femininity and moon's energy, aventurine for abundance, or amethyst for spiritual connection.

There are many different kinds that you can get, but white sage is the most common. Watch that you don't call these sage smudge sticks unless you're Indigenous to North America. Smudging is one of many Native American Traditions that has been culturally appropriated. While smudging itself is a very particular ritual that is sacred to many Indigenous nations, many cultures used herbs to cleanse the spiritual air. Last, white sage is a protected plant, so make sure you're getting it from a trusted source and an Indigenous grower if you can, like the listing above! 7) [Reiki Stones](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=639903&clickref=spiritual+healing&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F774695977%2Freiki-set-usui-reiki-set-clear-quartz) This set of 4 stones helps with the flow of your body's ki (also called qi or chi) and can help a spiritual person clear their chakras.
