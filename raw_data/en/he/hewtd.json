About NettaVet The NettaVet team is developing a line of specialized CBD veterinary and medicinal products for animals. CBD has shown benefits in animals including pain and inflammation reduction, immune system improvement, skin and fur care and cognitive support. NettaVet products will offer a natural, holistic medical alternative for animal care and which we believe may produce therapeutic results for diagnosed conditions such as Idiopathic epilepsy, canine lymphoma and anxiety, without the negative side effects of traditional veterinary medications. CBD is renowned as a very well-tolerated medication and nutraceutical that doesn't produce harmful side effects. In addition, CBD-based products are believed not to damage the kidneys, liver or gastrointestinal system. This business line will synergistically leverage RAMM's pharmaceutical expertise to continue to further the development of its products which will begin being rolled out in 2021.
