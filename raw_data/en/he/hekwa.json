New safety information can be identified through the TGA's ongoing safety monitoring activities or uncovered and submitted by sponsors themselves. Please see below details of some medicines that have recently had safety related updates to their PI. The TGA monitors the safety of medicines marketed in Australia using: [reports of adverse events](https://www.tga.gov.au/safety/safety/safety-monitoring-medicines/overview-how-tga-manages-medicine-adverse-event-reports) - [Risk Management Plans (RMPs)](https://www.tga.gov.au/resources/resource/guidance/risk-management-plans-medicines-and-biologicals)and Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) - reviews of literature - sharing of information with other regulatory agencies - sharing of information with Australian state and territory health authorities. Changes to the PI that result from TGA safety monitoring activities may: - narrow indications - add or modify specific sections, such as: - contraindications - warnings or precautions - use in fertility, pregnancy and lactation - use in special populations - adverse effects. It is important for prescribers and other health professionals to be aware of safety-related PI changes, as they may require you to take actions or do things differently, such as: - counsel patients on identified risks - undertake special monitoring or precautions - in some instances select alternate medications. Significant PI changes are often supported by distribution of a Dear Health Care Professional Letter on the issue, which are produced by the medicine's sponsor and sent directly to health professionals. We will publish a Medicines Safety Update (MSU) article detailing recent safety-related PI updates each month, although this may not include all safety-related updates. We will continue to publish MSU articles for critical safety issues or topics of special interest. The below medicines are generally innovator brands (generic brands may be included in some circumstances). Generic brands containing the same active ingredients as the medicines below are required to align with the safety information in the innovator's PI and will be updated accordingly. To view the full PI for each listing, click on the name of the product in the 'Brand/trade name' column. A 'Summary table of changes' appears at the end of the PI. If the TGA has published any further risk communication, such as a safety alert or stand-alone MSU article, it will be linked to in the 'Safety issue' column. | | Active ingredients | | Brand name Sponsor | | PI updates | | Date of approval | | acamprosate calcium | | Alphapharm Pty Ltd | | 4.6 - Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 4.8 - Adverse effects (undesirable effects) | | 18 July 2023 | | buprenorphine | | Mundipharma Pty Ltd | | 4.2 - Dose and method of administration 4.5 - Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions | | 4 July 2023 | | carvedilol | | Pharmaco Australia Ltd | | 4.4 - Special warnings and precautions for use | | 11 July 2023 | | diltiazem | | Sanofi-Aventis Australia Pty Ltd | | 4.9 - Overdose | | 6 July 2023 | | eliglustat | | Sanofi-Aventis Australia Pty Ltd | | 4.8 - Adverse effects (undesirable effects) | | 23 June 2023 | | erythromycin (as ethyl succinate) | | Alphapharm Pty Ltd | | 4.5 - Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions 4.8 - Adverse effects (undesirable effects) | | 13 July 2023 | | escitalopram oxalate | | Lundbeck Australia Pty Ltd | | 4.8 - Adverse effects (undesirable effects) | | 3 July 2023 | | fluorometholone | | AbbVie Pty Ltd | | 4.8 - Adverse effects (undesirable effects) | | 24 July 2023 | | influenza virus haemagglutinin | | Seqirus Pty Ltd | | 4.8 - Adverse effects (undesirable effects) | | 6 July 2023 | | liraglutide | | Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd | | 4.8 - Adverse effects (undesirable effects) | | 5 July 2023 | | lisdexamfetamine dimesilate | | Takeda Pharmaceuticals Australia Pty Ltd | | 4.8 - Adverse effects (undesirable effects) | | 17 July 2023 | | live varicella vaccine | | Merck Sharp & Dohme (Australia) Pty Ltd | | 4.8 - Adverse effects (undesirable effects) | | 7 July 2023 | | mavacamten | | Bristol-Myers Squibb Australia Pty Ltd | | 4.4 - Special warnings and precautions for use | | 17 July 2023 | | moclobemide | | Viatris Pty Ltd | | 4.4 - Special warnings and precautions for use 4.5 - Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions | | 10 July 2023 | | naproxen | | Atnahs Pharma Australia Pty Ltd | | 4.3 - Contraindications 4.6 - Fertility, pregnancy and lactation | | 22 June 2023 | | onasemnogene abeparvovec | | Novartis Pharmaceuticals Australia Pty Ltd | | 4.4 - Special warnings and precautions for use 5.1 - Pharmacodynamic properties | | 17 July 2023 | | oxycodone hydrochloride | | Mundipharma Pty Ltd | | 4.2 - Dose and method of administration 4.4 - Special warnings and precautions for use 4.8 - Adverse effects (undesirable effects) 4.9 - Overdosage | | 24 July 2023 | | penicillamine | | Alphapharm Pty Ltd | | 4.8 - Adverse effects (undesirable effects) | | 14 July 2023 | | phenylephrine hydrochloride/prednisolone acetate | | AbbVie Pty Ltd | | 4.8 - Adverse effects (undesirable effects) | | 21 July 2023 | | praziquantel | | Bayer Australia Ltd | | 4.4 - Special warnings and precautions for use 4.5 - Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions | | 7 July 2023 | | ravulizumab rch | | Alexion Pharmaceuticals Australasia Pty Ltd | | 4.3 - Contraindications 4.4 - Special warnings and precautions for use 4.5 - Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions 4.8 - Adverse effects (undesirable effects) | | 19 July 2023 | | ropinirole hydrochloride | | Arrow Pharma Pty Ltd | | 4.8 - Adverse effects (undesirable effects) | | 3 July 2023 | | ruxolitinib (as phosphate) | | Novartis Pharmaceuticals Australia Pty Ltd | | 4.4 - Special warnings and precautions for use 4.8 - Adverse effects (undesirable effects) | | 3 July 2023 | | telmisartan/amlodipine | | Boehringer Ingelheim Pty Ltd | | 4.9 - Overdose | | 13 July 2023 | | triptorelin (as embonate) | | Ipsen Pty Ltd | | 4.4 - Special warnings and precautions for use | | 30 June 2023 | | zolpidem tartrate | | Alphapharm Pty Ltd | | 4.8 - Adverse effects (undesirable effects) | | 7 July 2023 What to report?
