Two literature reviews raise doubt about chiropractic benefits. The Annals of Internal Medicine has published a well designed meta-analysis of spinal manipulation for low-back pain. [Assendelft WJ and others. [Spinal manipulative therapy for low back pain. A meta-analysis of effectiveness relative to other therapies](http://www.annals.org/issues/v138n11/abs/200306030-00008.html). Annals of Internal Medicine, 138(11):871-81, June 3, 2003]. Based on randomized controlled trials published up to January 2000 , the authors concluded: - Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) had clinically and statistically significant benefits only when it was compared with either sham manipulation or the group of therapies judged to be ineffective or even harmful. - SMT was no more effective than general practitioner care, analgesics, physical therapy, back school, or exercise in clinical trials. - SMT is very unlikely to be a particularly effective therapy for any group of patients with back pain. - Systematic reviews that provided the basis for national guidelines are partially discordant and did not include the larger high-quality trials that have been published over the previous few years. The authors include Paul Shekelle, MD, PhD who wrote a similar review in Annals of Internal Medicine in 1992 and headed the panel that produced an influential 1991 RAND report. These publications supported manipulation and were warmly greeted by chiropractors. However, the current meta-analysis concluded that more recent trials of spinal manipulation were of higher quality, and that \"advances in meta-analysis methods\" allowed more useful comparisons with other therapies. Indeed, the authors detail their methods of analysis in two pages in the body of the paper and describe their raw data and scoring system in a 13-page appendix. They conclude that \"Spinal manipulation is substantially less effective than previously estimated.\" After the literature search for this meta-analysis was performed, another randomized controlled trial found no relative advantage for chiropractic care [Hurwitz EL and others. [A randomized trial of medical care with and without physical therapy and chiropractic care with and without physical modalities for patients with low back pain: 6-month follow-up outcomes from the UCLA low back pain study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12394892&dopt=Abstract). Spine 27:2193-204, 2002]. The second review focused on randomized controlled trials to study the effectiveness, safety, and cost of acupuncture, massage therapy, and spinal manipulation for back pain [Cherkin DC and others. [A review of the evidence for the effectiveness, safety, and cost of acupuncture, massage therapy, and spinal manipulation for back pain](http://www.annals.org/issues/v138n11/abs/200306030-00011.html). Annals of Internal Medicine, 138: 898-906, 2003]. The authors concluded: \"Preliminary evidence suggests that massage, but not acupuncture or spinal manipulation, may reduce the costs of care after an initial course of therapy.\" In a Wall Street Journal story, both Shekelle and Dr. George McClelland of the ACA predicted that the studies would result in a negative influence on chiropractic coverage. [Rundle R. [Study questions efficacy of chiropractic care](http://webreprints.djreprints.com/762541451608.html). Wall Street Journal. June 3, 2003]. Shekelle questioned whether payers would continue more expensive therapies merely for greater satisfaction rates. Given some indications that massage therapy has a higher satisfaction rate and lower cost than chiropractic (and overall costs), guidelines for back pain may change substantially for many organizations. Even though the review studies were done carefully, chiropractic leaders criticized them and several news reports that they generated. ICA executive director Ronald M. Hendrickson said that his organization is exploring the possibility of Congressional hearings into the use of the media for anti-competitive purposes. In Chiropractic Economics, he stated, \"If the hearing process reveals any hard data on what we suspect, the next step is for the Justice Department to see if there is any violation of the [AMA] injunction.\" [ [Wall Street Journal article refutes benefits of chiropractic](http://www.chiroeco.com/news/wsj-chiropractic.html). Chiropractic Economics. June 2003] ACA President Dr. Daryl D. Wills complained that the study did not take into account the Manga reports. This is a peculiar argument because Manga's analyses did not include the most recent studies and have little credibility outside of chiropractic circles. Wills also claimed that the meta-analysis \"also failed to address the federal government's guidelines on low back problems.\" [ [American Chiropractic Association: New study is further support for safe alternatives to drugs](http://www.acatoday.com/media/releases/060203.shtml). ACA News release June 2, 2003]. This, too, is peculiar because the guidelines to which he referred were published in 1994 and based on almost the same body of literature as the 1991 RAND report. Wills also stated that chiropractic can still fill a niche for back pain by providing a \"safer form of care, without sacrificing any of the benefit.\" In letters to various media, Mills has claimed that chiropractic treatment is safer than nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are capable of producing serious side effects. However, this has not been studied scientifically, and a true comparison would have to take many factors into account: - No prospective randomized trial conclusively demonstrates that chiropractic management reduces the incidence of serious NSAID complications, such as fatal gastrointestinal bleeding. NSAIDs taken at recommended doses for a short time are generally very low-risk for appropriately selected patients\u2014particularly the relatively young not on corticosteriods, anticoagulants, alcohol or tobacco and without a history of ulcers or severe comorbid illness. - Many patients continue to take NSAIDs while undergoing spinal manipulation. Moreover, spinal manipulation can frequently cause an exacerbation of pain, which might cause some patients to increase or initiate NSAID therapy. [Ernst E. [Prospective investigations into the safety of spinal manipulation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11239743&dopt=Abstract). Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, 21(3): 238-242, March 2001]. - Herbal recommendations seem to be common among DCs; some remedies have actions similar to NSAIDs, while others directly affect bleeding per se. A recent set of [reports by the North American Spine Society](http://www.spine.org/herbal_supplements.cfm)includes an 18-page reference chart listing approximately 70 herbs with their uses, potential side effects, and (known) potential interactions. - While side effects of low-back manipulation appear to be very uncommon, some chiropractic back-pain patients also receive neck manipulation, which entails additional risks. - Manipulation is much more expensive thatn NSAID treatment. So if both are equally effective, manipulation would be much less cost-effective. Arnold Schwarzenegger advocates chiropractic, considers politics. Arnold Schwarzenegger will star in Warner Brothers' \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machine,\" opening July 2. He is also considering running for governor of California, perhaps in a special election this fall if a recall campaign facing current governor Gray Davis is successful. [AP staff.

Schwarzenegger has regularly supported chiropractic, particularly the ICA, even after the crisis at Life University. Schwarzenegger signed a chiropractic adjusting table as part of an auction for the World Federation of Chiropractic, and was [photographed with Sid Williams, D.C. and Carl Cleveland III, D.C](http://www.chiroweb.com/arnold). Schwarzenegger broadly endorses chiropractic, while disparaging other healthcare professionals: It is truly one of the few professions that really helps people in a straightforward way with no monkey business, like some of the other professions promise to help, but this chiropractic is the real thing. . . . Chiropractic is about natural, preventive health care. . . . Whenever I have a problem\u2014or even if I don't have a problem\u2014and I go to a chiropractor, my problems are gone for a long time.

Accreditation guidelines require that students see at least 25 new patients at the clinic. Students with no previous ties to the community in which their school is located often have difficulty reaching this number.

Published by the Institute for Social Research at Ohio Northern University, the survey was underwritten in part by Dynamic Chiropractic and in part by Foot Levelers, two parties with a large financial interest in a broad, unified market of chiropractors. The survey found: - Nearly 90% of chiropractors favor keeping the term \"vertebral subluxation complex\" term (and apparently paradigm) rejecting a limitation of chiropractic to musculoskeletal conditions. - Nearly 80% of DCs teach a relationship between \"subluxations\" and internal health. - Large majorities were in favor of homeopathy, thermography, and herbs in the parameters of chiropractic practice, while nearly half of chiropractors were in favor of colonics. - Chiropractors were split roughly 50/50 with regards to \"prescribing\" over-the-counter medicines, and prescribing privileges for \"muscle relaxants, corticosteriods, etc.\" The large numbers of chiropractors favoring broad inclusion of nontraditional, nonmanual therapies suggests a loss of focus on chiropractic's claim to uniqueness, perhaps as a result of economic desperation. Chirobase maintains a [referral directory](http://www.chirobase.org/13RD/chiroguidelines.html) for practitioners who eschew the \"subluxation\" concept, thermography, homeopathy, and a long list of other dubious practices.

Question I am a physical therapist with a master's degree. I have recently been considering going back to school to learn chiropractic. However, after reading much of your site, I am quite dismayed about what you report. I am only interested in the chiropractic approach to treating musculoskeletal problems, so that I can combine the two professions and perhaps offer my patients a wider variety of techniques. I have taken a few osteopathic-based courses on muscle-energy techniques for the spine. Even there, however, I find people diagnosing everyone with sacral torsion, rotated innominate, or rotated vertebrae. And it appears that inter- and intra-examiner reliability, even among experienced practitioners, is poor. Do you think it wise to pursue a degree in chiropractic? If not, do you have any ideas where I can get further training in back injuries and manipulative techniques? Thank you so much for your time and your tenacity in sticking with a scientific medical approach. Answer Have you considered going back to a university-based school of physical therapy for a Doctor of Physical Therapy (D.P.T.) degree? This would allow more direct access to your services in private practice where you could use any type of physical treatment method, including manipulation. Many physical therapy schools teach manipulation as well as with mobilization. I have also read about postgraduate classes in manipulation taught by physical therapists. I agree that it would be a good idea to combine use of spinal manipulation with mobilization and other physical therapy modalities. The spinal manipulation taught in chiropractic schools could certainly be useful. But I would not recommend that you attend a chiropractic college unless postgraduate training in manipulation, offered by physical therapists, is not available. The practice of chiropractic has so long been associated with quackery and cultism that it raises an element of suspicion. Furthermore, the \"spinal adjustment\" used by chiropractors to correct \"subluxations\" as a method of \"restoring and maintaining health,\" based on the scientifically rejected vertebral subluxation theory, is not the same as spinal manipulation used to restore normal movement in the spine. Only a few of the chiropractic colleges offer adequate training in the treatment of musculoskeletal problems. Most train their students to adjust the spine to correct alleged subluxations. Some even lack training in physical therapy modalities, rejecting any treatment method other than spinal adjustments. Some properly-limited, science-based chiropractors do a good job treating back pain. Most of them include use of physical therapy modalities. Such chiropractors disagree with chiropractic colleagues who claim that spinal adjustments are effective in treating a host of organic ailments, including such things as asthma and ear infection. I strongly recommend hat you avoid the controversy surrounding the practice of chiropractic. Most chiropractors still cling to the theory that vertebral subluxations cause disease or ill health. The stigma of being associated with such practitioners can be disconcerting and counterproductive. It would be much better for you to obtain a D.P.T. degree and then take postgraduate training in manipulation taught by physical therapists. Before you make a decision, read some of the articles on Chirobase, particularly my article \"How Chiropractic Subluxation Theory Threatens Public Health.\" _________________ Dr. Homola is a second-generation chiropractor who has dedicated himself to defining the proper limits on chiropractic and to educating consumers and professionals about the field.

Although some of what Rosner says was factual, he either ignored or attempted to obfuscate information about chiropractic's shortcomings. To highlight his deception, I have inserted comments in bracketed bold-faced red text. As far as I know\u2014and despite my advance warning that chiropractic proponents would present misinformation\u2014the IOM \"CAM\" committee did not invite anyone to present accurate information about chiropractic. My dear colleagues: I want to thank the Institute of Medicine (IOM) for two reasons; first, for inviting my testimony this afternoon, but especially for carrying what I believe is the unfulfilled work of both the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine and the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine an essential step forward by calling us to the table today. [The [White House Commission report](http://centerforinquiry.org/quackwatch/political-activities/WHC/00.html) was an atrocity written by \"CAM\" proponents.] I also want to offer my strongest assent and congratulations to the Institute for its most pertinent and insightful assessment of American healthcare\u2014first, in its forthright reporting of medical errors in 1999 [1], second, in providing one of the most equitable definitions among the many offered for \"primary care [2],\" and finally, for having published two years ago the most candid and uncompromising assessments of U.S. healthcare, Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century [3]. [FCER actually accept IOM's definition of primary care but promotes one of its own.] This last publication courageously concluded that \"the American healthcare system is in need of a fundamental change,\" especially because \"what is perhaps most disturbing is the absence of real progress toward restructuring health care systems to address both quality and cost concerns. . . .\" [3] [Rosner acted as though medicine's possible shortcomings might somehow make chiropractic look good in comparison. Nothing could be further from the truth.] We now know that superficial makeovers will not suffice. The IOM indicated that entirely new patterns of thinking will be necessary to escape this dilemma. \"Our present efforts,\" suggested Mark Chassin, \"resemble a team of engineers trying to break the sound barrier by tinkering with a Model T Ford. We need a new vehicle, or perhaps many new vehicles. The only unacceptable alternative is not to change.\" [4] [Chiropractic still clings to its century-old theory that spinal problems (\"subluxations\") are the underlying cause of ill health and that spinal adjustments can improve health.] With these facts in mind, I come to you as the Director of Research of a nonprofit foundation that in its 60-year history has provided over $10M for pilot projects and support for postgraduate study in areas pertaining to the theory and practice of chiropractic healthcare. I am both joyful and dismayed. [FCER does not function like most research foundations. It's primary activity is not research but public relations. One of its stated research strategies has been to \"use research data to position chiropractic in the minds of people who will decide which services will be used and which won't.\" In a fundraising letter describing clinical trials it has funded, it stated that they were \"all intended to demonstrate the effectiveness of chiropractic treatment.\" (Under the rules of science, studies are supposed to test whether methods work, not to prove that they do.) In addition to funding research, FCER also issues booklets, a newsletter, and pamphlets that promote chiropractic care based on subluxation theory. For example, its 1993 \"Ask Your Doctor\" brochure titled \"What does chiropractic care have to do with wellness\" states: At the core of chiropractic philosophy is the fact that the brain and nervous system control and mediate the functions of the human body. The influence of the nervous system on the rest of the body is altered when the nerves that exit the spine at the vertebrae are crowded, stretched or otherwise irritated by spinal misalignments and fixations. These conditions result in pain at the primary site, but can also affect other areas where the injured nerves travel. For instance, nerves that exit the spine between the shoulder blades travel to the stomach. This is how the brain mediates and controls stomach function. If these nerves are irritated at the level of the spine where they exit, they can cause interference with stomach function. A person may enter the chiropractic office with middle back pain, but through the course of treatment, stomach symptoms\u2014which the individual may have thought were unrelated\u2014improve. Not all stomach problems are caused by this type of nerve interference, but it is an extremely common contributing factor, and in many cases a primary factor. A 1988 FCER pamphlet called \"How to Put and Keep Stress in Its Place\" states: \"Your doctor of chiropractic can adjust any possible spinal misalignment (which can cause stress), remove neuromuscular tensions, lessen nerve cell fatigue and improve circulation.\" Does Rosner believe that statements like these reflect science-based thinking?] Joyful, because in terms of achieving chiropractic research goals from a scientific standpoint, I can only share with you the greatest satisfaction if not outright wonder. Until about 30 years ago, chiropractic research was considered in some quarters to be something of an oxymoron, \"falsely conceived and rather text] . . . that should never have been accepted, on a subject that should never have been chosen, by [those] who never have attempted it.\" A depiction of chiropractic researchers? No, a description of George Gershwin's now immortal opera, Porgy and Bess, by the music critic Virgil Thompson. Despite the fact that chiropractic has existed as a formal profession worldwide for over a century, most of what we consider to be rigorous, systematic research in support of this form of healthcare has emerged in just the past two-and-a-half decades. In 1975, Murray Goldstein of the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke concluded that there was insufficient research to either support or refute chiropractic intervention for back pain and other musculoskeletal disorders [5]. [Not quite. Goldstein was talking about spinal manipulation, not chiropractic.] Nearly 30 years later, we now can review with great satisfaction how back pain management has been assessed by government agencies in the U.S. [6], Canada [7], Great Britain [8], Sweden [9], Denmark [10], Australia [11], and New Zealand [12]. All of these reports are highly positive with respect to spinal manipulation. [But not necessarily chiropractic care. The U.S. report [6] did not mention chiropractic in its text. The New Zealand report [12] stated that chiropractors were skilled manipulators but should not function as primary care practitioners. The report further said: (a) Chiropractors do not provide an alternative comprehensive system of health care, and should not hold themselves out as doing so; and (b) The issuing of any publicity material which suggests that chiropractors provide a comprehensive health care service or should be consulted ahead of medical practitioners for general health problems should be banned.] Now we could argue that chiropractic care, at least for back pain, appears to have vaulted from last place to first as a treatment option. [Hardly. Although I believe that spinal manipulation can relieve appropriately selected cases of acute low-back pain, the research demonstrating effectiveness is skimpy and controversial.] In just the last 20 years, at least 73 randomized clinical trials involving spinal manipulation have made their appearance in the English-language literature. [The majority of these studies were not performed by chiropractors and do not reflect what takes place when a typical patient consults a typical chiropractor.] Even more amazing is the fact that the majority of these have been published in general medical and orthopedic journals. These trials address not only back pain, but also headache and neck pain, the extremities, and a surprising variety of nonmusculoskeletal conditions. [Yes, and the further they go from low-back pain, the more negative the results.] When spinal manipulation is employed, the majority of these trials have shown positive outcomes with the remainder yielding equivocal results. There are 43 trials addressing acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain with 30 showing us that manipulation is more effective than control or comparison treatments and the remaining 13 reporting no significant differences between treatment groups. None of these studies appears to have produced a negative outcome and none indicate that manipulation is any less effective than any comparison intervention [13-14]. [Both of these reviews are chiropractic puff-pieces.] Other major accomplishments - The appearance of a variety of favorable systematic literature reviews; [15-17] - The establishment of the first federally funded chiropractic Center for Excellence at Palmer University by NIH's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine in 1997; - The publication of the Headache Report by Duke University last year; [18] - The securing of over $10M in federal grants within the past decade when in 1991 this accomplishment was considered to be unlikely; [19] - The establishment of chiropractic services within the military; and - The historic signing of Public Law 107-135 on January 23 of this year mandating the establishment of a permanent chiropractic health benefit within the Department of Veterans Affairs health care system. Even more remarkable is the efficiency of chiropractic research. When compared to the NIH budget of nearly $20B, the $10M investment in federal funds is substantially less than a tenth of 1 percent, which makes it less than a rounding error or, as a couple of wags have offered in the past\u2014obviously, the federal government must believe in alternative medicine because it has given chiropractic researchers homeopathic doses of money with which to work. [I am not aware of any chiropractic research that has led to any significant improvement in patient care. Most studies of chiropractic diagnostic and therapeutic systems have found that they don't work. Studies of spinal manipulation have had mixed results and do not necessarily reflect what most chiropractors do.] If you were to sum up my feelings about how far chiropractic research seems to have come, I'd have to resort to a pithy quotation from a baseball hero that many of us grew up with: Yogi Berra. When asked as manager of the New York Yankees whether one his star players exceeded his expectations during a banner season, Yogi's remark was, \"I'd say he's done better than that!\" So then why am I dismayed? Let me share with you just one example out of many which typify our problem. A recent report on workers' compensation claimants from Florida is particularly galling. It pointed out that for industrial musculoskeletal injuries, chiropractic care demonstrates lower costs and shorter durations in both reaching maximal medical improvement and return to work. Incredibly, over the same 7-year period, the frequency of specific musculoskeletal related cases treated by chiropractors in 1999 was only 25% of the level seen in 1994 (the date that managed care was introduced into the Florida workers' compensation system) [20]. [Chiropractors point with pride to selected worker's compensation studies that show that chiropractic care got workers back on the job sooner and for less cost than did medical care. But these studies were not scientifically controlled for the severity of the injuries and not all workmen's compensation studies have been favorable to chiropractic.] In other words, just when access of workers to chiropractic care should be increased to result in significant direct and indirect cost savings (as previously shown by Manga [21], we are witnessing precisely the opposite. Chiropractic care seems to be getting squeezed out of the system. Look at the neighboring state of Georgia, in which chiropractic workers' compensation cost recoveries were just 0.8% of the benefits disbursed to physicians in 1997 and 1998 [22,23]. Again one suspects the exclusion of chiropractic services. [There's no reason to postulate that \"discrimination\" is at work. Insurance companies favor what is cost-effective and try to curb what is not.] Is this paranoia? Not when you consider that, despite the wealth of its research information with such little funding, it has been necessary time and time again for the chiropractic profession to seek both legislative and legal recourse to achieve its earned recognition with the most meticulous of research, ironic in light of a recent report which shows that chiropractic practices in at least one locale can demonstrate that a higher percentage of its treatments are evidence-based than found in medical interventions [24]. [This may be most preposterous statement I have ever seen made by a chiropractic official. The study to which he refers involved a review of the records of 180 consecutive patients seen by one Spanish chiropractor. The study's author tabulated whether the treatment for the chief complaint described in the records appeared to be supported by published reports about the alleged value of spinal manipulation for musculoskeletal problems. The author concluded that \"chiropractic care\" was evidence-based 68.3% of the time, which he claimed was higher than various other studies had reported for different medical specialties. The design of the study was absurd. But even if it had been valid, it would be absurd to suggest that the work of a single Spanish practitioner work reflects what most chiropractors do in the United States. Three well-designed surveys indicate that the vast majority of American chiropractors do quacky things such as homeopathy, applied kinesiology, neck manipulation for back problems, and inappropriate prescribing of dietary supplements.] Yet we still endure the opinions of past editors of such trusted sources as The New England Journal of Medicine who have debunked alternative medicine as \"unscientific,\" often basing their own theories upon the same type of anecdotal evidence that they condemn in various branches of non-orthodox medicine [25,26]. Add medical journal articles on cerebrovascular accidents of questionable scientific validity [27-32] plus an onslaught of negative press regarding the safety of manipulation [33-38] that could only be described as a petri dish of fetid disinformation of the first magnitude. This is downright embarrassing, almost vaudeville, when you consider that medical practitioners have been shown to have failed validated competency examinations in musculoskeletal medicine [39-41]. Instead of abiding by this nonsense, we need to level the playing field instead of the patient! In an ideal world, scientific debate would be carried on at a high level and documented evidence would be enthusiastically accepted and incorporated into guidelines and practice. In the real world, unfortunately, there have been too many examples of resistance such that chiropractic healthcare would probably not even have existed had such lawsuits as the Wilk case against the AMA for restraint of trade not been brought to bear [42]. [In 1987, federal court judge Susan Getzendanner concluded that during the 1960s \"there was a lot of material available to the AMA Committee on Quackery that supported its belief that all chiropractic was unscientific and deleterious.\" The judge also noted that chiropractors still took too many x-rays. However, she ruled that the AMA had engaged in an illegal boycott. She concluded that the dominant reason for the AMA's anti-chiropractic campaign was the belief that chiropractic was not in the best interest of patients [42]. Rosner implies chiropractic progress was retarded by alleged AMA \"discrimination\" that took place many years ago. The simple fact is that chiropractic research was (and still is) hampered by the widespread chiropractic belief that \"chiropractic works\" and does not need to be proven.] Now the profession faces discrimination in reimbursement practices in the insurance industry requiring two more ongoing lawsuits headed by the American Chiropractic Association against both Trigon Blue Cross Blue Shield and the Health Care Financing Administration's Medicare Part C regulations [43]. [In April 2003, the [Trigon suit](http://www.chirobase.org/08Legal/trigon2.pdf) was dismissed in a ruling in which the judge concluded that the insurance company had not \"discriminated\" but had taken appropriate steps to try to control chiropractic costs.] How has the insurance industry and the AMA responded to attempting to control the costs of healthcare? By advocating such legislation as the Help Efficient Accessible, Low-cost, Timely Healthcare Act of 2003 designed to cap pain and suffering awards to patients suing for malpractice [44]. In light of the IOM's own data on iatrogensis and medical errors [2,3] as well as more recent reports that tells us that efforts to improve upon these errors have not been forthcoming and that their mandatory reporting has actually been resisted by doctors and hospitals [45], this seems to be an exceptionally cynical and ill-conceived response to the needs of the American public. So is its ignoring the real culprit of runaway costs: runway prescription drug spending [46]. Realizing already documented [21,47] cost savings by allowing patients access to alternative means of healthcare, including chiropractic, seems far more efficient as well as effective. [There is no reason to believe that increasing insurance coverage for \"alternative\" health care will lower costs. The studies he cites are not about chiropractic. Reference 21 is about inpatient medical care. Reference 47 is about osteopathic care.] Chiropractic interventions which manifest tangible results, a commitment to research and documentation of the highest recognized quality [15-17], high patient satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness should not have to continually resort to legislation and costly legal action to continue to survive. In this presentation I request that the IOM display a commitment to working with us in order to halt the spread of both discriminatory policies which impede access to healthcare and the propagation of disinformation in the media that can only be described as an epidemic of alarming proportions. [Discrimination means \"treatment or consideration based on class or category rather than individual merit; partiality or prejudice.\" Anti-chiropractic feelings are generated by chiropractic's shortcomings.] By commitment I am specifically referring to adequate as well as qualified chiropractic representation in matters of healthcare policy and decision-making as we attempt to address the leading problems in America's healthcare. [Chiropractic, with its limited scope, has little or nothing to contribute to solving \"the leading problems in America's healthcare.\"] All too often this effective seat at the table has been denied as part of the discriminatory pattern I referred to earlier. Skyrocketing health insurance premiums and the known shortages of healthcare professionals can both be addressed with better access to chiropractic healthcare. [Neither data nor logic support the idea that better access to chiropractic care is needed or can lower insurance premiums.] References - Kohn LT, Corrigan JM, Donaldson M, eds.

The simple truth, however, is that the default rates signify that the profession itself is in deep trouble. Background Information The Federal Health Education Loan (HEAL) program was enacted under Public Law 94-484 and took effect in October 12, 1976. In 1981, Public Law 97-35 made chiropractic, health administration, and clinical psychology students eligible to borrow up to $12,500 per year for four years. In 1992, Congress raised the the maximum graduate students could borrow in federal loans from $11,500 to $18,500. ... The default rate for student loans is much higher among chiropractors than it is among graduates of any other health profession, Chiropractic leaders would like you to believe this situation exists because the loan program is flawed and reflects \"discrimination\" against their profession. The simple truth, however, is that the default rates signify that the profession itself is in deep trouble. Background Information The Federal Health Education Loan (HEAL) program was enacted under Public Law 94-484 and took effect in October 12, 1976. In 1981, Public Law 97-35 made chiropractic, health administration, and clinical psychology students eligible to borrow up to $12,500 per year for four years. In 1992, Congress raised the the maximum graduate students could borrow in federal loans from $11,500 to $18,500. Of this amount, $8,500 is available as a subsidized [Stafford Loan](http://www.ed.gov/prog_info/SFA/StudentGuide/2000-1/stafford.html) on which the government pays interest while the student is in school. The remaining $10,000 is available through an unsubsidized Stafford loan, on which interest starts to accrue immediately. Borrowers obtain these loans through private lenders or directly from the federal government. Private lenders aggressively market their own loan programs to graduate students typically with rates pegged to the 91-day Treasury bill plus 2.4 to 3.25 percentage points while one is in school and rising to 2.85 to 3.5 points after graduation [1]. From fiscal year 1978 through 1998, the HEAL program insured loans to over 156,000 borrowers and was a big help to chiropractic schools and their students. But as time went on, it became clear that the default rate of chiropractic graduates was very high. By 1991, taxpayers had lost an estimated $3.6 billion on bad student loans, and the Bush Administration recommended dropping chiropractic from the HEAL program [2]. Congress did not do this [3], but increasing debt (from $10 million in 1987 to $42 million in 1992) stimulated the Department of Health and Human Services to release the names of defaulters with the hope that public humiliation would pressure them into paying. Many media outlets responded by portraying the defaulters as \"deadbeats, but some defaulters were portrayed sympathetically. In St. Charles, Missouri, for example, the local newspaper issued these contrasting reports: The U.S Attorney's office is looking for two \"deadbeats\" in St. Charles County who have defaulted on more than $200,000 in student loans. \"We consider them deadbeats, even though they are professionals and graduates of chiropractic colleges,\" said Eric Tolen, assistant U.S.attorney [4]. A former chiropractor turned high school teacher who is deep in debt to the government because of student loans said his experiences have taught him valuable lessons. \"I'm in my boat, and I want others to stay out of it. It almost like a prison sentence \u2014 a lifelong prison sentence.\" The prison sentence Scott Pinkham referred to is the debt he owes the US government for student loans he used to finance his education at Logan College of Chiropractic in Chesterfield, Missouri. Pinkham said he passed his chiropractic board exam in September 1987 and became partners with a man who was still a student and whose father was willing to finance the start-up of a practice. \"This gentleman financed my practice on the premise that I would get an office up and running so that his son could them join me as a 50-50 partner upon graduation,\" Pinkham explained. Pinkham said the practice opened in July 1988, but that after his partner graduated in April, 1989, the partnership fell apart. \"After practicing together for one month, father and son suddenly decided the practice could not support two doctors. At that point, the father called in my loan for $120,000. My family and I were devastated, and despite several more attempts to make it in practice, I have never recovered financially.\" Since he was hired as a teacher at Francis Howell North in 1991, Pinkham said he has received numerous awards, including Teacher of the Year for 1992-1993. \"A deadbeat would not pour his heart and soul into his family, his neighbors and his students,\" Pinkham said [5]. The HEAL program ended in 1998. Today, chiropractic education is funded by a privatized version called ChiroLoan, which began in 1992 [6]. As far as I know, its default rates have not been publicly revealed. I have inquired several times but received no data. Recent Statistics The Department of Health and Human Services maintains a [list of defaulted HEAL borrowers](https://www.defaulteddocs.dhhs.gov/) which identifies the defaulters and provides several statistical analyses. As of February 6, 2003, the site included the following figures: | | School |Number||Amount| |Life Chiropractic College||189||$ College - West||59||3,672,346| of Chiropractic||59||3,908,723| of States Chiropractic College||31||2,687,279| |Northwestern College of Chiropractic||20||1,240,465| | | | | 859 |73,087,922| | | |314||38,803,551| | | |197||21,706,051| | | |142||19,385,099| | | |45||5,451,778| | | |39||3,270,570| | | | | 33 | | 2,314,453 | | |26||1,295,607| | | |9||654,372| | | |4||319,593| | | |1||33,671| | | | | 1,641 | | 166,325,667 The data indicate that the percentage of chiropractic students defaulting vastly exceed the percentage of students from other disciplines. Other data indicate that, over the years, the percentages of defaulters who had declared bankruptcy or were reportedly disabled were also much higher among chiropractors [7]. Efforts at \"Spin Control\" In 1993, ACA executive vice president Jerome McAndrews, D.C.,charged that the loan crisis reflected discrimination against chiropractors and issued a special report in response to the federal government's crackdown of HEAL defaulters [8]. According to McAndrews, the reasons for the high default rate were: - Higher tuition costs at chiropractic colleges; medical schools have lower tuition because of research grants. - Licensing exams for chiropractors are given out of phase with graduation dates. - Medical students are eligible for the Health Professions Student Loan whereas chiropractors are not. - Medical doctors have developed large group practices. New medical graduates have better opportunity for employment. Chiropractors, on the other hand, have to develop lines of credit and open solo practices. - Chiropractors have faced \"the long term consequences of medicine's illegal boycott.\" ACA believes that despite the chiropractic legal victory, chiropractic's reputation has been harmed thus it takes a chiropractor longer to build a successful practice. - Chiropractors have to buy expensive x-ray equipment (total cost of $36,000) when chiropractors could have easily referred to hospitals for such services. None the above reasons involves \"discrimination\": - Chiropractic tuition rates are high because when student loans became available, the schools raised their rates accordingly. Life University, for example, tripled its tuition rate between 1990 and 1995 [9]. Moreover, the cost of attending medical school is generally higher than the cost of going to chiropractic colleges. - The timing of licensing exams represents a failure of the chiropractic community to welcome new graduates. Some chiropractors believe this is done for anti-competitive reasons. As noted by Robert Ward, D,C.: A number of state boards . . . make it impossible for many graduates to become licensed until after the grace period has expired, effectively nullifying the loan grace period. Policies like these greatly increase the likelihood of financial failure and default, and apply tremendous pressure to the new doctor to do anything, however, unethical, to generate income. In the absence of a clear rationale for the existence of restrictive policies by state boards, it is likely that such policies exist solely to protect the business interests of established doctors by restricting competition from an influx of new graduates [10]. - Medical students may be eligible for different loan options because after graduation they can meet the needs of underserved areas. They can prescribe medications, give inoculations, deliver babies, perform surgery, and provide many other health services that are needed more than spinal manipulation. Moreover, chiropractors who are philosophically opposed to standard medical care, including medications and vaccinations, are even more unsuitable for primary-care practice. Thus the lack of federal subsidy is due to chiropractic's shortcomings and not bias within the medical community. - Most chiropractors are solo practitioners because chiropractors vary widely in philosophy and practice styles. - The \"We haven't recovered from the AMA boycott\" argument is another ploy used to justify chiropractic failures. The AMA's antichiropractic campaign took place more than 25 years ago when chiropractic was completely mired in quackery. The average doctor's opinion of chiropractors is based on their disdain for \"subluxation\" theory and the bad experiences their patients report to them. - Most hospitals and private radiologists are willing to provide x-ray examinations for chiropractic patients. But many chiropractors prefer to buy their own machines because (a) x-ray exams can be very profitable and (b) medical radiologists will report as normal many films on which chiropractors see \"subluxations.\" Some chiropractic leaders have charged that the HEAL program was flawed because it initially did not include a credit check [6]. Chiropractic Incomes Are Falling Most insurance companies don't knowingly pay for \"maintenance care\" in which the chiropractor keeps the patient coming back to have \"subluxations\" diagnosed and treated. Managed-care programs, which strive to eliminate unnecessary care, try to avoid practitioners who provide unnecessary services. Chiropractic schools have been turning out more new chiropractors than are needed. As a result, the field is overcrowded, inflation-adjusted chiropractic incomes have been falling, and new graduates can have a very difficult time earning a living. In 1994, Stephen Seater, executive director of the Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research, stated: On an average day, the FCER staff talks to about 50 practicing chiropractors. These doctors are telling us more and more frequently that their practices are down, some by as much as 50%! And time and time again, the villain is managed care. In areas where managed care is growing rapidly, it is systematically cutting out most chiropractors [11]. In 1997, Michael Pedigo DC, a former president of the International Chiropractic Association and the ACA stated: Are there too many DC's in today's market? The primary reason we hear more doctors expressing concerns that the colleges are graduating what they consider to be too many doctors is that most practices across the country are seeing fewer patients and being paid less per visit than just a few years ago. I hear figures like the average practice is down 30 to 40% and income is down 40 to 50%. Adding to that new doctors graduating with $80,000-$100,000 in student loans and inability to join some managed care groups until they have been in practice for three years, and you have an environment that is even more difficult for these new doctors to succeed [12]. [Data from the U.S. Department of Commerce](http://www.census.gov/svsd/sasann/view/health.pdf) indicate that the total reported net income for chiropractic offices and clinics rose from $6.56 billion in 1992 to $7.68 billion in 1998, which is about 2.8% per year. Since the number of practicing chiropractors has been increasing, and taking inflation into account, these figures show that real chiropractic income has been decreasing steadily. In 2001, Donald Petersen, editor of Dynamic Chiropractic, wrote: The number of phone calls and emails we receive from new DC's is on the increase. Many are questioning why they can't seem to be able to make a living in their chosen profession. They graduate with high hopes, but also with the heavy burden of a substantial student loan debt, and are facing a very challenging health care marketplace. . . . Are these recent graduates just whining about the challenges that have always faced new DC's or are they serious issues that threaten the growth and success of our profession? Are we avoiding talking about the tough issues? If so, how much is our avoidance hurting us? [13] The Bottom Line The chiropractic loan default rate signifies an immense problem. The chiropractic profession is overcrowded; average chiropractic income has been falling; and new graduates who wish to practice ethically may be unable to earn a living. Yet chiropractic leaders suggest that loan defaults reflect individual failures rather than problems that are professionwide. I believe that the main chiropractic trade organizations do not wish to admit the truth because it would undermine their public relations efforts. The bottom line is that students who are considering chiropractic as a career should think seriously about doing something else. References - Berman N. Facing 20 years of debt.

The American Chiropractic Association (ACA) likes to pretend that the scope of chiropractic is very broad and that its members are qualified to play a major role in preventive public health. On April 7, 2003, in line with this objective, the ACA issued a a news release through PRNewswire that provided tips for lifestyle and dietary changes and suggested that chiropractors be used for nutritional advice. Here is the ACA release with my comments added in boldface red type. American Chiropractic Association Responds to Epidemic of Obesity in the United States ACA is Official Partner in National Public Health Week The American Chiropractic Association ACA and public health officials across the country are using National Public Health Week, April 7-13, to call attention to the prevalence of obesity among Americans. The ACA warns that the number of Americans who are overweight or obese is steadily increasing at epidemic proportions, and immediate intervention is critical to the health of our country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC has indicated that the rate of obesity has increased in all 50 states over the past year. Additionally, childhood obesity has reached its highest level in 30 years. Contributing to these figures is the fact that Americans are exercising less and eating less healthy foods than ever before. According to ACA President Daryl D. Wills, DC, \"We need to call attention to this life-threatening epidemic.\" In observance of National Public Health Week, the ACA offers the following nutrition tips to help combat this growing problem: [Most of the tips are not relevant to weight-control. The news release seems to be an attempt to create visibility for ACA. The American Public Health Association Web site invites organizations to become National Public Health Week partner by filling out a [one-page application](http://www.apha.org/NPHW/sponsors/partnership.pdf) which indicates how the applicant and the project can publicize each other.] Lifestyle Changes * Get active! Try to exercise for 20-30 minutes at least 3-4 days a week. [Appropriate exercise can provide many health benefits and should be part of any weight-control program. Several major organizations have issued research-based guidelines that depend on the individual's goals. The ACA's advice is simplistic and less than ideal for weight-control purposes.] * Eat out more sparingly. Since food preparation methods in restaurants often involve high amounts \u2014 and the wrong types \u2014 of fat and sugar, give preference to home-cooked food. [Moderation of fat and sugar intake is part of standard medical/nutritional advice. Eating at home does not guarantee that the diet will be more healthful.] * Limit your intake of alcohol, and quit smoking. [This is standard medical advice.] Drinking alcohol excessively and/or smoking can hinder your body's ability to absorb nutrients from your food. [Nutrient shortages related to alcoholism are usually related to inadequate food intake rather than poor absorption. Smoking does not hinder absorption of nutrients.] Dietary Changes * Eat more raw foods. Cooking and canning destroys much of the nutrition in foods that can be eaten raw. [This statement is misleading because food processing has little impact on overall diet. Only a few nutrients are heat-sensitive, and these are readily obtainable from the average American diet.] * Select organically grown foods when possible. They have lower amounts of toxic elements than foods that are not grown organically. [Except for price (organics are higher), the differences between \"organic\" and conventionally produced foods are insignificant ( [1]). Neither contains high levels of \"toxic elements.\"] * Eat whole foods. Much of the nutrition available to us in fruits and vegetables can be found in its skin, so don't peel it off and throw it away, unless it has been waxed or dyed. [Is the ACA suggesting that people should eat the skins of banana, citrus fruits, pineapples, and melons? With apples and potatoes, some vitamin C would be wasted if the peel is not eaten, but the amount would be irrelevant in most people's diet. Some people prefer to peel apples because undigestible carbohydrates in an under the skin can cause flatulance. The only dyed foods I can think of are maraschino cherries and some pistachio nut shells.] Stay hydrated! Drink eight to ten 8-ounce glasses of water a day. [The amount of water people need depends on their activity level, environmental conditions, and various other factors. For most people, thirst is an adequate guide to an appropriate fluid intake ( [2]), but most people will not benefit from adding two quarts of water per day to their diet. The ACA's advice also fails to take into account that foods and other beverages contain water.] * Consume 25-30 grams of fiber per day. [The Institute of Medicine's recommended daily intake for adults up to age 50 is 38 grams for men and 25 grams for women. For those over 50, because of decreased food consumption, it is 30 grams for men and 21 grams for women ( [3]).] Whole-grain breads and cereals, beans, nuts and some fruits and vegetables are good sources of fiber. For Vegetarian Dieters * Don't rely on fruits and vegetables at the expense of grains and legumes. The repetition of fruits and vegetables can narrow your food choices, thus narrowing the variety of nutrients you consume. [This advice is silly. First, legumes (peas and beans) are vegetables. Second, in contrast to science-based food guides, this item provides no information about the number of servings of fruits, vegetables, or grains. Third, very few people who eat vegetarian diets are inclined to skimp on grains.] * Tiredness, malaise, and anemia can be signs of deficiencies. [True, but they are more likely to be caused by other things.] Those who have been on a vegetarian diet for some time should have their B12 and iron levels checked at least once a year. [It would be more prudent to discuss how to prevent B12 and iron deficiency than to check for it. In addition, the only vegetarians who are at risk for B12 deficiency are those who avoid all animal products.] * Consume fortified foods or take supplements to obtain the nutrients you no longer get from animal-based products. [True, but it would be more prudent to identify the nutrients that are at risk. Since the list is a short one, the ACA could have identified the nutrients in their press release. Why do you suppose they did not?] * Before eliminating animal products from the diet, it is important to get information about how to do it right. Children, pregnant and breast-feeding women, and people recovering from illness should consult their doctor e.g. DC, MD, DO. [It would be wise to be well-informed. However, registered dietitians (RDs) are probably the most qualified professionals to consult, and MDs and DOs are generally more qualified than DCs.] Dr. Wills explains that, \"Unfortunately, consumers are not sure where to turn for nutritional advice. Many people do not realize that, as part of their training, doctors of chiropractic learn overall wellness and healing, with proper nutrition playing a significant part in that approach.\" [This statement is untrue. Chiropractors have very little training in clinical nutrition, and their textbooks and journals say very little about science-based nutrition ( [4](#4)). Most chiropractors who give nutrition advice make inappropriate recommendations for supplements.] In fact, the ACA has released its vision for a wellness-based model of health care that stresses disease prevention rather than disease management. For more information on ACA's wellness initiative, visit: [http://www.acatoday.com/about/policies.shtml#99.](http://www.acatoday.com/about/policies.shtml#99.) [Except for \"spinal hygiene\" (whatever that is), the long lists under the heading \"Wellness Model consist mainly of standard medical topics. I am not aware of any data showing that consulting a chiropractor for such advice is advisable or cost-effective.] References [Barrett S.] [\"Organic\" foods: Certification does March 29, 2003 [Valtin H.] [\"Drink at least eight glasses of water a day.\" Really?

Since I have been going to the chiropractor, my ears have been popping a lot, every time I swallow. This is not normal for me. Could this be the result of chiropractic treatment? What should I be doing to fix it? Answer I don't know of much that a chiropractor could do for a TMJ problem other than use physical therapy modalities to relieve symptoms. Neck manipulation cannot possibly be helpful. Several conditions can cause or mimic a TMJ problem. Arthritis can develop in a worn TMJ joint. Bone tumors, or inflammation in the inner ear or in a parotid gland, and so on, may have to be ruled out. If there is popping and cracking when you open and close your mouth or when you chew, the disk cartilage lining the TMJ joint might be fragmented or displaced. Surgical correction might be necessary if the joint locks or is painfully restricted. MRI or x-ray studies with dye injected into the joint space might be needed to detemine if a disk can be repositioned or if it must be removed. In rare cases, severe malocclusion caused by fractures or congenital deformity in the jaw joints can cause TMJ problems, requiring the care of an orthodontist. Poorly aligned teeth or ill-fitting dentures may cause jaw-clenching or tooth-grinding habits that inflame jaw muscles and contribute to the development of arthritis in the jaw joint. Most TMJ problems cause restricted jaw movement with pain and popping sounds in the area of the ear, especially when chewing or when moving the lower jaw. A TMJ joint might pop or cause pain when you swallow because of muscle action, but when swallowing seems to affect your ears, it's a good idea to see an otolaryngologist. Most TMJ symptoms resolve by themselves. If jaw pain with restricted movement lasts longer than three months, you could consult a dentist or an oral surgeon for a definitive diagnosis. ____________________ Dr. Homola is a second-generation chiropractor who has dedicated himself to defining the proper limits on chiropractic and to educating consumers and professionals about the field.

I do not have insurance and cannot afford such an expensive exam. One day, I received a flyer in the mail from a chiropractor who was offering x-rays and a complete examination for only $27 dollars, so I went to see him. The chiropractor examined me, made some x-rays, and told me to come back the next day for the results. All the tests came back positive for nerve damage. He showed me the x-rays and told me that I had no L4 and L5 disc spaces. My C1 and C2 were also bad but not as bad as L4 and L5. This did not surprise me because I was told six years ago that my dizziness was caused by loss of blood supply to my brain because of neck problems. I have learned to pamper my neck, and I know what and what not to do to avoid getting like that again. I have also been having weakness in my arms, which I thought was happening because of my lower back problems. The chiropractor told me that my back was off center in the L4 and L5 area, and that my neck was not curved like it is supposed to be. He showed me a video and started me on a schedule of adjustments, every day the first week, three times the second week, twice the third week, and then once a week till whenever. I have just completed my first week. I am now experiencing numbness in my little finger and in my ring finger, which I did not have before. The chiropractor said this was normal and would pass as soon as there is more spacing between my bones. Should I continue seeing him? Should I continue getting neck adjustments? My lower back seems to be doing better, and I am not having the really bad pain I normally have. But this might be because I have not been doing my normal activities for about a week. Answer It is never a good idea to respond to free or discounted exams offered by chiropractors. Such ads may propose that a humanitarian effort is being made to \"help more people who need care\" when the real purpose is to build a larger practice by soliciting patients. You should discount any advice offered by such chiropractors. Because you have a history of dizziness that has been attributed to circulatory insufficiency caused by neck problems, you should not have neck manipulation if there is a possibility that vertebral arteries are involved. Better safe than sorry. Lower back problems have nothing to do with loss of the normal neck curve. Attempts to change the curve of the cervical spine by manipulating your neck could cause problems, such as the numbness in your fingers. The weakness in your arms and numbness in your fingers are not good signs and should be brought to the attention of an orthopedist or a neurologist. In fact, you should seek a thorough medical evaluation whether you believe you can afford it or not. Perhaps you can find a local clinic where fees are based on ability to pay.

Imagine for a moment that you were asked to write an article about a city. You walk down the main street and notice that the buildings on one side of the street are attractive and well maintained, but the buildings on the other side look like they are falling apart. Instead of giving the whole picture, you write only about the attractive side. Suppose further that you realize that half of the buildings on the attractive side are made of cardboard. But instead of commenting on their construction, you report that they look attractive. Even if every word you write is true, the report does not really describe the city. Meeker and Haldeman have done something similar in writing their article about chiropractic. Although most of what they say is \"factual,\" they either ignore or attempt to obfuscate information about chiropractic's shortcomings. To highlight their deception, I have inserted comments in bold-faced red text. - Chiropractic: A Profession at the Crossroads of Mainstream and Alternative Medicine William C Meeker, DC, MPH; and Scott Haldeman, DC, PhD, MD, FRCP(C) - Annals of Internal Medicine 136:216-227, 2002. Chiropractic is a large and well-established health care profession in the United States. In this overview, we briefly examine the development of chiropractic from humble and contentious beginnings to its current state at the crossroads of alternative and mainstream medicine. [Chiropractic is not like a freely moving car whose driver can decide which of two roads to take by merely turning the steering wheel a few degrees. Chiropractic is chained to its past by a preposterous basic theory that is an integral part of its identity, and its practitioners cannot agree among themselves about what they are doing or should be doing. Moreover, its road to mainstream care is blocked by the mainstream requirement that practitioners follow science-based standards.] Chiropractic has taken on many of the attributes of an established profession, improving its educational and licensing systems and substantially increasing its market share in the past two decades. [Data from three major studies suggest that the percentage of Americans using chiropractors has changed little during the past ten years. Telephone surveys reported by Eisenberg found that 10% of respondents said they had used a chiropractor in 1991 and 11% said they had used a chiropractor in 1997. But a more comprehensive survey estimated that only 3% of Americans had used chiropractors during the previous year.] The public increasingly uses chiropractic largely for spinal pain syndromes and appears to be highly satisfied with the results. Of all the so-called alternative professions, chiropractic has made the largest inroads into private and public health care financing systems and is increasingly viewed as an effective specialty by many in the medical profession. [The authors provide no data on how medical doctors regard chiropractors. Most medical doctors regard manipulation as a potentially useful option for treating acute low-back pain but still regard chiropractors generally as quacks.] Much of the positive evolution of chiropractic can be ascribed to a quarter century-long research effort focused on the core chiropractic procedure of spinal manipulation. [This statement is true but neglects to discuss the negative views based on chiropractic quackery or the fact that most of the research was not done by chiropractors.] This effort has helped bring spinal manipulation out of the investigational category to become one of the most studied forms of conservative treatment for spinal pain. Chiropractic theory is still controversial, but recent expansion in federal support of chiropractic research bodes well for further scientific development. [Chiropractic theory \u2014 the idea that spinal misalignments (\"subluxations\") are the primary or underlying cause of ill health \u2014 is controversial only among chiropractors. The scientific community regards it as a delusion.] The medical establishment has not yet fully accepted chiropractic as a mainstream form of care. [\"Not yet\"? It never will fully accept the quackery that is integral to chiropractic theory and practice.] The next decade should determine whether chiropractic maintains the trappings of an alternative health care profession or becomes fully integrated into all health care systems. [Chiropractic cannot become \"fully integrated\" because its basis is delusional.] Chiropractic is the largest, most regulated, and best recognized of the professions that have traditionally functioned outside of mainstream medical institutions and, in the new lexicon, have fallen into the category of \"complementary and alternative medicine.\" It is unique in the United States as the most widely disseminated indigenous U.S. system of healing. Its steadily increasing acceptance and use by the public and payers indicate that chiropractic is no longer the \"marginal\" or \"deviant\" profession it was once considered to be [(1)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R1-10). [Data on public acceptance are very sparse. Insurance coverage is largely the result of laws that force third-party payers to pay even though they would prefer not to do so.] According to surveys of patients seeking alternative care, chiropractors are used more often than any other alternative provider group [(2)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R2-10), and the satisfaction with chiropractic care is very high [(3, 4)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R3-10). The number of chiropractors is growing: The current number of 60 000 is expected to reach 100 000 by 2010 [(5)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R5-10). [The market appears to be saturated. Chiropractic incomes appear to have been falling steadily for more than ten years.] Although some observers suggest that the profession may be entering the health care mainstream [(6, 7)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R6-10), chiropractic remains a young profession; in 1995, it celebrated its 100th anniversary. Until the mid-1970s, chiropractic was considered to be outside mainstream medicine, often an outcast, and most chiropractors viewed themselves as differing in philosophy and practice from other health care practitioners [(8)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R8-10). During the past two decades, there has been a marked change in the manner in which chiropractic is viewed, not only by mainstream medical practitioners [(9)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R9-10) and institutions [(10, 11)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R10-10) but also by members of the profession itself [(12)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R12-10). [Reference 9, which summarizes various surveys, is a very peculiar report. Most of the surveys were done in foreign countries, and not enough were done to establish any trend. Moreover, although these surveys supposedly measured physician attitudes, many of the surveyed practitioners said they practiced chiropractic, which suggests that they were chiropractors rather than medical doctors.] Examining the factors that led to this change in attitude and the legitimization of chiropractic as a method of treatment and as a profession, as well as the conflicting emotional discussion that has accompanied these changes, is an interesting and informative exercise in health care sociology [(13)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R13-10). [The data in references 9-11 do not necessarily support the assertion that chiropractic has been legitimized.] The changes in the chiropractic (and medical) profession are, however, still in the transitional phase, and the acceptance and even the future role of chiropractic in the overall health care system remain controversial [(14, 15)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R14-10). The Origins and History of Chiropractic Chiropractors have designated 18 September 1895, when Daniel David Palmer reportedly gave his first spinal adjustment, as the origin of the chiropractic profession; however, spinal manipulation is one of the oldest and most widely practiced healing methods. References to spinal manipulation, and even the term subluxation, can be traced back as far as Hippocrates and Galen [(16)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R16-10), and manual and manipulative procedures have been depicted in the art and writings of most ancient cultures. [Neither Hippocrates or Galen used the word \"subluxation\" the way chiropractors do.] Although manipulation has been part of orthopedic medical practice for centuries, most nonmedical practitioners of spinal manipulation in the 19th century were \"bonesetters\" who had learned their skills primarily by apprenticeship and observation [(17)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R17-10). The early and middle years of chiropractic were dominated by charismatic and authoritarian figures who often disagreed with one another. Many of the early schisms around the theory and scope of practice from this period still exist in some form [(9, 17)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R9-10). Daniel David Palmer, who originally practiced as a lay magnetic healer, is credited with professionalizing the practice of spinal manipulation. He integrated popular natural health and scientific models of the day to present a unique theory of chiropractic. [This statement is pure baloney. There was nothing scientific about what he did. His theory was more akin to religion than to science.] He did this by incorporating the concept of an inherent healing ability of the body, which he named \"innate intelligence,\" into concepts drawn from contemporary knowledge about anatomy and physiology. He eschewed the use of drugs and surgery as unnatural invasions to the body and focused on what he perceived as normalizing the function of the nervous system as the key to health [(17)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R17-10). From the beginning, chiropractors understood that professional self-regulation and independent legal status were crucial to survival. [Translation: Chiropractors realized that they could not survive if they were held to science-based standards. So their only hope for survival was to free themselves from outside regulation.] This stormy history of the first century of chiropractic includes many milestones on the march to professionalization. [\"Professionalism\" usually implies something about standards. Chiropractic is not noted for high standards.] Although chiropractic originated in the United States (the primary training ground and theoretical inspirational source for chiropractors), it took less than 10 years for chiropractors to immigrate and begin practice in other countries. In 1923, the province of Alberta in Canada became the first jurisdiction to license chiropractic outside of the United States; in 1939, the canton of Zurich in Switzerland was the first to license the profession outside of North America. Today, chiropractors are licensed and regulated in many countries throughout the world [(18)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R18-10) and are permitted to practice in most countries, pursuant to general law. Chiropractic in Health Care One indicator of chiropractic mainstreaming is the steadily increasing use by patients in the United States, which has tripled in the past two decades from about 3.6% according to a 1980 survey [(19)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R19-10) to an estimated 11% according to a 1997 national random telephone survey [(2)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R2-10). This translates to an estimated 190 million patient visits to chiropractors in a year, or about 30% of visits to all complementary and alternative practitioners [(2)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R2-10). One recent survey of family physicians and chiropractors in North Carolina [(20)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R20-10) found that two thirds of the medical physicians felt \"moderately\" or \"very\" informed about chiropractic. Furthermore, 65% admitted referring patients to chiropractors, and 98% of chiropractors made routine referrals to physicians. [The meaning of the 98% figure is not clear. The chiropractors surveyed were members of the American Chiropractic Association. Nonmembers may have very different referral patterns.] Payments for chiropractic care historically came directly from patients' pockets until chiropractic services were included in Medicare in the 1970s. In the past few decades, chiropractic has been included in a substantial proportion of private and public insurance plans, all state workers-compensation systems, and all forms of managed care (including health maintenance organizations). More than 50% of health maintenance organizations and more than 75% of private health insurance plans now offer chiropractic services [(21)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R21-10). Under order of the U.S. Congress, the military health care system has initiated a series of demonstration projects to investigate the feasibility of providing chiropractic care to military personnel. Chiropractic Training and Licensure From many proprietary schools hastily established during the first part of the 20th century, a stable number of chiropractic training institutions have emerged in the United States. Unlike in the United States, where all but one college are privately funded, chiropractic education in Australia, South Africa, Denmark, one college in Canada, and two in Great Britain is provided at established government-sponsored universities and colleges. Most colleges in the United States are accredited by the Council on Chiropractic Education, an agency certified by the U.S. Department of Education. Each college requires at least 4 academic years of professional education before students can qualify for licensure examinations. A minimum of 60 units of prescribed college-level courses (increasing to 90 units by 2002), mostly in the sciences, is required before admission to chiropractic college. Approximately 50% of students enter chiropractic training with a baccalaureate degree. A recent study described U.S. chiropractic curricula as an average of 4820 classroom and clinical hours, with about 30% spent in the basic sciences and 70% in clinical sciences and internship [(22)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R22-10). Medical school curricula average about 4670 hours with a similar breakdown. Compared with medical students, chiropractic students spend more hours in anatomy and physiology but fewer in public health. Both programs have similar hours in biochemistry, microbiology, and pathology. Chiropractic curricula provide relatively little instruction in pharmacology, critical care, and surgery but emphasize biomechanics, musculoskeletal function, and manual treatment methods. Medical education has more than twice as many hours in actual clinical experience but 1000 fewer hours in didactic and workshop-like clinical courses. [Translation: Whereas medical students see large numbers of sick patients, chiropractors covering many of the same subjects attend lectures and read about medical care. Moreover, chiropractor typically enter practice after four years of coursework in which they have limited or no exposure to problems outside of their limited scope. Most medical doctors have 3-4 more years of additional specialty training before entering practice.] All chiropractic colleges maintain busy training clinics that deliver chiropractic care in settings similar to typical chiropractic practice. [This statement is misleading. In many schools, lack of real patients forces students to recruit healthy people as patients in order to meet minimal accreditation standards. Moreover, in the largest chiropractic college (Life Chiropractic College), students were taught to avoid differential diagnosis and to diagnose \"subluxations\" in every patient.] Specialty training is available in 2- to 3-year postgraduate residency programs in radiology, orthopedics, neurology, sports, rehabilitation, and pediatrics. [The paragraph falsely implies that medical and chiropractic educational programs are similar in depth and quality.] Coursework leads to eligibility for accredited specialty board competency examinations, which confer \"diplomate\" or \"certified\" status. [The required coursework is not compatible to medical specialty training either in depth or in scope. Chiropractic pediatrics is completely illegitimate.] Forty-six states either recognize or require passage of examinations administered by the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners in the areas of basic science, clinical science, and clinical competency before granting a graduate a license to practice. Most states also require annual proof of continuing education credits for ongoing license renewal. [The CME course approval standards are very low.] Chiropractic Health Care and Practice Characteristics Chiropractic is an evolving health profession with functions, values, traditions, and training institutions similar to those of other professions. [Similar in form, perhaps, but very different in substance and validity.] As envisioned by its founder, chiropractic was to be a revolutionary system of healing based on the premise that neurologic dysfunction caused by \"impinged\" nerves at the spinal level was the cause of most \"dis-ease\" and that spinal manipulation (adjustment) removed the interference to a full and healthy expression of life. Modern chiropractic theory and practice have moved away from the original monocausal theory, and research is gradually redefining the nature of the discipline and its education. [\"Modern chiropractic theory,\" if it exists, is double-talk that attempts to cling to \"subluxation\" theory while pretending to have abandoned it. The actual reality is that chiropractors cannot agree among themselves about what they believe or should believe.] Many still think \"chiropractic\" is synonymous with \"spinal manipulation,\" but as described below, this is only partially accurate. [Many chiropractors are engaged in homeopathy, bogus muscle-testing procedures, hair analysis, inappropriate recommendations for dietary supplements, and other forms of quackery.] With the advent of the category \"complementary and alternative medicine\" (CAM), chiropractors themselves are divided about how to define the profession; many do not want to be termed CAM practitioners [(23)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R23-10). Chiropractors have many of the attributes of primary care providers and often describe themselves as such [(24)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R24-10). [In so doing, they use a definition that differs from that of other health-care disciplines. Chiropractors who do this use the term \"primary care provider\" when they mean portal of entry practitioner.] Others point out that chiropractic has more of the attributes of a limited medical profession or specialty, akin to dentistry or podiatry [(1)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R1-10). [This is the correct viewpoint, but chiropractic leaders are afraid that if they cannot have primary-care status, patients in managed care programs will not be able to see them without referral from a medical doctor.] This is an ongoing internal and external debate affected by dynamic health industry forces. Spinal Manipulation: The Chiropractic Adjustment The core clinical action that all chiropractors agree upon is spinal manipulation. Chiropractors much prefer the term spinal \"adjustment,\" reflecting their belief in the therapeutic and health-enhancing effect of correcting spinal joint abnormalities. [This passage refers to the belief that spinal manipulation can enhance general health. This belief is false. Why don't Meeker and Haldeman note that?] Dozens of adjusting \"techniques\" exist, and discussions about their relative merits make up much chiropractic academic discourse [(25, 26)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R25-10). The procedure in its broadest definition describes application of a load (force) to specific body tissues with therapeutic intent. This load, which has traditionally been delivered by hand, can vary in its velocity, amplitude, duration, and frequency, as well as anatomic location, choice of levers, and direction of force. [The variation is enormous. What Meeker and Haldeman refer to as variation in \"anatomic location\" includes systems, for example, whose practitioners adjust the upper neck vertebrae no matter where in the body the patient's problem is located.] Although \"spinal manipulation\" is traditionally associated with \"chiropractic\" (chiropractors deliver >90% of the manipulations in the United States [ [27](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R27-10)]), chiropractors also provide many other treatments and counseling services. Physical therapies such as heat, cold, electrical methods, and rehabilitation methods are common [(28, 29)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R28-10). Chiropractors usually suggest therapeutic exercises and general fitness recommendations to most patients, and give advice to many patients about nutrition, vitamins, weight loss, smoking cessation, and relaxation techniques [(30)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R30-10). [Meeker and Haldeman fail to mention that the vast majority of chiropractors who give \"nutrition advice\" make inappropriate recommendations for dietary supplements.] Many chiropractors use other forms of CAM, with emphasis on massage, acupressure, and mineral and herb supplements [(23)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R23-10). [The supplement and herb recommendations are almost always inappropriate.] Chiropractic Case Mix Studies confirm that most patients go to chiropractors for musculoskeletal problems: about 60% with low-back pain, and the remainder with head, neck, and extremity symptoms [(28, 31)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R28-10). Approximately one third of all patients who seek professional care for low-back pain consult chiropractors in a primary health care role [(32-34)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R32-10). Furthermore, about half of the patients seeking chiropractic care have chronic symptoms [(31, 35)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R31-10). Only a small number, typically fewer than 2% to 5%, seek care for other conditions. Recent studies have also documented that a minor proportion of patients visit chiropractors for general health concerns, prevention, and a feeling of well-being; they often receive standard health advice, most often with regard to physical fitness and nutrition [(35-37)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R35-10). [The idea that chiropractors routinely give standard health advice is preposterous. One third strongly oppose immunization, chiropractors receive very little training in science-based nutrition, and the majority who give nutrition advice engage in inappropriate testing (such as hair analysis) and/or make inappropriate supplement recommendations. Reference 36 states that 97% of patients coming for \"maintenance care\" received \"adjustments/manipulation,\" the average number of recommended visits for maintenance care was 14.4 visits per year, and the total revenue represented an estimated 23% of practice income. Recommendations for periodic spinal examinations and adjustments are not \"standard health advice.\" ] Diagnostic and Assessment Methods The approach used in chiropractic training and practice for clinical diagnosis is similar to that of all health care disciplines: a history, physical examination, and specialty-specific assessments [(25, 38)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R25-10). [The scope and quality of training varies considerably from one chiropractic school to another, but the average quality is far below that of medical schools.] The Council on Chiropractic Education specifies that these basic clinical competencies must be taught in all accredited institutions, and chiropractors are expected to differentiate mechanical musculoskeletal problems from visceral abnormalities that may present with a similar clinical picture [(29)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R29-10). Chiropractic practice guidelines developed by the profession rate history taking, physical examination, and periodic reassessments of progress as \"necessary\" attributes of good practice [(39)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R39-10). [Large percentages of chiropractors engage in diagnostic practices that have no scientific validity. Implying otherwise is downright dishonest.] By using job analysis concepts, the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners has provided the most thorough description of chiropractic practice [(28)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R28-10). Chiropractors rated \"extremely important\" the knowledge needed to arrive at a diagnosis on the basis of information gathered from a patient's history and physical, neurologic, and orthopedic examinations. [Yes, and 43% use applied kinesiology, in which problems throughout the body are diagnosed by placing substances in the patient's mouth (or elsewhere) and testing the strength of patients' muscles. And the vast majority of diagnostic tests that are unique to chiropractic are either unsubstantiated or have been studied and found to be invalid.] In most states, chiropractors have the statutory right and obligation to render a medical diagnosis, especially within their scope of customary and legal practice. Patients with diagnoses not amenable to chiropractic care are routinely referred [(20)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R20-10). [The extent to which this is done has not been extensively studied.] Chiropractors' use of advanced diagnostic tests is generally low, reflecting the typical nature of the musculoskeletal caseload [(29)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R29-10). The main exception is plain-film radiography, which has been traditional in chiropractic ever since its development at the beginning of the 20th century. Much training time is spent on the technique and interpretation of musculoskeletal radiographs [(22, 40, 41)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R22-10). In regard to radiographic examination, the job analysis survey indicated that chiropractors \"frequently\" obtain radiographs for new patients to determine abnormality; they \"sometimes\" obtain radiographs to determine instability or joint dysfunction; they \"frequently\" determine the possible site and nature of a manipulable subluxation; they \"frequently\" perform radiography on a patient whose condition is deteriorating or who is not responding to care; and they \"rarely\" obtain radiographs to monitor a patient's progress. [The authors neglect to mention how often chiropractors do inappropriate x-ray examinations.] Chiropractors consider knowledge of normal radiographic anatomy and of radiographic interpretation and diagnosis to be \"extremely important\" [(28)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R28-10). Indications for radiography are hotly debated in chiropractic circles, but use appears to be declining over time [(42)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R42-10). The use of radiography may also vary substantially by geographic region. A practice-based study comparing chiropractic and physician practices for patients with back pain in Oregon found that 26% of patients of both provider groups had radiography [(43)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R43-10). [The study did not indicate why the x-rays were obtained, what x-rays were obtained, or whether obtaining them was appropriate. ] Carey and colleagues [(4)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R4-10) found higher rates of use in North Carolina: 67% for chiropractors and 72% for orthopedists. Of note, since the inception of Medicare 30 years ago, chiropractors had been mandated to obtain radiographs in order to be reimbursed for care. Only after persistent legislative activity has this provision finally been changed [(44)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R44-10). The Chiropractic Clinical Encounter and Patient Perceptions Chiropractors use the information from the case history and examination to ascertain the patient's state of health and to form a diagnostic impression, with additional studies obtained as needed. [A substantial minority of chiropractors pay very little attention to the patient's history or standard physical findings. Rather, they rely on bogus tests to find \"subluxations.\"] Focal joint, muscle, and soft tissue examinations are usually performed to determine the potential utility of spinal manipulation and other interventions. These usually include palpation, assessing the range and quality of joint motion, and probing for tenderness and inflammation. On the basis of the findings, the chiropractor chooses a treatment plan and estimates prognosis. Essentially, patients may receive a trial of chiropractic care, be referred for co-management, or be referred to an appropriate specialist. The profession has developed detailed consensus guidelines for quality for most aspects of case management [(39)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R39-10), and these are didactically and clinically modeled in accredited chiropractic institutions. [The guidelines are not as well developed as the authors imply, and many chiropractors flatly reject them anyway. Moreover, this paragraph deliberately omits mention that many chiropractors recommend lifelong periodic care from birth onward to detect and correct \"subluxations.] The clinical encounter tends toward a high-touch, low-technology health model with more concern for the person than the disease. [No well-designed study has demonstrated that chiropractors focus on the person rather than the ailment. The authors fail to mention that many chiropractors focus on the spine rather than the person.] Chiropractors believe in the inherent healing ability of the body and communicate the hope of healing to patients. [The \"inherent healing power of the body\" includes homeostasis, immune responses, and various other mechanisms that medical science has elucidated. Nothing chiropractors do has been shown to enhance the body's \"inherent healing power.\"] Spinal manipulation and other forms of touching care require that a level of trust develop between the patient and the chiropractor. Repeated visits allow a relationship to flourish that is often used to communicate on a social and psychological level as well as about biological implications of care [(45)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R45-10). [The relationship can also be used to brainwash patients into coming for periodic care that has no proven value.] One recent essay opined that much of chiropractic's success and perhaps its most important contribution to health care might concern this patient-physician relationship [(7)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R7-10). [Chiropractors have contributed nothing.] Analyses from anthropologic and sociologic perspectives have suggested that treatment by a chiropractor, especially for many patients with chronic pain, can generate a sense of understanding and meaning, an experience of comfort, an expectation of change, and a feeling of empowerment [(46, 47)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R46-10). The hands-on and compassionate \"can do\" clinical behavior of the typical chiropractor seems to be concrete, reassuring, and immediately satisfying. Observational studies [(3, 4)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R3-10) and randomized trials [(48)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R48-10) leave little doubt that chiropractic patients are very satisfied with their management. [Satisfaction is not the same thing as effectiveness.] Chiropractic Theory and Research Throughout the short history of chiropractic, the profession has had the difficult task of justifying a treatment partially rooted in quasi-mystical concepts to a skeptical mainstream medical and scientific community. Confounding this problem has been the fact that pain, especially chronic musculoskeletal pain, remains something of a scientific enigma [(49)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R49-10). A 1975 National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke conference, \"Research Status of Spinal Manipulative Therapy,\" pointed out the lack of any substantial research to justify claims made by chiropractors or any other practitioner of manipulation [(50)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R50-10); by doing so the conference galvanized a quarter century-long research effort. [Research has increased, but I don't know of any evidence that the conference \u2014 which I attended \u2014 was responsible. It might also be pointed out that chiropractic research appears to have very little effect on chiropractic practice.] Focus of Research Two broad categories of research have been pursued: 1) clinical outcomes in randomized clinical trials and observational studies and 2) basic science efforts attempting to understand the biological mechanisms of spinal manipulation. For this report, we supplemented our own exhaustive reference collections of randomized clinical trials of spinal manipulation with additional searches of MEDLINE, MANTIS, CHIROLARS, and the Cochrane Collaboration Library. We tracked citations and manually searched relevant journals to verify that the list was as complete as possible. We made no attempt to find finished unpublished clinical trials or review non-English-language reports. To date, at least 73 randomized clinical trials of a broadly defined spinal manipulation procedure can be found in the English-language literature. Most trials have been published in general medical and orthopedic journals (for example, British Medical Journal, Journal of the American Medical Association, Spine). Nineteen papers were published in the chiropractic peer-reviewed literature (for example, Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics). Most first authors have medical degrees, and 23 papers were written by chiropractors. Authors did not necessarily publish in the literature of their profession. While publication bias cannot be ruled out, there is no evidence of it in this information. Most of these studies have been conducted on patients with low-back, neck, and head pain, and a few have examined other conditions. The clinical trials include placebo-controlled comparisons, comparisons with other treatments, and pragmatic comparisons of chiropractic management with common medical management. Forty-three randomized trials of spinal manipulation for treatment of acute, subacute, and chronic low-back pain have been published. Thirty favored manipulation over the comparison treatments in at least a subgroup of patients, and the other 13 found no significant differences. No trial to date has found manipulation to be statistically or clinically less effective than the comparison treatment. Eleven of the low-back pain trials included a placebo group; 8 of them showed an advantage to manipulation [(125)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R125-10). Eleven randomized, controlled trials of spinal manipulation for neck pain have been conducted; 4 had positive findings and 7 were equivocal. Seven of 9 randomized trials of manipulation for various forms of headache were positive. In most of the randomized, controlled trials of manipulation for musculoskeletal pain, the positive effect sizes appear to be clinically and statistically significant but not dramatic, leaving room for various interpretations. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses conducted in the early to mid-1990s made cautiously positive or equivocal statements about the effectiveness of manipulation for low-back pain, neck pain, and headache, and called for higher-quality studies [(27, 125-129)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R27-10). Using formal consensus processes, in 1995 the Quebec Task Force on Whiplash-Associated Disorders concluded that spinal manipulation had at least \"weak cumulative evidence,\" and recommended that a short regimen of spinal manipulation may be used as a therapeutic trial for neck pain [(130)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R130-10). In 1994, the U.S. Agency for Health Care Policy and Research similarly concluded that spinal manipulation was safe and effective for acute low-back pain, with a strength of evidence level of \"B.\" This agency reviewed all clinical trials available at the time and found no other treatment to have stronger evidence, although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs received the same \"B\" rating [(131)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R131-10). A 1997 systematic review of manipulation for low-back pain concluded [(132)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R132-10), in contrast to previous opinions [(27, 128, 131)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R27-10), that evidence was sufficient to recommend manipulation for chronic back pain but that the evidence for acute back pain was weak. The most recent systematic review [(133)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R133-10) used a slightly different method of analysis, taking into account study design, quality, and strength of evidence; these authors concluded that there was moderately strong evidence of a short-term benefit of manipulation for both acute and chronic back pain. They found insufficient evidence for or against the effectiveness of manipulation for sciatica. However, a recent trial found that manipulation for patients with sciatica related to disc herniation was better than chemonucleolysis in the short term and equivalent to that therapy at 12 months [(95)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R95-10). A recent quantitative review found only equivocal evidence for the benefit of traction, exercise, and drug therapies for sciatica [(134)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R134-10). The heterogeneity of patients with spinal pain, the lack of definitive diagnoses, and the indications in some trials that subgroups of patients appear to respond better to manipulation than others have further highlighted the need to understand the underlying physiologic and psychological mechanisms of pain and disability. The design of rigorous clinical experiments of treatment efficacy for approaches that include strong physician-patient interactions and \"hands-on\" therapy has been challenging, posing the question of a strong psychological effect of chiropractic treatment. Surprisingly, spinal manipulation is one of the most studied treatments for back pain [(56, 132)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R56-10). All manipulation trials, however, have had to contend with design and execution weaknesses that need to be addressed in future studies. The treatment of disorders not directly related to the musculoskeletal system by manipulation has been supported mainly by clinical experience and case reports. In the past few years, randomized clinical trials for primary dysmenorrhea and premenstrual syndrome [(121)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R121-10) have been completed, with variable results. Two systematic reviews, one on extant trials at the time [(135)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R135-10) and a recent one on asthma sponsored by the Cochrane Collaboration [(136)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R136-10), concluded that the results do not argue convincingly for or against the utility of spinal manipulation for these kinds of conditions. [Meeker and Haldeman fail to note that there is no scientifically plausible reason to believe that manipulation is effective for treating any non-musculoskeletal problem.] Biological Rationale Chiropractors direct spinal manipulation to a dysfunctional joint \"lesion\" known as a subluxation. This is characterized as a form of joint strain or sprain with clinically associated hypomobility, malalignment, local and referred pain, inflammation, and muscle tension [(137)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R137-10). [Chiropractors cannot agree among themselves what a \"subluxation\" is. Many chiropractors regard it as a something that interferes with the body's \"vital force.\"] Subluxation in the chiropractic context primarily connotes a functional and not necessarily an anatomic entity. [\"Subluxation in the chiropractic context\" also includes a \"spiritual entity.\" The phrase \"functional and not necessarily anatomic\" means that some chiropractors think subluxations are visible on x-rays and others think they are not.] At least five mechanical and neurologic mechanisms have been proposed. [It is completely senseless to propose neurologic mechanisms to explain an entity that has not been defined.] Chiropractic theory has held that subluxation and manipulation can have important physiologic effects: increased range of joint motion [(147, 148)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R147-10), changes in facet joint kinematics [(149)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R149-10), increased pain tolerance [(150)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R150-10), increased muscle strength of motoneuron activity proprioceptive behavior in -endorphins [(154)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R154-10) and substance P [(155)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R155-10). A biomechanical picture of manipulation is beginning to emerge from studies on the forces involved and the resultant kinetics and kinematics [(156, 157)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R156-10). [This chiropractors view what they are doing.] Risks of Spinal Adjustments and Manipulations The topic of complications from spinal manipulation has been controversial [(126, 158, 159)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R126-10). Nonserious side effects of manipulation may consist of localized discomfort, headache, or fatigue that resolves within 24 to 48 hours [(160)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R160-10). The more serious reported complications are the cauda equina syndrome from lumbar manipulation and cerebrovascular artery dissection from cervical manipulation. The apparent rarity of these accidental events has made it difficult to assess the magnitude of the complication risk. No serious complication has been noted in more than 73 controlled clinical trials or in any prospectively evaluated case series to date. [One reason for this may be that the type of neck manipulation that poses the greatest cerebrovascular risk may not be used by the practitioners who are most interested in participating in research.] Serious complications from lumbar spinal manipulation are extremely rare, estimated to be 1 case per 100 million manipulations [(27)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R27-10). For cervical manipulation, the risk for a cerebrovascular accident has been calculated by various authors to range from 1 in 400 000 [(161)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R161-10) to between 3 and 6 per 10 million manipulations [(126)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R126-10). The figures have been primarily based on retrospectively collected single case reports [(126, 158)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R126-10) and unsubstantiated practitioner surveys [(161, 162)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R161-10). One retrospective cohort study examined the incidence of cerebrovascular accidents after manipulation [(163)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R163-10). It covered the experience of 99% of the practicing chiropractors in Denmark from 1978 to 1988. During this 10-year period, five cases and one death were identified, representing approximately one serious complication for every 1 million cervical manipulations. Unfortunately, there do not appear to be any specific risk factors for vertebrobasilar artery dissection after manipulation, and the cases might represent idiosyncratic events or the aggravation of arterial dissections in progress [(159)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R159-10). [The chiropractic profession has not made a serious effort to study the incidence of cerebrovascular complications of neck adjustment.] The Future Significant challenges for conducting high-quality studies in the chiropractic profession continue to exist, but this is changing. The U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration's Chiropractic Demonstration Program was the first federal effort to facilitate collaborative research between chiropractic and medical institutions in 1994, and it continues to sponsor annual conferences designed to set research agenda [(164)](https://www.chirobase.org/14Misc/meeker.html#R164-10). In 1997, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine initiated a research center, the Consortial Center for Chiropractic Research, at Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa. It represents a collaboration of six chiropractic colleges and four state-supported universities. Chiropractic has survived, and it has begun to embrace the values and behaviors of a mainstream health profession. [One thing that is missing is a systematic effort to identify and discard ineffective practices.] In the past few decades, chiropractic has strengthened its educational system; initiated research that has validated spinal manipulation; increased its market share of satisfied patients; initiated collaborations with other disciplines in practice, research, and professional settings; and effectively used political, legislative, and legal measures to secure a role. Nevertheless, significant attitudinal and structural barriers to mainstream status still hinder chiropractic, and the advances of recent years may not be enough to ensure continuing progress in this direction. [The main \"mainstream barrier\" is the fact that the majority of chiropractors engages in improper practices.] Chiropractic still maintains some vestiges of an alternative health care profession in image, attitude, and practice. [Vestiges? What gall! Data from the 1998 National Board of Chiropractic Examiners' job analysis survey indicate that the majority of chiropractors engage in unscientific practices and that the percentage is higher than it was in the previous (1991) survey.] The profession has not resolved questions of professional and social identity, and it has not come to a consensus on the implications of integration into mainstream health care delivery systems and processes. In today's dynamic health care milieu, chiropractic stands at the crossroads of mainstream and alternative medicine. Its future role will probably be determined by its commitment to interdisciplinary cooperation and science-based practice.

The Annals article is not about the chiropractic I have been associated with for 28 years. It was written in the way Al-Jazeera reports the news about the War in Iraq \u2014 slanted, one-side, and very biased. Chiropractic, unlike the medical profession, does not tolerate self- criticism very well. If you do not march to the party line or \"believe in\" their extremist pseudo-religious dogma then you are \"against us,\" not \"with us\"; always either-or, black or white, no in-between, no gray area. The lack of tolerance reminds me of Muslim fundamental extremists who hate Jews, Americans, and Christians because their teachings say everyone else are the \"infidels.\" They are the only ones who have the answer, but what is the question? The President of National College of Chiropractic Dr. Joseph Janse stated when he addressed my graduatimg class at Texas Chiropractic College in 1975 that a \"fanatic\" was a person who after losing his direction, tripled his speed. (By the way, the first choice for our commencement speaker was Oral Roberts, but he had a prior engagement.) I ask every prospective chiropractic student to please read the book \"Combating Cult Mind Control\" by Stephen Hassan and log onto Chirobase before attending chiropractic college. This may save you some grief in the future. References [Wardwell WI. Chiropractic. History and Evolution of a New Profession.

I feel strongly that spinal manipulation is a valuable way to treat back pain. I have doubts, however, about the future of chiropractic and the credibility of some chiropractors who should not be doctors of anything. My concerns increased after reading articles written by you and Dr. Stephen Barrett. I have a true interest in manual rehabilitative therapies, especially in sports medicine. I like the idea of being a doctor, but, unlike some, I do not want money to be a deciding factor in how I run my clinic. After all, we should be health-care providers before being businessmen. Several kinesiology students here are interested in becoming chiropractors. We are all concerned about the lax entrance requirements, licensing requirements, and educational quality of chiropractic colleges who are graduating large numbers of chiropractors. We would appreciate any comments you might have. Answer Your knowledge of kinesiology would be helpful in using spinal manipulation to treat back pain, and I'm sure you would make a very good chiropractor. But you might be better off choosing physical therapy as a career. Western States Chiropractic College is one of the scientifically-oriented chiropractic colleges, but once you are in the field you will be competing with graduates of other chiropractic colleges who claim that using spinal adjustments to correct vertebral subluxations will restore and maintain health. The bad image created by such practitioners hinders cooperation with other health-care providers. This makes it difficult to succeed in practice as a properly limited, science-based chiropractor. Student loan defaults among chiropractors are higher than in any other health-care profession. To avoid the rejection associated with the practice of chiropractic, you might want to consider physical therapy as an approach to treating back pain. Manipulation and mobilization are now a part of the armamentarium of physical medicine, which includes a variety of physical treatment methods. All physical therapists now graduate with a master's or doctoral degree. Many states now allow direct access to a physical therapist without a physician's referral during the first month of treatment. Many are in private practice as portal-of-entry practitioners. You might also want to consider being a physiatrist (a medical doctor specializing in physical medicine) or a physician's assistant. A physical therapist with a degree in kinesiology would be a valuable partner for an orthopedist who recommends manual therapy. ____________________ Dr. Homola is a second-generation chiropractor who has dedicated himself to defining the proper limits on chiropractic and to educating consumers and professionals about the field. His 1963 book [Bonesetting, Chiropractic, and Cultism](../../05RB/BCC/00c.html) supported the appropriate use of spinal manipulation but renounced chiropractic dogma. His 1999 book [Inside Chiropractic: A Patient's Guide](../../03Edu/C/homola.html) provides an incisive look at chiropractic's history, benefits, and shortcomings.

After graduation, chiropractors can get help from many practice-building consultants who offer seminars and ongoing management advice. This article describes observations I have made over a 30-year period in which I collected practice-building manuals and many other relevant documents. When confronted with my writings on this subject, most chiropractors respond that my information is outdated and that the unethical practices I have described are not widespread. They also claim that many chiropractors who take practice-building courses don't use the unethical techniques to which they are exposed. I have received many reports from consumers who have encountered inappropriate salesmanship in chiropractic offices. Undercover investigations have also found evidence of their use, but, as far as I know, no professionwide survey has been conducted. How to Sell Services During the 1970s, flamboyant ads from practice-builders were much more common than they are today. The Drennan Seminar, for example, offered to \"double your income and patient volume in 90 days\" and said that one out of every ten registrants would receive a free Cadillac. The Stoner Chiropractic Research Foundation offered to \"show you how to make $350,000 as easily as $50,000\"; promised \"no more end-of-the-month jitters\"; and [one of its ads depicted a chiropractor pushing a wheelbarrow full of money toward the First National Bank](../../02Research/stoner.html). Dr. Robert A. Jarmain invited chiropractors to a three-day seminar to \"build the $1,000,000 practice.\" The Yennie Chiropractic Success Seminar offered to \"put you on the road to total success\" and to \"upgrade your practice into the $100,000-$200,000-$300,000 service levels.\" In 1978, Clinic Masters advertised that three thousand chiropractors had enrolled in its program and increased their incomes, on average, more than $50,000 a year. Its fee for a program of seminars and ongoing consultation was $20,000-$100 initially and the rest payable as income rose. Its seminars included \"How To Increase Insurance Business $100,000 Or More A Year\" and \"How To Achieve The 'Optimum Gettable' With Every Patient.\" Santavicca and Associates charged $30,000 for its advice-$100 for an initial three-day seminar and the rest payable as income rose. Recent ads for Nikitow Training Seminars promise that they will reveal how \"only 200 NP's [new patients] in one year yield you ONE MILLION DOLLARS - CASH COLLECTIONS.\" [The largest practice-building firm is the Parker Chiropractic Research Foundation, founded by the late James W. Parker, D.C. A 1987 brochure for its Parker School of Professional Success Seminar claimed that \"over 125,000 Doctors of Chiropractic, spouses and staff assistants worldwide-over two thirds of all practicing chiropractors-have attended nearly 300 Seminars more than 400,000 times. . . . Resulting in millions and millions of additional patients being served. . . . And surely resulting in at least a billion dollars of EXTRA CHIROPRACTIC EARNINGS!\" Attendees receive a diploma for completing \"the prescribed course of study at the Parker Chiropractic Research Seminar.\" In 1989, the fee for first-time chiropractors was $389 for the four-day course plus a gold-lettered plaque indicating membership in Parker Chiropractic Research Foundation.] [Parker's basic course](../../05RB/AYOR/04.html) was built around a 335-page Textbook of Office Procedure and Practice Building for the Chiropractic Profession. Parker appears to believe that the scope of chiropractic is unlimited. The Textbook suggests that patients be offered a \"free consultation\" but led into an \"examination\" that costs them money. It suggests that \"One adjustment for each year of age is a rough thumbnail guide of what people will willingly accept and pay for,\" but \"If in doubt about the payment or the return of the patient, take only the smaller x-rays on the first visit but ostensibly x-ray fully.\" Writing in a Parker publication, L. Ted Frigard, D.C., a prominent California chiropractor, has asserted: \"A patient is much more satisfied if you give him an adjustment every time he comes into the office. If you do not . . . you will have to spend a lot of time explaining why you didn't.\" [2] Share International, Parker's sales organization, sells hundreds of educational items and other practice-building aids. One is a chart alleging connections between points on the spine and organ disfunctions. Another is a \"report of findings\" on which chiropractors note \"subluxations\" and the (large) number of visits needed to correct them. A set of cassette tapes I acquired in the late 1970s included \"Sentences that Sell,\" in which Parker described how chiropractors associated with him tested ideas scientifically and reported back to him how they worked. The set also included \"Ways to Stimulate Referrals,\" in which he told how to steer conversations to sick people. \"In a casual, natural way,\" patients should be asked about the health of their families, friends, and neighbors. Should any be ailing, patients should be urged to be \"Good Samaritans\" by telling them about \"all the wonderful things\" that chiropractic might do for them. During the 1970s, for about $20, chiropractors could get copies of 107 advertisements to \"guide\" preparation of their own ads. Most of the ads were case histories. The instructions that accompanied them suggested: \"Re-type each ad on your own stationery for presentation to the editor. This would indicate that they are your own creations, and that the cases mentioned . . . are from your own files.\" Sale of this advertising kit was discontinued after its instructions were exposed in Jack Anderson's syndicated newspaper column. Despite the questionable methods Parker espoused, he was a highly respected and integral part of the chiropractic world. He was president of the Parker College of Chiropractic in Dallas, Texas, which he founded, from 1978 until about two years before his death in 1998. He lectured at many other chiropractic schools, and school officials often attended ceremonies at his seminars. The Parker School for Professional Success is now owned and operated by Parker College. Parker's son H. Karl Parker, D.C., now operates \" [Karl Parker Seminars](http://www.karlparker.com/),\" which he calls \"The Official Seminars of the Parker Family.\" | | Sid Williams, D.C., another leading promoter, has been president of the International Chiropractors Association. He founded and served until 2002 as president of Life Chiropractic College in Marietta, Georgia, where his salary and benefits rose to over $900,000 a year [3]. His other enterprises have included Today's Chiropractic (a journal), Health for Life (a testimonial newspaper), the Life Foundation (for public education), the [Dynamic Essentials (DE) Seminars](http://www.lastingpurpose.com/ov.html) (at which Williams expounds on chiropractic's \"Dynamic Essentials\"), and Dynamic Essentials (a chiropractic supply house originally called Si-Nel). Williams appears to believe that virtually all health problems are caused by nerve interference and should be treated by chiropractic methods. In 1979, he appeared on CBS's \"60 Minutes,\" adjusting the neck of an infant girl. When asked why, her mother said the adjustments (begun on the child's third day of life) were \"preventative measures\u2014to keep her healthy.\" The DE meetings are intended to inspire chiropractors to greater income as well as greater self-confidence. During the late 1970s, the fee was $325 for a three-day program during which \"the DE Team speakers will show you how to increase your practice with the secrets that have enabled them to build their practices into the $300,000-$500,000 range.\" Other ads for the seminars boasted that their top instructors saw 200 to 400 patients per day. During the 1970s, Williams distributed two volumes entitled Dynamic Essentials of the Chiropractic Principle, Practice and Procedure. One volume, also called the \"Doctors Red Senior Textbook,\" outlines his views on the importance of chiropractic. It states: \"Life Foundation and the Life Principle offer the world its one hope for freedom from disease, self-annihilation and eventual oblivion.\" The volume also affirms that God told Williams \"in very clear language on three different occasions during a five-month period\" to commence the DE meetings. The practice-building aspects of the DE meetings were centered around the other volume, which resembles Parker's textbook but is far more detailed in its instructions. The initial phase of patient contact is said to have three parts: the consultation, the examination (including an x-ray of every patient), and the report of findings. Page 129 states: Every step of your procedure should be thorough enough to convince the patient that you are not overlooking anything. The sophisticated age in which we live prevents the simplicity of chiropractic from being understood by the average person. . . . The examination procedures are not diagnostic, they are to emphasize to the patient that a weakness exists in his body and that they have been caused by spinal fixations. By fortifying the patient's knowledge of the 'spinal cause' by the use of test instruments and graphs, the patient is able to see beyond any doubt that he is actually physically sick; that a spinal condition caused it, and that something needs to be done chiropractically to correct it. Much of this volume is composed of statements for selling patients on chiropractic care. On pages 98-100, for example, Williams recommends that the doctor feel the spine for tender spots, \"predict the conditions that might occur underneath,\" and ask whether various symptoms have yet occurred. If the patient answers no to any of them, say: \"Well, Mrs. Jones, it certainly is a wonder. I must say you have a strong constitution in order to stand up under the many problems that you have. You have trouble in many areas, but you don't have many symptoms as of yet. But I would make the prediction that if you hadn't turned to chiropractic, you'd be a very sick girl shortly.\" Page 148 suggests telling patients: \"Medicine is very effective in its place; however, it is a simple fact that it is becoming obsolete. The theory of medicine is false.\" Williams's suggested goal was to convince patients to continue \"preventive maintenance\" once a month for life. (Page 75 notes that \"once the patient has experienced relief through chiropractic adjustments, he will accept almost any reasonable recommendation.\") If the patient asks, \"But will I have to continue with chiropractic care as long as I live?\" the recommended reply (page 175) is: (Chuckling) No ma'am, you won't have to continue it as long as you live. Only as long as you want to stay healthy. Every spine needs some maintenance, Mrs. Jones. My family and I are checked regularly on a monthly basis, and more often when we think that it is necessary. Yes, if you want to stay healthy, you will have to continue some chiropractic care. Page 216 describes a technique called \"sealing the patient in.\" First the patient is asked if various positive responses have occurred yet. If any have, he is told he even looks better. Then he is instructed to rest quietly in the chiropractor's office so he can get \"filled up with the thought that he is better, looks better, and he will be able to tell all his friends how much better he is.\" But page 218 cautions: \"Keep in mind that we don't want to feature 'Well' or 'Cure' too soon or too strongly because the patient won't show up for the next visit since he thinks 'I'm ready to quit; I am well.' He is never well-just better. Don't emphasize improvement too fast. Instead we say, 'We want to get you over on the good side of the ledger and keep you there.'\" Recently, I was informed that a newly formatted version called Dynamic Essentials Seminars Procedures Manual is still distributed at DE Seminars and that passages from it are used as classroom materials at Life University. During the late 1970s, I acquired a set of tape-recorded lectures from the April 1978 DE meeting. In \"The Patient Report That Eliminates Premature Dropouts,\" Williams advised using a magnifying glass to point out to patients the \"fixations\" on their x-rays. \"If you'll remember the first time someone showed you an atlas and the condyles of an A-to-P cervical view, it looked like so much nothing. But you can get the magnifying glass out and go home and they'll say, 'I saw it. He showed it to me!'\" But if patients don't look convinced while listening to the report, Williams suggests in the tape called \"Office Procedures of the Big Men,\"\"Tell 'em they ain't ready\u2014you gotta re-x-ray 'em.\" Ronald L. Halstead,, D.C., who operates Practice Systems, in Scottsdale, Arizona, is one of several practice-builders who provide suggested scripts to help retain patients. In an script called \" [Overcoming Patient Objections](../../15News/retention.html),\" he advises telling patients who are feeling better that they might relapse if they stop too soon and telling patients who feel worse that additional discomfort :indicates progress is being made.\" [4] [David Singer Enterprises](http://www.dse-inc.com/), a practice-management firm in Clearwater, Florida, published additional insights in its bimonthly Purpose Newsletter. A 1991 issue, for example, stated: Patient retention comes as a result of education. . . . There is usually only one reason why your patients don't continue to receive the chiropractic care they need: They don't understand what a subluxation is and its effects. . . . We must educate patients so that they understand that chiropractic care is a part of life; once subluxations are corrected, the body will innately heal itself. . . . Only the consumer who understands nerve interference will pay cash after his symptoms are gone [5]. Curiously, Sid Williams has expressed concern about overutilization. In the January/February 1992 issue of Today's Chiropractic, he said: Unfortunately, some members of the chiropractic profession have been engaging in what amounts to \"crime and wicked conduct\" in their practices by jumping on the bandwagon of getting all they can from the insurance industry while the \"getting\" is good. They have been playing a numbers game of getting as many patient visits and as many dollars per visit by whatever means they (and often their practice consultants) can devise. . . . Some members of our profession have been engaging in outright fraud with too many examinations and inflated office fees-which include inappropriate and worthless therapies and x-ray procedures-that sometimes amount to $1,000 for the first visit before they've done anything at all for the patient! How to Attract Patients Practice Management Associates (PMA), a Florida-based firm run by Peter Fernandez, D.C., advertised that chiropractors who followed its guidelines would gross an average of $240,000 in their first year of practice and that the average for all of their clients was about $350,000 [6]. The firm touted itself as \"the world's largest full-service chiropractic management firm.\" An ad for one of its 1991 seminars stated: \"We use an 'idea' factory approach which teaches a chiropractor every conceivable way that exists to attract new patients, from the most subtle to the most aggressive.\" Fernandez has marketed a cassette tape series called \"How to Keep Your Patients Coming Back,\" which included this inspirational message: Constantly educate your patients as to the value of chiropractic. . . . Get out there and beat the bushes, advertise, word-of-mouth, either way. But let's let the people in our country know what we can do. We only take care of four percent of the people. Guess what, gang? One hundred percent of the people out there have spines, 100 percent have subluxations. They all need adjustments. We have 95 or 96 percent of the people still to reach. Fernandez has also produced a five-volume series called Secrets of a Practice Consultant. The first (1981) edition of Volume I, 1001 Ways to Attract Patients, included the following suggestions on how to build one's reputation when beginning chiropractic practice: - Never go anywhere without being paged. This affixes your name in people's minds. . . . Whenever you're not busy, tell your receptionist that you are going to a certain supermarket, and . . . to have you paged as if for an emergency. . . . This paging procedure can be used 15 to 20 times a day very successfully. - Your wife and/or receptionist can dial any phone number and say, \"Is this Dr. So-and-So's, the chiropractor's office? I hear he is tremendous with treating headaches and I've got a terrible headache.\" . . . I know a doctor who employed a woman to make these calls eight hours a day. It was her only function on his staff! He built a large-volume practice in a short time using this technique. - Write notes on good chiropractic literature . . . with a red pencil: \"John, this man cured my headaches. Go to him!\" or \"Bob, this is the best doctor in the whole town! He cured the back problem that I have had for the past 15 years!\" Then take this literature, with your name and location stamped on it, and lay it all over town. The fifth volume in the series, published in 1990, is called How to Become a Million Dollar a Year Practitioner. For several years, Fernandez published Chiropractic Achievers, a bimonthly magazine distributed free of charge to chiropractors throughout the United States. One thing it reported was the record set by clients during their first thirty business days-the highest of which was $91,000 in services to 177 new patients. A 1987 ad for Fernandez's school of patient longevity stated, \"Once you've acquired a patient, keep him coming back because he wants to, because he believes in chiropractic and in you.\" During the early 1990s, Fernandez and PMA became embroiled in a large number of lawsuits with clients who said they were dissatisfied. Another company purchased the right to service PMA's clients and Fernandez dropped from the limelight.

Question Having read what you say about \"alternative medicine,\" I wonder whether your theory that chiropractic has an \"uncertain future\" is correct. Insurance companies now reimburse certain modalities and use of alternative medicine is increasing due to public acceptance. Answer At present, \"alternative medicine\" is a haven for nonsensical and unproven healing methods. Its popularity is due to public gullibility rather than proven effectiveness and scientific merit. In response to public interest, insurance coverage and hospital sponsorship of questionable healing methods have increased. But these methods will remain on the fringe of health care. I believe it is a mistake for the chiropractic profession to seek classsification as an alternative healing method. Appropriate use of spinal manipulation as a treatment for certain mechanical-type neck and back problems is a specific treatment method, like physical therapy, that should not be grouped with nonsensical approaches such as homeopathy or therapeutic touch. As long as chiropractic defines itself as a method of correcting \"vertebral subluxations\" to restore and maintain health, it will not have scientific support and will continue to seek shelter under the umbrella of \"alternative medicine.\" If the profession ever defines itself as a specialty in the use of spinal manipulation as a method of treating mechanical-type neck and back problems, it will have a better chance of gaining scientific acceptance that will allow it to function in cooperation with standard medical care, protected from the whims of a gullible and fickle public. ____________________ Dr. Homola is a second-generation chiropractor who has dedicated himself to defining the proper limits on chiropractic and to educating consumers and professionals about the field.

His ultimate goal is to have her stop taking any medication, including antibiotics and vaccinations, and he believes that this can be accomplished with Network Chiropractic. Your input would be greatly appreciated. Answer Network Chiropractic proposes that correction of \"vertebral subluxations\" will remove \"nerve interference\" as well as improve the flow of cerebrospinal fluid which csupposedly carries \"life energy\" needed to heal the body. This approach often includes CranioSacral Technique in which cranial (skull) and spinal structures are manipulated to \"pump\" the flow of cerebrospinal fluid throughout the body. There is no logical reason to believe that such treatment will improve the immune system or influence the course of asthma. In fact, I consider it to be utter nonsense. The fact that the chiropractor is antagonistic to vaccination is additional evidence that his advice is untrustworthy. I do not believe that young children should ever be treated by a chiropractor. Although many chiropractors claim that spinal adjustments are effective for treating asthma, these claims are not backed by scientific studies. A well-designed study published in the October 8, 1998, issue of the New England Journal of Medicine concluded that \"In children with mild or moderate asthma, the addition of chiropractic spinal manipulation to usual medical care provided no benefit.\" Claims that adjusting \"vertebral subluxations,\" moving cranial bones, or pumping spinal fluid will cure a child's asthma or replace the need for medication are dangerous as well as nonsensical. Your daughter's asthma may improve with time, but she should be under the care of a competent specialist. ____________________ Dr. Homola is a second-generation chiropractor who has dedicated himself to defining the proper limits on chiropractic and to educating consumers and professionals about the field.

Many chiropractors treat patients with spinal adjustments based on the theory that correction of vertebral subluxations will restore and maintain health. This article explores the controversy surrounding the practice of chiropractic and discusses some of the dangers associated with inappropriate use of spinal manipulation. The management of infants and children by subluxation-based chiropractors who do not endorse such medically accepted procedures as immunization or use of antibiotics is especially a cause for alarm. If the chiropractic profession fails to abandon the false premise upon which it is based, it will remain controversial and some aspects of chiropractic treatment will continue to be a threat to public health. When the polio epidemic was at its peak in the mid-1950s and the Salk vaccine was being promoted for immunization against poliomyelitis, the National Chiropractic Association campaigned against polio vaccination and recommended chiropractic adjustments for preventing and treating the disease. Defending the use of the Salk vaccine, the US surgeon general issued this statement in 1958: \"During the three and one-half years [the Salk vaccine] has been in use, the effectiveness rate of 60 to 90% has been consistently maintained. Nor is there any evidence that properly vaccinated persons are losing their immunity and becoming more susceptible to polio.\" [1] In 1959, an article in the Journal of the National Chiropractic Association disagreed with the surgeon general: \"The test tube fight against polio has failed....The death rate has increased among children who have been vaccinated....There is no vaccine against fatigue or a traumatic lesion in the anterior cord or motor cells....In the mild, and especially in the more acute, chiropractic is supreme. Adjustments of the entire spine will break up the cord congestion, if given within the 3 days of grace given by Nature. Chiropractic aids Nature....The fatigue of acute polio can be caused by other factors, such as whooping cough and smallpox vaccines. The latter can cause vaccinosyphilis in the pure blood of children.\" [2] Encouraged by the leadership of the chiropractic profession, chiropractors advertised chiropractic adjustments as a method of treating and preventing polio, recommending \"early treatment before it is too late.\" A chiropractic organization called We Walk Again proclaimed that maximum recovery from polio was found only in chiropractic [3]. Time and science have proven chiropractors wrong. Today, thanks to the use of vaccination, polio has been nearly eradicated: \"The present rate of polio is less than one hundredth its lowest level before oral immunization programs began, and public health officials have predicted worldwide eradication by the year 2000.\" [4] Immunization is one of the most successful public health measures ever put into effect and is responsible for the control or eradication of such deadly communicable diseases as smallpox, polio, diphtheria, and whooping cough. Vaccination and the Chiropractic Theory Leaning on the theory that correcting \"vertebral subluxations\" will cure and prevent disease by removing \"nerve interference\" and boosting the body's immune system, many chiropractors still oppose vaccination, fluoridation, and other mandatory public health measures. Despite the historical success of vaccination, neither of the two major chiropractic associations supports mandatory vaccination. The American Chiropractic Association (ACA), the larger of the two, admits that vaccination has been shown to be a clinically practical public health preventive procedure for certain viral and microbial diseases but advises that the use of vaccines is not without risk. Failing to emphasize that the benefit of vaccination outweighs risk over the population as a whole, \"the association supports each individual's right to freedom of choice in his/her own health care based on informed awareness of the benefits and possible effects of vaccination.\" [5] The International Chiropractic Association (ICA) does not acknowledge any benefit in vaccination and openly opposes compulsory vaccination. The ICA actually markets a book called Vaccination: 100 Years of Orthodox Research Shows that Vaccines Represent a Medical Assault on the Immune System. The ICA's current policy toward immunization states: The International Chiropractic Association recognizes that the use of vaccines is not without risk.... The ICA supports each individual's right to select his or her own health care and to be made aware of the possible adverse effects of vaccines upon a human body. In accordance with such principles and based upon the individual's right to freedom of choice, the ICA is opposed to compulsory programs which infringe upon such rights [4]. A former president of the ICA said in 1993, \"I am a firm opponent of artificial immunization and the antiquated germ theory on which it is based.\" [6] In 1997, promoting the ICA point of view, a popular publisher of patient education materials advised chiropractors: \"When chiropractors embrace vaccination, they are turning their backs on their philosophy, on their purpose, on their reason for being.\" [7] The more liberal ACA allows inclusion of physical therapy and other treatment methods (which often include such questionable methods as herbology and acupuncture) in a \"mixed\" practice, while the ICA advocates limiting treatment to use of spinal adjustments, which is called \"straight\" chiropractic. These differences prevent unification of the two associations. A 1992 survey revealed that 37% of 178 chiropractors who responded agreed that \"there is no scientific proof that immunization prevents infectious disease.\" Of these respondents, 24% were members of the ACA and 65% were members of the ICA. Only 14% of all the respondents agreed that the chiropractic profession should fully support the American Public Health Association's immunization policies for children and adults [8]. Although fewer chiropractors openly oppose vaccination today, the number who do is significant. With chiropractic colleges still teaching the subluxation theory (that correction of vertebral subluxations will boost the immune system as well as restore and maintain health), there will continue to be chiropractors who oppose vaccination and other mandatory public health measures. As an \"alternative healing method\" based on the vertebral subluxation theory, the name of the game is indoctrination in the belief that spinal adjustments are superior to medical treatment for many forms of disease. Opposing vaccination and similar public health measures is an inherent part of chiropractic philosophy. \"By opposing immunization,\" says one chiropractic reformer, \"chiropractic assures that it will not become assimilated into the health-care mainstream.\" [9] There is reason enough to reject chiropractic health care that is based on the vertebral subluxation theory. When promotion of this theory threatens public health by opposing vaccination and other measures that protect all of us from preventable diseases contracted by others, there is cause for alarm, especially when the theory is espoused by chiropractors who specialize in \"chiropractic paediatrics\". Since much of what chiropractors do today is still based on the subluxation theory, it is essential to understand what is meant by the term and how chiropractors have managed to sell their theory to the public. The Mysterious Vertebral Subluxation Chiropractors have been adjusting vertebral subluxations since 1895 when D. D. Palmer, a magnetic healer, declared that \"95% of diseases are caused by displaced vertebrae; the remainder by luxations of other joints.\" [10] Today, all 16 North American chiropractic colleges agree that \"chiropractic is concerned with the preservation and restoration of health and focuses particular attention on the subluxation.\" [11] In 1996, 16 chiropractic college presidents signed a position paper defining a subluxation as \"a complex of functional and/or pathological articular changes that compromise neural integrity and may influence organ system function and general health.\" [11] A 1997 pamphlet for laypersons, published by the Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research, explained what is meant by a \"subluxation complex\": What the above means is that a subluxation is a joint problem (whether a problem with the way the joint is functioning, a physical problem with the joint, or a combination of these) that affects the function of the nerves and can therefore affect the body's organs and general health....Chiropractors believe that if joints function properly nerves will function properly and the body will be able to keep itself healthy [12]. Although some chiropractors no longer support the vertebral subluxation theory [13], the theory is still being taught in chiropractic colleges and still forms the basis for the average chiropractor's practice. There is no scientific evidence to indicate that vertebral misalignment or any dysfunction in structures of the spinal column is a cause of disease [14]. Subluxations and \"Nerve Interference\" The original chiropractic subluxation theory proposed that misalignment of a vertebra obstructed nerve flow by pinching spinal nerves. Today, a subluxation is called a \"subluxation complex\" and is defined in many ways under more than 100 different names (such as a segmental dysfunction or a neurobiomechanical lesion). The Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research defines a subluxation as \"changes in nerve, muscle, connective, and vascular tissues which are understood to accompany the kinesiologic aberrations of spinal articulations.\" [15] Noting that such subluxations \"may not be detectable by any of the current technological methods,\" the proof of the existence of a subluxation is described as being reflected in reversal of \"a variety of physiological phenomena.\" In other words, if the patient gets better following a spinal adjustment, that is proof that a subluxation or some other spinal problem has been corrected. It seems likely that many of the explanations chiropractors use to explain the effects of a spinal adjustment, such as a reflex global response [16] or an increase in white cell respiration [17], can also apply to other forms of everyday stimulation, such as an accidental bump, a deep massage, or a cold shower. But there is no reason to believe that such temporary physiological effects have anything to do with the cause and cure of disease, as postulated in the chiropractic subluxation theory. The mysterious and elusive chiropractic subluxation is obviously not the same as a medically recognized orthopedic subluxation, a partial dislocation, which causes pain and loss of mobility but does not cause disease or ill health. The truth is that slight misalignment of a vertebra has no effect on spinal nerves. When a spinal nerve is pinched, compressed, or irritated by a bony spur, a herniated disc, a thickened ligament, or some other pathological process, there may be pain, numbness, muscle weakness, and other symptoms in the skin and musculoskeletal structures supplied by the affected nerve. But this has no effect on visceral function or general health. Injury to a spinal nerve may result in some autonomic disturbance in the portion of the skin supplied by the damaged nerve, but visceral functions are protected by a widespread, overlapping nerve supply from a number of sympathetic (autonomic) ganglia located outside the spinal column. Anatomy of the Nervous System There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves; 26 of these pass through movable vertebral segments. Five pairs of spinal nerves (accompanied by some parasympathetic fibers) pass through solid bony openings in the sacrum. There are an additional 12 pairs of cranial nerves which pass through bony openings in the base of the skull (including the 10th cranial parasympathetic vagus nerve, which travels down to supply visceral structures in the thorax and abdomen). The parasympathetic portion of the autonomic nervous system is well protected at its bony outlets and is not affected by slight misalignment of a vertebra, as suggested by the chiropractic subluxation theory. Nor is it accessible to manipulation of the spine. There is plenty of room for the passage of spinal nerves and blood vessels through the fat-padded foraminal openings between the vertebrae. It cannot be imagined that slight displacement of a normal vertebra will place pressure on a spinal nerve. This was proven conclusively 25 years ago by experiments performed by Edmund S. Crelin, PhD, a prominent anatomist at Yale University. Using dissected spines with ligaments attached and the spinal nerves exposed, he used a drill press to bend and twist the spine. Using an ohm meter to record any contact between wired spinal nerves and the foraminal openings, he found that vertebrae could not be displaced enough to stretch or impinge a spinal nerve unless the force was great enough to break the spine. Crelin concluded: \"This experimental study demonstrates conclusively that the subluxation of a vertebra as defined by chiropractic \u2014 the exertion of pressure on a spinal nerve which by interfering with the planned expression of Innate Intelligence produces pathology \u2014 does not occur.\" [18] Spinal nerves are commonly pinched by bony spurs and herniated discs, causing musculoskeletal symptoms without any effect on visceral function. Even when the spinal cord is severed below the level of the fourth cervical vertebra, shutting off the flow of nerve impulses to spinal nerves, paralysis of musculoskeletal structures occurs from the neck down but the autonomic nervous system continues to maintain function of the body's organs. If a transverse cord lesion occurs above the level of C5, however, disruption of parasympathetic nerve supply from the brain stem may cause death as a result of respiratory failure [19], Insignificant Vertebral Misalignment In view of the complex and fail-safe overlapping of the autonomic nervous system and the chemical reactions that occur in tissue fluids to maintain visceral functions, it becomes apparent that slight misalignment of a single vertebra is not likely to be a significant factor in the cause of disease. That the chiropractic version of vertebral subluxations may not exist at all is reflected in the fact that interexaminer reliability is low when chiropractors attempt to locate subluxations. Except in cases of gross misalignment caused by disc degeneration and other structural abnormalities, or in cases where chiropractors are using the Meric system, which simply assigns a certain vertebra to a specific organ or disease (used by 23.4% of chiropractors) [20], few chiropractors find the same subluxations when attempting to relate a specific subluxation to a disease process. In 1964, the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) asked representatives of both the American Chiropractic Association and the International Chiropractic Association to identify subluxations in 20 sets of X-rays submitted by chiropractors who had previously identified 1 to 6 subluxations in each set of X-rays. According to the NALC: \"One after the other, each film was placed in the view box. The chiropractic representatives, including a radiologist of their own selection, were invited to point out the subluxations. Not a single one was identified. Nor did the chiropractic representatives offer a solitary comment.\" [21] Is the chiropractic subluxation theory a threat to public health? It would certainly seem so. Unless the chiropractic profession abandons the subluxation theory and evolves into a properly limited specialty in the use of manual therapy and other physical treatment methods in the care of musculoskeletal problems, inappropriate use of spinal manipulation will continue. And chiropractors will continue to order unnecessary X-ray examination and maintenance care that requires use of unproven and possibly harmful treatment methods. Limitations and Dangers of Chiropractic Manipulation As a vaguely defined treatment approach with a broad scope of practice, chiropractic remains controversial and may pose a threat for persons who cannot distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate use of spinal manipulation. Reviews of the literature have revealed evidence that spinal manipulation may be of value in treating some types of back pain [22]. There are many good chiropractors who offer effective treatment for back pain and other musculoskeletal problems. But few chiropractors limit their practice to the care of mechanical-type problems; most offer spinal manipulation as a method of restoring and maintaining health. Chiropractors' use of a variety of unproven treatment methods and adjustive techniques make chiropractic treatment even more problematic. Some techniques entail physical risk while others pose risk by diverting the patient away from proper medical care for visceral problems. A 1991 survey by the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners found that 26% of chiropractors \"specialize\" in adjusting the upper cervical spine as a method of treating visceral disease and back pain [20]. Cervical manipulation is not often indicated. Inappropriate use of such treatment poses risk of injury to vertebral arteries in the neck. A RAND study reported in 1996 that only 11.1% of reported indications for cervical manipulation were considered appropriate [23]. The rate of vertebrobasilar accidents and other complications that occur as a result of cervical manipulation was estimated to be 1.46 per l 000 000 manipulations. These numbers are more significant when it is realized that each patient receives a large number of manipulations, most of which may be unnecessary, thus increasing the risk of stroke per patient. Risk may outweigh benefit when 88.9% of all cervical manipulations cannot be labeled as appropriate. Some observers feel that cervical manipulation involving extreme rotation of the top 2 cervical vertebrae should never be done. In many cases, the desired effect of cervical manipulation can be obtained through rest, exercise, mobilization, traction, and other methods of treatment. Obviously, the use of cervical manipulation and its dangers should be subjected to intense scrutiny. The incidence of stroke following cervical manipulation may be much higher than indicated when reviewing the existing literature. Many cases of stroke caused by cervical manipulation may not be recorded as such because patients don't always report previous manipulations they may have received. All patients reporting stroke symptoms should be asked if they have undergone recent cervical manipulation. Gimmicks and Ineffective Treatment Methods A few chiropractors do not perform hands-on spinal manipulation. Surveys indicate that the average chiropractor uses 5 or more different manipulative techniques [20], if not to meet the competition of chiropractors who offer a particular technique then to be able to use a different technique if the patient does not get better. This reduces chances of losing the patient to another chiropractor. It has been reported that 51.2% of chiropractors include use of a handheld, spring-loaded Activator mallet to tap \"misaligned\" vertebrae back into place [20], an apparently ineffective treatment method that may have nothing to offer but a placebo effect. I know many chiropractors who use such an instrument. Such treatment is not an effective replacement for appropriate use of hands-on spinal manipulation under the proper indications. At least 97 different adjustive techniques have been used by chiropractors in recent years [24], including such dubious methods as applied kinesiology, reportedly used by 37.2% of chiropractors [20]. Applied kinesiology is a nonsensical method of testing muscle strength to detect diseases and deficiencies that may then be treated with spinal adjustments or nutritional supplements. (Chiropractors who manipulate specific vertebrae as a treatment for disease prefer to call the treatment a spinal adjustment rather than a spinal manipulation.) In many cases, the only thing the various adjustive techniques have in common is that they are all unproven and all are claimed to be most effective for removing \"nerve interference.\" Using a plethora of inconsistent adjustive techniques and producing \"results\" that cannot be replicated, chiropractors are holding on to the subluxation theory in order to maintain their status as \"alternative\" primary care physicians in a \"separate and distinct profession.\" Chiropractors continue to offer treatment to persons of all ages for a variety of organic and musculoskeletal ailments. The greatest threat may be to infants and children whose parents are lured by claims that spinal adjustments at an early age can prevent the development of disease and that vaccination may not be necessary. Chiropractic Treatment of Children An outrageous but typical example of the danger of the chiropractic theory put into practice was brought to my attention recently when I received a copy of a letter requesting information about chiropractic treatment of children. A Florida father was concerned about the treatment his 3 children (ages 7, 2, and 1) were receiving from his estranged wife's chiropractor. Each child was being treated 3 times a week with an average billing of $120 per week. The 7-year-old was being treated for cerebral palsy and the 1-year-old for ear infection. The insurance billing described the treatment as \"spinal disorder care.\" In my 43 years of practice as a chiropractor, I have heard such stories many times. Some chiropractors recruit families with children who are then placed on lifetime \"maintenance care\" to maintain \"optimum health.\" A front-page article in the March 18, 1993, issue of the Wall Street Journal castigated chiropractors for offering treatment to children as a method of expanding their practice. Labeling chiropractic as \"a 19th-century philosophy wearing the white smock of science,\" the article condemned chiropractic for treating children for \"legions of childhood afflictions\" and for not supporting immunization [25]. In response, the American Chiropractic Association placed a full-page ad in the March 22, 1993, issue of the Wall Street Journal claiming that the article focused on an \"isolated number of sensational and tragic occurrences.\" Denying any wrongdoing by chiropractors, the ACA response was designed more to protect the image of the chiropractic profession than to protect the public. Chiropractors are trained to diagnose, the ad said, and are \"obligated \u2014 morally and professionally \u2014 to refer all patients to medical doctors and other specialists when treatment is outside their scope of practice.\" The ad also denied that chiropractors use spinal manipulation as a substitute for vaccination or for the use of antibiotics in treating infections, despite the fact that many chiropractors claim to do so. The ACA maintained that no single healing art has all the answers to the many health problems affecting mankind and that it is the right of patients to select the health-care provider of their choice. \"Today,\" the ad concluded, \"conscientious health practitioners work as a team for the benefit of the patient.\" It is the consensus of medical and scientific opinion that chiropractors should not be allowed to treat infants and children. Using a limited treatment method based on the subluxation theory, chiropractors do not have adequate training in the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric ailments. And they do not have recourse to antibiotics and other medical treatment methods that are essential in combating potentially fatal or crippling illnesses. Yet, according to a special report in the November 1993 issue of Pediatric Management, children account for an estimated 20 million visits to chiropractors each year, compared to 87 million visits to pediatricians (in 1989) [26]. Many of these children are receiving spinal adjustments for ear infection and other common and often self-limiting childhood ailments. Chiropractors were caught red-handed treating infants and children for ear infections and other ailments when ABC-TV's 20/20 secretly videotaped visits to 17 chiropractors who professed to treat children. Television viewers were astonished when the program was aired on February 4, 1994, as chiropractors were shown diagnosing and treating ear infections with a variety of nonsensical methods based on a variety of causes, ranging from subluxated vertebrae to nutritional deficiency, weak glands, food sensitivity, and a short leg. Two chiropractors differed on which leg was shorter. One infant with recurring ear infection was taken to several chiropractors, two of whom used surrogate muscle testing in which the diagnosis was made by using applied kinesiology to test strength in the mother's arm while she was in contact with the infant. Although a pediatrician had determined beforehand that the children's ear infections could be handled with antibiotics or would eventually be outgrown, all the chiropractors offered treatment lasting from several weeks to a lifetime. It is not hard to find chiropractors who treat infants and children. Despite such articles as those in the Wall Street Journal, the chiropractic movement to treat children is growing. According to the International Chiropractic Association, whose Council on Chiropractic Pediatrics offers the profession's only Board Certified Diplomate in Chiropractic Pediatrics: \"The Council on Chiropractic Pediatrics is one of the fastest growing specialty groups of the International Chiropractic Association.\" [27] The World Chiropractic Alliance (WCA), an organization of straight chiropractors who believe that the chiropractic adjustment is sufficient in the treatment of most ailments, reports that there is \"overwhelming evidence\" that spinal adjustments should begin at birth and continue for life [28]. WCA's mission is to \"promote a vertebral subluxation-free world.\" The president of the WCA is also editor and publisher of the Chiropractic Journal, \"read and respected by more doctors of chiropractic than any other professional publication in the world.\" In 1996 the Chiropractic Journal published Chiropractic First, The Fastest Growing Healthcare Choice . . . Before Drugs or Surgery. This book recommends that everyone should be checked for nerve interference from birth. Chiropractic care is recommended for children who have any of these symptoms: Fever, colic, croup, allergies, wheezing, poor posture, stomach ache, hearing loss, neck/back pain, leg/hip/foot pain, numbness, headaches, coughs/colds, asthma, bed wetting, bronchitis, constipation, weakness/fatigue, ear infections, skin problems, one leg shorter, irritability, neck aches, nervousness, learning disorders, sinus problems, eye problems, scoliosis, arthritis, fatigue, pain in joints, shoulder/arm pain, poor concentration [29]. The market for chiropractic treatment of children is so great that some practice-building programs for chiropractors are based on pediatric care. A chiropractic research foundation called the Traumatic Birth Research Foundation, for example, which claims to be committed to locating and correcting vertebral subluxations in newborn babies, is being promoted as \"the most cost-effective, innovative chiropractic marketing program to come along in years.\" Chiropractors are encouraged to invite mothers and mothers-to-be to participate in a \"chiropractic mothers and mothers-to-be program\" to spread the word about the benefits of chiropractic manipulation for newborn babies. The message conveyed is that failure to correct spinal subluxations at birth could result in disease later in life [30]. Criticism by Consumer Reports In view of such outrageous claims made by some chiropractors, it is not surprising that consumer advocates criticize chiropractors. Consumer Reports has published two articles on chiropractic, one in 1975 and one in 1994, both drawing negative conclusions about chiropractic as a method of dealing with health and disease. In the 1994 article, titled \"Chiropractors,\" the editors concluded that \"manipulation is a widely accepted therapy, but chiropractic is not just a set of techniques for manipulating the spine; it is a belief system that credits the spine with a major role in health and disease....If chiropractors limited themselves to treating back pain and other neuromusculoskeletal problems, they might win a broader measure of acceptance from medical doctors.\" [31] Denouncing valid criticism in order to retain popular support among portions of the public who find the subluxation theory appealing, the chiropractic profession maintains the status quo. It continues to draw fire from scientists and consumer advocates who are morally and ethically obligated to speak out about the dangers of the chiropractic theory. Chiropractic Theory and Maintenance Care Chiropractic maintenance care consisting of regular spinal adjustments is an integral part of the chiropractic subluxation theory. Most chiropractors agree that such care is helpful in treating and preventing visceral and musculoskeletal problems in all age groups, with treatment sometimes beginning shortly after birth. One recent study reported that 90% of all chiropractors believe that maintenance care will optimize health, while 88% believe that such care will prevent conditions from developing. The average number of maintenance care visits was 14.4 per year, representing an estimated 23% of all practice incomes [32]. In my opinion, use of spinal adjustments as a method of prevention is unnecessary treatment that subjects the patient to unnecessary risk. When used by chiropractors who treat every patient with upper cervical manipulation, the risk is much greater. In the case of children, such treatment should be considered fraudulent or illegal. Patient Education and Practice Building Because of the suspicion the public has about the practice of chiropractic, the demand for patient education materials and practice-building courses for use by chiropractors has created a lucrative business opportunity for chiropractic entrepreneurs. Chiropractic journals and newspapers are filled with ads selling tapes, books, and seminars on how to attract new patients and build a million-dollar practice, all espousing the vertebral subluxation theory. The newest twist in practice-building is the \"integrated\" chiropractic office in which there is an MD or a DO on staff to sign insurance claim forms for conditions and procedures not normally covered under chiropractic care. Introduction to Chiropractic: A Natural Method of Healthcare (written by a former chairman of the board of governors of the American Chiropractic Association) is one of the profession's most popular and sophisticated patient education manuals. Without mentioning any specific disease and with a subtle approach, the manual explains that malfunctions (subluxations) that interfere with nerve supply to the organs and tissues are causative factors in many disease processes: \"Locating minor spinal deviations early, before they interfere with a proper functioning of the nervous system and produce symptoms, will greatly assist your body in remaining healthy....Regular spinal adjustments are a part of your body's defense against illness....The conditions which doctors of chiropractic treat can be as varied and as vast as the nervous system itself.\" [33] Dynamic Essentials, a very popular practice-building course, is conducted by the president and founder of Life Chiropractic College, who said in a journal published by his college: \"I have never found any justification for doing anything for, or to, a patient who has come to me for chiropractic care, other than doing the best job possible of adjusting that patient's spine.\" [34] His practice-building manual tells chiropractors how to convince patients they need chiropractic care and then how to \"seal the patient in\" for lifetime care. If the patient asks, \"But will I have to continue with chiropractic care as long as I live?\" the recommended reply is: \"(Chuckling) No ma'am, you won't have to continue it as long as you live. Only as long as you want to stay healthy.\" [35] A practice-building consultant who authored 1001 Ways to Attract New Patients and How to Become a Million Dollar a Year Practitioner advises that the key to wealth is to expand the variety of conditions treated, find subluxations, reduce them, and then keep them reduced with regular spinal adjustments [36]. Maintenance care is emphasized in the popular Singer Enterprises approach to practice building. Publications and audio tapes on \"How to Create Lifetime Patients\" advise chiropractors that once subluxations are corrected and symptoms have been relieved, patients should be encouraged to pay an annual fee for maintenance care. Since lifetime care is the goal, chiropractors are advised to regularly explain that \"nerve interference will remain and people need adjustments because nothing else really works to make people well.\" [37] The great number of practice-building courses, all designed to promote the subluxation theory and create new patients, probably reflect better than anything else the problems with chiropractic care. Some of these courses appear to knowingly incorporate deception, which is willingly accepted by chiropractors. Many practice-building consultants lecture at chiropractic schools and conventions. As long as the chiropractic profession continues to base chiropractic treatment on the unproven vertebral subluxation theory, there will continue to be opposition from medical scientists as well as criticism by consumer advocates. Reacting defensively to such opposition, some chiropractors feel that the approach of some practice builders is necessary for the survival of chiropractic, since referral of patients from science-based health-care practitioners is rare. Unless the chiropractic profession proves the subluxation theory or abandons the idea that adjusting the spine will restore and maintain health, it will remain controversial and some aspects of it will remain a threat to public health. And without the support of medical scientists and public health officials, chiropractors will continue to seek public acceptance rather than scientific support. Failure of chiropractors to criticize the pseudoscience in chiropractic (concentrating more on public relations than on promoting public health) perpetuates chiropractic dogma and fails to challenge chiropractors who exploit spinal manipulation. According to a 1996 survey of 2280 chiropractors, with 1245 responding, only 3% of the respondents felt that increasing the ability of the profession to conduct its own research was a high priority. The survey report concluded: \"Practicing chiropractors in the United States feel that the acceptance of chiropractic, primarily by patients and other health care professionals, is the most important research objective.\" [38] Many chiropractors feel that they qualify as primary care physicians capable of handling a broad scope of human ailments [39]. Such claims should increase concern about chiropractors who base their practice on the vertebral subluxation theory. References - Burney L.
