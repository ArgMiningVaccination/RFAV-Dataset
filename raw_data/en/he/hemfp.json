Seventy patients with CRPC were assigned to two arms; PPV plus HM or PPV alone. Two to four peptides were chosen from 31 peptides derived from can- cer antigens for a s.c. injection of PPV given eight times according to the patient's human leukocyte antigen type and levels (Mo-MDSC), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) responses were measured before and at the eighth vaccination. Clinical outcomes were also analyzed. Combination therapy of PPV with HM was well tolerated without severe adverse events. There was no signicant change in antigen-speci- c IgG, CTL, Treg or clinical outcomes. Combination therapy of PPV with HM sta- bilized the frequency of Mo-MDSC P=0.96) to 16.1 pg/mL, P=0.63) during the treatment. In contrast, the frequency of Mo-MDSC and levels of IL-6 in the PPV-alone group were cantly 9.2 pg/mL to 19.4 pg/mL for IL- 6, respectively). These results suggest that the combined use of HM has the potential to prevent the immunosuppression induced by Mo-MDSC or IL-6 during immunotherapy. More research is needed to validate the ndings of the present study. Although several new drugs for CRPC have recently been approved, prostate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men in Western countries. Each of these new drugs has prolonged survival by only a few months. Consequently, new therapies with longer survival ben- ets are greatly needed.(1)Recently, immunotherapy has become an important part of treating some malignant tumors. Newer types of immune strategies are now being studied which will impact how we treat cancer in the future. One novel strategy of cancer immunotherapy is PPV, in which up to four peptides are selected for vaccination from 31 candidate peptides derived from cancer antigens based on HLA type and pre-existing host immunity.(2,3)Recent clinical studies of PPV have demonstrated safety, immunological efcacy and survival benets in patients with CRPC.(4-6) The emergence of immunotherapy provides opportunities for HM to contribute beyond reducing the side-effects of toxic chemicals. They now have a role in enhancing the body's nat- ural immunity in support of the cancer vaccines and targeted immune responses of cancer immunotherapy.(7)Hochu-ekki-to (TJ-41) and Keishi-bukuryo-gan (TJ-25) are Japanese tradi- tional HM. Combined use of these two HM are prescribed to improve immunity and general conditions of cancer patients. Several studies have suggested that TJ-41 can affect theimmune system in experiments on mice.(8-10)TJ-25 also has anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and anti-pyretic effects.(11)These functions lead to the hypothesis that TJ-25 improves the TME for cancer immunotherapy to attack cancer cells. Although there is some evidence for immune reinforcement effects of TJ-41 in animal models, the roles of TJ-41 and TJ- 25 in combination with immunotherapy for CRPC patients have not been dened. Thus, a randomized phase II study of PPV in combination with TJ-41 and TJ-25 was conducted to assess the immune-enhancing effects in CRPC patients. Materials and Methods Patients. Eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of CRPC. CRPC was dened by at least two consecutive increases in PSA or clinically apparent disease progression, including diag- nosis of PD, on cross-sectional imaging despite appropriate androgen ablative therapy. At least two positive responses were also required on the pretreatment peptide-specic IgG titer test for HLA matched peptides in 31 candidate peptides. Safety and immunological effects of the 31 candidate peptides were previously reported.(5,6,12)All patients were required to be 20 years of age or older, have a performance status of 0 or 1 in accordance with EOCG, have a life expectancy of Cancer Sci | December 2017 | vol. 108 | no. 12 | 2326-2332 \u00a92017 The Authors.

Exclusion criteria included an acute infection, a history of severe allergic reactions, or pulmonary, cardiac, or other inappropriate conditions for enrolment as judged by clin-icians. The Kurume University Ethical Committee approvedthe protocol and this study was registered in the UMIN Clini- cal Trials Registry (UMIN 0000010290). After a full explana- tion of the protocol, all patients provided written informedconsent before participating in the study. Study design and treatment. In this open-label, randomized phase II trial of PPV plus HM (TJ-41 and TJ-25) for CRPC patients, enrolled patients were assigned to two arms: PPV plusHM treatment or PPV-alone treatment. They were randomized in a 1:1 ratio using the minimization technique with the follow- ing stratication factors: age ( <70 or 70 years old), PS (0 or 1), and baseline PSA levels ( <100 or 100 ng/mL). Primary end- point was immune response in combination with HM in PPV treatment. OS, PFS, and safety were secondary endpoints. Thirty-one candidate peptides were prepared for PPV treat- ment: 12 peptides matched for HLA-A2; 14 peptides matchedfor HLA-A24; four peptides matched for HLA-A26; nine pep- tides for HLA-A3 super type (HLA-A3, HLA-A11, HLA-A31 and HLA-A33). Two to four peptides were each patient according to HLA-typing and peptide-specic IgG titer. Each selected peptide with Adjuvant (Seppic, Paris, France) in1.5 mL emulsion (3 mg/peptide) was injected s.c. Patients received vaccinations a total of eight times at 1- week intervals in the rst course of PPV in both groups. In the PPV plus HM arm, 2.5 g of both TJ-41 and TJ-25 was takenbefore each meal (total 7.5 g/day each) for 50 days during the8 weeks of PPV treatment. TJ-41 is manufactured as a spray- dried powder extract made from 10 medical herbs in is also manufactured as a spray- dried powder extract and composed of equal rst course, HM were not continued. In the PPV-alone group, patientsreceived the vaccination only. Immune responses. The patient's peripheral blood was col- lected for measuring peptide-specic CTL pressure in PBMCand IgG in plasma at pretreatment and at 8 weeks. CTLresponse to the vaccinated peptide epitopes was measured using the IFN- cELISPOT assay previously reported meth- ods. (12)Briefly, incubated for 2 days with each vac- cinated peptide in culture medium containing IL-2. Then, thecells were cultured with each peptide or control peptides and HLA-matched C1R-cells in an ELISPOT plate coated with anti IFN-cantibody. Eighteen hours later, the plates were washed and color developed, and then the spots were read using an ELI- SPOT reader (CTL-ImmunoSpot S5 Series; Cellular Technology Ltd, Shaker OH, USA). Peptide-specic IgG titers weremeasured using a Luminex system as reported previously. (15) When the total of vaccinated peptide-specic IgG titer at 8 weeks was higher than that at pre-vaccination, it was consid- ered to be a positive response. Positive CTL responses weredened as a more than 50-spot increase in the total IFN- cspots at 8 weeks. Total IFN- cspots was the sum of spots for each vac- cinated peptide minus the spots for IL-6. Treg, Mo-MDSC, and IL-6 were +FoxP3 +cells in lymphocytes 1a). using the One Step Staining Human TregFlowKit (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. MDSC were identied as CD33 were run on a FACS-Canto II (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA), and data were analyzed using the Diva software package (BD Bio- sciences). Frequencies of Treg and MDSC in the lymphocyteswere calculated. Serum IL-6 concentration was determined byELISA. Assessment of toxicity and clinical activity.

Toxicity was assessed in accordance with the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for AdverseEvents version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE Ver. 4). General biochemical examinations, including serum PSA test, were done every eight vaccinations. CT and bone scans were carried out every6 months or at progression of symptoms. PD was dened astwo consecutive increases in PSA from baseline or nadir, and CT images were evaluated in accordance with RECIST criteria or death. Statistical methods. Student's t-test and the chi-squared test were used to compare quantitative and categorical variables among safety and immune responses to the treatment, respec- tively. Analyses of PFS and OS were based on population of afull analysis set that included all randomly assigned and trea- ted patients. PFS and OS were dened as the time in months from study enrolment to event: death for OS and diagnosis ofPD for PFS. PFS and OS data for each arm were analyzedusing the Kaplan -Meier method. The log -rank test was used for comparison of the survival curves and Cox proportional hazards analysis for estimation of HR. CI reported are 95%.Statistical analyses were carried out using SAS software ver-sion 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) with a two-sided sig- nicance level of 5%. Results Patients. Between June 2013 and March 2014, a total of 70 patients with CRPC were enrolled in this randomized phase IItrial at the Cancer Vaccine Center of Kurume University in Japan. They were assigned to PPV plus HM ( n=35) or PPV alone ( n=35). Four patients withdrew consent before initia- tion of treatment in the PPV plus HM arm. Three patients inthe PPV plus HM arm and four patients in the PPV-alone armdid not complete the treatment for 8 weeks because of disease progression or death. Two patients in the PPV plus HM armdid not have immunological evaluation as a result of sample availability. The study flowchart is shown in Figure 2. Demo- graphic and baseline disease characteristics were well balancedbetween the treatment arms (Table 1). Toxicity. Overall AE as a result of any cause are listed in Table 2. Treatment-related deaths did not occur in either arm. Grade 1 or 2 injection site reactions were the most frequentAE in both arms (84% in the PPV plus HM arm and 71% inthe PPV-alone arm). Appetite loss was less frequent with the PPV plus HM treatment than with PPV-alone treatment. Immune responses. Number of lymphocytes during the treat- ment was not changed in either arm (Fig. 3a). Peptide-specic immune responses in each patient are shown in Table S1 (Sup- porting Information). Peptide-specic IgG responses were mea-sured in 15 of 26 patients (58%) in the PPV plus HM arm andin 14 of 31 patients (45%) in the PPV-alone arm. Peptide-spe- cic CTL responses were observed in nine of 26 patients (35%) in the PPV plus HM arm and in nine of 31 patients(29%) in the PPV-alone arm. IgG responses in both arms sig-nicantly increased after the treatment (Fig. 3b). Although CTL responses in both arms exhibited an increase after treat- ment, the results did not differ (Fig. 3c). Rate of patients withpositivity for IgG or CTL responses was assessed. There were no signicant differences in the two arms. Average frequency of Mo-MDSC was compared between the two arms. Beforetreatment, Mo-MDSC frequency was lower in the PPV-alonearm than in the PPV plus HM arm (0.91% vs1.91%, P=0.024). Average frequency of Mo-MDSC in the PPV plus HM arm was not changed after the treatment (1.91% at pre-therapy and 1.92% at the eighth vaccination, P=0.96). In the PPV-alone arm, frequency of the average Mo-MDSC Fig. 2. Study flowchart. PPV, personalized peptide vaccination. \u00a92017 The Authors.

Regarding IL-6, average IL-6 level at pre-therapy was also lower in the PPV-alone arm than in the PPV plus HM arm (9.2 pg/mL vs19.2 pg/mL, P=0.021). Average IL-6 level in the PPV plus HM arm showed a decreasing trend after thetreatment, but this result did not differ signicantly (19.2 pg/ mL at pre-therapy and 16.1 pg/mL at the eighth vaccination, P=0.63). In contrast, average IL-6 level in the PPV-alone arm signicantly increased after the treatment (9.2 pg/mL atpre-therapy and 19.4 pg/mL at the eighth vaccination, P=0.04) (Fig. 3f). Clinical responses. At the end of follow up, 45 of 65 patients (69%) had progressed or died: 19 of 30 patients (63%) in the PPV plus HM arm and 26 of 35 patients (74%) in the PPV- alone arm. Median duration of follow up was 14.3 months(IQR, 7.4 -30.7 months): 14.9 months in the PPV plus HM arm and 13.6 months in the PPV-alone arm. Median PFS in both arms was not signicantly different (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6-1.7;P=0.98): 4.6 months (95% CI, 3 -7.1 months) in thePPV plus HM arm and 4.6 months (95% CI, 10.8 - 26.3 months) in the PPV-alone arm (Fig. 4a). Median OS in the PPV plus HM arm was 15.5 months (95% CI, 7.2 - 33.6 months) and that in the PPV-alone arm was 13.6 months(95% CI, 10.8 -26.3 months). However, there was no signi- cant difference (HR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.5 -1.6;P=0.68) (Fig. 4b) Mo-MDSC and IL-6 in relation to survival. To clarify the clini- cal meaning of the frequency of Mo-MDSC and levels of IL-6, we dened the subgroups according to the increase MDSC >0.8%) and IL-6 ( >6.5 from each median value at pretreatment, and carried out an OSsubgroup analysis. Median OS times for patients with anincrease of Mo-MDSC (Mo-MDSC-High) and without an increase of Mo-MDSC (Mo-MDSC-Low) were 12.9 months (95% CI, 8.7 -22.4) and 32.6 months (95% CI, 11.9 to not reached), respectively. Patients without an increase of Mo- MDSC demonstrated a signicantly longer survival than patients with an increase of Mo-MDSC (HR, 0.48; 95% CI,0.2-0.9; P=0.026) (Fig. 4c). In contrast, median OS times for patients with an increase in IL-6 (IL-6-High) and without an increase in IL-6 (IL-6-Low) were 20 months (95% CI, 11.9-34) and 19.5 months (95% CI, 6.8 -32), respectively. There was no signicant difference in OS between the twogroups stratied by the increase in IL-6 (HR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.4-1.7,P=0.63) (Fig. 4d). Discussion With the emergence of a new class of immune-based cancer therapies, HM are expected as enhancers of the body's immu-nity.(7)TJ-41 was originally used to enhance digestive function and maintain homeostasis.(16)Recently, the action mechanisms of TJ-41 were reported in some studies, and its immunostimula-tive ability came to attract attention. Several reports demon-strated that TJ-41 enhances NK cell activity, activates anticancer immunity, and defends against infections in animal models. (8-10,13,17)TJ-25 has been known as a HM that improvesTable 1.

Based on these functions, we investigated the immunological and clinicalefcacy of HM using TJ-41 and TJ-25 in combination therapy with PPV for CRPC patients in this randomized phase II study. In the present study, the combined use of HM with PPV was well tolerated without severe AE, and reduced anorexia, but itdid not improve indices of immune function such as antigen- specic IgG or CTL. PFS and OS were not signicantly extended. In contrast, this study demonstrated that the combi-nation therapy of PPV with HM stabilized the frequency ofMo-MDSC and serum levels of IL-6 after the treatment. Mo- MDSC is one of the major groups of MDSC and has immuno- suppressive activity. Mo-MDSC were previously detected inthe serum of patients with prostate cancer and were correlated with levels of PSA, which is used as a marker of tumor bur- den. (18)The immune inhibition caused by MDSC in the can- cer-bearing patients was reported in a number of studies. Itwas also reported that MDSC correlated with the clinical can- cer stage in patients with solid tumors.(19)Our results demon- strated that patients with increased Mo-MDSC after thetreatment had shorter survival than those without increasedMo-MDSC, and the frequency of Mo-MDSC was stabilized during the combination therapy of PPV with HM. Hoelen (Poria cocos ) is one of the main components of TJ-25. It is a type of mushroom and is reported to have antitumor effects. (20) b-Glucan levels are high in mushrooms and were reported to enhance antitumor immune responses by regulating differentia-tion and function of Mo-MDSC.(21)Mushroom powder was also reported to decrease MDSC and PSA levels in patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.(22)These ndings suggest that HM inhibit the increase of Mo-MDSC underimmunotherapy with survival benets. However, more researchis needed to validate the ndings of the present study. It should also be noted that the increase in IL-6 was stabi- lized by combined usage of TJ-41 apreventive effect on surgical sion the represen- tative inflammatory cytokine. IL-6 affects the biologicalactivity of the cancer cell as well as inflammation.(23-25) Chronic inflammation may promote the development, progres- sion, and immunosuppression of cancers.(25, 26)Constitutional activation of STAT3 is associated with the transition to castra-tion-resistance of prostate cancer and IL-6 is a major activator of JAK/STAT3 signaling.(23,24)STAT3 is considered to be the main transcription regulator in the expansion of MDSC.(27) These results suggest that IL-6 is crucial for aggressive tumorgrowth and the transition to castration-resistance of prostate cancer by the dual effects of IL-6 on tumor cells and MDSC expansion.(28)A recent report showed that IL-6 and MDSC have positive correlation.(29)We previously reported thatincreased IL-6 levels before PPV was an unfavorable factor for (HR, 0.024; 95% effects of TJ-41 and TJ-25 on increased IL-6 levels may be benecial for controlling prostatecancer progression. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that combination ther- apy of PPV with HM is well tolerated and, although the com- bination with HM had no signicant impact on antigen-specicIgG, CTL, PFS, or OS, PPV with combined use of HM stabi-lized the increase of Mo-MDSC and IL-6 in patients with CRPC during PPV treatment. These results suggest that the combined use of HM has the potential to prevent immunosup-pression induced by Mo-MDSC or IL-6 during immunother- apy.
