This is false; public health authorities and experts around the world have found no evidence the shots harm male fertility. \"Sperm is replaced completely by spike protein in 'vaccinated,'\" claims an April 8, 2023 [Instagram caption](https://perma.cc/JWL6-26ZV). The post shares an image with a quote attributed to Arne Burkhardt, a German researcher whom AFP [has previously](https://cinjenice.afp.com/doc.afp.com.9WH7MV) fact-checked for spreading vaccine misinformation. \"If I were a woman in fertile age, I would not plan a motherhood from a man who was vaccinated,\" the quote says. The same claim circulated on [Rumble](https://perma.cc/6DK8-S8FQ) in which Burkhardt discusses [messenger shots [harm ](/covid-19-vaccine-not-shown-cause-female-sterilization)female fertility. Experts say safety monitoring [has not detected](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/vaccines/2021/09/covid-19-vaccines-fertility.pdf?sc_lang=en) problems for men, either. \"Based on the studies published so far, there is no scientific proof of any association between Covid-19 vaccines and fertility impairment in men or women,\" says an October 2022 [analysis ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9464596/#:~:text=Conclusion,impairment%20in%20men%20or%20women.)of research from around the world. [Guidance](https://perma.cc/V7YZ-CE9B) from the Canadian Fertility and Andrology Society [says](https://cfas.ca/_Library/COVID19/CFAS_COVID_UPDATE_JANUARY_2022.pdf): \"All advisory and regulatory bodies recommend that Covid-19 vaccinations are safe for people attempting to conceive.\" Spike protein The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 [vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/how-they-work.html?s_cid=11344:how%20does%20mrna%20vaccine%20work:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY21) work differently than other shots. Traditional vaccines contain weakened or dead forms of a virus so that the immune system can recognize and build antibodies against it. Covid-19 mRNA vaccines, meanwhile, deliver instructions to cells on how to build a harmless piece of the spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus, teaching the body to recognize and fight the real thing. \"It is true that the mRNA from the vaccine goes to other places in the body, other than the muscle where it is injected,\" said [James Lawler](https://perma.cc/U3AN-6FKR), a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Nebraska. But there is no evidence this is harmful. \"Just the fact that there is spike protein in other places in the body doesn't necessarily mean that that is detrimental,\" Lawler said April 13. \"It means that the body is developing an immune response in multiple places, which is probably a beneficial thing.\" Lawler contrasted the body's response to vaccination with a Covid-19 infection, in which affected cells can express spike protein all over the body for a longer period of time. \"All of the data and all of the studies show consistently that you are much worse off getting Covid than you are from any potential side effects from the vaccines,\" he said. Research demonstrates safety Multiple studies have found the Covid-19 vaccines pose no danger to male fertility. \"After receiving the two doses of the vaccines, we did not observe a clinically significant sperm parameter decline within the cohort, suggesting the vaccines do not negatively impact male fertility potential,\" says a 2021 [study](https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(21)01398-4/fulltext) that the [American Society for Reproductive Medicine](https://www.asrm.org/) sent to AFP.
