Many techniques work.", "sitename": "EurekAlert!", "date": "2023-08-15", "cleaned_text": "A new set of national guidelines recommends that cancer patients use mind-body techniques \u2014 particularly mindfulness meditation \u2014 to ease anxiety and depression during and after treatment. Yoga, hypnosis, acupuncture, and music therapy were also among the \"integrative oncology\" interventions that showed strong enough evidence to recommend to patients. Other methods, such as inhaling lavender essential oils during cancer-related medical procedures, came with weaker recommendations due to less compelling data \u2014 but still would do no harm and may provide some benefit, researchers said. A University of Rochester [Wilmot Cancer Institute](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/cancer-institute.aspx) oncologist, [Alissa Huston, M.D](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/people/21788079-alissa-huston-porter)., associate professor of Medicine and Hematology/Oncology, was part of a national team that reviewed scientific data and made the recommendations based on clinical study outcomes. [The guidelines were recently published](https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.23.00857) in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. \"It's so exciting to have these tools to utilize \u2014 and to have the scientific evidence to back up what works for anxiety and depression in people with cancer,\" said Huston, who practices mostly at Wilmot's Pluta location in Henrietta, and is co-medical director of the Pluta Integrative Oncology and Wellness Center. \"Now, we have evidence-based guidelines for mind-body therapies, similar to what we use to guide other treatments for cancer,\" Huston said. \"This will help our patients with decision-making, and we can educate them about what is effective and safe.\" More than 40% of individuals with cancer report anxiety or depression associated with the diagnosis and may suffer a reduced quality of life, Huston said. She and co-authors reviewed 110 studies on integrative oncology interventions. [The Society for Integrative Oncology (SIO) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) convened the expert panel](https://integrativeonc.org/latest-news/441-sio-asco-new-recommendations-for-use-of-integrative-therapies-for-anxiety-and-depression) One interesting outcome of the study: Supplements were not recommended. Although many cancer patients take supplements for anxiety, Huston said, scientific data is inconclusive and some studies show they can be unsafe due to harmful interactions with cancer medications. She suggested that patients talk candidly with their physicians about all vitamins and supplements they are taking. What is Integrative Medicine? It's a growing field that combines well-researched complementary therapies with well-researched conventional medicine, tailored to a patient's symptoms and needs. Integrative oncology is specific to cancer, and emphasizes lifestyle changes and mind-body practices that can be used alongside cancer treatment. Wilmot is somewhat unique in that it's integrative oncology and wellness center is available, cost-free, for all Wilmot patients throughout the 27-county upstate New York region it serves. The national study noted that despite widespread acceptance of integrative oncology, roadblocks do exist. - A lack of understanding by some doctors has been a problem, but may become less of an issue now that the SIO-ASCO guidelines are peer-reviewed and published. - Distance to services is often a problem for patients. - Integrative oncology services are not always covered by insurance. *At services are free to all cancer patients \u2014 thanks to support from the [Pluta Cancer Center Foundation](https://plutacancerfoundation.org/).
