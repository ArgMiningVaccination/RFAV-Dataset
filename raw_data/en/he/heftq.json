But did you know the scent in scented candles can be incredibly toxic? Introducing the non-toxic alternative; aromatherapy candles. If you're anything like me, you may notice yourself experiencing ultra-sensitivity to things like cleaning products, air fresheners, insect repellants, and regular scented candles. And, also like me, you may notice that every time you use these products, you end up with headaches for days. Well, I'm here to tell you that, unless you're going a little too hard on the vino nights, your headaches are most likely caused by the toxic chemicals that are used to produce these fragrances. I'll phrase that another way for you: these products might be making you sick. The 'Questionable' Ingredients Sometimes Found in Candles We all know how relaxing it can be to light a candle and jump in the bath to unwind. Or to simply light a candle to cosy up the home or to kickstart our creative spark. But did you know the scent in scented candles can be incredibly toxic? Let's take a look at the three main components of a candle; the wax, the wick and the scent. The Wax A common ingredient in cheaper candles is called paraffin wax. Derived from petroleum, paraffin contains carcinogens such as toluene and benzene. What's a carcinogen? The definition is: \"a substance capable of causing cancer in living tissue.\" Eek! Paraffin also contains a bunch of chemicals with varying levels of known harmful effects (chemicals like Acetone, Trichlorofluoromethane, Carbon Disulfide, 2-Butanone, Xylene, and Cyclopentene, and many others). ( [Source](https://wellnessmama.com/22656/dont-use-scented-candles/)) The Wicks While not common these days, some candles still use wicks containing heavy metals like lead. While using lead-based wicks in candles is banned in many countries, if you're buying online, it's worth investigating this. The Scents Those 'great smells' are caused by a synthetic chemical used in the fragrances, which are derived from petrochemicals. Some of these chemicals are known endocrine disruptors (something that interferes with the hormones), carcinogens, and have been linked with reproductive birth defects ( [Source](https://cehn.org/our-work/eco-healthy-child-care/ehcc-faqs/fragrances/#:~:text=Many%20synthetic%20chemicals%20in%20fragrances,toluene%2C%20which%20are%20known%20carcinogens.)). They're also extra harmful to people with allergies and asthma. Suddenly those vanilla-smelling candles don't smell so tasty, do they? What About the Research? Now it would be remiss of me to not acknowledge that the science on the harm caused by burning paraffin wax is not well-researched or well-documented, and [some existing studies have been questioned](https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/a25656783/candles-bad-for-you/). Nonetheless, these truths do give me just enough pause to consider whether these products are really needed in our households. Plus, the aforementioned headaches I used to experience when burning these products was a pretty sure sign for me that there had to be a less toxic alternative. There Are No Toxic Chemicals in GGCo.
