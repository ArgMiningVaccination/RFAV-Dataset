Like yoga, the osteopathic approach to wellness focuses on your body's natural tendency toward health and self-healing. \"The purpose of yoga is to build strength, awareness and harmony in both the mind and body,\" explains Natalie Nevins, DO, a board-certified osteopathic family physician and certified Kundalini Yoga instructor in Hollywood, California.
