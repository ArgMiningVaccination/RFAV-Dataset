Yet there is no standard reference for prescribi ng frequency data. The multiple sources that do exist vary in their sampling methods, target populations, nomenclature, and methods of tallying individu al medications prescribed or dispensed. These differences are likely to create ambi guity and contradictions in the scientific literature, but they are not well understood. Methods: We conducted a descriptive study to exam ine the similarities and differences between 5 well-known sources of prescribi ng frequency data: the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS, emergency department and outpa tient department), the IMS National Prescription Drug Audit, the Solucient outpatient dataset, and the Solucient inpatient dataset. We compared survey methods, cost s, overall frequencies, number of unique names in each database, correlations betw een frequency estimates from different databases, the extent of overlap in the data bases, and nomenclature differences between and within datasets. Results: All the correlations between frequency es timates derived from different datasets were significant, but the frequency estim ates differed considerably. The lowest correlation (0.17) was found between the IM S and emergency department of the 3NHAMCS, and the highest correlation (0.93) wa s between IMS and Solucient outpatient data. Conclusions: Although there were significant correla tions between frequency estimates for comparable datasets, sampling methods and nomenclature choices resulted in important differences both for individual drug products and for overall frequency statistics. Researchers need to be aware of the differences when deriving drug frequency with these datasets. Key Words : prescription, frequency, pharmac y, NAMCS, NHAMCS, IMS, Solucient Word Count (main body text) : 3620 Take-home messages: 1. Correlations between frequency estimates from public and proprietary drug datasets range from small to large. 2. High correlation was found betw een proprietary datasets . Moderate correlation was found between public and proprietary datasets. 3. Correlations between drug frequency datasets appear to depend on sampling frame, data collection method, a nd nomenclature differences. 4. Total prescribing frequency estimated from the five datasets differs significantly. 5. Each of the five prescription drug da tasets provides unique opportunity to investigate various issues re lated to drug frequency; how ever, researchers need to be aware of the different definition of drug frequency between the datasets. 4 Introduction Knowing how frequently a drug product is pr escribed or dispensed is important for market planning, evaluating market performan ce and sales, and designing strategies for research and development of new drugs. It is also an important factor to consider in pharmacoepidemiological research and in h ealth policy decision-making. In the study of medication errors, combining prescribing fre quency information with accurate estimates of error rates can produce estimates of the total number of errors committed per year. Frequency is also the single most important ps ycholinguistic variable affecting errors in word memory and perception,1-10 and can play an important role in predicting look-alike and sound-alike medication errors. Generally speaking, common words are easier to recall and recognize than rare words. When two drugs are in volved in a look-alike sound- alike mistake, it is often the case that the high-frequency drug was dispensed when a low- frequency drug was actually prescribed. Our interest in drug frequency originat ed in medication errors involving drug name confusion, but soon we found that, unlike common English words, there is no consistent estimate on drug name frequency. Despite the relevance and usefulness of information about medication prescribing frequency, there are relatively few datasets with such information in the United States . Unlike countries with single-payer systems (e.g., Canada), the lack of a national health care system and a comprehensive healthcare dataset in the United States makes it almo st impossible to obtain accurate and timely 5information on prescription drugs used by th e entire U.S. population at all healthcare settings. Several public and proprietary datasets ha ve been used by previous studies to approximately estimate prescribing freque ncy in the United States. The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) are two public datasets that collect information on the use of medications.11 One of the most commonly used proprie tary data sources is from the IMS Health,12 which has been used by the pharmaceu tical industry, researchers, and government agencies to estimate the national sa les of pharmaceuticals. Solucient, another commercial source that claims to be maintaining the largest healthcare database in the United States, also provides prescription drug frequency and other healthcare information to thousands of clients. 13 Although these datasets all provi de information on frequency of drug utilization, the spec ific methods used to collect the data might cause a difference in frequency estimates. This study was conducted to quantify and explain similarities and differences between these well-known a nd widely-used public and proprietary prescribing frequency datasets. Methods Data sources Two publicly available datasets, NAMCS and NHAMCS, and three commercial datasets were included in this study. The commercial datasets were the IMS National Prescription Audit Plus (outpatient data, deno ted as 'IMS' from here on), the Solucient Hospital Drug Utilization Database (inpatient data , denoted as 'Solucient inpatient' from 6here on), and the Claims Data Warehouse (outpatient data, denoted as 'Solucient outpatient' from here on).14-16 Both the NAMCS and NHAMCS are national probability sample surveys conducted annually by National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Center for Disease Control and Prevention.11 At the time the data were obtained (f all 2003), the latest data from NAMCS and NHAMCS were from the year 2000. NHAMCS dataset includes two subsets: one was based on visits made to outpatient department of hospitals (OPD), and the other included only visits made to emergency rooms of hos pitals (ED). Although IMS had more current data, for consistency we used only the year 2000 data in our comp arisons. Solucient drug frequency data were provided in aggregate over a three-year span (three year aggregate from 2000 to 2002 for Solucient outpatient and from July 1999 to June 2002 for Solucient inpatient). In our preliminary analysis, we found th at the OPD data from NHAMCS were more similar in nature to the NAMCS than to the ED data from NHAMCS. The OPD part of NHAMCS was therefore combined with the NAMCS data and referred to as \"NAMCS+OPD\". We treated ED as a standalo ne dataset for correlational analyses on drug frequency. Generic and brand names were used inc onsistently by the datasets. The 'drug mentions' of NAMCS and NHAMCS and drug names in IMS datasets contained a combination of generic and brand names. Solucient outpatient dataset listed both generic and brand names side by side, and Solucient in patient dataset consisted mostly of generic names. 7Comparisons Projected national frequency estimates, da ta collection method, time lag for updates, number and types of drugs, and cost to use the datasets were compared. Pearson correlation among drug frequency was computed using the names listed in the five datasets. Due to the heterogeneity in nomenc lature among the datasets, we performed two additional correlation studies as sensitivity an alyses: one converting all drug names into generic names and the other using only the one-word drug names. The conversion to generic names was carried out by linking drug names to the FDA Orange Book17 and the generic-brand names lookup table compiled from NAMCS and NHAMCS documentation. Analyses ba sed on these derived generic names presumably provide an estimate of maximum possible correlations when nomenclature differences are ignored. The exclusion of non-one-word drug names eliminates the variation between datasets in coding com ponents of drug names (e.g., whether salt or strength was included as pa rt of a drug name). Correlations only provide information on th e similarity between datasets in the ranking of drug frequencies, but not in the estimates of drug frequency. A list of 20 most frequently prescribed medications in NAMCS +OPD was used to compare the differences in frequencies estimated by the five datase ts and to examine whether the differences followed any discernable pattern. 8Results Sampling Frame NAMCS and NHAMCS. NAMCS is an annual survey with a national probability multistage-sample design that i nvolves samples from primary sampling units (PSUs), physician practices within PSUs, and patient visits within physician practices. The target universe of the NAMCS is visi ts made to the offices of non-federally employed physicians in the United States. The sampling method of NHAMCS is a four- stage probability design that involves samples of PSUs, hospitals within PSUs, clinics within hospitals, and patient visits within clinics. The NHAMCS includes an outpatient clinic dataset (OPD) and emergency room vis its dataset (ED). Medications collected in the NAMCS and NHAMCS are called \"drug mentions\" which included up to 6 medications that \"were ordered, supplied, admi nistered or continued\" during a visit. These mentions could be prescription dr ugs, OTC medications, immunizations, allergy shots, anesthetics, and non-pharmaceutical products.11 IMS. The sampling frame for IMS includes chain, independent, and food store pharmacies, as well as mass merchandisers and discount houses. Not included in the sampling frame are HMO pharmacies that serve HMO members only, dispensing physicians, hospital pharmacies, clinic pharm acies, and home healthcare. A stratified random sample of about 20,000 networked drug stores is taken from the 29,000 reporting stores in IMS Health's pharmacy database through stratif ying pharmacies by region, type, and size. Every new and refilled prescripti on is collected each day from the sample 9pharmacies. Altogether, the sample pharmacies constitute more than half of all retail pharmacies in the US.18 Solucient Outpatient. The sampling frame of Solucient outpatient data is a claims data warehouse. A sample of 1.2 milli on covered lives is drawn from the universe of 170.47 million covered lives to produce a nationally re presentative sample. With projection, the sample can refl ect the utilization of health services by people covered under the employment-based, priv ate health insurance, whic h constituted about 60% of the U.S. population in 2003. Solucient Inpatient. The sampling frame in this dataset is all discharges from short-term, general, non-fed eral hospitals in the US. In the year 2000, nearly 150 healthcare organizations and 2.1 million disc harges from a universe of 35.4 million discharges nationally were included in the dataset. The sampled discharge data are projected to reflect approximately 20 million, or more than 50% of all-payer discharges annually in the U.S. Time Lag of Updates Solucient datasets are upda ted quarterly, with a time lag of approximately 6 months. NAMCS and NHAMCS are released an nually with a time lag of about 2 years from the end of a survey year to the time the datasets are released to the public. There is almost no time lag for IMS. Reliability of Estimates In both NAMCS and NHAMCS, estimates that are based on fewer than 30 records or have a Relative Standard Error (RSE) of greater than 30% are considered 10unreliable. The RSE is calculated by dividing the standard error (sampling error) by the estimate itself. 19, 20 The IMS dataset considers any medication with fewer than five thousand projected prescriptions per month as unreliable. Re liability data for Solucient estimates were not provided in the documentation. Costs NAMCS and NHAMCS data can be freely downloaded from the web site of NCHS. One CD-ROM of the survey data can also be requested without charge. IMS and Solucient (includes both the i npatient and outpatient) datasets can easily cost tens of thousands of dollars each, depending on the amou nt and type of data requested and the availability of discounts. Number and Type of Drugs NAMCS 2000. There were 2187 unique drug menti ons in the dataset, with 74.2% of them were prescription drug names, 18.2% were OTC medications, and 7.6% were neither (e.g., shampoo). After weighting, th ese names produced a total frequency of 1263.5 million 'drug' mentions for all visits made to physician's office in year 2000. NHAMCS 2000. The ED subset had 1721 unique drug mentions and a weighted drug frequency of 173.5 million. The OPD subs et had 2273 unique drug mentions, which, after weighting, gave a dr ug frequency of 129.9 million. IMS 2000. In the year 2000, there were 6400 drug names listed, but only 3990 had a frequency greater than 0. The dataset estimates are by the thousands; therefore, drugs with fewer than a thousand prescriptio ns in the reporting period were assigned a frequency of zero. The weighted freque ncy gave an estimate of 3126.6 million 11prescriptions, which represents the total num ber of prescriptions dispensed at pharmacies in the year. Solucient Outpatient. The Solucient outpatient da taset had 5572 unique brand names, which together produced a weight ed prescription number of 3841.2 million from January 2000 to December 2002. Dividing the frequency by three, we obtained an estimate of 1280.4 million prescriptions, wh ich represents the total number of prescriptions submitted every year for reimbursement purposes by the 60% of the US population who were covered under employ ment-based health insurance. Solucient Inpatient. The inpatient prescription dr ug dataset compiled data from July 1999 to June 2002. There were 2448 drug names (mostly generic names) in the dataset, which constituted a total frequency of 95.8 million over the three-year period. If divided by three, the estimated number of 31.9 million annual prescriptions represents the use of medications by the 20 million discha rges included in the sampling frame. Shared Drug Names Among the Datasets The five datasets altogether listed 12,747 unique drug names. One-quarter of the drug names appeared only in the IMS 2000 dataset, one-fifth only in Solucient outpatient, 14% only in Solucient inpatient, 6% only in NAM CS+OPD and less than 2% only in ED. Only 84 names were common to all five datasets. If only considering th e outpatient datasets (i.e., NAMCS+OPD, ED, IMS, Solucient outpat ient), 702 drug names were found to be in all four datasets. Further removing th e ED dataset from consideration, 1055 drug names were found to be present in NAMCS+O PD, IMS, and Solucient outpatient. IMS and NAMCS+OPD shared 1522 names, whic h represented only 23.8% of 6400 IMS 12names and 56.3% of the 2703 NAMCS+OPD na mes but they constituted 77.6% of IMS and 81.9% of NAMCS+OPD total drug name frequency. A similar situation was observed between drug names common to Solucient outpatient and NAMCS+OPD datasets. Together, the statistics indicate th at, despite the relatively small number of names in NAMCS+OPD dataset, they have considerable representation in the two commercial datasets in terms of the total number of prescriptions. Correlation of Drug Frequency by Listed Drug Names in the Five Datasets Table 1 gives the correlation coefficients and the corresponding number of names shared by datasets. All the correlations were sign ificant at the p< 0.001 level. --------------------------------- Insert Table 1 about here. ------------------ ---------------- NAMCS+OPD has a moderate correlation wi th the other three outpatient datasets (i.e., ED, IMS, and Solucient outpatient), which ranged fr om 0.635 (ED) to 0.720 (IMS). The ED dataset derived from the NHAMCS had a moderate correlation with NAMCS+OPD, but weak correlations with al l the other datasets (ranging from 0.133 with Solucient outpatient to 0.237 with So lucient inpatient). The two commercial outpatient datasets, IMS and Solucient, were highly correlated (r= dataset (Soluc ient inpatient) did not correl ate well with any of the other datasets. The highest correl ation was with IMS (r=0.372), an d the lowest was with ED (r=0.237). 13Correlations of Drug Frequency by Generic Names IMS 2000 and NAMCS+OPD 2000 . After converting all the drug names into generic names, 701 generic names were common in both the IMS and NAMCS+OPD datasets, which altogether represented 67.2% of total IMS prescriptions and 96.4% of total NAMCS+OPD drug mentions. The co rrelation of these generic names was 0.789. After removing the non-prescription drugs and vaccines from both datasets, 574 common drug names remained, yielding a correlat ion of 0.915 in their frequencies. Solucient Outpatient and NAMCS+OPD 2000. There were 433 generic names that appeared in both the Solucient ou tpatient and NAMCS+OPD datasets. The correlation between the shared generic names of the two datasets was 0.802; after the removal of non-prescription drugs and vaccines from the NAMCS, the correlation increased to 0.871. Although the number of th e matched generic names was only 372, it represents 43.7% of total So lucient outpatient prescripti on frequency and 50.0% of the NAMCS+OPD drug mentions. Correlation Between Frequencie s of One-Word Drug Names One-word drug names constituted more than 70% of the drug names in NAMCS+OPD 2000, ED 2000, and IMS 2000 da tasets, but only around 38% in Solucient outpatient and 26% in Solucient i npatient. In terms of frequency, these one- word drug names constituted more than 86 to 89% in the NAM CS+OPD 2000, ED 2000, and IMS 2000 datasets; 65% outpatient; and 31% in Solucient inpatient. Although one-word drug names constituted only a portion of total number of drug names and prescription frequency in the or iginal datasets, the magnitude of the 14correlations between these subsets differ only sl ightly from the previous analysis using complete datasets. The results suggest the representativeness of one-word drug names in the frequency database. Comparisons of Drug Frequency Table 2 lists the 20 most frequently mentioned drug names in the NAMCS+OPD 2000 and frequency estimates from the five data sets. All of the 20 dr ugs appeared in ED 2000, 19 appeared in both IMS a nd Solucient outpatie nt datasets, but only 8 appeared in Solucient inpatient dataset. The only drug mi ssing from the IMS and Solucient outpatient datasets is the influenza vaccine, which is an injectable product ofte n given at clinics but rarely dispensed directly to patients. Two significant differences in the frequency of Tylenol\u00ae and Lasix\u00ae were found between NAMCS+OPD, IMS, and Solucient outpatient datasets. Although Tylenol\u00ae, a brand name of an OTC analgesic, is frequently mentioned in visits made to the physician's office, it doe s not necessarily lead to a prescription. It is also very possible that when Tylenol\u00ae was prescribed, a gene ric version could be dispensed, which causes a discrepancy between prescription and dispensing frequency. A similar reason could also lead to the discrepancy observed in Lasix\u00ae between datasets. Both Lasix\u00ae and furosemide (generic name of Lasix\u00ae) were listed in all the five datasets; however, while 85% of the products were listed as Lasix\u00ae in NAMCS+OPD, only 5% and 6% were listed as such in IMS and Solucient outpatient. --------------------------------- Insert Table 2 about here. ------------------ ---------------- 15Overall Advantages and Disadvantages The major characteristics as well as advant ages and disadvantages of the five drug frequency datasets are given in Table 3. The most significant adva ntages of NAMCS and NHAMCS are the low cost, and the opportunity to study medications being mentioned in physicians' offices and the co-prescribing of medications in a patie nt visit. Timeliness and accurate sales data are the primary reasons for using IMS data, and Solucient inpatient is the only dataset in our study that provided information on inpatient medication use. Discussion We purposefully selected and examined fi ve datasets that have been commonly used by researchers in deriving prescribing pa tterns, drug utilization trends, total sales, prescription rate, etc., despite their vast difference in sampling frame, sample size, data collection methods. To our knowledge, there is no published study that compares and contrasts drug frequency estimated from these datasets. We found that although the ranking of drug frequency is relatively simila r across datasets, ther e were considerable differences in estimates of drug frequency a nd inclusion of drug names. The frequencies, types, and names of drugs included in each prescription dataset are mostly determined by where and how the prescription information was collected. So which dataset provides the most accurate estimates of drug frequency? From our results, it appears that the IMS datase t is more close to the commonly agreed upon estimate of roughly 3 billion outpatient prescr iptions per year in the United States. However, it should be noted that this estimate of 3 billion was in f act derived from the 16IMS data. There is no independent source to co nfirm whether this is a correct estimate of total prescribing frequency in the United States. Moreover, there is also the problem of defining what is meant by \"prescribing fr equency\" or \"total prescriptions\". NAMCS and NHAMCS measure drug menti ons, which are drugs prescribed, continued, supplied or administ ered in a visit. IMS meas ures prescriptions actually dispensed at outpatient pharmacies. Solucient outpatient measures insurance claims for prescriptions. Discrepancy in frequencies es timated by these different data sources can happen when a prescription written for a patient in a visit was not filled, or a prescription filled was not claimed for reimbursement. Also, a prescription drug 'mentioned' in a patient visit might be filled for three times in a pharmacy and lead to three claims. Vaccines administered to patient in physic ian's office might be captured by the NAMCS but most likely would not be included in IMS dispensing data. Not to mention that Solucient outpatient dataset is based only on information from people covered by employment-based health insurance and does not provide valid means to derive national statistics on drug utilization. When these datase ts refer to prescribing frequency or total prescriptions, they are not referri ng to the same underlying quantity. Furthermore, in any given year, a sign ificant portion of NAMCS drug mentions were coded as 'illegible', for example, 7.5% of drug mentions in the year 2000 NAMCS were illegible and could not be categorized by any drug characterist ics (e.g., brand name or generic drug, prescription drug or OTC). Similarly, while IMS data can accurately capture prescriptions dispensed at outpat ient pharmacy, it could not capture the drug samples supplied to patients by physicians. Acco rding to a report in 2004, the retail value 17of free samples given to physicians for pr omotion purpose in the United States could amount to $16.4 billion,21 when the total expenditure on prescription drugs of the year was about $164 billion.22 Another cause of the divergent estimate s of drug frequency was the different naming conventions used by the five datasets that we compared. Different datasets adopt different methods of abbreviating drug name s and include different components (salt, strength, formulation) in drug names. These differences will continue to pose a problem when researchers attempt to corroborate results or construct a more comprehensive picture of medication usage from multiple source s. A possible solution is to use tools that can link across and map major proprietary and public healthcare datasets. The clinical drug nomenclature of RxNorm database developed by the U.S. National Library of Medicine is one such effort to tackle the problem of different naming and coding conventions. 23 There are still other dimensions of pres cribing frequency that these databases do not address. For example, how many unique patients were exposed to a given drug in a given year? How many new prescriptions were written? How many refills? How many milligrams of the active ingredient were consumed per person per year? How many units of the drug product were manufactured or sh ipped to wholesalers in a given year? How many different physicians prescribed the drug ? Hence, prescribing frequency can mean different things to different people and in different datasets. With this study, we attempted to draw attention to the dive rsity of meanings, methods, and measures associated with this basic concept and to caution researchers to keep this diversity in 18mind when analyzing and interp reting results that incorporat e one or another measure of prescribing frequency. There are several limitations to this study. The two Solucient datasets we acquired are aggregated frequencies over a three-year period. This limitation makes the datasets less comparable with other datasets in te rms of time horizon. Comparability problems also may result from differences in reliab ility between and within datasets. When estimating frequency and performing correlations, all the available drugs in each dataset, regardless their degree of reliability or lack of reliability data (as in the case of Solucient datasets), were included in analyses. The read ers should also note that the results from the commercial sources were based on the specific data \"cuts\" we obtained, which may be different from what the owners of the data sets can potentially provide. More detailed information, including information relate d to the drug products , prescribers or pharmacies, may be available from the data pr oviders. Most of the analyses were based on year 2000 data, which are almost five y ears old now and may not reflect the more recent trends. Conclusion Although there are significant correlations between datase ts in their estimates of drug frequency, the estimates differ considerab ly due to the different methods employed to sample and measure drug frequency. Resear chers need to be aware of the differences when using the datasets to deri ve drug related statistics. 19References 1. Glanzer M, Bowles N.
