Homeopathy Homeopathy was discovered by Samuel Hahnemann in Germany in 1796. Hahnemann was appalled by the then modern day treatments of bloodletting and toxic chemicals. So he looked for a way of using non toxic remedies to treat various illnesses. He believed in a 'vital force' which controls the body. This 'vital force' is responsible for the general well-being. He discovered that if you use substances which induce symptoms, your own body will try and heal itself. This principle is commonly known as 'like cures like' and is the basis of homeopathy. Hahnemann further discovered that you will need to dilute the active ingredients to get its full potential. He also worked out that if you dilute the dilution it will be more potent. So a 30C dilution is stronger than a 6C dilution. Homeopathic Remedies At the Stirling Health Food Store we sell 30C dilutions of homeopathic remedies.
