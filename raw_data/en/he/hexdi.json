The most popular method of extracting these oils is through water distillation. With this method, the plant parts are put into water and brought to a boil. During this process, the essential oils appear in the water. Once the process is completed, the highly concentrated essential oil is separated from the rest of the liquid. For this reason, you should avoid using a pure essential oil on its own. The ways in which you can use essential oils include: Massage. If you decide to apply the essential oil directly on your skin, you should dilute it into a carrier oil like coconut, almond, olive, or jojoba oil. Diffuser. Add a few drops of essential oil to some water and use a diffuser to emit a nice pleasant aroma in your room throughout the entire day. Spray, cream, or roll-on. There are some products that contain essential oil extract. If you decide to go for this option, aim for a safe, reputable brand to guarantee you're getting high-quality ingredients. Disclaimer: Before starting an essential oil treatment, always consult your doctor to ensure that the oils you intend to use are safe and you have no allergic reaction. If you suffer from asthma, avoid using an essential oil diffuser because this might trigger an asthma attack. What's Hormonal Imbalance? Hormone imbalance is defined by having any of your hormones outside their normal range. These hormones could be estrogen, testosterone, thyroid hormones, cortisol, and insulin among others. Here are a few common hormone imbalance issues you should watch out for: #1. Cortisol Imbalance If you are under stress, your cortisol levels increase as part of your \"fight or flight\" response. However, when this happens on a regular basis, your adrenal glands will keep producing high levels of cortisol. This might lead to: Feeling tired Having more energy during the night Craving high-calorie foods Sleep disturbances If this constant stress persists for a long period of time you can even suffer more serious health conditions like adrenal fatigue and adrenal insufficiency. #2. Sex Hormone Imbalance You might experience a hormone imbalance of your estrogen, testosterone, and progesterone levels if you're entering menopause, or after giving birth (known as the baby blues or postpartum depression). Hormone imbalances during menopause might cause: Hot flashes Night sweats Low sex drive Anxiety Sleep disturbances Another instance when you might experience slight changes in your hormone levels is every month, the week before and during your period. The effects surrounding your period aren't exactly a hormone imbalance. However, the hormone changes might cause symptoms like: Mood swings Anxiety Cramps Irritability Changes in your sex drive Headaches Breast tenderness #3. Thyroid Hormone Imbalance Your thyroid hormones are responsible for controlling your metabolism and your digestive, muscle, and brain functions. If your thyroid hormones are out of balance you might experience symptoms like: Sudden weight loss or weight gain Having sleep problems Muscle weakness Irritability Anxiety But what causes hormonal imbalance in the first place? What Causes Hormonal Imbalance? Hormone imbalance can be caused by things like: Chronic stress Bad diet Unhealthy habits such as excessive smoking and drinking Sleep deprivation Even if one of your hormones is out of balance, it will affect the production and proper functioning of other hormones in your body. For example, if you're under constant stress, your adrenal glands will pump out excess cortisol. As a result, your body will prioritize the production of cortisol over other hormones like estrogen and serotonin. If you experience severe hormone imbalance we recommend seeking the help of a medical professional. However, if you feel mild hormone imbalances like PMS, transitioning to menopause, or being under stress, aromatherapy with certain essential oils can help you regain your hormone balance and provide relaxation. So, which essential oils can help you? How Essential Oils Help With Hormone Balance Whenever the body senses danger, the amygdala (the emotional center of our brain) triggers the production of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. Now, when we inhale essential oils, the pleasant scent travels to the amygdala and activates the release of \"feel-good\" endorphins, like serotonin. This, in turn, decreases cortisol production and alleviates feelings of anxiety, stress, and depression. Some essential oils are also believed to reduce menstrual cramps, boost libido, and impact issues such as infertility, PCOS, and low progesterone levels. We've made a list of our top 17+ essential oil picks and the different hormonal benefits they provide, in the section below. But before we dive into them, it's important to note that although most essential oils are safe to use and free of negative side effects. However, they still need to be handled properly, and be used in moderation. We'd also recommend never eating or drinking these substances, but rather, inhaling or applying a few drops onto the skin. 17+ Essential Oils for Hormone Balance #1.

To relieve menstrual cramps, dilute clary sage in a carrier oil (such as coconut oil), and apply on the lower abdominal area. For hot flashes and overall adrenal support, apply the substance around the neck and over the kidney area. #2. Ylang Ylang In traditional medicine, Ylang Ylang is used to increase the libido in both men and women. This makes it a great option for menopausal women trying to increase their sex drive.
