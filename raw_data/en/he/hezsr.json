As a result, decisions about vaccine boosters based on breakthrough infection rates and the decline of antibody titers have commanded worldwide attention and research. COVID-19 patients have displayed continued severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-spike-protein-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in longitudinal studies; in addition, cytokine activation has been detected at early steps following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Epitopes that are highly reactive and can mediate long-term antibody responses have been identified at the spike and ORF1ab proteins. The N-terminal domain of the S1 and S2 subunits is the location of important SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitopes. High sequence identity between earlier and newer variants of SARS-CoV-2 and different degrees of sequence homology among endemic human coronaviruses have been observed. Understanding the extent and duration of protective immunity is consequential for determining the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further knowledge of memory responses to different variants of SARS-CoV-2 is needed to improve the design of the vaccine.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-05-12", "cleaned_text": "Long-Term Immunity and Antibody Response: Challenges for Developing Efficient COVID-19 Vaccines [https://doi.org/10.3390/antib11020035](https://doi.org/10.3390/antib11020035) [Antibodies, B Cell Responses and and MERS-CoV, is mainly a respiratory virus that causes manifestations and illnesses ranging from minor infections to severe acute respiratory syndrome, leading to multiorgan failure and death in some cases. Various COVID-19 protection and management strategies, such as convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies, off-label drugs, and numerous vaccinations, using advances in materials science strategies for targeted delivery, are being investigated in reaction to the outbreak [ [1](#B1-antibodies-11-00035)]. About 200 vaccine candidates are now being studied worldwide, but work on a harmless and highly immunogenic COVID-19 vaccine is still ongoing. Inability to produce long-term immunity and a failure to control the cytokine storm are serious roadblocks in improving and approving the COVID-19 vaccine [ [2](#B2-antibodies-11-00035)]. [Table 1](#antibodies-11-00035-t001)summarizes some of the benefits and drawbacks of various vaccination types. [Table 2](#antibodies-11-00035-t002)). Furthermore, the cold chain requirement, particularly ultra-cold chains for mRNA-based vaccines, obstructs vaccine distribution in impoverished countries [ [1](#B1-antibodies-11-00035)]. The continuing evolution and successive virus mutations, which can considerably diminish vaccine-induced immunity, are further obstacles [ [11](#B11-antibodies-11-00035)]. While no data of \"antigenic drift\" have been found, such as with the influenza virus, mutations can happen and vaccine-mediated immune selection pressure may speed the escape mutants' rise, as has been documented with other infections [ [12](#B12-antibodies-11-00035), [13](#B13-antibodies-11-00035)]. Therefore, COVID-19 vaccine development must continue to be improved and researched. 2. COVID-19 Vaccine-Mediated Protection: Immunological Mechanisms [17](#B17-antibodies-11-00035)]. A 79.6% nucleotide sequence and SARS-CoV-2 has been whole-genome sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes several structural proteins: the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The S protein, a trimeric type I fusion protein found on the virion surface, is essential for viral adhesion and entrance into cells of the host. For viral infection, host proteases must cleave the S protein into 2 subunits; S1 and S2 [ [19](#B19-antibodies-11-00035)]. Virus attachment to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its entrance receptor is made virus's gets released after its interaction with ACE2. Then, for viral fusion and entry, the fusion peptide of the S2 The production of IgG, and IgM that targeted the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were detected to occur during the acute and early recovery phases of viral infection [ [22](#B22-antibodies-11-00035), [23](#B23-antibodies-11-00035)]. Factors such as age, symptomatic infection, and severity of disease seem to influence the amount of neutralizing antibodies. Elderly individuals with COVID-19 appear to have poorer neutralizing antibody responses [ [24](#B24-antibodies-11-00035), [25](#B25-antibodies-11-00035), [26](#B26-antibodies-11-00035)]. Although the plasma/serum to antigens of the virus and titers of neutralizing antibodies were reduced in certain people with symptomatic COVID-19 over time, several studies regarding the endurance of antibody responses have demonstrated that a continuous level of general long-term humoral immunity could be seen for as long as 8 to 12 months post-infection in COVID-19-convalescent patients [ [25](#B25-antibodies-11-00035), [27](#B27-antibodies-11-00035)]. In addition, the amount of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific memory B cells remained steady for 6 to 12 months at least [ [27](#B27-antibodies-11-00035)], as well as continued B-cell clonal selection and accumulation with the release of neutralizing antibodies [ [28](#B28-antibodies-11-00035)], demonstrating the continuance of lasting humoral immunity following infection by the coronavirus. [29](#B29-antibodies-11-00035), [30](#B30-antibodies-11-00035)] principally directed at epitopes found at the RBD of the S protein, which collects into trimers on the surface of the virion and enables viral entry and fusion after activating the ACE2 receptor [ [31](#B31-antibodies-11-00035)]. Other S protein regions, such as the S1 and S2 subunit N-terminal domains, include immunogenic epitopes well [ [30](#B30-antibodies-11-00035), [32](#B32-antibodies-11-00035)]. Effector pathways mediated by Fc receptors that interact with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can also protect the host, such as the antibody-mediated cell toxicity and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis by natural killer cells and macrophages or monocytes, respectively [ [33](#B33-antibodies-11-00035), [34](#B34-antibodies-11-00035)]. As well as fighting viral infections, antibodies produced by either natural infection or via vaccination can assist viral development, via elevated activation of inflammation or by heightened virus infectivity (e.g., Fc-dependent or forming antigen/antibody immune complexes) [ [35](#B35-antibodies-11-00035), [36](#B36-antibodies-11-00035)]. However, such increased viral infection has not been seen in vivo for SARS-CoV-2 infection. These differing antibody responses require a thorough investigation of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes and characteristics of antibodies epitopes. [21](#B21-antibodies-11-00035), [37](#B37-antibodies-11-00035), [38](#B38-antibodies-11-00035), [39](#B39-antibodies-11-00035)]. Some antibodies can neutralize the virus by targeting the RBD and preventing viral attachment to surface receptors of host cells and consequently inhibit viral entry and invasion. The strong neutralizing ability of synthetic peptides and antibodies against the heptad repeat region, HR2, of SARS-CoV-1's [42](#B42-antibodies-11-00035), [43](#B43-antibodies-11-00035)], most likely inhibiting the conformational modifications required for membrane fusion. Moreover, since targeting the S protein may efficiently induce the T-cell immune response, it is considered for vaccine development. As a result, attempts to produce a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have induced responses to the S protein. N and M proteins have also been found to trigger an effective cellular immune response in the body [ [44](#B44-antibodies-11-00035)]. Clinical trials are currently underway to test vaccines using N proteins (NCT04591717 and NCT04715997). [2](#B2-antibodies-11-00035)]. After vaccination, CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells develop in response to type I interferon, which regulates leukocytes and inflammation, including the stimulation of CD4+ T follicular helper (TFH) cells. This in turn allows the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells that secrete antibodies. Two primary doses of the mRNA and AdV vaccines separated by 3 to 4 weeks have been recommended. Mild to moderate adverse effects are associated with the vaccines, including transient fever, chills, and pain at the injection site. Elevated secondary immune responses may be due to \"trained immunity\", which affects the innate immune response to create immunological memory [ [45](#B45-antibodies-11-00035)], or mobilization of memory B and T cells from a previous exposure. Because the development and survival of B cells and T cell memory can be induced by type I interferon, long-term immunological memory can be promoted by the inflammation from booster vaccines. 3. What Is the Duration of COVID-19 Immunity? [46](#B46-antibodies-11-00035), [47](#B47-antibodies-11-00035)]. However, T cell evidence is still being clarified. This short-term durability will likely be enough to stop the SARS-CoV-2 spread and recover. Nevertheless, the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the appearance of S protein variations may restrict vaccination effectiveness. Because of reservoirs in unvaccinated persons and/or other species of animals, eradicating SARS-CoV-2 from people could be challenging. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines can be provided once or twice per year for persistent strains or seasonal variants. New SARS-CoV-2 vaccines can be created from variant spike protein sequences and other proteins. The formulation of the mRNA vaccine is suitable for repeated or revamped vaccination because various mRNAs, including mutant S proteins, can be readily produced and placed inside the lipid nanoparticle (LNP) carrier. Due to immune-mediated vector clearance, the AdV vector formulation results in AdV-specific immunity, limiting the efficiency of repeating boosters [ [2](#B2-antibodies-11-00035)]. [48](#B48-antibodies-11-00035)]. TRM cells can be stimulated using attenuated viral vaccine formulations and site-specific immunization. [ [48](#B48-antibodies-11-00035)]. It would be fascinating to define whether mRNA vaccines' intranasal delivery can stimulate TRM cells and lung protection. A recent study showed that an intranasal vaccine provided strong immunological protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory tract of mice [ [49](#B49-antibodies-11-00035), [50](#B50-antibodies-11-00035)]. Self-replicating mRNA vaccines (which imitate replication of viruses) can promote protective T cell immunity in a similar way. Vaccine composition and delivery mode adjustments can be used to tailor vaccinations to different immunological states and ages. [51](#B51-antibodies-11-00035)]. [52](#B52-antibodies-11-00035)]. BCG is a live attenuated tuberculosis vaccine created at the Pasteur Institute in Paris at the turn of the twentieth century. BCG-enabled trained immunity may protect against COVID-19; however, this theory must be tested in randomized clinical trials. The BRACE trial is currently investigating the use of the BCG vaccine against COVID-19 in healthcare workers (NCT04327206). In addition, there are other potential strategies to stimulate trained immunity in COVID-19. One example is the oral polio vaccine, which may provide protection for other viral infections. Another example is VPM1002, which is a novel recombinant BCG vaccine. 4. Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in the Body [53](#B53-antibodies-11-00035)]. However, patients with severe infection demonstrated more antibodies overall. In June 2021, the Moderna vaccine research group reported that, six months following their second dose, clinical trial participants were found to have high antibody levels [ [54](#B54-antibodies-11-00035)]. In March 2022, another study reported that a Moderna vaccine booster after a Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca primary immunization provided higher protection against the Omicron variant (observed 2 to 4 weeks post-booster), but the protection decreased over time (by 5 to 9 weeks post-booster) [ [55](#B55-antibodies-11-00035)]. Another investigation clarified that a low dose Moderna vaccine could elicit long-lasting antibodies, memory CD4+ T cells including TFH and IFN-expressing cells, and CD8+ T cells, enhancing cellular and humoral immunity. Finally, a new investigation reported the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine led to high levels of antibodies after a single dose, with \"minimal waning\" three months later [ [56](#B56-antibodies-11-00035)]. [57](#B57-antibodies-11-00035)]. Both groups of patients exhibited polyfunctional antibodies, that can counteract the virus or help kill virus-infected cells. The study suggests that this broad reaction may help promote longer protection in general, even if neutralizing potential decreases. Moreover, another study explored the decline of neutralizing antibodies in seven COVID-19 vaccines [ [58](#B58-antibodies-11-00035)]. Researchers believe even in the absence of the booster dose, long-term immunity of considerable people proportion kept against severe infection by an antigenically identical strain, despite susceptibility to mild disease [ [58](#B58-antibodies-11-00035)]. 5. Factors Involved in Inducing Long-Term Immunity for COVID-19 Vaccines [59](#B59-antibodies-11-00035)]. Kaneko et al., studied the underlying causes of waning and observed the lack of germinal centers in the thoracic lymph nodes of dead SARS-CoV-2 cases [ [60](#B60-antibodies-11-00035)]. They suggested that Bcl6+ follicular T-cell defects that result in loss of their ability in memory B-cell (MBC) activation are conferred in this germinal center absence. This would decrease the production of long-lasting, high-affinity antibodies, which might also elucidate why antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are rapidly fading. MBCs are assumed to be kept independently of antibody levels, implying that B-cell immunity could persist even if antibody levels decline. However, because only deceased cases were examined, these pathways may only pertain to the most severe illness. [61](#B61-antibodies-11-00035)]. Monitoring the clinical outcome of convalescent plasma transfer therapy (CPTT) may be one approach to determining antibody efficacy [ [62](#B62-antibodies-11-00035)]. CPTT trials in SARS-CoV-2 have yielded mixed results on the preventive role of neutralizing antibodies. In case-control trials for severe SARS-CoV-2, CPTT initially showed encouraging results, with some research suggesting that earlier treatment was more effective [ [62](#B62-antibodies-11-00035), [63](#B63-antibodies-11-00035)]. SARS-CoV-1 patients were also found to benefit from early CPTT [ [64](#B64-antibodies-11-00035)]. Recent findings from large-scale randomized controlled studies, on the other hand, found no significant reduction in mortality or benefits in clinical outcomes for patients with moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 who were given CPTT [ [65](#B65-antibodies-11-00035)]. As a result, the antibody response alone may not be as crucial in SARS-CoV-2 protection as previously believed. [66](#B66-antibodies-11-00035)]. Females are less likely than males to receive vaccines, but once vaccinated, they generate greater and longer-lasting protective antibody responses [ [66](#B66-antibodies-11-00035)]. Females might, however, experience adverse reactions more frequently and intensely than males who are vaccinated [ [66](#B66-antibodies-11-00035)]. Sex hormone control of immune function, and genetic and epigenetic modulation, are among the processes explaining sex disparities in vaccine response. One possible reason for the stronger and sometimes longer-lasting immunological reactions in women is that they have two X chromosomes, whereas males have only one [ [67](#B67-antibodies-11-00035), [68](#B68-antibodies-11-00035), [69](#B69-antibodies-11-00035)]. Since the X chromosome contains many genes involved in the immune system (e.g., toll-like receptor 7 [TLR7], chemokines, interleukins, microRNAs), females may express more molecules that participate in the immune response than males. [70](#B70-antibodies-11-00035)]. Another study on SARS-CoV-2-naive nursing home residents also found poor antibody responses to BNT162b2 vaccination [ [71](#B71-antibodies-11-00035)]. In this sense, the immune system's ability to function declines as people age [ [72](#B72-antibodies-11-00035)]. An abnormal, chronic, low-grade pro-inflammatory condition, which may occur at a larger level in females than in males, is a prominent characteristic of the immune system in aging [ [73](#B73-antibodies-11-00035)]. Furthermore, Wang et al., found that influenza vaccination is linked to lower hospitalization and fatality rates in older women than in men, implying that females have higher titers of the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) test or react more strongly to vaccination, resulting in better defense than men [ [74](#B74-antibodies-11-00035)]. 6. Concerns about Boosting COVID-19 Vaccines [75](#B75-antibodies-11-00035)]. Boosting may be appropriate for some persons whose first immunization, defined as the initial one-dose or two-dose series of each vaccine, did not give adequate safety, such as those given low-efficacy vaccines or who are immunocompromised [ [76](#B76-antibodies-11-00035)]. However, persons who had a poor response to the original vaccine may also have a poor response to a booster. It is uncertain if an extra dose of the same vaccine or a distinct vaccine that complements the first immune response will benefit people with compromised immune systems. Because the immune response gradually decreases after the initial vaccination and variants with novel antigens may no longer elicit a sufficient immune response, booster vaccines are recommended. [77](#B77-antibodies-11-00035)]. The long-term effect of boosters on clinical outcomes should be further investigated. Large numbers of adults in the United States are completely vaccinated, whereas others are not, and comprehensive comparisons between them are continuing. New data from sizeable studies in the United States (COVID-NET and large health maintenance organizations [ [78](#B78-antibodies-11-00035), [79](#B79-antibodies-11-00035)]) show that complete immunization against serious disease or hospitalization continues to be highly effective. 7. Conclusions and Future Prospects [80](#B80-antibodies-11-00035)]. Furthermore, lyophilized nanoparticles do not require refrigeration for storage. When targeting moieties are put on the surface of nanoparticle-based formulations, they may raise uptake by phagocytic APCs. Due to adjuvant co-delivery, APC-targeting nanoparticles are great vaccines for efficiently and appropriately training T and B cells, along with inducing high levels of antibody synthesis [ [81](#B81-antibodies-11-00035), [82](#B82-antibodies-11-00035), [83](#B83-antibodies-11-00035), [84](#B84-antibodies-11-00035)].
