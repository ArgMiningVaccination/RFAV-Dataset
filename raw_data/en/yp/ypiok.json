Epigenetics refers to the external modification of DNA that turns genes on and off, affecting gene expression. This occurs without changes in the basic structure of the DNA. This gene expression can have transgenerational effects. The major factors that cause epigenetic changes are lifestyle and behavior, diet and digestion, stress, and environmental factors. Ayurveda addresses these factors, thereby affecting the Deha (body) Prakriti (psychophysiological constitution), which corresponds to the phenotype, and indirectly the Janma (birth) Prakriti, which corresponds to the genotype. Thus, it is proposed that epigenetics is an important mechanism of Ayurveda. This correlation and understanding will lead to better communication and understanding with the current medical system, and lead to better integration of both sciences in the management of optimal health. In addition, research on Ayurvedic modalities affecting gene expression will further increase correlation and understanding between the current medical system and Ayurveda.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-12-11", "cleaned_text": "Ayurveda and Epigenetics [https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina56120687](https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina56120687) [The Future of )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-medicina-56-00687)]. All nucleated cells contain DNA. The combination of DNA creates genes. It is estimated that humans have approximately 20,000 genes. Less than 2% of these are coding genes that express themselves and are known as the genotype. The genotype refers to the part of the genetic makeup that determines specific characteristics of an individual. It is stable and non-changing unless there is toxic damage. The genotype is responsible for the development of the phenotype of the individual [ [1](#B1-medicina-56-00687)]. The phenotype refers to the physical properties of an individual\u2014appearance, development, and behavior. Whatever one does in one's life\u2014knowingly or unknowingly\u2014affects the phenotype and changes the expression of the genotype accordingly. The four major factors affecting the phenotype are lifestyle and behavior, diet and digestion, stress, and environmental factors [ [1](#B1-medicina-56-00687)]. 2. Genotype and Phenotype in Ayurveda [2](#B2-medicina-56-00687)]. The Ayurvedic understanding that Deha Prakriti has a genetic basis has been corroborated by current scientific research. For example, the phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) gene has been correlated with Pitta Prakriti (one of the Prakriti types) [ [3](#B3-medicina-56-00687)]. Research on human leucocyte antigen (HLA) gene polymorphism showed a reasonable correlation between HLA type and Prakriti type [ [4](#B4-medicina-56-00687)]. [Figure 1](#medicina-56-00687-f001)). It is proposed that mRNA, tRNA, and protein have features and properties that represent Vata, Pitta, and Kapha at the cellular level. Messenger RNA corresponds with Vata (transmission of information), tRNA corresponds with Pitta (transformation), and protein corresponds with Kapha (structure) [ [1](#B1-medicina-56-00687)] ( [Figure 1](#medicina-56-00687-f001)). methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and micro RNA (miRNA) are involved in modifying DNA expression. DNA methylation is a process in which methyl groups are added to the DNA molecule. This process changes the activity of the DNA [ [5](#B5-medicina-56-00687)]. Histones are proteins that DNA wraps around in the nucleus, forming chromatin. This process condenses DNA into a more compact form and protects the DNA structure and sequence. Chromatin can condense or it can relax, thereby changing the expression of DNA. Histones play a major role in the condensation and relaxation of chromatin and thereby affect DNA expression [ [6](#B6-medicina-56-00687)]. Chromatin remodeling refers to the rearrangement of chromatin from a condensed state to a transcriptionally accessible state, allowing transcription factors or other DNA-binding proteins to access DNA and control gene expression [ [7](#B7-medicina-56-00687)]. MicroRNA refers to small non-coding RNA molecules that \"silence\" or stop the functioning of mRNA [ [8](#B8-medicina-56-00687)]. [Figure 1](#medicina-56-00687-f001)). In the field of physics, this is represented by Newton's Third Law of Motion: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Another way of putting it is the Biblical saying \"As you sow, so shall you reap.\" Every cell is going through this process. Factors that cause epigenetic changes affect DNA expression and this can also be transmitted to the progeny [ [9](#B9-medicina-56-00687)]. [10](#B10-medicina-56-00687)]. Ayurveda addresses the factors that cause epigenetic changes, and it thereby affects both the phenotype and expression of the genotype in a positive manner. Thus, it is proposed that epigenetics is an important mechanism of Ayurveda [ [1](#B1-medicina-56-00687), [11](#B11-medicina-56-00687)]. 4. Research on the Four Major Factors that Cause Epigenetic Changes [10](#B10-medicina-56-00687), [12](#B12-medicina-56-00687)]. It has been identified that diet, obesity, physical activity, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, environmental pollutants, psychological stress, and working the night shift might modify epigenetic patterns [ [13](#B13-medicina-56-00687)]. For example, polyphenols, which are natural compounds widely found in plant foods, have been shown to modify the activity of DNA methyltransferases, histone acetylases, of including genes involved in adipogenesis, methylation patterns of obesity-related genes, and inflammation genes could help predict susceptibility and prevent obesity. Physical activity has been associated with higher methylation in peripheral blood lymphocytes of long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) elements, which are a class of repeated sequences that are highly repeated in the human genome. Low methylation in these elements is associated with inflammatory responses and chromosomal instability [ [13](#B13-medicina-56-00687)]. [13](#B13-medicina-56-00687)]. [13](#B13-medicina-56-00687)]. The following is further research on the four major factors that cause epigenetic changes. 4.1. Lifestyle and Behavior [14](#B14-medicina-56-00687)]. A study on men with prostate cancer showed that a lifestyle intervention program that included meditation, breathing exercises, aerobic exercise, and a vegetarian diet changed the expression of 500 genes, including the downregulation of disease-promoting genes involved in tumor formation [ [15](#B15-medicina-56-00687)]. A study on patients with coronary artery disease showed that a lifestyle modification program that included stress management, aerobic exercise, and a vegetarian diet resulted in successful and sustained modulation of gene expression that ameliorated cardiovascular risk [ [16](#B16-medicina-56-00687)]. A study on the impact of a health promotion intervention that included increased physical activity and increased intake of fruits/vegetables impacted patterns of DNA methylation in gene regions related to immune cell metabolism, tumor suppression, and overall aging [ [17](#B17-medicina-56-00687)]. Two additional studies have shown a linkage between exercise and DNA methylation, with concordant health-enhancing changes in the phenotype [ [18](#B18-medicina-56-00687), [19](#B19-medicina-56-00687)]. 4.2. Diet and Digestion [10](#B10-medicina-56-00687), [20](#B20-medicina-56-00687)]. For example, foods that contain B vitamins can influence DNA methylation [ [21](#B21-medicina-56-00687)]. Curcumin, one of the components L. (turmeric), is a histone deacetylase inhibitor, as demonstrated in B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells. The expression levels of several histone deacetylase enzymes were downregulated following curcumin treatment. The dysfunction of histone deacetylases is associated with the manifestation of several different types of cancer [ [22](#B22-medicina-56-00687)]. In breast cancer cells, curcumin significantly downregulated both estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and p53 protein levels, with a concomitant decrease in breast cancer cell viability. Both ER and p53 are known to contribute to the formation and progression of hormone-dependent breast cancer [ [23](#B23-medicina-56-00687)]. [24](#B24-medicina-56-00687)]. These bioactive food components have shown similar results in other types of cancer [ [25](#B25-medicina-56-00687)]. In light of these findings, an \"epigenetics diet\" has been proposed, which would utilize these bioactive dietary compounds to neutralize epigenetic aberrations as a form of cancer treatment, and be utilized as cancer prevention [ [26](#B26-medicina-56-00687)]. [27](#B27-medicina-56-00687)]. Bile acids, which are necessary for lipid digestion and absorption, are also signaling molecules. Bile acid synthesis is transcriptionally regulated in relation to the fasted-to-fed cycle. The underlying mechanisms include chromatin remodeling at promoters of key genes involved in their metabolism [ [27](#B27-medicina-56-00687)]. [28](#B28-medicina-56-00687)]. A study on herbs showed that 36% interacted with histone-modifying enzymes and 56% of these promoted chromatin condensation [ [29](#B29-medicina-56-00687)]. Withaferin A, a component of Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal been shown to downregulate DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylase in breast cancer cells and induce apoptosis of these cells [ [30](#B30-medicina-56-00687), [31](#B31-medicina-56-00687)]. 4.3. Stress [32](#B32-medicina-56-00687)]. Stress-associated epigenetic changes have been correlated with depression [ [33](#B33-medicina-56-00687)]. Feelings of anger, stress, frustration, and fear cause the DNA to become shorter and tighter, and switch off many codes. In contrast, feelings of gratitude, love, and appreciation cause the DNA to relax, and the strands unwind and begin to express [ [34](#B34-medicina-56-00687)]. A pilot study on telomerase gene expression in hypertensive patients showed that stress reduction through meditation and lifestyle modifications increased telomerase gene expression [ [35](#B35-medicina-56-00687)]. In light of these research studies, stress management can be viewed as a crucial requirement for health and well-being. In this regard, Ayurveda has long included a thorough understanding of meditation as a technique for stress management and the development of consciousness. 4.4. Environmental Factors [10](#B10-medicina-56-00687)]. Research has shown that environmental toxicants such as diesel exhaust particles, cigarette smoke, and inorganic arsenate can silence certain tumor suppressor genes, resulting in carcinogenesis [ [36](#B36-medicina-56-00687)]. Chronic sun exposure causes epigenetic changes in the skin. Hypomethylation was seen in sun-exposed epidermis samples from older individuals [ [37](#B37-medicina-56-00687)]. [9](#B9-medicina-56-00687)]. It has been shown that exposure to air pollution during gestation affects the gestating mother, her embryo, and its developing germ line, thereby influencing the third generation's phenotype [ [38](#B38-medicina-56-00687)]. Many effects of traumatic stress can be transmitted to future generations, even when individuals from these generations are not exposed to a traumatic stressor [ [39](#B39-medicina-56-00687)]. [40](#B40-medicina-56-00687)]. One of the recommendations for reducing mental stress and increasing Bala and Ojas to increase resilience is Vedic meditation, which utilizes a technique that goes beyond the mind and deep into the inner being, which is a place of peace and bliss. Research has demonstrated the health benefits of this type of meditation [ [41](#B41-medicina-56-00687)]. 5. Conclusions Funding Conflicts of Interest References - Sharma, H.; Meade, J.G.
