Postma, Jacco Wallinga Epidemiology, Mar 2018, 29(2):215-223Chapter 3 Abstract Background There are few estimates of the effectiveness of long-standing vaccination programmes in high income countries. To ll this gap, we investigate the direct and indirect effectiveness of childhood vaccination programmes on mortality at the population level in the Netherlands. Methods We focused on three communicable infectious diseases, diphtheria, pertussis, and poliomyeli- tis, for which we expect both direct and indirect effects. As a negative control, we used tetanus, a non-communicable infectious disease for which only direct effects are anticipated. Mortality data from 1903-2012 were obtained from Statistics Netherlands. Vaccination cover- age data were obtained from various ofcial reports. For the birth cohorts 1903 through 1975, all-cause and cause-specic childhood mortality burden was estimated using restricted mean lifetime survival methods, and a model was used to describe the pre-vaccination decline in burden. By projecting model results into the vaccination era, we obtained the expected bur- den without vaccination. Programme effectiveness was estimated as the difference between observed and expected mortality burden. Findings Each vaccination programme showed a high overall effectiveness, increasing to nearly 100% within ten birth cohorts. For diphtheria, 14.9% [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 12.3%, 17.6%] of mortality burden averted by vaccination was due to indirect protection. For pertussis, this was 32.1% [95% UI: 31.3%, 32.8%]. No indirect effects -17.9%, 10.7%] respectively. Interpretation Vaccination programmes for diphtheria and pertussis showed substantial indirect effects, providing evidence for herd protection. 56Population-level effectiveness of vaccination progrmmes Introduction Estimates of the effectiveness of long-standing vaccination programmes provide insight into the value of these programmes to public health (Metcalf et al., 2015). These insights are especially important for policy makers to motivate the continu- ation of these interventions in this time of increasing vaccine hesitancy (Schuchat and Bell, 2008). Halloran et al. described the overall effectiveness of a vaccination programme as the ratio of the observed disease burden in a population with a vac- cination programme, to that in a population without such a programme (Halloran and Struchiner, 1991). Such a measure takes both direct and indirect protection into account. Including indirect protection is important as it is the distinguish- ing feature of most vaccination programmes (Fine, 1993; Haber, 1997, 1999; Shim and Galvani, 2012; Metcalf et al., 2015). One approach for estimating vaccine pro- gramme effectiveness would be to compare the burden in the pre-vaccination era to the burden shortly after the introduction of the programme (Taranger et al., 2001). However, such comparisons for long-standing vaccination programmes typically ignore secular trends in disease burden. Another approach is to construct a so- called counterfactual: the expected situation had the vaccination programme not been introduced. One can then directly compare the observed disease burden (in the actual situation with an implemented vaccination programme) to the expected burden in the same population without a vaccination programme. Constructing a counterfactual is not straightforward as diverse pre-vaccination dynamics need to be taken into account. This is especially the case for the earlier vaccines, such as diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and polio, which were introduced in many high income countries in the mid-20thcentury. Indeed, few studies have focused on the effectiveness of early mass vaccination programmes due to lack of data and proper analysis methods. Here we examine the population-level overall effectiveness of vaccination program- mes on mortality burden, and show that this overall effectiveness can be partitioned into a direct and indirect component. To do so, we make use of data from the Nether- lands, where detailed mortality statistics are available from 1903 onwards (Wolles- winkel-van den Bosch et al., 1997; Van Wijhe et al., 2016). In a previous analysis of these data, we showed that the all-cause childhood mortality burden declined 57Chapter 3 exponentially over the 20thcentury, and that the mortality burden of many vaccine- preventable diseases declined at a similar exponential rate in the pre-vaccination period (Van Wijhe et al., 2016). Besides mortality data, information on vaccination coverage is available since the implementation of mass vaccination programmes in 1953. This makes the Dutch data uniquely equipped for investigating vaccination programme effectiveness. We pose the following research questions: is there evidence for indirect effects of vaccination programmes on mortality burden, and what is the magnitude of these indirect effects? To address these questions, we constructed counterfactual scenarios (i.e. scenarios in which vaccination programmes were not implemented) using a model to describe trends in the pre-vaccination era, and estimated programme effectiveness with respect to childhood mortality burden in the rst two decades following the start of mass vaccination in the 1950s. We quantied the magnitude of direct and indirect effects for three communicable vaccine-preventable diseases (diphtheria, pertussis, and polio), and one non-communicable vaccine-preventable disease (tetanus), which serves as a negative control (Lipsitch et al., 2016). Materials and methods Childhood mortality burden We used data on vaccination coverage and cause-specic mortality as previously reported in Van Wijhe et al. (2016). Briefly, these data, spanning the period 1903- 2012, were obtained from the national census bureau (Statistics Netherlands) and consist of the cause-specic number of deaths from various infectious diseases, including vaccine-preventable diseases. Deaths were stratied by year and except 5-14 and 15-19 replaced 5-13 and 14-19; for 1941-2012, data were available by 5-year age-group, with separate groups for <1 year and \u001580 years). Here we focus on the mortality due to diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and polio during the period 1903-1996. Data were available for the entire period, except for poliomyelitis which was included as a cause of death since 1920. We quantied the childhood mortality burden as years of life lost before the age of 20. Each reported death was randomly assigned a specic age within each 58Population-level effectiveness of vaccination progrmmes age-group and a birth cohort using multiple imputation methods. Cause-specic mortality burden was then calculated using restricted mean lifetimes survival analysis (Andersen et al., 2013; Andersen, 2013). This method estimates the years of life lost due to a specic cause up to a cut-off age within a competing risks framework. For our analysis we choose a cut-off age of 20 years, as most mortality due to our diseases of interest occurred before that age. Each one-year birth cohort between 1903 and 1975 was followed up to 20 years of age. Cumulative incidence curves for each cause of death were constructed using the Aalen-Johansen estimator, and the corresponding age-specic childhood mortality burden attributable to each cause was calculated from the area under the cumulative incidence curves. For more details on the data preparation and survival analysis, see Supplementary information to Chapters 2 and 3. Vaccination coverage Vaccination coverage by birth cohort was obtained from various ofcial reports by the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate (period 1949-1969) and the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (period 1970-1975) Van Wijhe et al. (2016). Missing cohorts (1953 for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus and 1960-1961 for poliomyelitis) were linearly interpolated from adjacent birth cohorts. As far as data allowed, we used age-specic national vaccination coverage. In the early years of mass vaccination (prior to 1962), registration of vaccination coverage was less stringent and it is unknown how many vaccines each child had received at which age. For this period, vaccination coverage was determined from the number of children that had already been vaccinated at one-year of age, and when entering kindergarten or elementary school. We assumed this calculated coverage represents the coverage at the ages of three months, four years, and six years of age respectively. As coverage metric we used the proportion of children who had received at least one vaccine during their lifetime, and we assumed a 95% vaccine effectiveness against mortality regardless of the number of vaccine doses (Bisgard et al., 2000; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2015; Plotkin et al., 2013). In Supplementary Figures 3.7 to 3.11 we present sensitivity analyses exploring the impact of this choice on our results. Mass vaccination with the diphtheria toxoid vaccine started in 1953 in the Nether- lands. Prior to the start of the mass vaccination programme against diphtheria in 59Chapter 3 1953, vaccination was already ongoing and mainly administered at 4-14 years of age (Hoogendoorn, 1954). In 1954 the diphtheria vaccine was combined with vac- cines against pertussis and tetanus (DTP). Polio vaccination followed in 1957 with a staggered catch-up campaign of all children born since 1945. The polio vaccine was combined with DTP in 1962 (DTP-IPV) and was offered at 3, 4, 5, and 11 months. Starting in 1965, DT-IPV re-vaccination was offered at 4 and 9 years of age. Figure 3.1 shows the vaccination by age (percentage of children vaccinated at least once) for each birth cohort since 1945. National vaccination coverage increased rapidly for each of these mass vaccination programmes and reached 90% or higher within a decade after each vaccine introduction. Modeling overview We estimated the overall effectiveness of a vaccination programme on mortality, by comparing the observed childhood mortality burden with the expected mortality burden had the vaccination programme not been introduced, i.e. the counterfactual. To capture overall pre-vaccination trend in childhood mortality burden, the counter- factual model was based on two components: the exponential decline in all-cause childhood mortality burden and contribution of a specic disease to this all-cause childhood mortality burden. The exponential decline was modelled by tting a lin- ear regression model to log-transformed all-cause mor- tality burden over birth cohorts 1903-1940. The cause-specic contributions to the all-cause childhood mortality burden were calculated for each age separately as the ratio of the age- and cause-specic mortality burden to the total all-cause childhood mortality burden. We assumed the age-specic contributions were constant in the pre-vaccination period (see Supplementary Figures 3.3 to 3.6 where we show there were no relevant age trends in the pre-vaccination period). To reflect uncertainty, the age-specic contributions of each vaccine-preventable disease were re-sampled from the pre-vaccination period with a higher sampling weight for more recent birth cohorts. The distribution of the rate of exponential decline was obtained using the semi-parametric bootstrap by resampling residuals (see Supplementary Figure 3.1 for the distributions of parameters used in constructing the counterfactual). We extrapolated the counterfactual model from birth cohort 1948 up to and including the 1975 birth cohort. The overall vaccination programme effectiveness in terms of mortality burden averted was dened as the ratio of observed and counterfactual 60Population-level effectiveness of vaccination progrmmes 05101520 1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 Birth cohortAge in yearsDiphtheria A) 05101520 1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 Birth cohortAge in yearsPoliomyelitis C) 05101520 1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 Birth cohortAge in yearsTetanusD) 05101520 1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 yearsPertussisB) 0.20.40.60.8Vaccination coverage0.8 0.80.8 0.8 0.8 0.80.8 0.40.40.4 0.4 Figure 3.1: Vaccination coverage by age and birth cohort, the Netherlands, 1948- 1975.

Vaccination coverage is dened as the proportion of children having received at least one dose during their lifetime. 61Chapter 3 childhood mortality burden. By incorporating vaccination coverage and vaccine effectiveness in the estimation, direct and indirect effects of vaccination programmes can be distinguished. The direct effects of vaccination were dened as the product of the vaccination coverage and vaccine effectiveness (i.e. the expected proportion of children at a specic age who are immunised). Indirect effects were dened as the remaining childhood mortality burden averted after subtracting direct effects. The model is described in more detail in the following sections. Counterfactual model We constructed the counterfactual by projecting the exponential decline forward from the start of mass vaccination programmes, assuming the rate of decline in childhood mortality burden, r, and the relative contribution of cause ito the all-cause childhood mortality burden at age a,pi;a, remained constant at their pre-vaccination values (see Supplementary information to Chapter 3). In the following we indicate the counterfactual by superscript c= 0, and the observed situation by c= 1. Let y0be the all-cause childhood mortality burden in birth cohort t0, then for each birth cohort with birth year t, the age-specic counterfactual childhood mortality burden was calculated as: Yc=0 i;a(t) =pi;aY0e\u0000r(t\u0000t0)(3.1) Bothy0andrwere estimated by tting a linear regression model to the log- transformed all-cause childhood mortality burden in the pre-vaccination period 1903-1940 (i.e. the intercept and the regression coefcient for birth cohort). The distributions of randy0were obtained using semi-parametric bootstrap by re- sampling residuals. We assumed pi;aremained constant in the counterfactual situation, assuming the hypothesis that the relative contribution did not change had vaccination programmes not been introduced. We estimated pi;afor each birth cohort in the pre-vaccination period by dividing the age-specic years of life lost due to causeiby the all-cause years of life lost. To reflect uncertainty, pi;awas re-sampled from the distributions in the pre-vaccination periods with a higher weight for more recent birth cohorts, 1903-1930 for diphtheria; 1903-1940 for pertussis; 1920-1940 for poliomyelitis; and 1903-1940 for tetanus (we excluded World War 2). 62Population-level effectiveness of vaccination progrmmes Overall, direct, and indirect programme effectiveness The overall effectiveness of a vaccination programme for cause iin birth cohort tup to age can be dened as the ratio of the observed mortality burden, Yc=1 i;a(t)and the expected mortality burden in effectiveness can also be partitioned into the direct and indirect programme effectiveness: Ei;a(t) =Edirect i;a(t) +Eindirect i;a (t). The expected direct programme effectiveness is the product of the vaccine effectiveness, v, and the vaccination coverage at age a,Ca(t), such that Edirect (t) i;a =vCa(t). The indirect programme effectiveness, dened here as any reduction in mortality burden not explained by direct protection (in other words, the difference between the observed and expected mortality burden if only direct protection would play a role), can then be calculated as: Eindirect i (t) =P a=1[(1\u0000vCa(t))Yc=0 i;a(t)\u0000Yc=1 i;a(t)]P a=1Yc=0 i;a(t)(3.3) We calculated the indirect effects of vaccination programmes using a vaccine effec- tiveness against mortality of 95% for all vaccines. Varying the vaccine effectiveness had little qualitative and quantitative impact on our results other than increasing or decreasing the estimated indirect effects slightly (Supplementary Figures 3.7 to 3.11). Uncertainty intervals reflect the uncertainty inherent in the imputation of single-year ages from age-group specic data (Figure 3.2, shaded areas), combined with the re- sampling of pre-vaccination period pi;a, and bootstraps of randy0, yielding 95% uncertainty intervals. All analyses were performed in R statistical programming en- vironment, version 3.2.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Results Figure 3.2 shows the observed childhood mortality burden along with model t to the pre-vaccination period and the estimated counterfactual (the situation had 63Chapter 3 vaccination programmes not been introduced). Our model adequately captures the observed pre-vaccination childhood mortality burden. Upon the start of mass vaccination, the counterfactual and observed childhood mortality burdens rapidly diverge. For pertussis (and to a lesser extent poliomyelitis) this divergence starts several cohorts prior to the start of mass vaccination. Because we look at birth cohorts, this early divergence may be due to indirect effects from vaccination of later birth cohorts or due to unregistered vaccination. This would result in a decline in mortality burden before the start of mass vaccination. The overall effectiveness of vaccination programmes against diphtheria, pertussis, poliomyelitis, and tetanus increased rapidly after the start of mass vaccinations and reached near 100% within ten birth cohorts for each vaccine-preventable disease (Figure 3.3). Figure 3.4 shows the estimated direct and indirect vaccination programme effective- ness in the Netherlands up to and including the 1975 cohort for diphtheria, pertussis, poliomyelitis, and tetanus. Mainly diphtheria and pertussis showed signs of indirect protection, with a maximum estimated indirect effect of 0.25 [95% uncertainty inter- val (UI): 0.24, 0.25] in birth cohort 1960 for diphtheria, and 0.62 [UI: 0.54, 0.69] in birth cohort 1951 for pertussis. Over time, as the proportion of children that got vaccinated increased and the direct programme effectiveness increased, the indirect programme effectiveness for diphtheria and pertussis diminished. We expected to see indirect effects for poliomyelitis, but there was no clear evidence of indirect ef- fects as in most birth cohorts the uncertainty intervals are broad and overlap with zero. No indirect effects were observed for tetanus, which is to be expected as it is not a communicable disease. By birth cohort 1965 almost no mortality burden was observed due to pertussis, diphtheria, poliomyelitis, or tetanus and the indirect programme effectiveness is reduced to the complement of the direct programme ef- fectiveness (Equation (3.3)); hence the small, positive value seen in all plots between the 1965 and 1975 birth cohorts. 64Population-level effectiveness of vaccination progrmmes 0.0000.0250.0500.0750.1000.125 1910192019301940195019601970 Birth cohortYears of life lost before age 20 per birthDiphtheriaA) 0.0000.0010.0020.0030.0040.005 1910192019301940195019601970 Birth cohortYears of life lost before age 20 per birthPoliomyelitisC)0.000.050.100.15 1910192019301940195019601970 Birth cohortYears of life lost before birthFitted Counterfactual ObservedPertussisB) 0.0000.0020.0040.0060.008 1910192019301940195019601970 Birth cohortYears of life lost before age 20 per birthTetanusD) Figure 3.2: Observed and estimated childhood mortality burden per live birth, the Netherlands, 1903-1975.

The dashed line represents the same calculation carried over to the pre-vaccination as a control. Vaccination coverage at one year of age is indicated by the diamond symbols, where open symbols represent interpolated data points. Here we assume a vaccine effectiveness against mortality of 95%. 66Population-level effectiveness of vaccination progrmmes Overall, since birth cohort 1948 and up to the 1975 birth cohort, 14.9% [95% UI: 12.3%, 17.6%] of all childhood mortality burden averted due to diphtheria vaccination was due to indirect protection (Figure 3.4 and Supplementary Figure 3.2, which shows the averted mortality burden due to indirect effects). For pertussis 32.1% [95% UI: 31.3%, 32.8%] was due to indirect Discussion According to our analysis, there are substantial indirect effects of mass vaccination against diphtheria and pertussis on childhood mortality burden, and programme effectiveness was considerably higher than would be expected based on direct effects of vaccination alone. These indirect effects were especially high at the start of mass vaccination when vaccine coverage was still low; up to 25% of the averted diphtheria mortality burden was due to indirect effects and up to 62% for pertussis. These results provide evidence for herd protection, of which the impact seems to be highest in the early years of vaccination programmes when vaccination coverages (and direct effects) were still relatively low. We did not observe indirect effects due to vaccination against poliomyelitis. This was unexpected and may be due to the low number of deaths observed or due to the regular epidemics in the pre-vaccination period, which increased the uncertainty in our analysis. The staggered catch-up campaign of all children born since 1945 initiated in 1957, together with the broad age-distribution of deaths due to poliomyelitis, further increased the width of the uncertainty intervals for both direct and indirect programme effectiveness. Although we did estimate a high overall effectiveness of vaccination programmes (Figure 3.3) our method may not be sensitive enough to detect indirect effects for poliomyelitis. It is likely that any indirect effects are more apparent in morbidity data than mortality. Here we restricted our analysis to mortality data, as these detailed data have been systematically collected for long time periods. Similarly, indirect effects for pertussis and diphtheria, although present in mortality statistics, may be more pronounced in morbidity data. 67Chapter 3 0.540.2700.501 195019551960196519701975 Birth cohortDirect Birth cohortDirect and indirect effectivenessTetanusD) Figure 3.4: Direct and indirect vaccination programme effectiveness, the Netherlands, 1948-1975.

Lines indicate medians and area's 95% uncertainty intervals. Direct and indirect programme effectiveness sum to the overall programme effectiveness. Here we assume a vaccine effectiveness against mortality of 95%. 68Population-level effectiveness of vaccination progrmmes We included tetanus, a non-communicable vaccine-preventable disease, as a neg- ative control for which we expect no indirect protection; indeed, we observed no indirect effects. To further check our calculation, we veried that the overall pro- gramme effectiveness (Equation (3.2)) over the pre-vaccination period was zero (Fig- ure 3.3). If our model performs well, the 'overall programme effectiveness' in the pre-vaccination period should fluctuate around the null and rapidly increase from the start of mass vaccination. This was the case for each vaccine-preventable disease in our study period (a decline can be seen for diphtheria during the World War 2 when large epidemics swept across Europe (Stuart, 1945)). This nding, together with the near-zero estimate of indirect protection for the tetanus vaccination pro- gramme, gives credence to our methodology. There are several limitations and possible biases to our approach. First of all, our estimated counterfactual may be overestimated due to other, unaccounted for, factors unrelated to vaccination that also impact upon childhood mortality burden, most notably the increasing use of antibiotics around the time mass vaccination programmes started. The impact of antibiotics is partially taken into account by the exponential decline in the all-cause childhood mortality burden, but may still show residual impact. This would lead to an overestimation of our indirect effects. To investigate the potential impact of antibiotics on our results, we performed additional analyses (see Supplementary information to Chapter 3 for details on the sensitivity analysis) in which we assume that antibiotics reduce the mortality burden in the counterfactual either by a constant, or by increasing the rate of exponential decline. These analyses indicated that our results are sensitive to the influence of antibiotics, specically if they influence mortality burden by increasing the exponential decline. However, even at a moderately high impact of antibiotics, indirect effects are still present for pertussis and diphtheria. These effects decrease rapidly as the effect of antibiotics increases. Although our results are influenced by the potential reduction in mortality burden due to antibiotics (and other prevention measures than vaccination), if their impact is limited, indirect effects remain apparent, especially at lower levels of vaccination coverage. Second, we assumed that the contributions of vaccine-preventable diseases to the total mortality burden remained constant in the counterfactual. This is a reasonable assumption for most vaccine-preventable diseases, given their small and relatively constant contributions to the total mortality burden in the pre-vaccination period 69Chapter 3 (Van Wijhe et al., 2016). The constancy assumption is also attractive as one would expect the cause-specic mortality burden to decline at a similar rate to the total mortality burden. In additional analyses we tested whether there were any age- specic trends in the pre-vaccination period (Supplementary Figures 3.3 to 3.6). We did not nd relevant trends in the pre-vaccination period; however, any effects of existing trends would be overwhelmed by the existing uncertainty in the analysis. Our assumption of a constant contribution from all vaccine-preventable diseases to the counterfactual seems justied, and allows us to restrict the model to the decline in all-cause mortality, obviating the need to construct multiple disease-specic models. Third, we assumed the exponential decline in the pre-vaccination period would hold subsequent to the start of mass vaccination. Exponential declines in (childhood) mortality rates throughout the 20thcentury have been observed in many high income countries besides the Netherlands (Tuljapurkar et al., 2000). For our time-frame of interest\u2014the period directly following the introduction of mass vaccinations\u2014it is unlikely that the trends in the counterfactual would look radically different than those in the pre-vaccination period, as these have been stable for the entire pre- vaccination period. Another factor that may have biased our results is the uncertainty in registered vac- cination coverage. Registration of vaccination coverage improved over time, and starting 1962, detailed records are available. In the early years of mass vaccination, registration of vaccination status was often incomplete, and before the implementa- tion of nationwide mass vaccination programmes there may have been substantial unregistered vaccination taking place (Hoogendoorn, 1954). Our vaccination cov- erage data may thus underestimate actual coverage. In addition, it is unclear how many children and at what age children were vaccinated; a substantial number of vaccines may have been given to children who were already immune due to natural infection. Our assumed vaccine effectiveness of 95% may therefore be unrealistic in the early part of the vaccination period. Decreasing vaccine effectiveness slightly increased the indirect effects and increasing vaccine effectiveness slightly decreased the indirect effects (Supplementary Figures 3.8 to 3.11). The interplay of these fac- tors makes it difcult to determine if the vaccination coverage\u2014and in extension the proportion immunised and our estimated indirect effects\u2014is biased and in which direction. 70Population-level effectiveness of vaccination progrmmes This research focused on the population-wide direct and indirect effectiveness of vaccination programmes on mortality in the Netherlands. Indirect protection is a well-established phenomenon in infectious disease epidemiology (Fine, 1993). However, a quantitative estimate of the magnitude of indirect protection compared with direct protection has been lacking for the older vaccination programmes, and specically the literature on the population effectiveness of vaccination programmes using population-wide surveillance data is decient (Breiman et al., 2004). Other studies looking into the population effectiveness of vaccination programmes have mainly focused on contemporary vaccines such as meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccines (Ramsay et al., 2003; et al., 2015), influenzae serotype b conjugate vaccines (Morris et al., 2008; O'Loughlin et al., 2010), and influenza vaccines (Baguelin et al., 2013). Our research provides a quantitative insight into the population direct and indirect effectiveness of older vaccination programmes using already existing data sources. Future research should focus on the effectiveness of vaccination programmes on morbidity by including hospitalisation or notication data. This is especially important for diseases such as poliomyelitis for which programme effectiveness may not be well estimated using mortality data, and for which a major share of disease burden is attributed to long-term sequelae. Alternatively, our methods could be veried using mortality data from other countries. In addition, spatial heterogeneity should be accounted for, as vaccination coverage shows substantial geographical differences (Van Lier et al., 2016). This heterogeneity may provide more insight into the indirect effects of vaccination when comparing high- and low-coverage regions. Our analysis shows that the indirect effects of the early vaccination programmes for diphtheria and pertussis are pronounced even in mortality statistics, indicating that for a proper appreciation of the impact of vaccination programmes and the monitoring of their effectiveness, both direct and indirect effects should be taken into account. 71Chapter 3 Contributors MvW obtained, extracted, and analysed the data, searched the scientic literature, and wrote the rst draft of the manuscript.

Lancet Infect Dis Cause-specic mortality trends in The Netherlands, 1875-1992: a formal analysis of the epidemiologic transition. , 75Supplementary information to Chapter 3Chapter 3 Survival analysis Data preparation Annual mortality data were available from 1903 through 1975 except for poliomyeli- tis, which was included as a cause of death since 1920. Deaths were stratied by year 5-14 and 15-19 replaced 5-13 and 14-19; for 1941-2012, data were available by 5-year age-group, with separate groups for <1 year and \u001580 years). See also Chapter 2. In order to estimate the years of life lost in each birth cohort, we needed to reconstruct the age-specic mortality by birth cohort. First, each death within an age-group was assigned a one-year age-group assuming deaths occurred uniform within an age-group. For age-group 1-4 years we assumed more deaths occurred at age one and two than at ages three and four. This ratio was estimated based on age-specic population estimates. Second, we assigned each death within a one-year age-group to a birth cohort by using Lexis-diagrams. See the overview by Carstensen 2007 for an explanation of Lexis-diagrams and how one could use them. In short, each one-year age-group is composed of two cohorts: those born in year i\u0015a\u00001 and those born in the year i\u0000a, whereiis the registration year and ais the age at death. These cohorts are divided along the diagonal, thus creating an upper and lower Lexis-triangle (see also Chapter 2, Supplementary Figure 2.2). If deaths occur uniform over a Lexis-triangle, the average age at death in the upper Lexis-triangle is a+2 3while the average age in the lower triangle is a+1 3. Deaths are assigned to one of the two possible birth cohort at random, with a probability proportional to the size of the birth cohorts. We assumed that all deaths occur at age a+2 3for the upper Lexis-triangle and at age a+1 3for the lower Lexis-triangle. To rule out chance effects in the process of assigning deaths to birth cohorts, we repeated this imputation step ten times. Calculating the years of life lost To estimate the cause-specic years of life lost for each birth cohort (see above) we estimated the number of life-years lost for each cause of death using the restricted mean lifetime method (Andersen, 2013; Andersen et al., 2013). Consider kmutually exclusive causes of death with event times 0< ta< ::: < t m< . We estimated the overall survival probability Susing the Kaplan-Meier , at ageta, andnais the total number of individuals at risk at age ta. The expected lifetime up to age , is: E =Z 0^S(t)dt (3.5) The cause-specic dying from cause jbefore age . The expected number of years of life lost before age due to cause j,Lj, is: Lj(0; ) =Z 0^Fj(t)dt (3.7) We estimated the number of years of life lost before age due diphtheria, pertussis, poliomyelitis, tetanus, and all other causes of death. These results are shown in Figure 3.2 and Supplementary Figure 3.1. Age-specic contribution The cause- and age-specic years of life lost add up to the total years of life lost. We can therefore calculate the contribution of mortality burden at each particular age to the total mortality burden up to age : 79Chapter 3 Cj(a) =^Fj(a) Pk j=1Lj(0; )(3.8) For each birth cohort we estimate the number of life-years lost up to the age for each age,a, using a cut-off age = 20 (Supplementary Figure 3.1). Pre-vaccination contribution In our analysis we assumed that the pre-vaccination contributions to the all-cause childhood mortality burden were constant. To ascertain whether this is the case, we tested for any linear trends using OLS linear regression analysis of the form Cj(a) =b0+b1xwithxthe year of birth for the cohort, and tested whether the regression coefcient b1differed from zero ( = 0:05). As our results are realisations of ten imputations, we used corrected degrees of freedom with df = (n\u00001)lwhere lis the length of the time series and nis the number of imputations. The results are presented in Supplementary Figures 3.3 to 3.6. This analysis was performed only for those ages where the contribution was non-zero in at least half of the time series. For each cause of death, there were several statistically signicant linear trends in the pre-vaccination period. The largest value for the regression coefcient was found for pertussis for the youngest age-group (<1 year): 0.00003 per cohort. This would result in an increase in contribution less than 0.1% over a period of 30 birth cohorts. We concluded that existing trends in the contribution to childhood mortality are negligibly small relative to the uncertainty of the contribution. We re-sampled age- distributions from the pre-vaccination period with higher weights for more recent cohorts (Supplementary Figure 3.1). We also checked whether the total contribution (aggregated over all ages) in the pre-vaccination period showed any linear trends. This analysis did not reveal linear trends that were sufciently large to impact our ndings. Impact of antibiotics The use of antibiotics increased around the same period that vaccination efforts intensied in the Netherlands. Use of sulphanilamide started in 1936, penicillin in 1944 (with limited supplies until 1947), streptomycin in 1947, and chloramphenicol 8000.10.20.3 05101520 Age in yearsRelatitive contribution to childhood mortality burden (%)Diphtheria A) 00.511.5 05101520 Age in yearsRelatitive contribution to childhood mortality burden (%)Pertussis B) 00.020.040.060.08 05101520 Age in yearsRelatitive contribution to childhood mortality burden (%)Poliomyelitis C) 00.020.040.060.08 05101520 Age in yearsRelatitive contribution to childhood mortality burden (%)Tetanus D) 01234 19001910192019301940195019601970 Birth cohortYears of life lost birthAllcause mortality burdenF) 0100200300400 0.0410.0390.0370.035 rRelative frequencyRate of exponential decline E)Supplementary Figure 3.1: Distributions of parameters used in constructing the counterfactual.

Childhood mortality burden averted due to indirect effects of vaccination programmes in the Netherlands for (A) diphtheria; (B) pertussis; (C) poliomyelitis; and (D) tetanus. Solid lines indicate the median and the coloured area's indicated 95% uncertainty intervals. Here we assume a vaccine effectiveness against mortality of 95%. in 1949. There was no central registration of drugs sales in the Netherlands, so no information is available on the actual use of antibiotics. In a study on the impact of antibiotic use on cause-specic mortality, a higher rate of decline was observed for various causes of death after 1947. For certain causes of death like pneumonia, the rate increased from 4% to 5%, for upper respiratory infections from 0% to 8%, and for acute bronchitis from 7% to 9% (Mackenbach and Looman, 1988). As antibiotics may thus have a substantial impact on mortality due to infectious diseases, mainly by preventing mortality due to co-infections, we performed a sensitivity analysis 82Supplementary information investigating the potential impact of the increased use of antibiotics. For simplicity, we assumed that antibiotics were introduced in 1947. Sensitivity analysis Antibiotics may have an immediate impact on childhood mortality burden, or they may modulate the rate of exponential decline in childhood mortality burden. To reflect the way antibiotics could influence childhood mortality burden, we modify Equation (3.1) in the main text, as follows: Yc=0 i;a(t) =spi;aY0e\u0000zr(t\u0000t0)(3.9) Wheresis the immediate reduction in childhood mortality burden and zis the increase in exponential decline following the increased availability of antibiotics in 1947. We performed a sensitivity analysis and calculated the total childhood mortality burden due to indirect effects from 1948 through 1975 for varying high and low values of sandz. Here,stakes the values 0.95 and 0.75, equivalent to a reduction of our estimated counterfactual mortality burden by 5% and 25% respectively, and ztake the values 1.05, 1.2, and 2, equivalent to an increase in the rate of decline by 5%, 20%, and 100%. In the base case sandzare set to 1. In addition to the impact of antibiotics, we also investigate the impact of a reduced or increased vaccine effectiveness, v(Equation (3.3)). In the base case vis set to 95%; here we also set vto 75% and 99%. Results The results of this sensitivity analysis are presented in Supplementary Figures 3.7 to 3.9. As expected, if we assume that a constant proportion of the expected mortality burden is averted due to the use of antibiotics, the expected indirect effects are signicantly decreased. Similarly, if we assume that after 1947 the rate of exponential decline in mortality burden increases, the indirect effects decline, although to a lesser extent. However, indirect effects can still be observed for pertussis and diphtheria. The indirect effects for diphtheria only disappear with a high impact of antibiotics (s= 0.75 and z= 2). Assuming lower vaccine effectiveness increases the indirect effects, and higher vaccine effectiveness decreases indirect effects. Supplementary 83Chapter 3 Figures 3.10 and 3.11 presents the indirect and direct effects when assuming a vaccine effectiveness of 75% and 99% respectively (similar to Figure 3.4). With an effectiveness of 75% the indirect effects for each vaccine-preventable disease are more apparent, including poliomyelitis. With an effectiveness of 99% the indirect effects are lower but still present for both pertussis and diphtheria. From these analyses we conclude that indirect effects can still be observed even if there is a substantial impact of antibiotics on the expected mortality burden and when vaccine effectiveness is near 100%. Indirect effects for diphtheria disappear only at the extremes. In other cases the general conclusions remain the same. References Andersen, P .K.
