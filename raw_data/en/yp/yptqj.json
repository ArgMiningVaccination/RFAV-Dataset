Consider This \"For thousands of years professions that ministered to the sick disregarded the centrifugal or inside force (Innate Intelligence), and searched the heavens and earth in a vain attempt to externally find the cause of disease.\" -- B.J. Palmer, 1949 \"Be careful about reading health books. You may die of a misprint.\" -- Mark Twain \"It's no longer a question of staying healthy. It's a question of finding a sickness you like.\" -- Jackie Mason \"Health is not simply the absence of sickness.\" -- Hannah Green Why Traditional Chiropractic? There are many modes of chiropractic treatment in use today. Some are experimental or ineffective; and some have little to do with adjusting the specific joints of the spine which cause nerve interference and pain. Dr. Tripp uses only time-tested, proven adjusting techniques. The adjustment is the main focus of treatment. Other therapies or x-rays may not be required. What type of conditions does Dr. Tripp treat? Dr. Tripp treats what are commonly referred to as \"pinched nerves.\" This is an over-simplification but, basically when the facet (connecting) joints of the spine become stuck together, the nervous system sends out a stress signal which results in some type of pain sensation. The sensation can be sharp pain, dull pain, ache, tingling, numbness, burning, coldness, or even loss of function. These symptoms can be in the form of headaches, neck pain, low back pain, pain in between the shoulder blades; pain which radiates to the shoulders, arms, hips, legs, feet or ribs. An examination reveals which of these joints are the culprits. The object of treatment is to release or \"un-stick\" the involved joints, in order to allow the body to return them to balance. This is referred to as an adjustment, and it is usually painless. The target of the treatment is the CAUSE of the symptom, rather than the symptom itself.

I have suffered with my back for 25 years and have not been able to get relief without a lot of medication until I started seeing him. I recommend to anyone who likes life without having to be in constant pain or a lot of medication to see Dr. Tripp. Mike L., Long Beach I could hardly walk and was in great pain. Previous surgery left me in a lot of pain. I had fused disks at C4-5 and C5-6, and my life was pretty much over. Dr. Tripp helped me so much that I can walk again and my pain is much less. He is the only doctor that I see today, and the only one that I need to see. Thank you Dr. Tripp! You made a big difference in my life. Mark J., Gulfport I was a non-believer! I knew Doc Tripp personally but not professionally. He knew I had spent twelve years in pain following an auto accident and offered to give me an examination. I thought I would humor him...but after just a few visits I was free of all that pain. I am now a "}
