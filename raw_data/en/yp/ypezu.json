Through [Digital Response Technique](https://awellness.com/index.php/wellness-evaluation/) testing we identify the precise protocol for our clients' condition and system. We can also determine how their body will respond to the supplements prior to their purchase. Many clients want to know if they eat right, why they will still need supplements. Firstly, one could not eat the volume of food necessary to acquire the amount of nutrients one needs to turn around a sick body. Secondly, the nutritional value of today's food has diminished considerably over the years due to poor quality soil, hybrid foods and pesticides. There are lots of inferior quality nutritional supplements on the market, but we use only the highest quality because we want our clients to receive maximum results in the shortest period of time. "}
