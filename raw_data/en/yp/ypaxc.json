Does your [natural hair feel dry](https://naturalgirlwigs.com/blogs/beauty/22-best-methods-to-keep-natural-hair-moisturized) and brittle? Or your curls aren't popping as they used to? Then your hair needs protein. Specifically, you need a protein treatment for your natural hair. Beyond the normal routine of shampooing, deep conditioning, and [protective styling of your natural hair](https://naturalgirlwigs.com/blogs/beauty/20-protective-styling-ideas-for-natural-hair), a protein treatment is a great way to take care of your hair. Our hair already has protein structures in it, however, due to constant manipulation, exposure to environmental conditions, and product buildup, our hair loses some of these protein structures gradually. This is when a protein treatment comes into play. Applying a protein treatment to your natural hair helps to nourish and strengthen the hair and ensures it grows to its maximum length. What Is A Protein Treatment? A protein treatment is a conditioning treatment that adds protein to the cuticle layer of your hair strands. This strengthens your hair, making it a lot stronger and less likely to get damaged later on. But you might be thinking hey, [a good deep conditioning treatment](https://naturalgirlwigs.com/blogs/beauty/10-best-deep-conditioners-for-dry-natural-hair) can also do the magic. Well, that's different, a good deep conditioning treatment adds moisture to the hair restoring its elasticity. But a protein treatment binds proteins to the hair strands which is ideal for strengthening the natural hair so it doesn't break off easily. However, it is important to alternate between doing a deep conditioning treatment and a protein treatment for your natural hair. When you do this you are able to maintain an adequate protein-moisture balance in your natural hair. This is why it's recommended that you do a protein treatment once every month because too much protein can actually have the opposite effect on your hair. Benefits Of A Protein Treatment For Natural Hair - Protein treatments do the work of nourishing and softening natural hair by taking away dead cells from the scalp and replenishing protein back into the hair. - They ensure that you have thicker, longer, and healthier hair by adding extra body and [volume to your natural hair](https://naturalgirlwigs.com/blogs/beauty/7-easy-ways-to-add-volume-to-curly-hair). - It helps to [reduce breakage](https://naturalgirlwigs.com/blogs/beauty/easy-remedies-for-reducing-natural-hair-breakage?_pos=1&_sid=470dda0ac&_ss=r), prevent split ends, and strengthen limp brittle hair strands. - Protein treatments ensure that your natural hair maintains its natural balance of proteins, oils, and nutrients. 5 Best Protein Treatment Products For Natural Hair 1.
