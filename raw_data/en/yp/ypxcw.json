You will need to make decisions about financing your education, whether or not to work, and if so, how many hours. You will need to decide how to balance your academic life, your social life, and your personal life.

Soon afterward the campus separated from its parent college on July 1, 1958, the founding date of the present University, to become San Fernando Valley State College. At that time, it had an enrollment of about 3,300 students with a faculty of 104. On June 1, 1972, the college was renamed California State University, Northridge. Today, a member of the 23-campus California State University system in Northridge is one of the largest institutions of higher learning in California. It is the third largest university in Los Angeles County, after UCLA and CSU Long Beach. It is the largest residential campus in the CSU system with approximately 10 percent of its enrollment living in residence halls on campus and thousands more in nearby apartments. Bachelor's degrees are currently given in 51 subject areas and Master's degrees in 44. There are 27 credentials given in the field of education. Campus Icons & Traditions The University SealThe University Seal is separated into four quadrants each identifying a part of the rich culture that makes California StateUniversity, Northridge unique. The San Fernando Mission herit age is depicted by the arched adobe columns; The fea ther quill pen & parchment represent scholarship; The geomorphology of the San F ernando Valley is created by the surroundingSanta Monica, San Gabriel, & Santa Susana Mountains, along with the Chatsworth Hills; The Sun, which is both in our moniker , C \"SUN,\" as well as an attractiveenvironmental feature which SouthernCalifornia is famous for. The typographythat surrounds the pictograms wasoriginally designed in a serif face, similarto Times Roman. It was updated to theunique sans serif face by Randall Tucker,then director of Reprographics in theearly eighties, under the direction ofPresident James W. Cleary. The Matador Statue - History of an Icon In 1958, students at then San Fernando Valley State College selected \"The Matador\" as the official mascot out of 158 recommendations. The students hoped to establish a tradition and find an icon round which to rally and represent the courageous character of the university. Their foresight was wise, and through the years students and alumni adopted The Matador as a symbol of California State University, Northridge's spirit - nicknaming the gymnasium \"PACU Arena\" and posing for pictures with \"Matty,\" Northridge's costumed cheerleader. The original statue campaign was launched by a campus committee in 1989. The Department of Art hosted a contest to come up with a design. The committee selected a design created by alumnus Frank Panaro '84 (Physics), '90 (Art). The design went to the foundry; however, plans stalled after the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Unfortunately, due to overriding campus priorities following the earthquake, the statue was never completed and the original full-size clay molds deteriorated and had to be destroyed. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of Cal State Northridge in 2009, a campus-wide committee, under the leadership of the late Vice President for Student Affairs Terry Piper and then Associate Vice President for Student Affairs William Watkins '74 (Urban Studies), convened to rekindle the effort. The original designer was not available so the commit- tee began a nationwide search for an artist to bring to fruition the 20-year-old 6 California State University, Northridge | New Student Handbook 2023-2024vision. In 2010, Jon Hair, a North Carolina- based sculptor, was commissioned to create and install a bronze Matador statue. The Matador Statue fundraising committee launched a drive to raise $150,000 to build a bigger-than-life-size bronze statute, the first of its kind on campus. Alumni rallied to support the initiative and no state funds were used. This iconic bronze sculpture salutes the courage, grace, creativity, ability and strength of Cal State Northridge's students, alumni and the entire campus community. The statue is located across from the Matador Square in the area west of the University Student Union and east of the University Library. For more information about the statue fundraising campaign, visit www.csunalumni.com. Tradition of the Rose Red roses are to be laid at the base of the Matador Statue by every Matador who wants to commemorate or celebrate a significant achievement or a time of overcoming a worthy adversary, including (but not limited to): Passing a difficult t est or class Over coming a personal obstacle or difficulty Joining a significan t campus organization Achieving a degr ee Getting a ne w job or promotion Celebra ting a personal milestone (birthday, engagement, wedding, death) Athle tic teams celebrating successful games or conference play Departments celebr ating achievements or making milestones Significan t occurrences in the life of the campus community California State University, Northridge | New Student Handbook 2023-2024 7Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drugs Policy The manufacture, possession, distribution, sale or use of alcohol, illicit drugs or drug related paraphernalia, and the misuse of legal pharmaceutical drugs on-campus, or off-campus while on university business or participating in University sponsored functions, is prohibited.

Courses in which grades of CR, NC, I and W are assigned are not used in GPA calculation. A student's academic status takes into account both the cumulative total GPA, which includes coursework transferred from other institutions as well as coursework taken at CSUN, and the CSUN GPA, which includes only coursework taken at CSUN. The University considers all grades reported at the end of each semester to be final. Students are responsible for reviewing their grades for accuracy before the end of the subsequent semester. Grades are available through myNorth ridge Portal and the SOLAR Student Center approximately one week after the final exam period. Matador Tips: Your grades are also reported on your unofficial transcripts, which can be found in the SOLAR Student Center in your myNorthridgeportal.
