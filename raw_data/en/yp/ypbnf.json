(3) It can be defined as neoptraditional medicine, since elements of biology and modern medicine play a significant part in its dissemination and practice. In the 1990s, the increasing biomedicalisation of !traditional\" treatment was driven by two factors, that of the longpterm state policy of integrating Chinese and Western medicine and modernising and normalising Chinese medicine, (4) and that of forces arising from cultural and economic globalisa p tion, as manifested in the circulation of scientific as well as traditional ideas and practices around the world and in the economic stakes crystallising around international health in the context of a world market. In the early twentypfirst century, the traditional pharma p copoeia ( zhongyao ) in its buoyant, state form, is tending toward becoming a pharmacotherapy (zhongyiyao ), and even a cine ( zhongyiyao xue ). Starting with the recognition that treatment and research in traditional Chinese medicine are an integral part of the pub p lic intervention plan for funding the treatment of HIV-AIDS gradually implemented since 2004, I have fo p cused on the modalities of utilisation and integration of this body of knowledge and practice in the management of AIDS, which I have researched in the context of previous works on therapeutic plurality in China. My article is in two parts, the first of which seeks to contextualise the subject in the framework of the major realignment of health policies in 2004. The second part deals with the integration of TCM in therapies and research on HIV. This process, in its con p ceptual and operational modes, is concrete evidence of the !biomedicalisation\" of TCM that accelerated in the 1990s. In the adaptation of existing and recommended treatments on an international level, combined treatments in biomedi p cine and TCM are the object of clinical research and prac p tice. In biomedicine it is mainly a question of ARVs (antip Management of the AIDS Epidemic and Local/Global Use of Chinese Medicine (1) E V E LY N E M I C O L L I E R 1.This research was carried in the framework of the IRD-PUMC/CAMS (Beijing Union Medical College/Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences) Project, Social Science Programme, with financial support from the CEFC, Hong Kong. The project was se - lected in the framework of the call for research projects in 2006. 2.The terms xiyi(literally \"Western medicine\") and zhongyi(literally Chinese medi- cine\") are used by patients and therapists and in official terminology. I have cho - sen to use the term TCM (traditional Chinese medicine), which is the official Eng - lish translation in China of zhongyi, because my approach is from an insider's view (here, official Chinese), which is consistent with an anthropological perspective. 3.For example, local, popular, or family medical treatments (minjian yiliao, difang yil- iao/liaofa , etc.), which are not necessarily part of the TCM corpus of practices and treatments. 4.On the initial project of medicine integrated into the construction of a socialist so - ciety, see Kim Taylor, Chinese Medicine in Early Communist China, 1945-1963: A Medicine of Revolution , London, Routledge, 2005, 236 pp.; on the modernisation and normalisation of Chinese medicine see Judith Farquhar, Knowing Practice: The Clinical Encounter of Chinese Medicine , Boulder, Westview Press, 1994, 260 pp.; on the construction of one standardised form among others, see Elisabeth Hsu, The Transmission of Chinese Medicine , Cambridge UK, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge Studies in Medical Anthropology, 1999, 296 pp., pp. 88-127. china perspectives In the context of a social and medical response to AIDS at a national level recommended by the Chinese authorities, the policy of eventual extension of treatment to all patients reveals \"Chinese characteristics\" that are akin to international concerns regarding the use of alternative and complementary medicine. One concerns the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), principally in combined treatment (biomedicine with Chinese medicine) in a public health system in which it plays a relatively large part compared to other health systems in the world. This article focuses on the integration of TCM in therapies and research on HIV/AIDS.Special feature retrovirals) applied to AIDS and of other medicines recom p mended in the treatment of the opportunist illnesses of AIDS, and in TCM it is a matter of treating opportunist ill p nesses or of developing complementary treatments that might reduce the side effects associated with ARVs, as well as stimulating the immune system, relieving pain, and work p ing towards increased wellpbeing and a better life for people living with HIV-AIDS (PLWHA). This research aims to adapt existing treatments and develop innovative treatments designed within the protocols as possible substitutes for ARVs. Based on analysis of a number of publications and observations, I will give examples of clinical tests aimed at the scientific certification of AIDS treatments in the wider context of R&D in TCM. It should be pointed out that public policy measures taken by China and the longpterm political intention to promote tradi p tional medicine come up against the preoccupations of states and civil and economic players on an international level, as well as the WHO's recommendation to integrate traditional medicines in public health systems, promulgated at the Inter p national Conference on Primary Health Care in AlmapAta back in 1978. At that time the Chinese system appeared to be a model to be followed by other states, particularly those with very limited medical resources, in view of the objective of !Health for All in 2000.\" The Beijing declaration adopted at the end of the WHO First World Conference on Traditional Medicine, held from 7p9 November 2008 in Bei p jing, (5) is a continuation that calls for wider application of the WHO public policy and strategy guidelines for traditional medicine (2002p2005) initiated in 1978: !Recognizing the progress of many governments to date in integrating tradi p tional medicine into their national health systems, we call on those who have not yet done so to take action.\" It should be added that the definition of !traditional medicines\" is very wide, including a range of therapies, practices, and knowl p edge that is highly diverse, depending on country and local p ity, and which can be termed !alternative medicines\" or !complementary medicines.\" (6) Reformulation of national health policies and integration of TCM Beginning in 2004, a new committee at State Council level entrusted with controlling AIDS, aided by more effective monitoring devices, has led to an improved understanding of epidemic dynamics and responses. Knowledge and con p trol of the epidemic have progressed considerably as a re psult, although many challenges and obstacles remain. Treat p ment and followpup of HIV-AIDS is being gradually ex p tended throughout the country, according to the interna p tional norms recommended by WHO for countries with limited resources. For the central government, the chal p lenge today is to implement these new policies in a rela p tively homogenous fashion at the local level. It would be a mistake, however, to overestimate the responsibility of provincial governments or authorities lower down in the ad p ministrative structure, who do not always have the human and financial resources to apply these new measures cor p rectly. (7) Disparities at the regional, administrative, and in p stitutional level, as well as an enduring and widespread stig p matisation of the epidemic and those infected or affected by it, (8) constitute major obstacles to the effective applica p tion of new public policies. It should be mentioned that in December 2003, before the implementation of the national HAART (Highly Active Antipretroviral Treatment) (9) programme that was in the course of being elaborated, MSF had initiated a programme of confidential treatment and followpup for patients infected by HIV in Nanning, the capital of Guangxi Province, in col p laboration with the provincial CDC ( fangyi ju ) and the re p gional Public Health Bureau ( weisheng ju ). This was a pilot project in China at the time, and was considered a model to be replicated in the official health structures specialising in 68 No 2 0 0 9 / 1 5.Available online: http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/TRM_BeijingDeclara - tionEN.pdf. 6.The concept of CAM (Complementary and Alternative Medicines) is widely used in med - ical science, in public health, and in human and social health sciences, including all therapies that do not originate in internationally standardised modern medicine or bio - medicine. Such an all-encompassing definition means that it is usually discussed in context in order to be operative rather than being reduced to a theoretical tool. 7.Source: field research carried out by the IRD-PUMC/CAMS research team in sites in the provinces of Hainan and Henan. 8.On firsthand experiences of discrimination against patients with HIV relating to percep - tions of AIDS, see Rachel Yunqiu Zhou, \"'If you get AIDS... you have to endure it alone': Understanding the social constructions of HIV/AIDS in China,\" Social Science and Med - icine,2007, vol. 65, pp. 284-295; on discriminatory rumours, perceptions of AIDS and the criminalisation of seropositive people in the media, see Jing Jun, \"The Social Origin of AIDS Panic in China,\" in Joan Kaufman, Arthur Kleinman, Tony Saich (eds), AIDS and Social Policy in China , Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Asia Center, 2006, 267 pp., pp. 152-169; on the phenomenon of stigmatisation at the beginning of the decade, see Evelyne Micollier, \"HIV/AIDS-related Stigmatization in Chinese Society: Bridging the Gap between Official Responses and Civil Society,\" in Alice Desclaux (ed.)

(10) In April 2004, the Ministry of Health, in cooperation with Ministry of Finance and the SATCM (State Administration of TCM, guojia zhongyiyao guanliju ), (11) promulgated a se p ries of recommendations aimed at the standardisation of ARV treatments. The set of measures known as !Four Frees and One Care\" ( simian yiguanhuai ) includes free ARVs for all patients resident in rural areas and for patients resident in urban areas who face financial difficulties; free testing and advisory services in highpprevalence areas; free education for children orphaned by AIDS; free testing, advice, and motherptopchild transmission prevention for pregnant women; and financial support for seropositive patients whose finan p cial resources are inadequate. (12) Since the end of 2003, five ARVs (AZT, d4T, ddI, NVP, and IDV) (13) have been produced by pharmaceutical companies based in China, and two others (3TC, EFV) (14) have been im p ported. These frontline ARV treatments prescribed in China in the framework of the national programme correspond to the norms recommended by the WHO for countries with limited medical resources. A detailed manual has been drawn up to fa p cilitate the implementation of the new policy of treatment and extension of treatment. (15) At the same time, the government has increased investment and development of research into pre p ventive vaccines, ARVs, the adapting of ARVs to clinical prac p tice, and TCM products. (16) A largepscale intervention and re p search programme encourages provinces to test traditional med p icine products for the treatment and followpup of AIDS. While estimates of the total number of patients benefiting from the HAART treatment in the framework of the na p tional programme vary according to the source and do not al p ways include patients who are following an TCM treatment, UNAIDS and international medical publications indicate that around 20,450 patients received HAART treatment at the end of 2005, 24,400 at the end of 2006, (17) and 32,000 at the end of 2007. (18) At the end of 2006 these included more than 6,000 patients benefiting from a TCM treatment. These data should be viewed with caution, as the figures vary depending on the documents used. While the official rate of the numbers of patients who withdrew from HAART treat p ment was 8 percent and that of deaths among patients was 10 percent, (19) unofficial sources indicate that the combined rate of withdrawal from treatment and death could reach 50 percent, depending on the locality and the population con p cerned. On this question, our field data reveal contrasting sit p uations depending on the location and the dominant means of transmission among patients. For example, in Number 8 Hospital in Guangzhou, which specialises in treatment of and research into infectious diseases and includes a treatment department and an AIDS research centre, the combined loss rate among patients on ARVs, a population with a majority (90 percent) in an advanced symptomatic state (20) and made up of intravenous drug users (70 percent), was around 10 percent in 2007, with a 6 percent death rate and 4 percent rate of withdrawal from treatment. (21) According to our field data, withdrawal behaviour is seen as widespread: some pa p tients readily state that a third or half of patients decide to !withdraw\" from the medical treatments prescribed. Observance and adherence to ARV treatment are crucial both for effectiveness and in reducing resistance.

We should also point out that since 2006, a moni- toring and control system has been established, cf.

The ad p ministration or use of traditional medicines to treat HIV or AIDS has not posed any significant problem, (24) these treat p ments being generally better accepted by patients. Lastly, in the framework of the new policies, new institutional models piloted and supported by the SATCM are being set up, bringing together research structures, hospitals, and univer p sity training institutes. These include the AIDS research sec p tion of the National Association of TCM in Zhengzhou, and the AIDS research institute at the TCM University of Henan. In Beijing, the organisational structure had been redesigned previously: the traditional medicine organisations specialising in the treatment and followpup of AIDS include AIDS treat p ment centres ( aizibing liaofa zhongxin ) such as that at the Guang'anmen Hospital (GAMH AIDS Clinical Centre), one of the hospitals of the National Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences that works in collaboration with research structures such as the AIDS department of the same Univer p sity. In 2000, a clinical research department, an AIDS treat p ment centre, and laboratories for testing, diagnosis, and analy p sis of viral load, were set up within Guang'anmen Hospital. Extension of treatment and integration of TCM in the national plan: A diachronic perspective and the present situation Since the 1980s, the Chinese government has shown politi p cal determination to enhance the value and explore the po p tential contribution of TCM to the prevention, treatment, and followpup of AIDS. This determination has been further re p inforced since the realignment of public policy in 2004: ac p cording to Wen Jiabao, (25) !the objective is to develop inte p grative methods of Chinese and Western medicine aimed at treating AIDS, and to this end, the resources of TCM must be completely exploited.\" Deputy Prime Minister Wu Yi also emphasised the importance of TCM during the National Working Meeting of Prevention and Treatment of AIDS that was held in the same year. We should note that the necessity of developing integrated treatment through the contribution of TCM was already indicated in official documents dealing with controlling the AIDS epidemic at the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s. (26) In real terms, the organ p ising and coordinating group on the prevention and treatment of AIDS was formed later in 2004 by the SATCM, drawing up the first project for the development of TCM for the treat pment of AIDS (Project of AIDS Prevention and Treatment with TCM of SATCM, 2004p2005). A series of public pol p icy measures and regulations promulgated by the SATCM and the Ministry of Health followed. (27) In terms of research, before the discovery and marketing of ARVs began in 1998, the Ministry of Science and Technol p ogy ( Keji bu ) had in the 1980s identified the development of TCM for the treatment of AIDS as a major project of public research in biological and medical science. In fact, clinical trials of treatment of AIDS with TCM were carried out in Tanzania in 1987: a group of researchers from the Na p tional TCM Research Institute, an academic institution that has since been raised to the status of an academy and re p named National TCM Academy in Beijing, then headed by Lu Weibo, director of the institute's AIDS department, was sent to Tanzania, where Chinese medicine was already widespread and appreciated, (28) to conduct exploratory re p search. The official explanation for the delocalisation of this research cited the fact that the pool of patients identified in China was too small to satisfy the criteria for inclusion in a test. These studies were carried out until 1995, with the re p sults reported in a number of publications.

Wu Gang, \"Status and Prospect in Preventing and Treat- ing HIV/AIDS with Traditional Chinese Medicine,\" Chinese Journal of 81-84, English language edition. 28.We should recall that Chinese medicine was introduced into Tanzania in the 1970s thanks to the close links established between the Chinese and Tanzanian governments. Chinese medical teams were sent by the central and provincial governments to work in the coun - try's district hospitals. Cf. Elisabeth Hsu, 2002, \"'The medicine from China has rapid effects': Chinese medicine patients pp. 291-313. 29.A (non-exhaustive) summary of the protocols, hypotheses, and results of research car - ried out in the 1990s is provided in Lu Weibo, Traitement du sida par la m\u00e9decine et la pharmacop\u00e9e traditionnelles chinoises: Huit cas de conversion s\u00e9ron\u00e9gative , translated from the Chinese by Mo Xuqiang, Paris, Quim\u00e9tao, 1998, 127 pp. Lu also refers to re - search carried out in China and its results published in Chinese journals such as zhongyi zazhi(TCM Journal), Zhongyi xueyuan xuebao (TCM (Chinese journal of in - tegrated traditional and Western medicine ); further information and clinical tests are re - ported in Zhong Dajin, Wang Xuao, Zhao Shuzhen, Fu Lining (compilers), A izibing de zhongyi zhiliao (Treatment of AIDS with TCM), Beijing, Zhongguo Shandong kexue jishu chubanshe (Shandong Science and Technology Press), 1992, 127 pp.china perspectives Management of the AIDS Epidemic and Local-Global Use of Chinese Medicine among researchers today is that methodological shortcom p ings produced biases and led to highly questionable results such as cases of !negative seroconversion.\" (30) Official discourse on the subject highlights three stages in the research in progress over the past 20 years and its clini p cal application to HIV treatment: the exploratory stage in Tanzania (1987p1995) consisted of acquiring general knowl p edge and building up clinical tests; the stage of preliminary research (1995p2003) was characterised by observations made possible by the TCM treatment of patients in areas where the epidemic had developed in China; simultane p ously, medicinal plants were tested in laboratories and se p lected for their antipHIV effects. Lastly, since 2003, the third stage has centred around the standardisation of the products identified and their development for possible mar p keting. (31) We should note, however, that the ethical problems raised by this research have rarely if ever been mentioned up to now. This situation is worrying, as the first two stages, one delocalised to Africa and the other relocalised to China, ap p parently prolonged while waiting for the introduction of a na p tional programme in certain regions and localities, imply the treatment of underpinformed patients, first by monotherapy with AZT for the treatment of HIV after 1994, and then by multitherapies introduced in 1996. In fact, access to ARVs was limited to patients who could afford them, because there was no reimbursement before the launch of the national pro p gramme in the context of the public health system. Combined/complementary treatment: Some fragmentary but meaningful data We note a time lag between the political determination stated for two decades and the progress of research toward widespread application of a product in everyday clinical practice. This situation has not yet come about in reality, but is in pilot clinical or everyday practice, depending on the lo p cality, with the introduction of the Tang herbal tablet, which was finally approved for the treatment of HIV infection in 2006 by the SFDA (32) and is today recommended at the na p tional level as a complementary treatment with HAART. This recommendation is not unanimously approved among healthcare workers and administrative cadres in the health system, however. For example, in Number 4 Hospital in Nanning, where the Tang tablet is prescribed in accordance with the recommendation, some members of the AIDS, In p fectious Disease and Hepatitis Department, and some hos p pital cadres, say it will take some time to confirm the effec ptiveness of the herbal tablet. To them and to other members of the medical staff, TCM products cannot be validated by clinical trials as in biomedicine, but only by !oldpfashioned\" clinical experience, according to which effectiveness can only be confirmed over a long period of time, stretching over generations. At the MSF clinic in Nanning, which cooper p ates with this hospital, members of the medical staff believe that the product can't do any harm, but its use was not pro p moted because TCM products have a certain cost, and the association could not pay for medicine that is not certified at an international level. (33) In Guangzhou, at the Number 8 Hospital that has an AIDS department, collaboration is closer between the medical, TCM research, and biomedi p cine staff because a TCM dispensary operates within the department, combining everyday clinical practice with re p search carried out with the traditional medical University. Around ten beds are reserved for patients volunteering for joint treatment, and patients being treated at Number 8 Hospital were recruited for a test being carried out at the tra p ditional medicine university. An interesting but very worry p ing aspect of the test underway is the number of dropp outs, (34) which repeatedly reached 30 percent, since the number of other patients newly included equalled that of those who !left\" the research protocol. (35) Lastly, returning to a macrosocial rather than a microsocial analytical perspective, we should note that beyond the polit p ically correct discourse heard in certain meetings, the share represented by TCM in China CIPRA (China Compre p hensive Integrated Programs for Research on AIDS) proj p ects and their publications is limited. (36) Moreover, TCM was referred to in a UNAIDS report for the first time in 2007, in a section dealing with the treatment of opportunist 71 No 2 0 0 9 / 1 30.Title of Lu Weibo's book, op. cit. 31.Wu Gang, art.cit ., p.83. 32.We should nevertheless mention that in 2006 this national organisation was implicated in a series of serious scandals concerning the health safety of food and medicinal prod - ucts, events widely reported in the official Chinese press by Xinhua, China Daily , etc., and internationally by Reuters, among others. These scandals undermined its authority and led to severe penal sanctions, including the execution of the organisation's former head in July 2007. 33.Interviews and observation carried out during field research in January 2008: visits to Number 4 Hospital and to the MSF clinic in Nanning. 34.In the framework of the HAART-TCM programme: some patients rejoined the non-com - bined HAART programme. 35.Id.: visits to the departments and research laboratories in Number 8 Hospital and to the traditional medicine university. 36.See China CIPRA Reference book, China CIPRA Overview , 2007, 253 pp., and China CIPRA's Publications Book , 2007, 340 pp., published by China CIPRA, www.cipran - caids.org.cn.

Under treatment, the condition of patients has improved and some have been able to resume their professional activity.! (37) The national pilot project on the use of TCM for the treatment of HIV-AIDS implemented in Guangxi and Yunnan begin p ning in 2005 shows encouraging results, with a reduction in clinical symptoms, a better quality of life, and no side effects or unfavourable reaction reported in the local press. (38) Moreover, an example of the use of the pharmacopoeia aimed at preventing the transmission of HIV through the sharing of contaminated needles by intravenous drug users, which remains a common means of transmission (after being the dominant means of transmission until 2005), was re p ported in 2008. The formula being tested can help end drug use: !It has particular properties which fight psychological addiction and anxiety, and prevent relapse.\" (39) Research in traditional medicine and treatments for HIV/AIDS In the first part of this section, I will deal with social and eco p nomic usages, including aspects of economics and the philos p ophy of knowledge. The second deals more specifically with the methodology of clinical testing as well as with treatments and research into AIDS. The last part, which refocuses on the Chinese world after a look at international research, seeks to provide information on tests of treatment for AIDS in China. The social, economic and scientific usages of TCM in China I will briefly summarise the sociopcultural and economic con p text of the use of TCM in China today. Chinese medicine is one of the icons of Chinese identity. For some time, it has been widely used by the authorities in the context of a more widespread revitalisation of certain aspects of Chinese cul p ture, such as the reassertion of the value of the architectural and artistic heritage, and of an education based on !Confu p cian\" values dispensed by the Confucius Institutes. (40) These phenomena of !heritagepisation! and revitalisation of ele p ments in the cultural repertoire have been identified in many societies, and are always associated with social change. In this context one can speak of a tendency to heritagepise med p ical knowledge \u2014 the problem is determining which knowl p edge \u2014 that is expressed in a diffuse or affirmed manner in Chinese society today. Concern for the !medical tradition\" has manifested itself in the desire of some categories of the population, who are witnessing this trend towards the !bio p medicalisation\" of Chinese medicine particularly in research methods, to remove TCM from the Chinese public health system and to question the idea of integration ( However, we should recall that !integrative\" or !hybrid\" practices and knowledge have developed since the 1950s, particularly during the time of the Cultural Revolution (1966p1976) in China, supported by a strong political deter p mination that shaped a consciously formulated hybridisation and a !top down\" syncretism. (41) In an accepted sense that has been widened to include other sociopcultural contexts and other forms of medical knowledge, they are also devel p oping rapidly, and have been validated at an international level with recommendations and declarations of the WHO favouring the insertion of TCM in national health systems since 1980. To return to the concern for Chinese medicine reflected in popular rather than official discourse, it is worth noting a de p bate that reached an unexpected scale at the end of 2006 following the online publication of an article by Professor Zhang Kongyao, a science philosopher at Hunan's Univer p sity of Changsha, which he posted on his blog, and in which he questioned the insertion of Chinese medicine into the public health system. The question at the heart of the de p bate turns out to be much more subtle than the a priori Manichean one of !for or against\" TCM in public medicine or in general that resulted from distortion of the issue through media dissemination. Zhang did not radically op p pose zhongyi, but called into question the process of institu p tionalisation of this medicine in the framework of schools, in p stitutes, and universities that teach Chinese medicine 72 No 2 0 0 9 / 1 37.A Joint Assessment of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Treatment and Care in China (2007 ), State Council AIDS Working Committee Office, UN Theme Group on AIDS in China, 1 Decem - ber 2007, 38 pp., p. 25. 38.Chen Yihua, Wei Yishan, Jiang Xian, \"Many benefits to treating HIV/AIDS with Traditional Chinese Medicine,\" Nanning Evening News , 18 December 2007; Cai Xiangrong, \"1,658 AIDS patients in Yunnan receive free treatment with Chinese Medicine,\" Xinhua , 28 Sep - tember 2007. 39.\"Specialized Chinese medicine shows quick results for quitting drugs,\" 2 January 2008, http://nb.qianlong/htlm/news/20081/73379.htm, posted on the site of the NGO www.china-aids.org, visited on 15 January 2009. 40.For an analysis of references to Confucianism and to \"cultural tradition\" in official dis - the S\u00e9bastien Billioud, \"Confucianism, 'Cultural Tradition,' and Of- ficial Discourse in China at the Start of the New Century,\" China Perspectives , Medicine' in the rural Lijiang basin: State policy and local practice(s) in socialist China,\" Social Sciences and Medicine , 1999, n\u00b049, pp. 1333-1347.china perspectives Management of the AIDS Epidemic and Local-Global Use of Chinese Medicine (zhongyi xuexiao, xueyuan, daxue ). (42) In his view, zhongyi cannot become a discipline in the academic system because traditional medicine is characterised by its holistic dimension and its historic, philosophical, and philological links with lit p erature, poetry, and painting: for example, some prescrip p tions were calligraphed poems. (43) Zhang suggested returning domain of !popular remedies\" ( minjian yiliao ) and reasserting its value through hereditary family or spiri p tual (44) transmission and practice exercised in the framework of !popular\" social organisations ( minjian hui-pai ), a means of shedding light on the futility of questions about moderni p sation and the construction of the evidence according to the norms of the biomedical sciences. (45) Moreover, in these times of economic and cultural globalisa p tion, Chinese remedies appeal to the new middle class in China and already make up an important part of the global market for complementary and alternative medicines, and are thus potentially lucrative. (46) We can therefore hypothe p sise that traditional medicine in its widest sense is, at the in p ternational level, the most commonly used repertoire of ther p apies among nonpbiomedical medicines. In the economic sphere, TCM research and development lies within the framework of the world health market be p cause of the potential marketing of pharmacotherapy (zhongyiyao ) and traditional pharmacology ( zhongyiyao xue ) products. These products could become a welcome niche market for the Chinese pharmaceutical industry (47) in the wake of constraints linked to China's access to the WTO, (48) when these companies can no longer systemati p cally manufacture the generic versions of biomedical prod p ucts patented in the developed countries that previously made up 97 percent of their production. The development of TCM pharmacology shows an orientation towards the merchandising underway in consumer societies by partici p pating in globalised methods of promoting traditional med p icines: the marketing methods and packaging of TCM products are becoming increasingly similar to those origi p nally used in the United States for dietary supplements (vi p tamins, antipoxidants, etc.) and which subsequently spread worldwide, including a number of products and prepara p tions that are available without a prescription (over the counter, or OTC). (49) In her research into the factors that led African peoples and governments to adopt Chinese medicine in the 1990s, Elisabeth Sue has emphasised that economic factors could not be underestimated, even though other factors such as the socialist orientation of po p litical ideology, the upward social mobility of patients, and the treatment strategies of actors attracted to this medicine out of curiosity or as a last resort, also play a part in the spread of TCM. (50) We have noted that while present at negotiations on the de p velopment of international research in Chinese medicine, the strategy of China's industry and the authorities \u2014 the in p dustry being mainly controlled by the State \u2014 was to obtain a licence to sell in developed countries by registering the compositions of the pharmacopoeia in the medical rather than dietary supplements category. The legal scientific vali p dation framework is much more constraining, implying a re p sort to the EBM (51) model and the carrying out of conclu p sive (52) (which is not to say successful) clinical tests.

Its objective is the close examination of TCM products, and the methods used in p clude high level screening, toxicity tests, and clinical trials to identify the active substances and toxic substances in 400,000 TCM compositions and 10,000 vegetable and ani p mal extracts. (53) Moreover, TCM-Chinese medicine appears in a call for projects launched by the French NRA (National Research Agency) for the first time this year, following FrancopChinese research agreements in partnership with bi p ological and medical sciences in the Biotechnologies for Health Programme (54) : !The BiotechS programme is open p ing up internationally in 2009 with the possible participation of Chinese partners in projects dealing with the study of tra p ditional Chinese medicines. These international projects will be evaluated according to the same procedures and by the same committees as French projects.\" Key words in the pro p gramme include biomarkers, biomaterials, sifting, clinical tri p als, immunotherapy, nonpmedical imagery, and therapeutic innovation. In short, they refer to biotechnologies based on innovative scientific concepts that exploit cuttingpedge tech p nologies in biology and medicine. Clinical trials and treatments for AIDS Consensually at the level of concepts and practice, clinical trials are ideally carried out in four stages. Stage I tests and determines the dose that triggers the initial desired and un p desired pharmacological effects, usually on healthy subjects numbering 20 at most. During Phase II, pharmacological ef p fectiveness is evaluated with the establishment of optimal dosage and efficient posology. The therapeutic index deter p mines the relation between the prescribed dose and the toxic dose. This stage still poses unresolved problems to re p searchers, and difficulty varies according to the pathology. Phase III consists of applying a particular methodology based on comparisons between homogenous groups of pa p tients, with one receiving the product and the other a refer p ence product or a placebo. In order for both groups to be identical, a draw is carried out called randomisation. In order to prevent an induction phenomenon, the test is car p ried out !double blind\": none of those concerned knows the result of the randomisation. Inclusion criteria for patients, who range in number from 100 to several thousand, are very precise and selective. This methodology defines doublep blinded randomised and placebopcontrolled clinical trials. Phase IV, known as !pharmacovigilance,! consists of testing the effectiveness and tolerance to the product in normal pre p scription conditions, and in ordinary clinical practice. I have briefly described the complete methodology of a !nor p malised\" test employed by the scientific community and pharmaceutical industry as a condition for licensing a medi p cine for sale in order to give an idea of the complexity of the process of researching and developing a medicine or biotech p nology for therapeutic use, from the identification of a sub p stance, composition, or molecule to the marketing of the final product. To continue this analysis with a more specific case study, we should note that medical research, which ideally tends to p wards !normalisation\" according to the EBM model, has shown potential but no really significant progress in treat p ments for HIV-AIDS using natural products. After a decade of extensive research aimed at discovering natural antipHIV agents, a certain number of natural products have been selected for their specific actions and their low toxicity. Most of them have the potential to interfere with successive antipviral targets, which can produce action mechanisms that complement those of available antipviral medicines. How p ever, the other aspect of the problem concerns the inade p quately explored interactions between natural antipHIV products and biomedical treatments, which in some cases can make the treatments ineffective or harmful. (55) In 2005, although no plantpbased medicine was currently being used in clinical practice for treating AIDS, a certain number of natural plantpbased preparations were identified as potentially antipviral and were tested in a clinical trial framework. (56) In 2000, a review of the literature on the re p sults of the treatment of HIV-AIDS with Chinese medicine \u2014 acupuncture and pharmacopoeia \u2014 concluded that despite promising indications of the reduction of certain symptoms, the published results were not convincing and showed methodological weaknesses. (57) At that time it was possible to identify two kinds of studies: one focused on symptomatic relief, for example of diarrhoea and neuropathy, while the 74 No 2 0 0 9 / 1 53.\"TCM under the microscope: Researchers hope the project will lead to better quality control,\" Science , 12 February 2008. 54.http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/AAPProjetsOuverts?NodId= 17&lngAAPId=227, page visited on 15 January 2009, pdf programme, p. 83. 55.See Edward Mills, Victor Montori, Dan Perri, Elizabeth Phillips, Gideon Koren, \"Natural health product-HIV drug interactions: A systematic review,\" AIDS , 2005, n\u00b016, pp. 181-186. 56.See an overview of the situation, including a review of publications, by Inder Pal Singh, Sandip B.

Controlled clinical trials attesting to the effectiveness of Chinese medicine based on biomedical markers of HIV (58) infection should be carried out in the framework of future research. (59) At a methodological level, the objective will be to normalise clinical trials in traditional medicine according to international biomedical standards. Clinical trials of AIDS treatments in China In the 2000s, following a trend observed in emerging and developing countries, clinical trials in China have undergone unprecedented development. We should remember that for a decade the country has been accelerating along the path of economic and cultural globalisation, including that of the world health market. We should note that China has very re p cently integrated the WHO system for the registration of clinical trials, (60) and that this procedure allows Chinese data to be submitted to the WHO research site on the Internet. The Chinese Register of clinical trials was initiated in 2005, and in less than two years was recognised as compliant with the norms. According to Margaret Chan, Director General of the WHO, the efforts of the Chinese and Indian govern p ments toward this integration reinforce the international movement for transparency and distribution of information from research circles to the public. In this context, even innovative treatments for AIDS are tested in traditional medicine and in biomedicine. (61) Thus the legitimisation process for TCM includes validation based on the evidence provided by biomedical testing: proof of the biological effectiveness and harmlessness of a composition or technique being tested has to be provided according to EBM evaluation criteria in order for these !AMC\" treat p ments to be validated by the international scientific commu p nity and given a permit to be sold on the market. (62) It was in 1985 that the first seropositive person was discov p ered in China, and in that same year the first clinical trials of treatment for HIV by the pharmacopoeia were carried out at the Quan Yin Center in San Francisco by Dr. Misha Cohen's team. This team also carried out the first double blind randomised and placebopcontrolled test of a Chinese pharmacopoeia treatment of the symptoms associated with HIV, the results of which were published in an international journal. (63) According to the results reported in a number of Chinese ac p ademic publications on clinical trials of AIDS treatments, TCM research shows advances in the identification of plants, in the extraction of the most active substances, and in the testing of medicinal compositions: out of 1,000 species of plants commonly used in the pharmacopoeia, more than 100 have an antipviral effect and several dozen inhibit the spread of HIV. (64) These publications confirm that animal, vegetable, or mineral extracts can be conceptualised and ul p timately categorised as medicinal products on the biomedical model without any explicit reference to TCM theory and practice. Compounds of CATCMpII ( Zhongyan p2) CATCMpIV (Zhongyan are innovative TCM treat p ments undergoing clinical trials, bear the name of the insti p tution that tests them: the China Academy CACMS (Z hongguo zhongyi kexueyuan ). Testing stages have been carried out in the framework of the TCM treatment of HIV-AIDS project, which was implemented with the col p laboration of 50 Chinese researchers with the Muhimbili Medical Centre in Tanzania over a period of 17 years. This project produced an accumulation of clinical trials and the publication of more than 100 articles.

(65) The SFDA's functions primarily concern the safety of food and health products, but also include supervi p sion of research protocols and clinical trials submitted for the organisation's prior approval. Let us take the example of the publication by Ma et al. (66) resulting from the clinical trial aimed at testing the effective p ness of the Aikeqing capsule in treatment combined with ARVs, in order to shed light on the problem of evaluating results. The protocol describes a clinical trial that will lack scientific validity, regardless of its outcome, since its inclu p sion of only eight patients without a control group does not meet the international norms for a double blind random trial. However, some clinicians see the results as showing some therapeutic effectiveness. This kind of clinical research could be validated to some extent in a prepEBM framework. It is not merely a clinical trial dependent on the subjectivity of one practitioner. Thus the toxicity of TCM products was tra p ditionally documented by clinical trial, while the most mod p ern toxicity data are based on animal testing in the frame p work of prepclinical trials. (67) The initial results of documentary research (68) show that the most widelypused treatments are commonly used in the daily lives of people and families to maintain health, stimulate the immune system, and improve the overall immunity of the body. A very small number of treatments tested are TCM in p novations \u2014 for example the Zhongyan p1 to Zhongyan p4 compounds. To give an idea of innovative treatments tested according to the methodology of random double blind trials with a con p trol group under placebo, I will give some indications regard p ing the Zhongyan p4 composition taken from the results pub p lished by Wang et al .(69) The product tested, prepared by the Tianjiang Pharmaceutical Company based in Jiangsu, in p cludes extracts article concludes that the preparation has a function of protection and-or reconstruc p tion of the immunity of patients with early and intermediatep stage AIDS infection, contributes to reducing the power of the virus, increases body weight and improves certain symp p toms. (70) The first two components mentioned, Ginseng root and Astragalus root, have a long history in the corpus of the pharmacopoeia, indicated for immune deficiency with the main function of stimulating the immune system. Con p stituents in the second component are the object of research at an international level that has begun to produce encourag p ing results reported in an international journal of immunol p ogy. (71) Moreover, Curcumin, a major constituent of natural curcuminoids extracted from plants, has an effect against AIDS, according to another recent publication. (72) We should note that the treatments tested in the framework of clinical trials are usually pharmacopoeia ( zhongyao ) com p positions and prescriptions, possibly accompanied by a com p plementary treatment ( zhenjiu , qigong ), although acupunc p turepmoxibustion and qigong treatments are described, for example, in Song et al. (73) I was struck, moreover, by the in p terest shown by one of my interlocutors, D., the deputy di p rector of the research institute concerned, in qigong treat p ments, the use of which has always been more or less called into question by health professionals and authorities in the institutional framework.

Conclusion The results of clinical trials of TCM AIDS treatments do not for the moment reveal any significant advance as recog p nised by the international scientific community, even if some internationalplevel publications report encouraging results. In China, a single product, the Tang herbal tablet, has been li p censed for the market, and its use is now recommended in the clinical practice of combined treatments. As has been stated by Cao Yunzhen, immunologist and head investigator of the axis concerned with clinical research into AIDS on the China CIPRA programme, no specific category of med p icine has been identified as inhibiting the spread of the virus and rebuilding the patient's immunity. (75) Having said that, the use of TCM in treatments, followpup, and research has an important place in Chinese public health policies. The role given to contemporary TCM, reinforced by its place as a knowledge established as an icon of national identity, is un p derpinned by the validation and legitimisation of a combined scientific and traditional rationality. As I have sought to demonstrate in this article, this legitimisation tends to be based on the EBM model, thus reflecting a current tendency in biomedical research, as well as on an invented or rein p vented model of knowledge drawn from the source of Chi p nese cultural heritage. In this context, the use of TCM in AIDS treatment is pro p moted in the framework of national management of the epi p demic. This role can also be explained by more pragmatic factors: the unresolved problems previously mentioned here, which affect the extension of treatment and followpup, in p cluding what is still very limited access to secondpline ARV treatment regimes, as well as, from an economic perspective, the urgent need for innovation in order to survive in the face of international competition in the Chinese pharmaceutical industry sector, can also be factors that explain the official position visp\u00e0pvis traditional medicine. Since 2004, ARV treatment regimes provided free of charge in the framework of the national programme have been the object of discus p sion and sharp criticism reflecting conflicts of interest be p tween various categories of national-global, economic, and political actors. (76) In fact, in China today, access to secondp line treatments is still limited to the framework of pilot schemes, and while firstpline treatments remain more eco p nomical, they do not offer the best combinations, particu p larly because they are associated with the development of re psistance and generate particularly strong side effects, a fact that tends to encourage the abandonment of treatment and nonpobservant behaviours. These inconveniences or defi p ciencies, inherent in the prescribed medicinal regimes, can facilitate the acceptance of traditional medicine by patients as integrative treatment and even as an alternative treatment. In an oral presentation at the WHO Conference on tradi p tional medicines (7p9 November 2008), Deputy Health Minister and Director of the SATCM, Wang Guoqiang, re p ferred to the use of TCM only as a treatment complemen p tary to or combined with the HAART programme, and reaffirmed the principles inscribed in the national pro p gramme for the prevention, treatment, and followpup of AIDS, which recommends prescribing TCM in a manner !integrated\" with biomedical treatments as an asset available in the national culture to be developed in fundamental and applied research. Nevertheless, given that TCM treatments and research are not yet standardised, and that interactions between biomed p ical and traditional medicines are not sufficiently docu p mented, the use of TCM in combined treatments generates strong controversy in the world of clinical practice and re p search, public health, and health administration. From the patients' point of view, popular perception can differ from that of health professionals, and depart from a scientific ra p tionality that values only experimental proof while ignoring the existence of other rationalities. Within the Chinese world, in Hong Kong, which enjoys special status in the People's Republic, and where over 95 percent of the popu p lation is Chinese, Chinese medicine is typically considered a complementary followpup to Western medicine. (77) Accord p ing to a recent study, use of TCM does not seem to have sig p nificant influence on HAART regimes among the popula p tion concerned; (78) the majority of patients consume tradi p tional products following a reasonable time interval after tak p ing ARV, in order not to reduce its effectiveness.
