Charlton, author of Addicted to Distraction With its wireless networks encompassing the globe, the Digital Revolution is altering the very fabric of our lives with alarming rapidity. New technologies are bringing about an ever closer union between human beings and machines, whilst at the same time transforming our planet into an increasingly hybrid 'cyber-physical' world. The current rollout of fifth generation wireless commu - nication networks, or 5G, is central to the project to create a global 'electronic ecosystem' , in which we will be obliged to live. This will provide the basis for an all-pervasive Internet of Things, and the widespread integration of Augmented and Virtual Reality into human experience. But what genuine human needs will this serve? Does the planet really need to be made 'smart'? Will our health, and that of other living creatures, really be unaffected by exposure to escalating levels of electromagnetic radiation? As we enter a new era of extreme technology, driven by a momentum that seems beyond the constraint of any spiritual or moral consideration, both human beings and nature face an unprecedented challenge. Jeremy Naydler argues that it is a challenge that can only be met through a re-affirmation of essential human values and the recovery of a sacred view of nature. From this grounding, we can work towards a truly human future that, rather than creating yet more pollution and toxicity, will bring blessing to the natural world to which we belong. JEREMY NAYDLER, PH.D., is a philosopher, cultural historian and gardener who lives and works in Oxford, England. His longstanding concern about the impact of electronic technologies on our inner life and on our relationship to nature has found expression in his book In the Shadow of the Machine (Temple Lodge 201 8) and in numerous articles contributed to magazines such as New View, Self and Society and Resurgence.

Steiner described the collaboration between human souls connected to the Platonic and Aristotelian 'schools' or groupings - both here on Earth and in the spiritual world. These groupings of souls work within a wider metaphysical collective known as the 'Michael School' , led by the ruling Spirit of our age, Michael. Prior to their births,millions of human souls were prepared within this School to help them face the challenges of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. We may have forgotten these pre-existence experi - ences, but they can be reawakened within us, says Hartmann. Indeed, it is possible consciously to reconnect to our earlier incarnations and to perceive our karma. The book begins with this theme and leads to Rudolf Steiner's 'Michael Prophecy' of 1924 - to his vision of the millennium and the era in which we now live, especially the crucial period between 201 2 and 2033. Dealing with the 'anthroposophical block' in the emerging holistic building of humanity, the author contextualizes the topic with reference to direct personal experiences. The sharing of such considered experiences can help to stimulate self-reflection in the anthroposophical movement and contribute real spiritual substance to contemporary culture. This little book provides stimulation to spiritual seekers who carry within them deeper questions about life in the modern world. STEFFEN HARTMANN, born in 1976 in Freiburg im Breisgau, studied piano in Hamburg and participated as accompanist in master classes with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, and has worked closely with the soprano Marret Winger. He is the author of many German-language books and has led the Rudolf Steiner Haus Hamburg branch of the Anthroposophical Society since 201 2, in addition to holding lectures and conducting seminar and concert activities in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Finland, Greece and Brazil.

I see diseases being translocated to others - humans or animals - despite the good intentions of many therapists or doctors. The diseases are translo - cated because they do not exist in energetic patterns, but as expressions of spiritual beings. Energy and energy-patterns only exist in the physical world, but in the spiritual world there are only spiritual beings.' From ancient times, all cultures have known of the spiritual phenomenon of 'translocation' - the movement of a pathological entity from one human being to another, or from a human being to an animal. These pathological entities are spiritual beings, known as 'demons' in common parlance. Their translocation, says Are Thoresen, can take place as a result of conventional Western medicine, but also from the application of 'alternative' therapies such as homeopathy, acupuncture and herbal medicine. In order to have a positive therapeutic impact, Thoresen advises that practitioners, doctors and veterinarians need to acquire a deep understanding of the function and laws of pathological demonic entities and the means to influence them. Using the Middle Point or Christ-force, it is possible to transform - instead of simply translocating - the negative spiritual aspects that are at work in contemporary society. As the author states: 'I have written this book to try to investigate these possibilities, and to give my fellow travellers in spirit the insights, tools and ability to make such a change.' ARE THORESEN was born in Norway in 1952. A doctor of veterinary medicine, he has also studied anthroposophic medicine, homeopathy, acupuncture, osteopathy and agriculture. Since 198 1 he has run a private holistic practice in Sandefjord, Norway, for the healing of small animals and horses, as well as people. He has lectured widely, specializing in veterinary acupuncture, and has published dozens of scholarly articles. He is the author of Demons and Healing (201 8), Experiences from the Threshold and Beyond (2019, both Temple Lodge) and several other books on complementary medicine published in various languages.

Rudolf Steiner describes that when the spiritual bodies separate from the physical body, the etheric body of the dying person is revealed, giving a panoramic overview of their earthly life. This etheric body contains everything we have experienced in our consciousness and kept in memory. The etheric not only generates and sustains all life, but encompasses the life forces out of which we shape our existence. Although the revelation of the life tableau belongs to the early period after death, it can also emerge as a result of meditation. Rudolf Steiner speaks of this - through the first level of spiritual experience known as 'imagination' - as a conscious self- perception of the soul, taking place in the world of images. Here we are confronted with the harrowing knowledge of our doppelg\u00e4nger - but we also experience the cosmic forces of childhood that are present in all our life processes. These same forces are described in psychology as the 'inner child' . In this highly-original anthology of Steiner's work we are led to a therapeutic, meditative approach that - through working with the imaginative life tableau - can strengthen and heal body, soul and spirit. Chapters include: 'Experiencing the Inner Child as the Starting Point for a New Philosophy'; 'Experiencing Life before Birth'; 'Pain and Life Tableau'; 'Intensive Backward Thinking'; 'Feelings of Happiness Experiencing the Life Tableau'; 'Re-experiencing the Inner Child'; 'Through the Forces of Childhood to the Higher Self and the Christ Experience' .

When all knowledge is seemingly digitized and available for reference at any time, do we actually need human memory? One consequence of the proliferation of digitization is the deterioration of our capacity to remember - a symptom that is apparent in a steady increase in dementia within contemporary society. Rudolf Steiner indicates that memory is the determining factor in awareness of oneself. Even a partial loss of memory leads to loss of self-conscious - ness and the sense of our 'I' . Thus, memory is crucial for the development of I-consciousness - not only for the individual, but for humanity as a whole. Rudolf Steiner's research on memory, recollection and forgetting has many implications for the way we learn, for inner development and spiritual growth. This unique selection of passages from his works offers insights into how consciousness can remain autonomous and creative in a digital environment. It also provides ideas for improving education and emphasizes the importance of life-long learning. Chapters include: 'The Development of Memory Throughout Human History'; 'The Formation of Memory, Remembering and Forgetting in the Human Individual'; 'Remembering and Forgetting in Connection with Education'; 'How Remembering and Forgetting are Transformed by the Schooling Path - Imagination and Inspiration'; 'Remembering Backwards ( R\u00fcckschau) and Memory Exercises'; 'Subconscious Memories of the Pre-birth Period and of Life Between Death and a New Birth'; 'Memory and Remembering after Death'; 'The Development of Memory in the Future' . RUDOLF STEINER (1 861-1925) called his spiritual , meaning 'wisdom of the human being' . As a highly developed seer, he based his work on direct knowledge and perception of spiritual dimensions. From his investigations Steiner provided suggestions for the renewal of many activities, includ ing education (both general and special), agricultur e, medicine, economics, architecture, science, philosophy, religion and the arts. Today there are thousands of schools, clinics, farms and other organizations involved in practical work based on his principles. Trans. J. Collis & P. King; Edited with Intro. by A. Neider (Selections, various GAs); 252pp; 2 x 1 Gl\u00f6ckler What this concise summary and introduction, Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler presents the therapeutic spectrum of anthroposophic medicine - its scientific basis, diagnostic methods and potential for practice. She gives numerous practical examples of its application and suggestions for treating patients at home. Anthroposophic medicine is an integrative system that combines scientific training and practice with a spiritual understanding of the human being. It seeks primarily to stimulate self-healing powers, directly supporting recovery processes and innate capacities of resistance. Anthroposophic physicians - registered general practitioners and specialists in all fields - utilize the knowledge and skills of conventional treatments as well as anthroposophic and homoe - opathic medicines, external applications, and eurythmy, art and physical therapies. Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler describes the current status of anthroposophic medicine whilst raising awareness of the social dimension of illness and health to address issues of fate and destiny and to show what individuals can do for their own and other people's health. She reflects on Rudolf Steiner's call to 'make the health system democratic' and clarifies why scientific pluralism of methods and freedom of therapy are essential for the further development of the healthcare system and a modern understanding of disease. DR MICHAELA GL\u00d6CKLER has been Leader of the Medical Section at the Goetheanum, the School of Spiritual Science in Dornach, Switzerland, since 1988. She studied medicine in T\u00fcbingen and Marburg and trained as a pediatrician at the community hospital in Herdecke and at the Bochum University Pediatric Clinic. Michaela is the author of many books in German. Her publications in English include Medicine at the Threshold, A Healing Education, Developmental Insights, and A Guide to Child's Health. Trans. A.

Working through a topic or question, a shaft of sudden inspiration hits. The cloud of fragmented ideas and thoughts clear as a whole picture begins to form coherently in your mind. What you have now worked out - in an unexpected, exciting eureka moment - will stay with you forever. All teachers seek this experience for their students. Liz Attwell explores theories of education to argue that traditional teaching, 'filling buckets' , must be replaced by dynamic, progressive teaching that promotes active learning - not just 'lighting a fire' , but knowing how to lay the sticks and finding the matches too. This progressive approach seeks to create a basis for inner awakening and original insight, in order for students ultimately to come to their own a-ha moments. In A Drop of Light , Liz Attwell presents her original research into the phenomenon of a-ha moments, offering a theoretical background as well as practical advice to give teachers the tools, lesson plans, anecdotes and inspiration to bring living thinking to their own classrooms. Goethe's approach and Rudolf Steiner's pedagogical ideas make an important contribution, but Attwell advises that teachers following Steiner's philosophy should enter into dialogue with educators from other backgrounds. Working together, enlightened teachers around the world can help schools and colleges to become true learning communities. LIZ ATTWELL (1960-2019) taught English at Michael Hall School, Sussex, for fourteen years. She studied English Literature at Exeter University followed by a PGCE training in Secondary English and Drama with Dorothy Heathcote at Newcastle University. At Michael Hall she helped introduce Continuing Professional Development and Theory U change management, whilst researching the inter - face between mainstream technique and the epistemology that underpins Waldorf Education for an MA in Creativity in Education at King's College, London.

Rudolf Steiner's search for the words and style to bring to expression a contemporary spiritual worldview epitomises this. In seven organically developing chapters, this little book presents Martina Maria Sam's long-standing research into this subject. As a writer, editor and lecturer she observed the increasing difficulty that many people - particularly those with an academic training - have with Steiner's style. However, this style was something that Rudolf Steiner developed very deliberately. As she states: 'What was most important for me in this was to point out Rudolf Steiner's intentions in his specific and often original linguistic forms and, consequently, to create the introductory basis for a deeper understanding.' Gaining such understanding, she says, can in turn enable us to develop insight into the spirit. Sam begins by quoting some of Steiner's contemporaries, who criticized his 'grating' style. She describes why he had to create new forms of expression and examines the specific character of his lectures. She considers two comprehensive stylistic principles that permeate Steiner's entire body of work, and his special handling of the pictorial element in language. Close attention is paid to Rudolf Steiner's construction of meditative verses and mantras, and the development of an artistic, linguistically-creative element that will only be possible in the future. MARTINA MARIA SAM was born in 1960 in Hornbach/Odenwald, Germany and studied sociology and political science at the University of Heidelberg. She has worked as a eurythmist on the Goetheanum stage, as editor on the Rudolf Steiner Gesamtausgabe and the weekly newspaper Das Goetheanum, and she wrote her Master's thesis on Rudolf Steiner's blackboard drawings ( Bildspuren der Imagination, Dornach, 2000). In 2000 she assumed leadership of the Sektion f\u00fcr Sch\u00f6ne Wissen - schaften (Literary Arts and Humanities Section) of the School for Spiritual Science at the Goetheanum. Trans. Marguerite A.

Savoldelli's survey of cinema and film is based on practical experience - he was once the enfant terrible of Swiss cinema - and years of contemplation and study. He examines the difference between film as the 'hypnotic monster' referred to by the Italian director Pier Paolo Pasolini, and the art of film that Rudolf Steiner aspired to. The author depicts the historical development of cinema from its origins, paying particular attention to science fiction - from Star Wars to The Matrix - and influential filmmakers such as Eric Rohmer, Andrei Tarkovsky and Pasolini. As a scholar of anthroposophy, Savoldelli gives a comprehensive assessment of Rudolf Steiner's attitude to film. In addition to frequenting the silent cinema of his time, Steiner made several statements about the new artform in his lectures, letters and private discussions. The author examines and interprets these and complements them with commentary on Steiner's attempt to produce a film on the theme of reincarnation and karma as well as his explorations with Jan Stuten of 'light-show art' . Other topics in this penetrating study include: 'Basic philosophical stances in the pioneer period of media studies'; 'Steiner's prophetic warnings about a technocratic form of civilization that will destroy humanity'; 'Nostalgia for the art-house cinema that emerged in the 60s'; and 'The project discussed by Alexander Kluge and Andrei Tarkovsky for a film based on Rudolf Steiner's From the Akashic Records ' . Anyone interested in the cinematic arts will find a treasure of stimulating ideas and new thought in this unique book. RETO ANDREA SAVOLDELLI was born in Solothurn, Switzerland, in 1949. He is a director and actor, best known for his films Stella da Falla (1972) and Lydia (1969). He trained in Eurythmy under Elena Zuccoli at the Goetheanum, Swizerland, and developed Gideon Spicker Verlag, where he published Herbert Witzenmann's writings.

As a recognized authority on Buddhist texts, he knew that complete knowledge of such Mysteries was not to be found within the limitations of waking con - sciousness, sense perception and logic. Beckh was already aware that Gautama Buddha had indicated the stages of higher knowledge. Furthermore, his studies of Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophical teachings revealed that such knowledge could be experienced directly, given disciplined medita - tion. Clairvoyant cognition included the conscious penetration of sleep consciousness, the dream state and an experience of pre-natal consciousness. Both the Mysteries and Rudolf Steiner's major books, he concluded, were founded on the same perceptions. Beckh - a worldwide expert on Tibetan, Sanskrit, Pali and Avestan texts - quickly became disenchanted with Madame Blavatsky's Theosophy, as it displayed little precise academic knowl - edge of primary records. At the same time, university departments showed scant trace of understand - ing the texts they analysed through philology and sociology. Thus, based on comprehensive studies and personal experience, he resolved to present his own perceptions and vision to the public. The results are to be found in this invaluable book, bringing together for the first time in English three groundbreaking publications: Our Origin in the Light (Genesis 1-9) (1924); Zarathustra (1927) and From the World of the Mysteries (1927), as well as five related articles from contemporary periodicals. HERMANN BECKH (1 875-1937) studied Law and later Sanskrit, becoming Professor of Oriental Studies at the University of Berlin. A master of ancient and modern languages, he wrote extensively on religious and philosophical subjects, including Buddhism, Indology, Christianity, Alchemy and Music. In 191 1, he heard a lecture by Rudolf Steiner and was inspired to join the Anthroposophical Society, where he soon became a valued co-worker. In 1922, he helped found The Christian Community, a movement for religious renewal. His many books are gradually being translated from the original German and published in English. Trans. A & M.

It describes that movement's evolution and transformation in the etheric world during the twentieth century, from the world-changing apocalypse of the 1930s and 40s through to the beginning of its incarnation on Earth at the end of last century. The book also focuses on developments in the practical and social work of building the community of the School of Spiritual Science, which embodies the new Michaelic move - ment in our time. As Ben-Aharon indicates, the Michaelic movement is searching for creative, courageous and enthusiastic souls to foster a strong community that develops - from one decade to the next - as a living organism. Based on the continuous resurrection of anthroposophy, this community strives to create a fully conscious meeting and communication with the school of Michael and Christ in the etheric world, in a form that is appropriate and demanded by the times. The transcripts of these lectures bring together the author's experiences with anthroposophy over the last 42 years in the light of present communications from the spiritual world. It is based on contemporary spiritual investigation and individual, lived experience.

Following the fire that destroyed the first Goetheanum building in Dornach, Switzerland, Steiner had focused his efforts on rebuilding and reorganizing the Anthroposophical Society. But he also continued to travel and speak to the public - in Prague, Vienna and Basel - to explain the purpose of the Goetheanum and to elucidate the broader aims of his spiritual work. These lectures, including a semi-public series in Dornach, are gathered here and published in English for the first time, together with an Introduction, notes and index. The volume features the following lectures: 'The Purpose of the Goetheanum and the Aims of Anthroposophy'; 'Enhancing Human Powers of Perception to Develop Imagination, Inspiration and Intuition'; 'Human Soul Life and the Development of Imagination, Inspiration and Intuition'; 'Experience and Perception of the Activities of Thinking and Speech'; 'The Physical World and Moral-Spiritual 'Perceiving Eternity in the Light of Anthroposophy'; 'Human Development and Education in the Light of Anthroposophy'; 'Supersensible Perception, Anthroposophy as a Contemporary Need'; 'Anthro-posophy and the Ethical and Religious Life'; 'How Do We Gain Knowledge of the Supersensible World?'

That effected, he points to the enormity of its vision for the future evolution of ideas...' - Dr Andrew Welburn (from the Introduction) In the immediate aftermath of the 'Mystery-act' of the Christmas Foundation Conference, Rudolf Steiner chose to speak on the subject of 'Rosicru - cianism and Modern Initiation, Mystery Centres of the Middle Ages' . Clearly connected to the events that had just taken place in Dornach - in which he not only refounded the Anthroposophical Society but took a formal position within it - Steiner begins by exploring the intellectual life of the Middle Ages and the role that Mystery culture played within it. He throws new light on the foundations of Rosicrucianism, its principles of initiation and its inherent impulse for freedom. Steiner also discusses the secret teachings of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and the dawn of the age of the Archangel Michael. In the second series of lectures, entitled 'The Easter Festival and the History of the Mysteries' (April 1924), Steiner describes how festivals grew out of the Mysteries themselves. He speaks of Mysteries connected to Spring and Autumn, Adonis and Ephesus, and the significance of Sun and Moon. Throughout the volume he discusses the roles of Alexander the Great and Aristotle in world history and the significance of Aristotle's 'Categories' . Published for the first time as a single volume, the freshly revised text is complemented with an extensive introduction by Dr Andrew Welburn, detailed notes and appendices by Professor Frederick Amrine and an index.

He goes on to explore the contemporary need for spiritual knowledge and the authentic paths that can lead to it. Speaking in Torquay, England, at the International Summer School organized by his friend and colleague D.N. Dunlop, Steiner surveys the differences in various types of consciousness - from ancient to modern times, in waking and dreaming, from space into time - and the changes that have taken place in relation to knowledge and science in the course of history. He goes on to discuss the Mystery nature of crystallized minerals and metals such as copper and silver, and their relationship to the planets. He also describes how the ages of life can become organs of perception. In a dramatic conclusion Steiner explains the role of moon beings, ahrimanic elemental beings, and the true nature of mediumship, ectoplasm and spiritual possession. Presented here in a fresh translation that corrects many errors in previous editions, the text is complemented with notes, an introduction by Paul King and an index.
