Immunization averts an estimated 2 to 3 million deaths every year from diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), and measles; however, an additional 1.5 million deaths could be avoided if global vaccination coverage improves. An estimated 19.5 million infants worldwide are still missing out on basic vaccines. Uptake of new and underused vaccines is increasing. http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs 378/en/History of theImmunization Schedule -I History History of theImmunization Schedule -III Measles Cases and Outbreaks History of theImmunization Schedule -IV StillNeed: HIV, malaria , Ebola, hepatitis C virus, tuberculosis ...

Subunit Recombinant vaccinesI immunization Transfer of active humoral immunity (antibody -mediated immun ity) Antibodies are introduced into the person's body, the \"loaned\" antibodies help prevent or fight certain infectious diseases. The protection offered by passive immunization is short -lived, usually lasting only a few weeks or months. Itis quick acting, producing an immune response within hours or days, faster than a vaccine. Additionally, passive immunization can override a deficient immune system, which is especially helpful in someone who does not respond to immunization. In certain cases, passive and active immunity may be used together. T oday, patients may be treated with antibodies when they are ill with diphtheria or cytomegalovirus. Or, antibody treatment may be used as a preventive measure after exposure to a pathogen to try to stop illness from developing (such as with respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], measles, tetanus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rabies, or chickenpox).

The protein -based toxin is rendered harmless byheat inactivation used in vaccine production.) and used as the antigen in the vaccine to elicit immunity.A vaccine made from a toxin that has been made harmless but that elicits an immune response against the toxin. They are based on the toxin produced by certain bacteria (e.g. tetanus or diphtheria). Bacteria thatproduce toxins (ie. Clostridium tetani II/5 -Recombinant /DNA Much progress has been made towards the development of novel vaccines and vaccination approaches. Viral vectors have been studied as potential tools to deliver vaccines as they present advantages over traditional vaccines in that they stimulate a broad range of immune responses including cell mediated immunity. The gene segment for a protein from the disease -causing organism that is known to stimulate a protective immune response (protein of interest) is inserted into the gene of another cell, such as a yeast cell. When the cell replicates it has the same shape as the protein of interest.

Advantages : easeof self administration and induction of mucosal as well as systemic immunityVaccine Ingredients Each ingredient in a vaccine serves a specific purpose : Help provide immunity (protection) against a specific disease Helpyour immune system respond more strongly to a vaccine Help keep the vaccine safe and long lasting Be used during the production of the vaccineVaccine Ingredients 1.Antigens are very small amounts of weak or dead germs that can cause diseases. (whole pathogen , proteins , peptides , cellwallcomponents , DNA, etc.) 2.Adjuvants , which are substances that help your immune system respond more strongly to a vaccine (ie. Alum n and Freund adjuvant ) 3. Ingredients keep vaccines safe and long lasting : Preservatives , like thimerosal, protect the vaccine from outside bacteria or fungus. Stabilizers , like sugar or gelatin, help the active ingredients in vaccines continue to work while the vaccine is made, stored, and moved. 4. Formulation depends mainly ontheroute of administration (emulsion , liposomes , virus -likeparticles When exposure to foreign matter occurs, cellular effectors of the innate immune response, such as macrophages, monocytes, neu trophils and dendritic cells, are able to recognize specific surface patterns that classify the agent as a threat or as benignImmune Response to an Infectious Agent (or to Active Immunization )Functions of Different Antigen Presenting Cells Pathways of Antigen Processing Peptides Bind toMHC I and II Molecules The Evolution of Vaccine Antigens Hum Vaccin Immunother . 2014 Mar 1; pathogenProtein -based : alum -based a synthetic factor analogue forsubunit Mycobacterium tuberculosis vaccination requires FcRgamma -Syk-Card9 - dependent innate .

T he responses are primarily mediated by two main types of lymphocytes, T and B cellsImmune Response to Vaccination with and without Adjuvant Lack of PAMP ( pathogen -associated molecular patterns ) -> initial innate immune response is not activated Adjuvants can act like PAMPs, triggering the innate immune response through a variety of mechanisms, to identify the vaccine components as a \"threat\", with activation and maturation of APCs and initiation of downstream adaptive immune activitiesVaccine Formulation & Delivery Influences vaccine retention and distribution in the body Protein/ peptide -based micellesLiposomal Antigen Delivery Polymers Used A, Sucheck SJ.
