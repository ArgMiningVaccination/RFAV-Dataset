Some are stocking up with help from family and friends while others struggle to buy just one can. Problems with the formula supply began when an Abbott Nutrition facility abruptly closed after Similac, Alimentum, and EleCare formulas were suspected of bacterial contamina-tion. This led to a shortage of almost all infant formulas across the United States. The Reliance on Formula Breastfeeding is not something we can take for granted. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only about a quar-ter of U.S. infants born in 2017 were exclusively breastfed during their first six months. There are many reasons why a mother won't or can't nurse. Maternal illness, absence or an infant's own intolerance are some examples. And if a mother has to stop nursing tem-porarily , it can be difficult to resume breastfeeding exclusively . Infants and children with artificial feeding tubes, metabolic disorders or protein aller- gies may not thrive on breast milk and require specialized formulas, which are limited. Alternative approaches, including those suggested on the internet, can be harmful to infants. For instance, adding extra water to the formula is dangerous. During the first 1,000 days of life, nutrition is vital for a child's health and development.

Feeding Baby When Formula Is Hard to Come BySeverity of Jury Verdicts Should Concern Florida PhysiciansBY LOIS THOMSON Memorial Healthcare System has been providing world-class care to patients for decades, and now future patients seeking care can look forward to a consolidation of those services when the new Memorial Cancer Institute is completed. According to Mark Greenspan, the purpose of this facility , which is currently under con-struction, is to coordinate all of the cancer care under one roof. As he explained, \"Care was being provided in multiple facilities, so the purpose of the project is to create a consolidation of care, bringing togeth-er our experts in cancer care, and cre-ating a healing environment for the patients. It will help to ease their bur-den during their journey with the dis-ease and create a patient and family center healing environment where we can provide world-class cancer care. It's also where our physicians and clinicians can collaborate, and where the patients have the amenities to make their journey easier.\" Greenspan, director of construction and design services at Memorial Healthcare Julie Danna New Cancer Center to Augment World-Class CareHealthcare Construction/Real Estate Dr. Aniruddh Setya BY VANESSA ORR In March of this year, an Iowa City fam- ily was awarded $97.5 million in a med- ical malpractice case, the largest award of this kind in state history . This verdict, along with a new Florida House bill on the horizon, should send up red flags to Florida physicians, according to Julie Danna, senior vice president, National Health Care Practice, Danna-Gracey , a Division of Risk Strategies. \"Verdicts that used to be $1 million are now $10 million or higher,\" she explained. \"What this means for doctors is that their premiums are going up because most carriers are running at a loss. For every dollar in, they are not bringing in enough to cover every dollar out.\" Because the state of Florida did away with tort reform in 2017, it means that doctors are particularly at risk as caps on non-economic damages in medical mal-practice actions litigated in Florida courts have been eliminated. \"Since 2017, we have completely lost tort reform in Florida, which a lot of doc-tors are not even aware of,\" said Danna. \"When we had tort reform, everything was stabilized, and premiums were dras-tically lower. However, since 2017, when it was decided that it was unconstitution-al to put a cap on pain and suffering cases, these rates have been going up (l-r) Mark Greenspan, director of construction and design services, and Dr. Brian Hunis, medical director of oncology and hematology, Memorial Healthcare System Broward Health Expects the Unexpected 24/7 Emergency and Trauma Expertise B Y BARBARA R.

At the time, both Carol and I naively thought surely now something would be done to control guns in the United States. Although we recently lost Carol's dad Ralph, we consider ourselves a lucky family. We have wonderful grand-children, grandnephews and grandnieces - all of whom go to school each day. It is time to find a path forward, no matter how small. The majority of Americans favor universal background checks. We will accept any small step to save our kids, everyone's kids, from the terror of active shooter drills and children being murdered in their classrooms. Our Inaction Has Been Deafening Gun violence is a notoriously American problem - this cannot be disputed (so please don't try .) And once again, it's happened right here in our South Florida community , forever affecting our relatives, friends and co-workers. And each time an American massacre occurs, half-hearted declarations are debated about new bipartisan bills, laws and regulations ... ad nauseam. But then the gunshots fade, the visible wounds heal, the funerals end ... and we all forget. But I believe this time, thanks to a brilliant, articulate, still-traumatized group of Marjory Stoneman Douglas students, we are all being held account-able. Much like my 60s generation who affected the Vietnam era culture shift, these children are tired of being sacrifices to impotent politicians and 2nd amendment scare tactics. Does it make sense to say a person is too young to buy a handgun, but an AR15 is acceptable? Not one student has even whis-pered that all guns should be banned, but rather it's time for sensible gun con-trol and effective mental health screening with regard to guns in the State of Florida and the United States. As the students of MSD and #neveragain, asked so eloquently , \"How could it hurt ... to ban assault weapons? ... to reinstitute regulations that make it more difficult for the mentally ill to obtain guns? ... to save more children and adults like the 17 we lost in Parkland, Florida?\" Look in the mirror and ask yourself, how could it hurt?

Fernandez, Jr., comes from a family of physicians - he's the grandson of a physician, and the son and the nephew of one. In addition, his brother, spouse, and one son are all physicians. (He also pointed out he is equally proud of his other son, who is an attorney in Miami.) But while some offspring might feel pressured into following in the fam-ily footsteps, that wasn't the case with Dr. Fernandez. As he commented, \"I think it was in the genes, but I'm most fortunate, my family didn't force me into medicine, it was my own choice.\" No, Dr. Fernandez wasn't forced but rather has shown a love for the profes-sion, as evidenced by the fact that he took over as president of the Dade County Medical Association in June. He said that process began a few years prior when he was invited to be a representa-tive from the South District for the DCMA. \"I came on board during a time of transition,\" he said; and during that time a few highly qualified directors, along with several top physicians and leaders, \"really re-energized this organi-zation. That motivated me to continue.\" He appreciates the opportunities the association has provided, such as partic-ipating in the Physician Leadership Academy , which he said exposed him to an area not normally received in med-ical education and training. The contin-uing medical education (CME) pro-grams that allow physicians to maintain their licensure in Florida have also been expanded. Additionally , the organiza-tion's journal was reborn as a peer review journal, Miami Medicine, allow-ing both students and residents, as well as physicians, to publish their research to educate the patients, community in general, and physicians. Finally , Dr. Fernandez said he would be remiss not to recognize the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic the past two years, which has been stressful to every-one associated with healthcare. The DCMA sought to get Personal Protective Equipment for family mem-bers of physicians who were on the front lines, taking care of the sick but then going home and possibly exposing their own family . \"They were able to get a grant to manage some things like that for family members. The physical and mental health of physicians has also been taxed as a result of the pandemic, something DCMA is assisting physi-cians with through the development of a Wellness Program. Those kinds of accomplishments are what really moti-vated me to continue forward in this organization.\" For those reasons, Dr. Fernandez stat- ed some of the things he hopes to accomplish as president: \"I'd like to reach out to both members and physi-cians who are not members. To the physicians who are not members, I'd like to highly encourage them to join. For members, I want to make clear that I am not the DCMA; I have just been provided the privilege and the responsi-bility to sit in this position for one year. But the real DCMA are the members; and as members, our goal is to help physicians in Dade County address challenges that we face, to help educate the public and the legislature - regard-less of party - and guide medicine in the county so that we can provide the best quality care for our patients and advo-cate for them in their times of need. \"I will do my best to get the message out there, to both the public and physi-cians, and encourage them to be active members in this organization.\" With all of the benefits of being a member, why wouldn't the medical community want to join? Dr. Fernandez said sometimes people may not be aware of the organization. \"Unfor - tunately , medicine is complex, there are a lot of moving parts, and it creates a lot of challenges. Commitment to the deliv-ery of healthcare eats up a lot of our time, more so now than it did 50 years ago.\" He said one way to attract people who have been on the fence is to contin-ue offering enhancements such as the Miami Medicine journal, providing CMEs so they can see the value of mem-bership, and showing them the oppor-tunities that are available, because Dade County is such a diverse community . While Dr. Fernandez realizes the ben- efit of being part of such an organiza-tion, he emphasizes the support he has received along the way . \"I want to make sure I point out that where I am today probably has more to do with the love and support I've had from my family , friends, and colleagues in South Florida. I also need to recognize my dedicated staff, who help me run a solo practice here in Coral Gables.\" The DCMA can provide similar sup- port as well.

Colleges and universities are now recognizing the need for innovation to reduce the nursing shortage and attract qualified nurses as teachers and faculty . Miami Dade College is one statewide college that is taking a proac-tive approach to this problem. \"Right now , it is rather difficult to recruit and hire qualified, experienced faculty ,\" says Dr. Tommie Norris, Dean of the Benjamin Leon School of Nursing at Miami Dade College. \"There's so much competition with travel nursing as well as the gap of pay between private prac-tice and academia that we're finding it really difficult to hire faculty who have teaching experience.\" She says burnout from COVID is also an issue with people who want to enter academia. Most of these individuals who have a Master's degree or a Doctorate degree are working in hospitals already where they are clinical experts and mov-ing to teaching as a novice educator may cause concern. To counter this, she says that Miami Dade decided to cultivate its own nurs-ing faculty . \"One way we plan to do this is by hir- ing nursing experts in the clinical area who need the opportunity to grow into becoming a nurse educator,\" explains Dr. Norris. \"We're going to provide mentor-ship and extra training for those faculty to make sure they understand the role of a nurse educator, how to be effective in the classroom, and how to communicate with students. We know that's something that is going to take extra resources from our side, but I feel like it'll be well worth it when we have those individuals who have that experience behind them.\" Dr. Norris expects that it should take a year for these clinical experts to be trained as nursing educators. However, as they are learning, she says that they will teach side by side or work with another faculty member in a course to have that real live experience. \"The lecture component of teaching is the most challenging,\" she adds. \"We'll provide classroom resources and online programs to help them become comfort-able.\" If nothing is done to alleviate the nurs- ing faculty shortage, it will impact nurs-ing students, and ultimately , patient out-comes. \"The fewer faculty you have, the fewer students you can take to the clinical set-ting,\" says Dr. Norris. Miami Dade is also looking to recruit retired nurses to serve as adjunct faculty . \"We're reaching out to retired clinical practitioners and nurses who have a wealth of information to share with the students and we are having some success with that,\" says Dr. Norris. \"We'll need to really get a robust pipeline of those adjuncts to come back each semester to help. There are many who still want to remain at the bedside in the hospitals, but also really want to share their knowl-edge and expertise with students.\" The other thing that's unique with Miami Dade is that it has strong practice partners\u2014hospitals and community agencies that are partnering with MDC to give the students a broad and hands-on clinical experience. \"What we're finding is some of our practice partners are allowing their nurs-es to have clinical groups because it allows our nursing students to have an immersion in that hospital,\" says Dr. Norris. Nursing education is a great career, Dr. Norris notes. \"It's never too late to go into a career in nursing education,\" she says. \"What we have to do is make sure that nurses know the benefits of becoming a nurse educa-tor, whether it's a full-time position or a part-time position. There are so many joys and rewards.\" For more information, visit https://www.mdc.edu/nursing/.

Each year, the program gifts grants to nonprofits that help support food, shelter, trans-portation, clothing, and financial assis-tance to improve quality health in Palm Beach County . In 2021, QIC gave $1 mil-lion in unrestricted funding to local organizations that were harshly hit by COVID-19 setbacks, and to date has awarded a total of $8.5 million through this targeted initiative. Quantum Foundation's mission is to inspire and fund initiatives that improve the health of Palm Beach County resi-dents. Quantum Foundation is a health foundation that was formed from $135 million in proceeds from the sale of JFK Medical Center. Now in its third decade of community investment, the foundation has assets of approximately $175 million. Since its inception, Quantum Foundation has awarded $160 million to hundreds of Palm Beach County nonprofit grantees. Every dollar the foundation grants stays in the county to benefit local communities. \"It's a privilege to reinforce the good work that tends to underserved residents of Palm Beach County ,\" said Eric Kelly , president of Quantum Foundation \"We are arriving at another unique time where organizations and individuals are feeling the weight of rising rent, food, and gas costs as well as overall inflation. It is our goal to help these grassroots organizations meet ongoing and increasing basic needs in our communities in order to maintain and improve quality health.\" A committee of foundation staff and board members will carefully consider each application. Strict criteria are set up for those nonprofits applying. Organizations must be registered as a 501(c)(3), have been working in Palm Beach County for at least six months, and have an annual operating budget not exceeding $500,000. In addition, Quantum Foundation will be accepting nominations for the Marie Thorpe Above & Beyond Award, also in its third year, in memory of staff member Marie Thorpe, who served the foundation for 22 years. The recognition will be given to an individual and everyday hero who exemplifies incredible service and sacrifice to improve Palm Beach County . At the annual QIC breakfast celebration on November 10, a $2,500 award will be presented to an individual for their selfless services that go beyond the call of duty , and $2,500 will be presented to their nomi-nating organization, which can be a past or present QIC grantee. This year's QIC committee is co-chaired by board members Ethel Isaacs Williams and Dr. Gerald O'Connor. All applications must be submitted using the foundation's online system by July 29, 2022, and grantees will be announced in the third week of October.

Quantum in the Community Plans to Invest $1 Million in Grassroots Funding Photo Credit: Tracey Benson Photography Floridians take their health seriously and expect access to the lat-est digital solutions to make their healthcare experiences better. Did you know that 37% of patients who changed providers last year reported that a lack of or outdated digital tools was a leading factor in their decision? And that number increases to 61% for patients under the age of 30. Healthcare providers can no longer overlook the importance of regu-lar reviews of their digital health plat-form. Now , Florida healthcare institutions can access Thrive Health's leading plat-form for care management, health data interoperability out-come measures and evidence-based Care Journeys that prioritizes the patient experience with the latest in smart tech-nology . Thrive Health was founded in 2016 by a diverse group of patients, clinicians, researchers, parents, and students who came together to help patients going through com-plex health journeys, work-ing to put people at the center of their care. Thrive Health is on a mis- sion to make healthcare work better for everyone. \"Thrive is all about empowering patients in a way that makes life better for cli- nicians and health system operators. Having already helped over 10 million people through their healthcare jour- neys, we're excited to be growing across the continent.\" - David Helliwell, Co-Founder of Thrive Health With Thrive, clinicians provide their patients with a tailored digital experi-ence. Utilizing assessments, integrations with existing data, real-time intelligence for decision-making, and customizable support resources, Thrive aids the patient in understanding each stage of their Care Journey . \"We believe that technology as a tool can have an incredible impact on peo-ple's health outcomes and that it is still far too difficult to bring the most basic of digital health solutions into the hands of patients. We aim to make it easier and play a humble role in enabling the amaz-ing healthcare professionals we interact with every day to provide even more meaningful care to their patients.\" - Alec McCauley , CEO St. Paul's Hospital and the Providence Health System in British Columbia uti-lize Thrive Health in multiple environ-ments, including pre-admissions, gener-al surgery , colorectal screening, complex pain, and perioperative quality improve-ment. Thrive has also been integrated to deploy care management for new and emerging treatment methods, such as with NeonMind Biosciences for their innovative intravenous ketamine (IV-Ket) treatments for mood, anxiety , and mental wellness. Thrive's technology has also been used throughout the COVID-19 pandemic for citizen communica-tions, resource sharing, and self-assess-ments by numerous governments and academic institutions. Thrive Health has partnered with emTRUTH, a California-based company that develops patented software using blockchain technology to power seam-less data interoperability and increased data security for Thrive Health's front-end, patient-facing platform. emTRUTH's API advances blockchain technology to address the challenge of how healthcare data is collected in siloes. They simplify the process of integrating and sharing data for care coordination and getting that data into the hands of the patient to own, understand, and manage - building a more robust view of individual health over time. \"The Thrive team focuses on deliver- ing improved patient outcomes while reducing operational inefficiencies and re-admissions. Our platform embraces the rapidly increasing demand for hybrid-care and is also helping health-care institutions across America make direct progress towards the Healthy People 2030 targets\" - Michael Rhiness, Director of Sales.

Starting with the 2022 reporting period, 1 out of every 2 clinicians will be penalized up to 9% based on performance in the MIPS pro-gram. With what's at stake and given the program is even more complex, you need a comprehensive solution to maximize MIPS points. This year you must earn at least 75 out of the possible 100 MIPS points to avoid penalty so it's imperative to have a strategic plan to under-stand the impact the reporting methodology has and to choose the best methodol-ogy and reporting partner. A superior reporting methodology , known as Certified EHR Technology (CEHRT), has emerged and should be strongly considered for use by all practices participating in the MIPS program. Reporting through CEHRT dramatically improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the reporting process especially when done using ONC certified software. A CEHRT utilizes eCQMs (electronic Clinical Quality Measures), which are better at optimizing the MIPS points to be earned. Unless you select a reporting partner that will help you earn the most points by leveraging technology to facilitate the ease, accuracy , and completeness of tracking and reporting to maximize your score, you risk leaving points on the table and sig-nificantly sub-optimizing your MIPS score. Reporting via a CEHRT, like Health eFilings, is the best approach because it optimizes the points that could be earned and therefore, maximizes Medicare reimbursements. Health eFilings, a CEHRT, is the best choice for a reporting partner. Our cloud- based ONC certified software automates the process and does all the work without IT resources, administrative support or workflow changes. Health eFilings service is an end-to-end electronic solution that will save significant time, be a turnkey submission process and maximize the financial upside for providers.

Let's Connect: ACHE of South Florida Spotlight ACHE of South Florida Member Spotlight: Rudy Molinet BY VANESSA ORR As a registered nurse, Rudy Molinet was able to follow his passion for helping peo-ple. And while he appreciated being able to play an important role in patients' lives, he realized that a career in healthcare lead-ership offered the opportunity to make a difference in an even bigger way . \"As a nurse, I was having a one-on-one impact on patients and families, but as a healthcare leader, I could make a differ-ence to an even larger group or an entire healthcare system,\" he said. Molinet returned to school to earn his master's in healthcare administration at Columbia University , and worked in healthcare operations, marketing and sales, and strategic planning before starting his own consulting company , Artemis Synergies. He now provides services in all aspects of management, including strategic planning, management development, corporate restructur-ing and reorganization, executive coaching and more. \"I'm a novelty seeker; it's never boring because there are always new things happening,\" he said of the myriad roles his position requires. Molinet also provides stand-alone coaching to healthcare executives at all stages of their careers. \"Clients may include late-careerist CEOs facing chal-lenges who value my level of experience or mid- and early careerists figuring out where they want to go and how to get to the level they want,\" he said. As the first openly gay board member at Holy Cross Health in Fort Lauderdale, FL, Molinet is also focused on the importance of diversity , equity , and inclusion (DEI), and provides education on the needs of the LGTBQ+ community . \"In this way , I am able to merge my two passions\u2014social justice and equality within the healthcare system,\" he said. An adjunct professor at Florida Atlantic University , he also teaches MBA and MHA students leadership, marketing and strategic planning, and has incorpo-rated ACHE (American College of Healthcare Executives) into his role at FAU. \"One of my proudest achievements, in addition to becoming an ACHE fel- low , is that I was able to convince FAU Executive Education to pay for the first year of each student's membership in ACHE,\" he said. \"There are so many benefits, from learning how to comport yourself, to having high ethical values, to knowing what an elevator speech is, to networking with other healthcare professionals. \"No one is going to come knock on your door and ask you if you want to be a CEO,\" he laughed. \"No matter how old you are, or your station in life, or what you think you know , every day should be a learning opportunity or expe-rience, and ACHE provides that.\" Molinet is such a firm believer in this tenet of lifelong learning that at the age of 62, after years in the healthcare industry , he decided to pursue his own ACHE Fellow credential. \"I feel so strongly about the importance of the FACHE credential that I decided to become board-certified,\" he said. \"I hadn't taken a six-hour board exam in many , many years, but I passed it on the first try . \"Not only has it helped my consulting practice, but it adds gravitas to my role as a healthcare executive,\" he added. \"When you have those initials after your name, it says it all in terms of this industry and our profession.\" Rudy Molinet Dr. Kathleen BerkowitzSouth Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com June 2022 9The Health Ambassador Program at Tampa General Hospital (TGH) pro- vides world-class medical care with white-glove service. When patients from across Florida need to be transferred to TGH, a TGH health ambassador will handle all the details for them, whether they need help making a general appointment, scheduling a test, or preparing for surgery and/or an inpatient stay . Simply give TGH a call, and they will take care of the rest. As an integral part of the TGH team, a designated health ambassador will: \u0081 Schedule patient appointments and testing \u0081 Arrange hotel and other travel needs if the patient and their family are coming to TGH from outside the Tampa Bay area \u0081 Help patients with any business needs they may have during their stay \u0081 Coordinate any follow-up care, imaging, or further tests a patient may need Tampa General Hospital is committed to becoming the safest and most innovative academic health system in the country . It is working to achieve that by offering the latest treatment options available, utilizing evidence-based practices, providing full transparency every step of the way , and extending per-sonalized, white-glove service to each patient. \"Patience, empathy and servitude are the basis of our program. We under- stand and respect each of our patients' unique medical and personal needs,\" said Lynn Stockford, RN, BSN, network development manager at TGH. \"Our goal is to reduce stress, so patients and their families can focus on what mat-ters most.\" When K.C. Austin, a resident on Florida's East Coast, was battling the Delta variant of COVID-19, he was rushed to a Palm Beach County hospital's intensive care unit. Austin was intubated, and he and his family were soon facing life-or-death decisions. \"They started talking about him needing a transfer for ECMO (extracorporeal mem- brane oxygenation through a heart-lung machine), more real,\" said Danielle Austin, K.C.'s wife. \"Luckily , the doctors had started the paperwork for the transfer pretty early on. When I got that phone call that he was being transferred to TGH, I just said, 'Oh my gosh, we have a chance.' The night he was airlifted, we sat on my in-laws' patio and waited to see that helicopter take off.\" \"The communication at TGH was unbelievable,\" Danielle said. \"The fact that I was able to speak to a physician or representative every day , even when I was in West Palm Beach, was unbelievable. I never felt like I didn't know what was going on.

Let's face it, when people go to the doctor, the test, visit or procedure they are having results in receiving either good news or bad news. Several years back, I received a phone call from a cus-tomer with a unique request. One of this per-son's responsibilities was to oversee the imaging department at the hospital. \"Can you get us Boca Terry robes for the patients who come in for their mammograms? We want to create a spa like experience.\" Well, I had to see this. Upon arriving, my contact showed me a renovated area that truly did look like an upscale Day Spa - complete with laminate hardwood floors, dim lighting, and posh furniture in the waiting area. He was right. The patient gowns we had been delivering for years, would no longer work in this environment. When I told him of course we would be able to help him, but that embroidered robes were going to cost him much more, he simply stared at me. After a few moments, he replied (and this is when I really got it) \"Jay , I don't care what it costs, I care about how women will feel when they come here for a mammogram.\" Getting any test, including an annual cancer screening, can be stressful. In the back of someone's mind, they are always thinking, I hope this goes 'ok'. Focusing on how patients feel during these times is extremely important and goes directly to the human experi-ence we are all trying to influence. Punchline of the story is interesting. About 9 months after we introduced the robes at this client, another cus-tomer, in another hospital called me to complain. \"Jay , we are losing patients to hospital X, it seems they are giving patient's Boca Terry robes!\" I kept the fact that it was my company providing the robes close to the vest. But it is clear, focusing on how you make patients feel, can have a dramatic impact on overall perception of your organization. Jay Juffre is Executive Vice President, ImageFIRST .

Box 19268 Plantation FL 33318 I think the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has opened many eyes to what has been predicted for more than 30 years. That is, our current processes, work environment, educational system, you name it, will not close the gap between the future demand for healthcare practitioners and the supply . Moreover, while tech-nology might be a wonderful assistant, it can't empathetically hold a patient's hand! Where have we gone wrong? In the 1980's while I worked for the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services (now the Florida Department of Health and others), I worked in the Office of Comprehensive Health Planning and one of our responsibilities was to evaluate and make recommendations about Florida's supply of healthcare practitioners. Yes, now almost 40 years ago, we knew back then that we were going to need more doctors and nurses. Our grow-ing population, our aging population all spelled out for us that we weren't doing enough to keep up. The pandemic brought those issues into clear focus. We managed through the first round of COVID and by the time we got to the Delta strain, there was no more hiding what was so obvious ... the tenuous staffing situation had gone crit-ical. \"According to an article in the Nursing Times, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that more than 275,000 additional nurses are needed from 2020 to 2030. Employment opportunities for nurses are projected to grow at a faster rate (9%) than all other occupations from 2016 through 2026.\" In looking at the source documents on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics website, over the next decade it is projected that there will be 194,500 job openings per year for registered nurses. I dare say that the pandemic has probably affected that number as greater numbers of expe- rienced registered nurses have chosen to retire or to make a career change moving from direct patient care to administration. So, what is the plan for meeting the need for additional healthcare professionals? While the statistics for nursing are more readily available, all health professions were impacted by the pandemic. It isn't only more registered nurses we are seeking, but all healthcare practitioners. Some things are being done to attempt to correct the situation. Florida has recently appropriated $125 million to help with nursing education. While this one time investment will help, everyone needs to be thinking about longer-term solutions. The challenges associated with healthcare staffing aren't going to be solved in one day , one month, one year, or with one legislative appropriation but, rather, it is going to take long-term effort to make a difference. Over the next few years, the SFHHA will be working with our community part- ners to explore the challenges and to construct sustainable solutions that will allow us to narrow the future gap between the supply and demand of healthcare practitioners. Jaime CaldwellA message from our President Technology Can't Care for Patients Alone formulas mimic human milk, so every nutrient, vitamin, min- eral, protein, and carbohydrate is measured for optimal growth and brain development. Diluted formulas can lead to malnutri-tion, electrolyte abnormalities, and other serious complica-tions. Cans of formula that are past their \"best before\" date should not be used either. The product could be at risk for contamina-tion and protein disintegration, which can cause complica-tions. Homemade Formulas and Other Commercial Products The FDA, CDC, and the Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) rec- ommend against homemade formulas since they may lack essential nutrients for proper infant growth. For example, some recipes call for unpasteurized cow or goat's milk, which are not fit for consumption. And homemade formulas may not be prepared or stored in a sterile manner, resulting in a high risk of bacterial contamination. Unfortunately , toddler formulas are not an appropriate alter- native because, unlike products made for infants, they vary quite a bit in nutritional composition and may not meet an infant's needs. Almond milk, oat milk, and similar products are beverages and not milk. Most do not have an adequate amount of nutri-ents, vitamins, carbohydrates, and fats, and some could cause other problems. For example, 10 to 20% of children allergic to cow milk are also allergic to soy milk. Almond milk should not be given because of nut allergies. Oat milk contains phytic acid, which prevents the body from absorbing iron, zinc, and calcium. Although popular in some cultures, goat milk is deficient in vitamin B12 and folate and is very high in protein, which puts extra pressure on the baby's kidneys to eliminate. This should be avoided under 12 months of age. Purchasing formula from overseas is a gray area. Formulas from overseas are not regulated by U.S. standards and may not be completely hypoallergenic. Furthermore, most use metric measurements, making them trickier to prepare. I will consider an overseas formula for my patients but may need to verify the ingredients and modify the recipe for an individual infant. Shortage May End Soon - Things Are Looking Up I see a light at the end of the tunnel since President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act, which requires suppliers to direct resources to formula manufacturers before other cus-tomers. A second government program, \"Operation Fly Formula,\" is using aircraft to import formulas that meet U.S. standards. Abbott's Sturgis plant is set to reopen, although it will take time for the new products to hit the shelves. For now , Abbott is importing formula from its FDA-registered facility in Ireland. In the meantime, it's important for parents and caregivers to communicate openly with their doctor, who can guide them to the best option for their baby . The North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology , Hepatology & Nutrition issued a chart listing several formulas that are comparable to the recalled brands. While the list doesn't include every formula on the market, it serves as a good starting point to research alter-natives. Parents may also be able to find formula locally by: \u0081 Contacting their nearest Community Action Agency . \u0081 Calling 2-1-1 for municipal referrals to non-profits that are providing supplies. \u0081 Reaching out to Mother's Milk Bank of Florida which has depots throughout the state (milkbankofflorida.org). Finally , while online research is helpful, it's essential to first speak with the baby's doctor before making any decisions about your child's nutritional needs.

An added concern for physicians is House Bill 6011, which will allow par-ents of adult children to recover damages for mental pain and suffering in a med-ical negligence suit. The bill will take effect on July 1, 2022. \"Before when a child died due to loss, the immediate family was allowed to seek payment for mental pain and suffer-ing,\" explained Danna. \"This new law allows parents of adult children who have no spouse or children to seek pay-ment of those non-economic damages as well. \"This is going to cause even more opportunity for lawsuits; attorneys going after this money are going to cause chaos in Florida,\" she added. Court cases are also being influenced by changing jury demographics, which now include younger millennials. \"Back in the day we had a jury of our peers, but now these younger millenni-als, who are very compassionate, tend to be more willing to award plaintiffs money ,\" said Danna. \"At meetings with carriers, we now discuss ways to prepare ourselves to work with the millennial mentality versus a jury of our peers. You have to consider how that age group thinks when sitting on a jury panel, and how to go to court with the younger gen-eration making decisions.\" While many Florida doctors have cho- sen to carry low policy limits of $250,000/$750,000, believing that attor-neys wouldn't pursue them if there wasn't as much of a reward, with out-of-court claims settling at an average of $400,000, this still leaves them at risk. \"A lot of doctors share their $250,000 limits with their corporations and allied professionals, which leaves them even more vulnerable,\" said Danna. \"I strong-ly suggest that they consider a separate policy for the corporation and put the allies under that. Doctors need a pure policy for themselves, where they are not sharing their limits.\" Danna advises physicians to carry a $500,000 per claim/$1.5 million aggre-gate per year limit to meet the national threshold. \"We are seeing a lot of surgical groups going for $1million/$3 million,\" she added.

Cover Story: Severity of Jury Verdicts Should Concern Florida Physicians Continued from page 1Long COVID-19 syndrome, in which symptoms last a year or longer beyond infection, impacts about 30 percent of survivors of the coronavirus. It is a mul-tifaceted systemic condition character-ized by fatigue, \"cognitive fog,\" and often heart, lung and neurological complica-tions. Lina Shehadeh, Ph.D., professor of medicine in the Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute and Division of Cardiology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, received a $1 million grant from the American Heart Association to study long COVID. Recognizing the sub-stantial public health impact and burden of this syndrome, the American Heart Association awarded three-year grants to 10 research programs in the nation with proposals for unraveling long COVID's etiology and molecular mechanisms. \"When you have an impact that is sys- temic \u2014 not confined to certain organs \u2014 you think about the circulatory sys-tem, since its function affects everything else,\" Dr. Shehadeh said. \"We have observed signs that the endothelial func-tion of the blood vessels is abnormal in preclinical models of long COVID. Now , we are working to connect the dots and explain this cascade.\" As part of her research, Dr. Shehadeh is using a mouse model and human blood samples to interrogate a chain of events that may account for symptoms seen in people with long COVID. This chain begins with virus-induced lung inflamma-tion and defective cholesterol homeosta- sis, and ultimately leads to endothelial dysfunction. The team is investigating evidence that there is an overzealous inflammatory response from the mating of protein spikes on the SARS-CoV-2 virus with low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLr) on the infected cells. Central to this response is the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are net-like structures composed of DNA-histone complexes and proteins. These form as the immune system activates an overabundance of neutrophils in the lungs. While they form as an overreaction to real pathogens like the SARS-CoV-2 virus, they are also complicit in a num-ber of autoimmune diseases, coagulation disorders and thrombus, diabetes, ather-osclerosis, vasculitis, sepsis and cancer. \"In COVID-19, when these neu- trophils are overwhelmed or defeated by the virus, they burst in the lungs, releas-ing their DNA material [netosis],\" Dr. Shehadeh explained. \"From there we think the NETs are carried through the systemic circulation and become stuck and then embedded in the vessel walls in the limbs and in the organs. This would explain the loss of normal homeostasis in the vascular walls and the tendency toward thrombus we see so often in COVID long-haulers.\" Dr. Shehadeh is working with Jeffrey Goldberger, M.D., M.B.A., professor of medicine and chief of the Cardiovascular Division, and Leonardo J. Tamariz, M.D., an internist in the COVID-19 Long-haulers Clinic at the Miami Veterans Affairs Healthcare System. Dr. Tamariz is obtaining blood samples and heart and lung MRI images of 150 or so patients from the clinic to sample the neutrophils and check for markers of netosis, while Dr. Goldberger is examining the MRIs and other cardiac readouts to assess visi-ble vessel anomalies. \"This ties in with work we have done for years in studying battle fatigue in vet-erans, which can persist long after they return from the field,\" Dr. Tamariz said. Other key team members are Shathiyah Kulandavelu, Ph.D., a junior faculty member at the Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute whose expertise is in endothelial function, and Jose Manuel Condor Capcha, Ph.D, a postdoctoral associate who is spearheading the lab work.

BROWARD HEALTH IMPERIAL POINT Dane Clarke, MD Dane Clarke, M.D., has wanted to be a doctor since he was a child. \"My mom told me that when I was 4 years old, I said that I wanted to be a doctor in order for me to take care of her when she got older,\" he said. Dr. Clarke is the medical director of emergency medi- cine at Broward Health Imperial Point. He has over 30 years of healthcare experience, not counting the time he spent in the medical field shadowing his mother who was a nurse. One of the turning points for Dr. Clarke came during the time he served as a teacher's aide at the United Cerebral Palsy Association. It was through his work with the children that he realized medicine was his calling. Dr. Clarke received his medical degree from Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia. He is board certified by the American Board of Emergency Medicine and a Fellow of the American College of Emergency Physicians. Gregory Dubrovich, DO Gregory Dubrovich, D.O., is the assistant medical direc- tor of emergency medicine at Broward Health Imperial Point. He was among the first caregivers at the hospital to get the Moderna vaccine when it was first made available in late 2020. \"I've been on the front lines battling this since the onset,\" said Dr. Dubrovich during an interview with TV station WSVN. Dr. Dubrovich was inspired to become a doctor by his parents who immigrated to the United States to give him and his sister a better life. \"Living in the same city that I work in provides great motivation to help the people of the community that I am so deeply rooted in,\" he said. Dr. Dubrovich received his medical degree from Michigan State University of Osteopathic Medicine in East Lansing, Michigan, and is certified by the American Osteopathic Board of Emergency Medicine. BROWARD HEALTH NORTH Cesar Carralero, DO Cesar Carralero, D.O., serves as chief of emergency med- icine at Broward Health North.

When Dr. Nieves was a child, her mother was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome and that greatly influenced her interest in medicine. While going to the hospital for her mother's frequent appointments, Dr. Nieves became fascinated by the collaborative environment of physicians from different specialties. \"Using science and medical knowledge to heal and improve a patient's quality of life is a daily rewarding experience,\" she said. Dr. Nieves earned her medical degree from Ponce School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Ponce, Puerto Rico, and is a certified by the American Board of Emergency Medicine. South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com June 2022 13Response to Unique Locale and Demographics For example, because of its unique loca- tion Broward Health North, near Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale and Fort Lauderdale - Inter na tional Airport, is the receiving facility for trauma or other terti-ary care needs for major illness from the islands where advanced lifesaving technol-ogy is not available. \"International Medicine requires tech- nology that provides clear communica-tions and readiness to handle severe injuries and illness even while the patient may still be airborne,\" Dr. Boyar explained. \"Also, our location which is close to highways and waterways, fre-quently provides scenarios for severe trauma from auto and air accidents and boating incidents,\" he said. Leisure living in the Fort Lauderdale area undeniably includes the dangers of children and pools and near drowning or heat-related construction worker emer-gencies along with typical on-the-job falls, cuts and mishaps. Additionally due to the demographics which include significant senior, tourist, and immigrant populations, there can be age and cultural barriers that need to be addressed even when dealing with life-threatening illness and injury such as heart attacks, strokes, broken bones, and blunt trauma. Dr. Boyar explained, \"Older, frail patients who often suffer from several ail-ments and take a pharmacy of medica-tions can present complex health hurdles and that may complicate a course of care when seconds count.\" Also, language and cultural barriers can present serious consequences to a seemingly straight-forward care plan. Broward Health has considered the con-sequences of miscommunications and has a solution. \"Since we live and work in a melting pot of Haitian Creole, Eastern European and French-Canadian influences we use a robust audio/visual program at our fin-gertips to translate degrees of symptom severity , share stat consults on iPads and accelerate pre-hospital knowledge in order to understand patients and trans-late to them and their families and the first responder pre-hospital caretakers regarding the appropriate treatment,\" according to Dr. Boyar. Health Watch for Caregivers Naturally , all the above\u2014and more\u2014 require a clinical readiness above the gold standard. However, maintaining that level of expertise and care delivery 24/7 can take a toll on the front-line heroes who can suf-fer from a type of combat fatigue. To avoid this, Dr. Boyar describes comprehensive safety protocols to protect staff while on-shift and intense behavioral checklists to gauge their wellbeing in the aftermath of tragedies like mass shooting incidents, domestic, child and sexual abuse cases, and other societal ills that often present in the Emergency Department as causal diag-noses. \"Opportunities for recuperative time off, staggered shifts, counseling, therapy , pro-fessional intervention and coaching is practiced which encourages nurses, doc-tors, residents and all ancillary caregivers including our first responders in the field to follow wellness guidelines,\" Dr. Boyar said. \"We coach our staff regarding mental health tips to check their own well-being for tell-tale signs of fatigue or clues of burnout and offer other opportunities to continue emergency careers without endangering their own mental or physical health,\" he explained. According to Dr. Boyar, the field of emer- gency medicine is popular because it offers work schedules amenable to providers, minus the need to get entangled in the business side of a medical practice. However, when burnout threatens there are still vital hands-on administrative input roles for emergency medical plan-ning such as preparation for weather relat-ed catastrophes, active shooter incidents and unexpected work calamities. An annu-al hazard vulnerability check is mandatory and regular drills followed by analysis and a sharing of best practices help formulate process improvements and improved readiness. Broward Health has frequently participated in collegial conferences with other hospitals regarding lessons learned in the aftermath of tragic incidents. A Look Forward Looking toward the future, Dr. Boyar predicts an accelerated trend to marry all the stages of emergency and trauma care delivery . \"Using diagnostic and monitoring technology during pre-hospital care to ED and intensive care through post hospital at-home care will enable us to elevate trau-ma and emergency care to a higher lifesav-ing level and improve patient outcomes. We will be able to diagnose earlier, treat immediately - often in the field - and mon-itor follow-up care with remote communi-cations, advanced imaging, bio markers and telehealth options. We already con-verse with stakeholders to enable special-ists on-call to evaluate rapidly , advance treatments and stimulate speed to care that saves lives,\" he concluded.

With the ongoing pandemic, a sig-nificant layer of stress has been added to the public, in addition to the general polar-ization we are witnessing across the country . The results of stress, anxiety , and other mood disorders play themselves out over the daily news with pointless attacks and crimes that are incom-prehensible under most cir-cumstances. The need for more mental health providers and newer facilities has never been more important. The increased need for this type of healthcare now con-sists of long wait periods for those in critical need. Waits of up to three months for psy-chologists and longer for psychiatrists are now the norm, not the exception. Existing mental health facilities have quickly become overcrowded and obsolete. Modern facilities need to address this as well as the new philosophies and med-ications in treating men-tal illness, such as psy-chedelic therapy that are clinician-prescribed guided experiences. Special consideration must also focus on behavioral health clinic acoustics, since emotional conversation can be loud, tearful, and sometimes hostile as part of therapy . The design of behavioral health facili-ties must also consider caregivers. Safety features must be incorporated into the design and appropriate barriers put in place to protect caregivers and other staff in the event of a potentially violent situ-ation. Caregivers need to feel safe within their center, knowing they will not be trapped. Additionally , the design of a behav- ioral health center needs to have the appropriate spaces, as much natural light as possible, and outdoor spaces for caregivers to decompress and prepare for their next client. As with any other modality of health- care, changes and advancement require the appropriately designed facilities to best service our community , requiring updated facilities than those designed in the past. Mental health telemedicine is also one component of improved treat-ment. Better outpatient facilities need to be provided that offer a variety of treat-ment opportunities under a single roof. Be it individual sessions, group therapy activity rooms, medical or drug thera-pies, the design of new facilities will enhance treatment through a warm and soothing environment. As an architect, I have always believed that good design can assist with positive clinical outcomes. Our mental health outpatient facilities should be warm and inviting spaces, conveying a sense of respect to facility clients. The interiors of these facilities should allow the safety and comfortable flow of people without bottlenecks. As much natural light as possible should also be incorporated into the space, as the benefits of any bio-philic architecture have been well docu-mented.

More important-ly , it will become a community gathering place that will nurture the potential of our youth by providing positive environment and opportunities and create a place that provides complete health and wellness programs for kids, families, adults and seniors; afterschool programs, communi-ty events and meeting space; preschool; workforce education through Broward College; as well as making retail space available to encourage economic growth and create jobs. One of those retail spaces will be a home to Holy Cross Health which will have a community health center to serve the surrounding community . This is all about creating an environment where the entire community can gather, get healthy and connect with one another. The impact will be transformational. We also are bringing awareness to the importance of improving health out-comes for racial and ethnic communities. Through programs and services at the new YMCA and at Holy Cross Health, we can also shine a light on how we can work together to reduce health dispari-ties, which according to the Centers for Disease Control Prevention, are prevent-able differences in opportunities to achieve optimal health for people who are disadvantaged by their social or eco-nomic status, geographic location or environment. The importance of encouraging healthy living cannot be understated. The new L.A. Lee YMCA/Mizell Community Center at Sistrunk will host more than 55,000 people annually , with the goal of providing social, education and health services to low-income families. In our community , the Y is a leading voice on health and well-being. With a mission centered on balance, the Y brings families closer together, encour-ages good health and fosters connections through fitness, sports, fun and shared interests. As a result, more youth, adults and families are receiving the support, guidance and resources needed to achieve greater health and well-being for their spirit, mind and body . The local Y here has been listening and responding to our community's most criti-cal social needs for 100 years. Whether developing skills or emotional well-being through education and training, welcom-ing and connecting diverse de mographic populations through community service, or preventing chronic disease and build-ing healthier communities through col-laborations with policymakers, the Y fos-ters the care and respect all people need and deserve. The L.A. Lee YMCA is the oldest YMCA in Broward County , serving Fort Lauderdale and the Sistrunk corridor for more than 70 years. The beautiful new YMCA is on the property that for decades was home to the Von D. Mizell Community Center. Prior to that, from 1938 to 1964, the site was where Provident Hospital stood. At the time it was the only hospital in Broward County that provided medical care to Black patients. The YMCA has named this new center the L.A. Lee YMCA Mizell Center in order to pre-serve the community and cen-ter's rich history . Here we will meet the needs of the local community and strengthen the foundations of the community . Strengthening communities is the YMCA cause. That's why , every day , we work side-by-side with our neighbors to make sure everyone, regardless of age, income or background, has the opportu-nity to learn, grow and thrive.

We have an entire construction and design department, and we see the projects from start to finish.\" He said the department represents the entire healthcare system and applies their expertise to the design firms, to manage and see projects from concept all the way through to transition and operations. \"It's a great role for us to play .\" He said Memorial Cancer Institute has been in the works for about five years, and he and the members of the team initially had opportunities to visit other similar facil-ities. \"We looked at benchmarks and brought back the best we could find; couple that with the world-class care and services that we already provide, and that's how the project was born. It also happened by collaboration with our executive leaders, physi-cians, and nurses, as well as input from patients and families.\" Greenspan mentioned that feedback from the latter groups is important because \"first and foremost we're here to serve them. That's the art of what we do. We can't plan effectively without their voice in our projects. We're here to advance the mission of the organization and to create the care environment, and we can't do that without bringing together all those perspectives.\" Having been in the works for a few years means that the COVID pandemic came into play right in the midst of the Memorial Cancer Institute project. Greenspan com-mented that the impact of the virus has been twofold. \"We're seeing price escalation across all the construction commodities and we're seeing supply chain disruption in terms of the delivery and availability of equipment and material. Those have been the most significant impacts we've had to mitigate along the path of the project.\" He added, however, that he and his team have been proactive, identifying risk and monitoring it in an effort to keep the project on schedule. \"It's been an area of focus for our team and our design partners and our construction manager. We meet about these issues on a weekly basis, and when things occur unexpectedly , we problem-solve and find solutions. We're definitely dealing with things we never thought we would be, but they've become the norm now.\" The projected date of completion for the 121,000 sq. ft. Memorial Cancer Institute is spring 2023. Greenspan said the frame has just finished being built, and work has now begun on the interior. When finished, it will consolidate resources such as radi-ation oncology , breast oncology , and hematology oncology . will be 76 exam rooms, 53 infusion bays, telehealth rooms, linear accelerators, a caf\u00e9, image recovery , a meditation room, and a rooftop terrace where both providers and patients can get away for a respite. In short, coordinated patient care will take place, and cancer research will also be housed in the new facility . Memorial Cancer Institute, along with its research partner Florida Atlantic University , is already designated as one of only five Cancer Centers of Excellence in Florida. The designation recognizes providers that exceed service standards and excel in providing quality , comprehensive, and patient-coordinated care. Of the work on this new project, Greenspan concluded, \"Our time is invested in helping the community and in helping to provide care, so it's a satisfying mission.\" For more information, call (954) 265-4325, or visit www.mhs.net/cancer. Cover Story: New Cancer Center to Augment World-Class Care Continued from page 1 HEALTHCARE REAL ESTATE, CONSTRUCTION, DESIGN & FACILITY PLANNING South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com June 2022 17 The Palm Beach Health Network Is Expanding to the T reasure Coast The Palm Beach Health Network is pleased to announce the expansion of its award-winning services to the Treasure Coast. Plans are now underway to begin building a new , technologically advanced facility slated to open in Port St. Lucie in 2024. The 54-bed acute care hospital will offer specialized surgical services includ-ing orthopedics, spine, robotics, general surgery , advanced cardiac care, and diag-nostic services. This expansion will allow the Palm Beach Health Network to extend its acute care health system capa-bilities to increase access to its services locally across Martin and St. Lucie Counties. The facility will be the cornerstone of the newly developed Florida Coast Health Network, a sister healthcare entity that will benefit from the depth of resources in the Palm Beach Health Network. On the campus of the new hos-pital, the Florida Coast Health Network will expand access to leading physicians in a convenient location with the addition of a new medical office building. There will also be greater access to outpatient surgical services with affiliated ambulatory surgery centers through the Palm Beach Health Network's relationship with United Surgical P artners International (USPI). \"Currently , many Martin and St. Lucie County residents travel south to seek advanced healthcare services,\" said Maggie Gill, Chief Executive Officer. \"With the future open- ing of the Florida Coast Health Network, we will be able to create a stronger healthcare infrastructure with high-quality care for the Treasure Coast community .\" HEALTHCARE REAL ESTATE, CONSTRUCTION, DESIGN & FACILITY PLANNING 18 June 2022 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital NewsBoot Camp for UM Medical Students Help Them Prep for Residency The boot camp was initially launched in 2015 as a two-week elective for a pilot group of eight students, to ready them for resi-dency training. Since then, word of mouth has spread about the value of the boot camp, with the result that the 2022 cohort of 50 students was the largest to date. In 2023, the boot camp will become a four-week required course for all graduating med-ical students, and will include specialty components such as emergency medicine, internal medicine, surgery , obstetrics-gynecology , and pediatrics. The course will be directed by Gauri Agarwal, M.D., associate dean of curriculum; Alecia Stein, M.D., director of simulation education; and Paul Mendez, M.D., director of clinical skills. Faculty members from the Departments of Medicine, Anesthesiology , Radiology , and Medical Education, and the Division of Emergency Medicine, will also contribute to the lessons in a voluntary role. \"The goal is to provide stu- dents greater confidence in beginning their internship year by preparing [them] to commu-nicate effectively in challenging scenarios with standardized patients, to handle acute emergencies using high-fidelity simulations at the Gordon Center, to prepare for the professionalism required of residency training, and to con-solidate the knowledge gained over four years of medical school,\" Dr. Agarwal said. Students taking the course can expect an interactive experience, performing simu- lations, procedure labs, and standardized patient sessions in \"real\" scenarios that they will encounter in residency . A favorite of the students has been emergency scenarios in which they are the first person in the room and must make an assessment and begin initial management, exercising a greater and unaccustomed level of independence. They also practice com-munication scenarios they may never have encountered, such as significant medical errors or informing a family member of a patient's death. \"I had been waiting for an experience like this throughout medical school,\" said Daniel Beckerman, a fourth-year student. \"To be challenged with working effectively as a team to navigate common yet extremely consequential scenarios is important. I am glad the Miller School is leveraging the resources available to them through the Gordon Center to improve the way medical education is delivered, and hope they find more ways to integrate this type of learning into the new curriculum.\" The Department of Medical Education has been taking notes throughout the boot camps, with an eye to the course's launch in 2023. Many of the popular boot camp lessons will remain as part of the course curriculum, while coverage will broaden to encompass other needed areas and give students the best experience. \"We will have the time to create specialty paths within the course so students spe- cializing in certain areas can add those skill sets,\" Dr. Agarwal said. \"We also hope to add an interprofessional piece that existed before the pandemic, training with fellow nursing and physical therapy students. \"The ultimate goal of the NextGenMD curriculum is to create transformational leaders in medicine, but the most immediate goal at graduation is ensuring that our students take outstanding care of their patients in residency and are prepared well for that transition to more independent practice.\" Phlebotomy practice with medical students.

A lignum vitae, also known as the \"tree of life,\" was planted at the hos-pital's main entrance with nurses from various departments taking turns adding dirt to ground the sapling. The tree is a native species of Florida and is known for its combina-tion of toughness, resiliency and adaptability , which is representative of nurses' career qualities. \"Remember, that the strongest trees have weathered the greatest storms just as nurses have over the last two years,\" said Netonua Reyes, MSN, chief nursing officer at Broward Health Imperial Point. \"This has made us stronger with deeper roots that anchor us here, where we can grow in our professional practice of nursing.\" The tree will forever represent nurses at Broward Health. Its roots spread out in all directions, as well as its branches, symbolizing how the health system is connected to the diverse community it serves. The trunk represents a single unit, linking healthcare providers together for years to come and providing nourishment, shade and shelter, just as nurses do. \"We specifically chose this tree because of its adaptability and individuality ,\" said Rachel Chavez, RN, manager of the progressive care unit at Broward Health Imperial Point. \"Every tree is unique just like our nurses.\" \"We all grow in different directions and will grow around something if it gets in our way ,\" she said. \"The roots that we have planted remind us that to grow , we need to be grounded, and no matter how high we go, our roots will offer us stability .\" The Pap Corps Donates $3.5 Million to Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center You can\u00edt keep champions down!

Ensuring that our patients and customers feel seen and heard when they walk into one of our stores is paramount to us as a company .\" Trulieve also recently launched a PRIDE Employee Resource Group (ERG), with representation from each of their three Hubs and supported by an Executive Sponsor and Co-Chairpersons. The ERGs will plan grass-roots sessions to facilitate personal growth and idea-sharing, providing a safe space and promoting free-flowing conversations that will positively shape Trulieve.

Sweet Talk gives the goods that are sure to leave a big smile on your face. \u0081 Chocolate bars: Satisfy your crav- ings with these tasty and therapeutic chocolate bars.

Collins offered the following advice on how to begin your cannabis journey: \"Many first-time patients start with tinctures because they're easy to dose drop-by-drop to help you gauge your tol-erance levels,\" she says. \"Capsules are also a great way to begin because they're similar to other medications and can be put in medicine trays with other pills. Edible gummies and chocolate are con-venient and tasty . Vapes or inhalables are fast-acting for those seeking immediate relief.\" Collins says that it's important you understand the potency of the products you're using and how your dosage will affect you. Start small and increase dosage as needed based on recommenda-tion from your physician. \"Many Trulieve dispensaries offer on- site consultations to help patients obtain appropriate medical products and dosages to ensure optimal cannabis experiences,\" she says.

Back Cover Story: Trulieve Announces PRIDE-related Activities for June Continued from back cover T rulieve CEO Kim Rivers Receives Green Market Report Women's Leadership Award Trulieve Cannabis Corp. announced that its Chief Executive Officer Kim Rivers has won Green Market Report's Women's Leadership Award in the C-Suite category . In the last year, Rivers has been the driving force behind several major business developments in the cannabis industry , including Trulieve's leading retail footprint in U.S. cannabis, industry leading profitability , and transformational purchase of Harvest Health and Recreation. Rivers set a new industry standard with Trulieve's release of its inaugural Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) report, the first issued by an American multi-state cannabis operator. The Women's Leadership Award honors women in the cannabis industry for their work in several different categories including Activism/Politics, Social Equity , Cultivation, and Media. \"It's an honor to be recognized amongst so many talented leaders who are redefining this industry ,\" said Rivers. \"As the only female-led public multi-state operator, Trulieve has a unique opportunity to increase female representation and ownership within the sector. It's also important to use this platform to foster sig-nificant economic and social advancement opportunities for local communities across the country . I look forward to a future when female leadership is ubiqui-tous in the C-Suite.\" Kim Rivers suppress many mental illness related symptoms. Educating seniors, who talk about its benefits over lunch, playing cards or at the pool is a vital step towards decriminalization of use. What's your history with the cannabis Industry? Well, in plain language, I started as a smuggler. I spent 30 years in prison and had a lot of time to think about the future and wanted to kick off a medical revolu-tion. I now have my own brand of cannabis \"Black T una\" which Trulieve sells in Florida, and I introduced a new , deli-cious strain, \"Blue Fin T una\" this month. I worked in the media as a pitchman and realized I could use that talent to help change the attitudes of seniors toward Cannabis use after Proposition 19 failed in California because it didn't have senior support. In 2010, California already had legalized medical marijuana use but nobody made a real effort to educate sen-iors about its benefits when trying to pass laws to legalize recreational use. Lacking the senior support, it failed. I originated the Silver Tour which edu- cates and advocates for decriminalization of pot and targets senior communities, at churches, synagogues - and wherever I get an audience in Florida - explaining the value of medical cannabis. Cannabis is a choice-better than pills - and Grandma needs to know about it to live her best life. This has taken me to politicians and leg- islators, (not just in Florida but in Washington DC), where we changed the audience of pro-marijuana rallies from hippies to seniors in wheelchairs. I talk with doctors and farmers, in person and through the media, I campaign for the benefits of cannabis legalization with the main goal of getting the truth out about the benefits and getting involved with advocacy groups to get petitions signed, legislation introduced and passed to allow everyone to reap the rewards. What motivates you? It doesn't make sense that the cannabis industry is one of the fastest-growing, tax producing businesses and produces one of the oldest natural medicines ... yet we still spend billions of tax dollars incarcerating users and promoting myths and miscon-ceptions about marijuana. Studies done to date about the effective- ness of cannabis use are so promising, pointing to the potential to help us live a better life, keep me pushing for the federal decriminalization of cannabis use. What do you think is necessary to help move Florida forward in the marijuana/cannabis business? Education. The benefits directed at sen- iors, like my Silver Tour campaign, have helped make huge inroads over the past several years. Seniors are advocates and politicians know they need the senior vote. Education targeting doctors and educators have led to Medical School research and teaching future doctors about cannabis medicine. At the very least this state needs to have reciprocity with other states who have passed laws regarding medical and recre-ational use. We are a tourist state and leg-islators understand that leaking money to other states is a bad economic move. Nationwide, 18 states have legalized recre-ational marijuana and 37 allow it for med-ical purposes with a prescription. Florida needs to get there now on both counts. We need to stop limitation on volumes and retrain budtenders to sync computer renewal amounts to determine appropriate quantities. We need to limit alcohol and opioid abuse and talk about the benefits of cannabis and marijuana for people who need relief. We need to allow for home-grown weed. Bottom line is we need to decriminalize use, period. Doctors, legislators, law enforcement, teachers and the public are getting on-board and moving to support federal decriminalization to remove all legal con-straints to using marijuana, which confus-es those who need it and blocks us from its benefits. Trulieve has pushed the envelope and provides education and a variety of quality products. I think we've made a lot of progress and I am confident we are moving in the right direction. People just wish it was at a faster speed for those who need the benefits.

KONIN In some of my previous columns I have discussed the importance of cannabis edu-cation to many different stakeholders if we are to see advancement in this space. While the term \"education\" seems simple to understand for most if not all of us, the diversity and quality of what is being taught in the numerous platforms can leave some even more confused than when they started. What about for those of you who already have a solid baseline of under-standing of cannabis and are seeking con-tinued professional development? Where do you go for educational opportunities? How do you decipher between quality and propaganda? First and foremost, peer-reviewed and published scientific literature is always a reliable source. Yes, you should still evalu-ate and critique all published work, but the mere fact that a paper has already gone through some review process is a good starting point for a minimal level of assur-ance. Keep in mind the key term \"peer-reviewed.\" Just because something is pub-lished doesn't mean it has been reviewed by others for quality , accu-racy , and an absence of bias. From the perspective of live or online courses, they abound! And - they can be expensive! There is no sin-gle formula that can help predict how good the edu-cational content will be when signing up to learn about cannabis. However, like all other conferences, there are a few guidelines that you can follow to bet-ter evaluate the course con-tent ahead of time. Of course much of this also depends on the level of knowledge that you are starting with and what your overall goals are toward learn-ing about a specific aspect of cannabis. The first simple step is to review the pro- motional materials: website, flyers, save the date cards, etc. Look for professional quality , images, typos, etc. These are basic things that should raise a red flag. If you find careless wording or blurred photos, you might want to just wonder if the same lack of attention to detail will be presented in the course delivery . You should also look carefully for the follow-ing components related to the course on the pro-motional materials: Program and/or Course Title: As simple as it sounds, the title of a program and its inclu-sive presentation topics may provide you with a sense of the quality and competence of the course. Titles can give you a glimpse into the scientific level of the content as well as the \"low key laid back\" approach to the deliv-ery . This is not to say that you should always judge the book by its cover, but it is an easy starting point for a review process. Learning Outcomes or Program Goals: A 1- or 2-day course can be themed and focus on a very specific topic such as the endocannabinoid system, or it can have a variety of topics that range from CBD and forms of application to the entourage effect of various cannabinoids. The choice is yours, depending on your goals of learn-ing and levels of interest. While not every-one is an expert in using Bloom's taxono-my to state course and presentation goals, those who do use such higher level of learning words such as \"solving\", 'detect-ing\", or \"validating\" reflect a deeper expec-tation as compared to words such as \"iden-tifying\", \"estimating\", or \"comparing\". Again, these are examples, but those who present more often and are tasked with writing goals and objectives will be more familiar with using higher level terms. It is easy to search online for an example of Bloom's taxonomy of words. One thing to also consider is who is identified as the tar-get audience. Be sure that you fit into this category or else you may feel as though you are in the wrong room! Speaker Credentials: A series of alpha- bet letters after one's name does not auto-matically translate to excellence at the podium. Credentials go beyond letters as they include accomplishments that con-tribute to the body of work in the area of the content being presented. We have all been to presentations where \"heavy-hit-ting\" named speakers disappointed us as well as listening to some of the best pre-sentations delivered by speakers we never previously have heard of. It is also impor-tant to correlate the speaker's presentation and know whether or not the individual has any potential conflicts of interest or biases in any way . This could influence the presentation and not provide you with a true reflection of the facts. Do your home-work, ask around, have some familiarity with individuals as best you can to maxi-mize your valuable time. Registration Fees & Cancellation Policy: This can be a tricky area to consid-er. Think about it, if a course fee is very low , would you not assume there may be a lack of quality? After all, we equate lower costing items with lesser quality products. Do professional development continuing education programs fall under this similar assumption? Yet, if the course was very high priced - as some are tremendously overpriced especially in the online cannabis space - will it truly deliver a valu-able package to you or is it a quick money grab? It is also helpful to view the cancel-lation policy . Any policies that just simply don't appear to be \"user friendly\" would raise a red flag to me. Life happens, and if companies putting on courses are unwill-ing to recognize this I would likely turn toward another program. Refunds that can be applied elsewhere toward a future course are good options, and refunds minus a reasonable administrative fee are also fare. After all, companies may have spent a respectable amount of funds mar-keting and promoting the course, agreeing to speaker fees, renting room space and/or AV equipment, etc. But any program that refuses to honor a refund in any manner within a reasonable time for such a request is simply not acting in good faith. Such programs operating in this manner will ultimately lose clients and word of mouth will spread fast. Professional Credits Offered: One item to consider is whether or not the program offers formal credits such as CME's or CEU's. Programs that formally offer credit that has been granted by your professional associations reflect a minimal standard of review and expectations that inform you of a higher level of quality to begin with. This doesn't mean there may not be less than admirable speakers or some with great knowledge and poor presentation skills. It does mean that some vetting process has occurred at least through a paper review and typically those looking to simply put on a program and make a quick buck will not go through the approval efforts. This is just a snapshot of some sugges- tions for reviewing cannabis educational courses. All of us have different experi-ences and we play a role in helping to bring efficacy not only to the science and clinical aspects of cannabis integration but also to ensure proper, factual, and effica-cious education is being transmitted to our stakeholders.

Konin is a Clinical Professor in the Department of Athletic Training in the Nicole Wertheim College of Nursing and Health Sciences at Florida International University (FIU) where he directs the Global Initiative for Cannabinoid Research and Education.

AROUND THE REGIONTM Evaluating Formal Cannabis Educational Opportunities Dr. Jeff G. Konin Cannabis News Florida cannabisnewsflorida.com June 2022 29 AROUND THE REGIONTM a population of productive income-pro- ducing individuals who have not done anything other than use cannabis, which is available via nature.\" Egort also has a strong opinion about the medical value of cannabis. \"There are other progressive countries out in this world that are doing tremen-dous amounts of research and medical advancement and using cannabis for treat-ments for cancer or degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Disease, which my father was afflicted with,\" he says. \"There's leading, cutting-edge research happening in the cannabis field right now , but I feel the United States is woefully behind in that arena.\" One of the reasons the nation is behind is due to the fact that cannabis remains illegal on the federal level. That makes cannabis accounting more challenging. \"Cannabis is unique because it's consid- ered to be\u2014and is labeled\u2014as a Schedule I narcotic in the United States,\" Egort says. \"Since it is a federally illegal activity , it makes that unique from an accounting or more importantly , from a tax standpoint. There are extreme limitations on what a business owner can use as deductions against the income earned from distribut-ing or selling cannabis, whether it's medic-inal or recreational.\" The challenges that consultants or tax advisors such as Egort have is to help those members of the industry navigate the restrictions on what they can deduct against that. Even though, it's federally illegal, it falls under a certain classifica-tion. While IRS Code Section 280E is clear that all the deductions and credits are not allowed for an illegal business, there is a caveat cannabis businesses are aware of: marijuana business owners can deduct their cost of goods sold, which is basically the cost of their inventory . This means they still must report the income. They don't have the same flexibil-ity or liberties that businesses who are not operating under the pretense have as far as what they can deduct against that income. Therefore, their taxes are significantly higher than other industries. While other tax consultants and accounting practices are now offering serv-ices to cannabis businesses, Egort feels he has one great advantage over the others. \"We're a smaller, boutique firm with seven total employees, so we don't have the distractions of a larger firm where it's multilayered and multilevel,\" he says. \"As a result, we're able to provide a unique per-spective with the same level of expertise but with greater attention and focus for our clients. Our clients will never feel like they're getting bounced around from one professional to another. We all share the same level of expertise and resources. You're getting high value no matter who you work with in our office.\" Whether you work with Egort's practice or any other firm, Egort offers this accounting advice: \"Always ask good questions and sur- round yourself with really good profes-sionals who are embedded in the indus-try ,\" he notes. \"Those are the people who will have access to resources specific to the industry , no matter what industry it is, whether it's cannabis or anything else in healthcare. Also, be sure to listen, be open minded, and have a positive attitude about compliance. Understand that your busi-ness advisors, whether they are lawyers, accountants or other business consultants, are all in your corner and are looking to help you become successful and to navi-gate a very highly regulated, challenging, and often misunderstood, industry .\" Finally , he stresses the importance of working with professionals who you are comfortable working with. For example, do the communication styles match? Is there easy access to the professional\u2014are they readily available? \"You should really decide what's impor- tant to you in the professionals you choose to work with,\" he says. \"The knowledge base about a subject area is similar for every professional. So, you should decide what's important to you for a working rela-tionship. The relationship is ultimately what matters. Cannabis is a relationship-driven business. That's where the value is.\" For more information, visit www.egortcpa.com.

Having completed over 80+ retail dispensaries, offering 60-day , fast-track turn time options on retail construction, and finish ing numerous indoor and outdoor cultivation facilities, SRCS clearly understands the challenges within the medical cannabis space and emphasizes a culture of 'communication' and 'transparency' which provide synergy and balance to our client relationships, according to Ryan Seddon, Principal of SRCS. Building Relationships \"Our most valuable asset is the talented and experienced SRCS staff who contribute - both as individuals and team members - to the ultimate goal of a job well done,\" Seddon explains, \"and that's what brings our customers back.\" By the Numbers According to the OMMU webpage, Florida has a total of 429 authorized retail dispensary locations statewide (May 13th, 2022 OMMU webpage). When you consider the active patient count makes up only 3.34% of Florida's population & future recreational use ruling, it is obvious MMTC companies are just getting started. SR Construction Services is a turnkey , Division 1, vertically integrated, multi-licensed Florida contractor with years of activ e experience in the commercial retail and industrial cannabis market. Their diverse business model is focused on industrial, hos-pitality , retail tenant improvement, medical, and large-scale new construction and renovations.

FALLON A new 'wave' is heading to the Sunshine State which will essentially double the number of licensed Medical Marijuana Treatment Center (MMTC) license holders over the next 16 months. The Florida Department of Health's Office of Medical Marijuana Use (OMMU) is currently processing the 2nd cycle of MMTC licenses, authorizing these companies to start their infrastructure buildout process to help serve the 719,366 qualified patients (active ID cards as of May 13th, 2022 OMMU webpage). As with the current 22 Florida MMTC license holders, the new wave of companies will be required to cultivate, process, and dispense (retail) low-THC cannabis and medical marijuana. However, unlike a typical retail outlet which can simply open a store and purchase product directly from another company , the MMTC must be pro-ficient at all product phases: grow-process-test-package before any product arrives at their own branded retail location. The term is commonly referred to as 'vertically inte-grated' or 'seed to sale.' To a current or new MMTC license holder, 'seed-to-sale' means 'a lot of infrastruc- ture.' This is where SR Construction Services (SRCS) fits in as a scalable 3rd party partner of their organization. Early and consistent collaboration amongst the design & architectural team, contractor, and equipment vendors is key to avoiding costly and time-consuming design alterations during construction. Partnering with a Florida-based, statewide, cannabis-experienced GC, familiar with BY DANIEL CASCIATO South Florida-based Marc Egort, CPA, P .A., was among the first statewide accounting firms to develop a portion of its practice dedicated to serving the cannabis industry . Founded in 1999, by its namesake, Marc Egort, the dedicated pro-fessionals at the firm had already been working closely with clients to provide core accounting services, tax compliance, and business consulting in various indus-tries nationwide. The boutique CPA firm expanded its business four years ago to provide accounting services to cannabis business-es, not just across the state, but across the nation as well. It offers a broad spectrum of accounting, financial reporting, tax compliance, and consulting services that give cannabis businesses the insight they need to grow and succeed. \"I got involved with the cannabis indus- try for several reasons,\" explains Egort. \"My personal belief is that cannabis has a lot to offer for medicinal and health pur-poses. I also have a strong belief that there should be no incarceration for those who are users of cannabis. We're missing out on Robert Platshorn Robert Platshorn aka Robert \"Bobby Black offend-er. Platshorn served a 30-year sentence for smuggling pot into Florida. He currently offers some of the best-selling strains of marijuana legally though Trulieve, one of Florida's largest dispensaries. What benefits do you see for patients throughout Florida with- in the cannabis space? The vast majority of users in Florida are seniors - my age group - who benefit from use for pain, sleep, Parkinson's, and lots of neurological and age-related illnesses, and epilepsy , post-traumatic stress disorders, arthritis and constipation to name a few. Doctors have prescribed cannabis prod-ucts to ease side effects from cancer treat-ment (such as chemotherapy) and sup-press the symptoms of many other dis-eases. Experts indicate that abuse of alcohol and opioids can be reduced through use of cannabis and marijuana products. Whether it is included in tinctures, edi-bles, vapes, gummies, powders, or oils, marijuana is an available therapy to decrease symptoms such as anxiety and pain (not limited to seniors) that can turn patients into junkies who frequent 'pill mills'. Cannabis and marijuana have been shown to help patients gain weight, cope with chemo, treat glaucoma symptoms, and calm paranoia.
