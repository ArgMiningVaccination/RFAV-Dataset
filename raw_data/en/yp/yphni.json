BA 1,2,3 and probably more. The FDA may be studying the new vaccine. Is this vaccine Novavax effective against these Omicron variants which are all very different on how they affect the human immune system. What if one is immunocompromised, is anything effective. How far along are treatments. All of the people I know who have Covid and there are many received none of the pills that are treatments for Omicron. Why not receive them is it because there is a shortage. You need a vaccine they targets long term immunity ( lymphocyte T) and not mainly lymphocyte B. Also, there is a subset of studies ( small) that raises the question of the importance of targeting common proteins ( common among different strains and among other viruses ) rather than structural proteins like spike Proteins.

Wonder if this too is considered fake news by censors. Let's see.
