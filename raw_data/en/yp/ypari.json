Though trained to diagnose using conventional methods, naturopathic doctors use primarily diet, lifestyle, exercise, herbs, nutrients, supplements, hands-on physical medicine therapies, and homeopathy to bring their patients to health. Naturopathic doctors practice holistic medicine, taking into account a patient's whole experience, including physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual elements when assessing health. We believe that our patients' life and experience of health are of primary importance, and that being healthy is about being able to live the life we want, not just living well enough to get by. Naturopathic medicine can often help people for whom other therapies may not have been as successful, because of the holistic philosophy used by NDs, along with the complementary therapies we are trained to employ. Our clinical philosophy is exemplified by six principles: 1. First do no harm 2. Identify and treat the cause 3. Support the body's healing capacity 4. Treat the whole person 5. Prevention 6. Doctor as teacher Naturopathic doctors attend four-year naturopathic medical schools at one of six accredited programs available in the United States. At these schools, students learn the basic biomedical sciences, such as anatomy, biochemistry, and pathology, as well as the clinical sciences of rheumatology, cardiology, gastroenterology, and others. Additionally, naturopathic doctors take part in clinical rotations, where they learn to diagnose and treat under the supervision of attending physicians. As part of their education and qualification for licensure, NDs must pass two rounds of board exams administered by the North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE). After graduating, naturopathic doctors apply for licenses and enter practice. In March 2016, Maryland began licensing naturopathic doctors. Drs. Paddock and Runde were both very involved in gaining licensure for NDs in Maryland, and were among the first to hold naturopathic medical licenses in the state.
