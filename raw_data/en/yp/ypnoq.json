Therefore, we suggest it is valuable to find the potential activity of regulating (inhibiting) the excess mucin secretion (production) by the compounds derived from various medicinal plants. We have tried to investigate the possible activities of some natural products on mucin secretion from cultured airway epithelial cells. As a result of our trial, we previously reported that several natural compounds affected mucin secretion and/or production from airway epithelial cells [3](#B3), [4](#B4), [5](#B5). According to traditional oriental medicine, the root bark of Morus alba L. has been used for controlling pulmonary inflammatory diseases [6](#B6)and the natural products derived it, kuwanon E, kuwanon G, mulberrofuran G, and morusin have been reported to antiviral and anticancer effects [7](#B7), [8](#B8), [9](#B9), [10](#B10). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report about the potential effect of extract of the root bark of Morus alba L. and kuwanon mulberrofuran G, and morusin ( [Figure 1](#F1)), the natural products derived from it, on production and secretion of airway mucin. Therefore, in this study, we checked whether extract of the root bark of Morus alba L., kuwanon E, kuwanon G, mulberrofuran G, and morusin significantly affect the production and secretion of airway mucin using in vivo and in vitro experimental models reflecting the hypersecretion and/or hyperproduction of mucus observed in inflammatory pulmonary diseases. For in vivo experiment, effect of aqueous extract (AE) of the root bark of Morus alba L. was checked on hypersecretion of pulmonary mucin in sulfur dioxide-induced bronchitis in rats [11](#B11). For in vitro experiment, effects of AE, ethanolic extract (EE), kuwanon E, kuwanon G, mulberrofuran G, and morusin were checked on production of airway mucin from NCI-H292 cells, a human pulmonary mucoepidermoid cell line, which are frequently used for the purpose of elucidating intracellular signaling pathways involved in airway mucin production Methods 1.

Effect of AMA on secretion of in vivo airway mucin and histopathologic changes in tracheal tissue of rats exposed to sulfur dioxide [Figures 2](#F2)and [3](#F3), SO2 exposure to rats for 3 weeks resulted in significant increase in mucin secretion and mucosubstances (acidic mucins) in tracheal tissues, compared with the normal control group. Dexamethasone, a positive control, significantly inhibited mucin secretion and mucosubstances (acidic mucins) in tracheal tissues, due to its prominent antiinflammatory effect. However, AMA stimulated the secretion of mucin and mucosubstances (acidic mucins) in tracheal tissues of rat. The amounts in the BALF samples were 100\u00b118%, 100 mg/kg, SO2 plus AMA of EE Morus alba L. 4](#F4), AE of L. significantly inhibited PMA-induced MUC5AC production from NCI-H292 cells, respectively. The amounts of mucin in the cells of AE-treated cultures were 100\u00b17%, 528\u00b16%, 165\u00b110%, [Figure of cultures were alone, PMA plus EE 1 \u00b5g/mL, PMA plus EE 10 \u00b5g/mL, PMA plus EE \u00b5g/mL, respectively ( 3. of inhibited PMA-induced MUC5AC production from NCI-H292 cells, respectively. The amounts of mucin in the cells of kuwanon E-treated cultures were E respectively ( [Figure 5A](#F5)). amounts of mucin cultures were G respectively ( [Figure 5B](#F5)). amounts of mucin cultures were G respectively ( [Figure 5C](#F5)). The amounts of mucin cultures were 100\u00b15%, 446\u00b114%, 364\u00b112%, prominent anti-inflammatory effect, significantly inhibited mucin secretion and the amount of mucosubstances (acidic mucins) in tracheal tissues. However, AMA airway mucin and mucosubstances (acidic mucins) in tracheal tissues in this rat model. This result can explain, at least in part, the traditional use of AMA as expectorants for controlling various pulmonary inflammatory diseases that are accompanied by mucus hypersecretion. AMA might stimulate the secretion of airway mucus and then remove the mucus from airway by inducing cough reflex. AMA can provoke the expelling of sputum through inducing cough reflex via stimulation of secretion of mucus in airway luminal surface under inflammatory status. Dexamethasone, one of the corticosteroidal compounds used as a remedy for inflammatory diseases, might suppress the overproduction of in vivo airway mucin and resultantly might decrease the amount of secretion of mucin, under inflammatory condition. Since AMA showed the stimulatory action on airway mucin secretion in in vivo model, we tried to investigate which component of AMA can contribute to its pharmacologic activity. Among the twenty one MUC genes coding human mucins reported to date, MUC5AC was mainly expressed in goblet cells in the airway surface epithelium [2](#B2), [20](#B20). PMA was reported to protein kinase C (PKC), diacylglycerol [21](#B21)and to be an inflammatory stimulant that can control a gene transcription [22](#B22), cell growth and differentiation [23](#B23). PMA also can induce MUC5AC gene expression in PMA which cleave pro-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands from the cell surface to become mature EGFR ligands. These ligands bind to the EGFR, provoking the phosphorylation of its intracellular tyrosine kinase. This leads to activation of MEK leading to ERK activation. Following is the activation of the transcription factor (Sp1) and binding of the factor to specific sites with the MUC5AC gene promoter. Eventually, the promoter is activated and produced the gene transcription and translation to MUC5AC mucin protein [22](#B22). Based upon these reports, we investigated the effects of AE and 70% EE of Morus alba L. on PMA-induced MUC5AC mucin production from NCI-H292 cells, a human pulmonary mucoepidermoid cell line. As shown in results, AE and 70% EE of Morus alba L. inhibited the production of MUC5AC mucin induced PMA, kuwanon G, G, and morusin, the natural products derived from Morus alba L., inhibited the production of MUC5AC mucin induced by PMA, respectively ( [Figure 4](#F4)). The production and the secretion of airway mucin are known to be regulated through separate signaling steps [2](#B2). However, based just on the result of this study, we cannot explain the reason AE, 70% EE and the single compounds derived from Morus alba L., kuwanon E, kuwanon G, mulberrofuran G, and morusin, inhibited the production of airway mucin, although AE of Morus alba L. stimulated the secretion of airway mucin. This result might be interpreted that, although AE of Morus alba L. can stimulate the secretion of airway mucin already produced by inflammatory condition, AE and EE and the single compounds derived from it can inhibit de novo production of airway mucin under inflammatory or stimulatory conditions. This interpretation of the result is coincident with the record that AE of Morus alba L. was utilized as a folk remedy which shows an antiinflmmatory activity (decrease in mucin production) and expectorating (increase in mucin secretion) activity [6](#B6). The underlying mechanisms of action of these single compounds on MUC5AC mucin secretion and production are not clear at present, although we are investigating whether kuwanon E, kuwanon G, mulberrofuran G and morusin act as a potential regulator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and/or a potential regulator of nuclear factor-kB signaling pathway, in mucin-producing NCI-H292 cells. In summary, these results can explain, at least in part, the folk use of AMA as expectorants and anti-inflammatory agents for controlling various pulmonary inflammatory diseases that are accompanied by hypersecretion of mucus. We suggest it is valuable to find the natural products that have specific regulative effects on mucin production and secretion-in view of both basic and clinical sciences-and the result from this study suggests a possibility of developing kuwanon E, kuwanon G, mulberrofuran G, and morusin as a candidate for the new efficacious mucoregualtors for inflammatory pulmonary diseases, although further studies are essential.
