You really read all the way to the bottom of my web page? You must also be one of those rare persons who stay in a movie theater to watch all the movie credits, hoping to see some out-take clips at the end. Well, it's like that here at the web page end. I am currently President of a very important professional organization - perhaps the most important professional organization that exists in the world right now - The Naturopathic Medicine Institute (NMI). It is a 501-C3 nonprofit organization whose purpose is to nurture, expand and teach the fundamentals of Naturopathic medicine to recent graduates of Naturopathic medical schools, and to educate the general public as to the possibilities of Naturopathic medicine. I owe a great deal to this organization and am excited to help it grow. "}
