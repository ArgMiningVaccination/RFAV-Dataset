Here's how to start feeling better with these immune-boosting foods Most of the time, this column focuses on food as joy, whether that's about the taste or the gathering we do around it. I'm going to interrupt that regular programming with a bit of a detour as we head into cold, fall weather and a winter season that may be post-pandemic, but is still rife with opportunities for us to get sick. That's because food can be about so much more than momentary bliss. According to many researchers and professionals, it can contribute in real ways to feeling better and have a large impact on our overall health. (You are what you eat, right?) Before we dive into this, please consider this my \"I'm not a medical professional\" disclaimer. I'm not. I'm a food lover and a journalist who likes to ask questions and a person who'd rather eat a hot bowl of soup than take cold medicine. With a keen awareness of how fragile our health can be, it seems like many of us may share the sentiment of wanting to know how best to take care of the only bodies we'll get. Immune-boosting foods aren't a new trend. And there's tons of research out there about the benefits of certain food groups that can boost the immune system and help with the \"stay healthy\" goal. [According to the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/fight-off-the-flu-with-nutrients), things like beta carotene, Vitamin C and D, Zinc, and probiotics, including dairy products like yogurt, and fermented foods, such as kefir and kimchi, are all nutrients that play a role in boosting the immune system. Luckily, we also have incredible resources here in Louisville in people like trained physician assistant and Registered Herbalist Myron Hardesty of [Weeds of Eden](http://www.weedsofeden.com/), 7505 New LaGrange Road. The health/life coach helps his clients feel better using a holistic approach to health and wellness with a strong emphasis on clinical nutrition.

Really, though, his advice all boiled down to this: warming foods (both temperature-warm and what he called energetically warm, or, warmth-inducing like fiery spices) are our friends when it comes to staying healthy. Yep, it's really that straightforward. But let's back up. Here are a few of my top takeaways about how to use food to stay healthy this cold and flu season. Is spicy food good for your immune system? \"First,\" says Hardesty, \"it's valuable to consider how we see immunity work within our bodies and try to mimic or support those efforts.\" What often happens when we start to get sick, he says, is we see our body's reaction say, fever and sniffles as symptoms, \"and then mistake the symptoms as the actual disease itself.\" While most of us will grab \"some manner of fever reducer,\" so that we can keep going, \"it is actually working against the body's own millennial evolved healing mechanisms,\" he says. \"The fever is in fact designed to help the body essentially burn an infection out of the body.\" These amazingly smart bodies also have another response when we're \"confronted with an unwanted invader,\" Hardesty says.

Yep, we take a cough suppressant and something to dry up the mucus. This, he explains, allows \"the virus to proliferate and take up a deeper residence inside the body ... and restrict[s] our capacity to isolate and eliminate the invader.\" If we look to older cultures with traditionally established systems of medicine, Hardesty says, the answer, rather than an Advil and a cough drop, is to warm the body. Eating foods like garlic, ginger, horseradish, and peppers \"will increase circulation, particularly to the gut and lungs where most infections invade and will bring the posse of white blood cells to fend off the potential invaders.\" Going for the spicy stuff that makes us sweat \"will also help thin the mucus to make it easier to expel from the body,\" he says. Is it good to eat hot or warm foods when sick? We can also eat foods that are actually hot. There's a reason grandma gave us chicken noodle soup when we were sick. Include root vegetables like carrots and beets to level up the infection-fighting powers, Hardesty says. Also, a big bowl of pho (from your favorite Vietnamese restaurant if you're not up to making your own) fits the bill on several counts, including a liberal garnish of herbs that pack their own anti-microbial punch, Hardesty says.

What else? Meat is warming, and the fat and protein found especially in red meat are beneficial for healing, Hardesty says. A former vegetarian, \"I'll be explicit,\" he says. \"Meat is medicine.\" (Don't @ me; \"the wheels are falling off the idea that dietary cholesterol or saturated fat contribute to mortality or morbidity,\" Hardesty says). That said, there are still plenty of reasons to avoid many types of meat, and mushrooms are not only a fantastic alternative but 'are having a heyday\" right now for their prevention powers and ability to fight off infection, says Hardesty. Want the best of both worlds? Try a steak topped with mushroom sauce! How about if you want a giant, delicious, immunity bomb? Try something like a stew. Funnily enough, we'd made just that in my own home before I talked with Hardesty. A Moroccan beef roast my husband cooked for Sunday supper along with roasted vegetables made so many leftovers that we made a stew the next day. This concoction (no recipe, sorry, it was literally just everything leftover heated through with more beef broth and bulked up with chickpeas then scattered with fresh herbs) ticked all the boxes.

Red meat: check. Warming spices in the Ras El Hanout (a Moroccan spice blend we bought in [Logan Street Market](https://www.loganstmarket.com/)): check. Root vegetables: check. It was so delicious, we ate it for three days running. With Hardesty's counsel in mind, and winter looming in a drafty Old Louisville Victorian that it would take a lottery win to sufficiently heat, I'm looking forward to enjoying warming dishes like the Taiwanese-style beef noodle soup we make to usher in the cold weather. And now I won't just feel good about eating them because they taste good, but because they'll help keep me and the people I love healthy and well. Tell Dana!
