Greetings from the President \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved 4 Kelly Holland Azzaro NAHA Vice President Walk this way....let your fabulous feet do the talking. Have you ever given much thought to how you get from one place to another, walking from room to room or hiking a mountain trail or jogging on a sandy beach. Climbing stairways or pedaling a bicycle. How do we get from here to there? Our fabulous feet! Combined with thought, intention and action our original thought initiates our intentions to move the body forward. We accomplish this every day during every moment of our wak- ing hours. Yet most of the thought process is not thought about at all it just happens automatically, as if we went about our day on automatic pilot. Our thoughts and feet become one without analyzing. The dancer becomes the dance. The rider and horse become one. The runner becomes the distance. Hesitation in movement is hesitation in thought. Should I move forward or stay put. Am I ready or uncertain. Should I walk or run. Will I sink or swim. Are those your footprints or prints left from the one who carr ied you. During times of uncertainty the natural reaction may be to plant your feet firmly on the ground as your thoughts are unable t o decipher which way to go. Indecision and fear based emotions can lock you into a stubborn mule -like stance. How do we move forward? Breathing and meditation are both powerful tools for calming the spirit and allowing energy to flow. When the need for feelin g more grounded, stable and not so anxious, take a few moments to focus on your breathing by inhaling and exhaling from the gut. Thi s is a perfect time to incorporate the use of essential oils and inhalation therapy. One drop of Lavender on a tissue is your calmin g friend. A drop of Sweet Orange gives you a boost of sunshine confidence and Vetiver tames the fearful mind. Combine all three essential oils and you have created a nice little blend for mindful breathing exercises. Blend with a carrier base and apply to your feet. P lace both feet on the ground and inhale deeply, visualize that both your feet are expanding into the floor and becoming root -like within t he ground. Exhale and wiggle your toes and feet around, ankle circles and a bit of a stretch. You have now grounded yourself for a day that should feel clear and focused, allowing you to be less anxious and free to move forward. By taking the time to listen to what your feet are saying by way of movement or lack of movement is an opportunity to bring a ware- ness to the mind -body connection. Your intuitive -spirit gut type reaction may be the mule that whispers hey dont move, stay s till. When this happens take that moment to listen and apply the aromatic grounding breathing technique. Perhaps at that moment you may need to be still and meditate, that may be the message your feet are sending. We are creatures of constant movement and o ur feet being the physical vehicle to get us from here to there. Slowing down and being more peaceful allows your body -mind and fee t to rest a bit. Rest is the fuel to keep the body moving and the thoughts flowing. So the next time you find yourself running to the grocery store or being overwhelmed by the never -ending to do list of drive here, drop this off there, pick this up over here stop for a moment and listen to what your feet are sharing. Are they throbbing or swollen or are they raring to run a marathon. If your dogs are barking (aka -feet are hurting), heed the message your feet are talk- ing. Fabulous Foot Soak : Warm water \u00bd gallon or foot tub full mix with the following ingredients: Epsom Salts \u00bd to 1 cup ACV (Apple Cider \u00bd to 1 cup Essential Oils: Cypress (Cupressus sempervirens) 4 drops Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) 4 drops Peppermint (Mentha piperita) 6 drops *If you have a bit of funky fungus add: 4 drops Tea Tree or Lemongrass essential oils Soak feet until they are rested and happy. Towel dry and apply a natural dusting of cornstarch. This foot soak is a wonderful treat for tired aching feet and as a pre -treat for a professional reflexology session. Add a few hot stones or marbles to the foot bath tu b and roll feet over the cool marbles or massage with stones for a therapeutic benefit.

During windy pre -winter type of evening I decided (without listening to my intuitive gut) to clean my horses hooves. While Sand y was eating a bit of hay, I went about my same hoof picking routine, she lifts up her hoof and I clean it out with a hoof pick , on to the next hoof. Well on this particular day while picking her front hoof, a gust of wind came out of no where, causing both he r and Taz to spook a bit. She jumped forward and her hoof landed on top of my foot. After much hobbling about and walking -out the pain, I managed to wipe my tears and begin breathing deeply. In and out, in and out, focusing on finding a rhythm for healin g and allowing my thoughts of pain to dissipate. I regained my sense of balance and found a bottle of lavender essential oil in my jeep. Inhaling a bit of lavender and taking a drop or two of Rescue Remedy I began to feel much better. Poor Sandy looked con- cerned about stepping her 1000 lb body onto my size 7 \u00bd foot so I had to go over and give her a hug. I whispered into her ear , \"Its ok girl, it was just the wind, Moms foot will be ok.\" Feeling blessed that Sandy is a barefoot natural girl and goes w ithout metal horseshoes added to the relief of my sore foot. When my husband and I arrived home the first thing I did was to examine my foot and apply a few drops of Helichrysum (Helichrysum italicum) essential oil directly to skin. I covered the area with a towel, followed by an ice pack. Applying the R.I.C.E. method (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) along with aromatherapy had me feeling so much better. After 20 minutes of ice the r- apy, I removed the ice pack and towel to see deep purple bruising already taking shape. Yet not so much pain. It was amazing. The next day I only needed to apply a couple of drops of Helichrysum to the bruised area and underneath my foot/big toe area. No ice was needed after the first ice treatment. I wore two socks for added padding and easier maneuvering during the day. By day three there was not much pain at all, just some guarded sensitivity and after day 4 only one sock was needed. While tendi ng to the bruised area I found that the Helichrysum would actually help to draw out the deeper bruising and even brought purple to the applied towel. My big toe (the affected area) had nail pain which subsided after day two and the nail bed has not changed color. So what is the moral of this story? Listen to your intuition and the sound of the wind, it may save your feet from being stom ped! Speaking of Foot Prints and NAHA News: Your \" Carbon Foot Print \" is what you decide to contribute, share and leave for others in the way of going green and keeping our planet clean. NAHAs way of going green was to introduce the e -journal, a method that is being implemented by many large magazine compa- nies. The information contained with an e -journal format can be accessed easily by way of computer. Hard copies are available by contacting the NAHA Office. NAHA also saves on paper by contacting members directly via email with notification of member- ship and school renewal information and updates. Renewals are still mailed to members who do not have email and or whose email addresses are out of date. If you have a new email address or if your email address or contact information has been changed please contact the NAHA Office with your updated email, address and phone numbers via the NAHA Online Feedback Form http://www.naha.org/contact.htm Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved NAHA Vice President 6 Greetings, I recently gave a continuing education class (for massage therapists) on \"Applying Aromatherapy to Eastern Meridian Theory\" w hich is the nationally approved and slightly expanded version of the class I gave at the Norfolk NAHA Conference entitled \"Aromati c Jin Shin Jyutsu\". I love the philosophy in this eastern modality and it works perfectly with my great passion in using essential oils -- their subtle quality. Its not that I dont think of and appreciate the physiological effects of essential oils, but for me, in choosing the perfect one for a specific issue, the subtle effects are key. Gabriel Mojays wonderful book \"Aromatherapy for Healing the Spirit\" has been a constant resource along with works by Valerie Worwood, Patricia Davis and info sections on essences in Sylla Sheppard Hangers \"Aromatherapy Practitioner Manual\". (Check NAHAs bookstore). For my list of oils to use on the meridian flows, I also researched books by Scott Cunningham, Richard and Iona Miller and Monika Junemann. These works list the essential oils in relation to planets and signs...perfect since the 12 meridian flows relate to the 12 signs, beginning with Aries and the Lung flow and ending with Pisces and the Liver Flow. Blending an aromatic energetic \"jumper cable\" for points or the whole flow is different and some interesting bedfellows arise along with unusual but engaging aromas. For those interested in this idea, the Proceedings from the Norfolk Conference holds all the information given regarding the Jin Shin Jyutsu Organ flows, some suggestions on when to use them and a list of essential oils appropriate for each. Imagine the scen t of these blends that I work with: Basil, rosemary, black pepper and coriander reflect the fire and dynamic expression of Aries and the Lung flow. Yummy vanilla, combines with geranium, rose, rosewood and ylang ylang for the Taurus and Large Intestine scent. Peppermint, lemon, lime and clary sage are for thinking, communicating Gemini and Stomach flow. Sandalwood, jasmine, roman chamomile stabilize and brighten the Cancer energy and Spleen flow. Orange, petitgrain, bergamot and cinnamon hold the spicy warmth of Leo and the Heart flow. Marjoram, fennel, lavender and a touch of the blend called amber suits the refined discernment of Virgo and the Small Intestine flow. Birch, galbanum, cedar and rose strengthen and balance the Libra and Bladder flow. Pine, cistus, sage and ginger convey the deep transforming energy of Scorpio and the Kidney flow. Cedar, juniper, clove and helichrysum relate to the earthy quality and spiritual fire of Sagittarius and the Diaphragm flow. Myrrh, vetiver and spikenard are the deep centering notes of Capricorn and the Umbilicus flow. Cypress, frankincense and eucalyptus open, ground and clear Aquarius and the Gall Bladder flow. Nutmeg, linden blossom and patchouli hold the dream of Pisces and the Liver Flow. Try a blend like this for your Sun sign...or the day when the Moon is crossing through that part of the sky. Another way to use Aro- matherapy! Blessings, Shellie SHELLIE ENTEEN NAHA Director Coordinator \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved 7 by By David Crow, L.Ac. (Published in Yogi Times, Oct. \u00b404) Image provided by www.holisticphoto.com Lavender is one of the most well -known, versatile, and extensively used essential oils in the world. When we use this essential oil we receive the blessings of the feminine, because lavender could be described as an angel of healing from the floral real m, and an expression of the earths compassion. Lavender has a long history of use. Originally, it was an herb used primarily in European herbology, but it has now spread worldwide. When one thinks of lavender cultivation, images of Provence in the south of France may come to mind, where it has been grown for centuries. But lavender has migrated across the globe, and is now at home in places as diverse as northern California, New Zealand, Kashmir, and the Himalayan states of India. Because demand for high quality organic oil is high, lav- ender is an ecological crop that provides income for many people. Lavender cultivation is also a source of ecotourism, as peo- ple are naturally drawn to the beauty and peaceful atmosphere where it is grown. What is the fragrance of lavender? One who is unfamiliar with the aromatic world might assume that all lavender oils are the same, but there are hundreds of species and varieties that create oils with different perfume notes, as well as differences p ro- duced by the soil, water, and climate. In general, lavender has a soft, sweet, and floral aroma. However, depending on the quality and place of origin, it can reveal a wide range of other scents, including hints of spiciness, fruity undertones, and green and herbaceous notes. When one smells lavenders from different places, it is easy to imagine the different elements that infl u- ence the plant: the hot summer Mediterranean days, the icy mountain winters, the spring rains. Therapeutically, lavender is one of the most versatile and safest of all essential oils. Its wide spectrum of benefits can be summed up as calmative and relaxing, cooling and anti -inflammatory, antibacterial and immune enhancing, and hormone balancing. Lavender enhances the healing powers of the body: it is effective against colds, flus, and infections, and used specifically for burns. It has pain -reducing properties, which, because of its feminine nature, are more pro- Lavender Profile By David Crow \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved 8 nounced in women than men. Lavenders pleasing fragrance and skin -regenerating benefits make it one of the most commonly used oils in cosmetic and body products. Lavender is safe and effective for children, who are more sensitive than adults and therefore more susceptible to its soothing influence. Used in diffusers in the home, it create a background scent that calms hyperactivity, excitability, and irritability of both parents and children. How would yogis and yoginis use lavender? In Ayurvedic terms, the effect of lavender oil could be described as pacifying to the vata (calms, relaxes, and restores the nervous system) and cooling to the pitta (anti -inflammatory). It is a highly sattvic oil, meaning that it purifies aggravated emotional states and helps bring mental peace. Use a few drops in a diffuser at the end of asana practice to make the transition into a calm state of rest. A few drops in a bath afterwards will refresh the mind and support the purifying effects of the asanas. If you are sitting down to meditate after a busy day, sprinkle a few drops of oil on your palms and inhale the fragrance. This will as- sist in making the transition from an active state of outwardly -focused sensory stimulation to an inward state of ab- sorption and mental serenity. Sprinkle a few drops on the pillow and sheets before starting yoga nidra, yogic sleep. The fragrance of lavender will make it easy to imagine beautiful scenery and peaceful visions before drifting into sleep. The combination of this fragrance with meditative sleep will give deep rest to those suffering from insomnia, and will assist in waking up refreshed and renewed.

Your meridians are the channels through which your emotions flow. The natural and free flow of life force energy (your e -motions - energy in motion) coursing through your meridians ensures your health and longevity. While blocked or suppressed emotions result in clogged meridian channels and imbalances of health. In classic, Oriental, or Chinese, Medicine all disease is seen as disordered elements. Restoring balance of the five elements and the harmonious flow of Chi is at the heart of Chinese medicine. Essential oils can help balance the five elements and restore the flow of chi through your meridians. The results of using aromatherapy to restore energetic balance and flow of chi may be enhanced through a regular practice of dia- phragmatic breathing. The power of Fire is transformation. This is your vital life force energy for empowerment and self esteem . Properties of the fire element: SEASON: Summer CLIMATE: heart, pericardium, cardiac plexus, thymus, breasts, small intestines, circulation, blood vessels, tongue COLOR: Red BITTER ACTION: Cooling, sweet, astringent, drying, anti -inflammatory, antibiotic, often ant parasitic and antiviral, promotes detoxification.

Stiles \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved 12 DELIVERY METHODS - Pure essential oils have a wide range of therapeutic uses and benefits. The choice of delivery method often depends on your intended goal. Here are some of the most practical and therapeutic methods for using your aromatic oils for balancing the 5 elements. Direct inhalation is the method I primarily use in my practice. Research shows that aromatic vapors will remain in your bloodstream for up to 4 -6 hours. PLEASE NOTE: Stimulating circulation of your blood, lymph and nerve flow through rhythmic breathing in conjunction with inhalation of aromatic oils enhances their delivery into your system! Steam Inhalation is one of the easiest and most direct ways to support your respiratory system with essential oils. Use steam inhalation to soothe and promote healing for your respiratory system, clearing nasal passages and enjoying thera- peutic benefits for your lungs. Great method to prevent or treat respiratory infections, support your health and prevent colds and the flu. Add 4 -8 drops of oil to a large bowl of steaming hot water, but not so hot it will burn your skin or mucous membranes. Put a towel over your head to capture the steam. Close your eyes and inhale until the water cools or until you stop smell- ing the oil. Breathe in the steam for a few minutes, as long as you desire. Please keep your eyes closed to prevent any of the essential oil vapors from getting into your eyes! Repeat, the treatment if necessary, every 4 -5 hours. Relieves sinus congestion, coughs, colds, flu and sore throats. Suggested oils to use: eucalyptus, ravensara, lavender, peppermint, lemon and tea tree. Bathing is an age -old method for using aromatic oils to balance the 5 elements and is great for stress reduction, relaxa- tion, soothing sore muscles and joints, supporting respiratory health, mood enhancement, and treating your senses to the full aroma of an essential oil. Fill your tub with water, add 5 -8 drops of oil that has been mixed in a dispersant such as a water soluble carrier oil, milk or cream, or a spoonful of honey, swish to disperse in the water. A half cup each of Epsom Salts (muscle relaxant, de- toxifier) and Baking Soda (skin softener) can also be used to disperse the oils in your bath water. PLEASE NOTE: Essential oils are not water soluble you must use a dispersant when adding them to a facial steam or bath and water may cause the oils to penetrate your system more quickly or cause irritation to sensitive or damaged skin, i.e. blemishes, sores or rash. Compress ~ Excellent for topical application to ease pain from strained muscles, menstrual cramps, etc. Disperse 4 -8 drops of oil in a teaspoon of milk or honey and add to a small stainless steel bowl of hot water. Absorb the \"HOT\" water into a wash cloth, using protective gloves, wring out excess water and apply compress to area of discomfort, repeat when your cloth cools. You may cover the warm cloth with a hot water bottle, plastic sheet or a towel to keep it \"HOT\" longer.

ESSENTIAL OILS TO BALANCE THE FIVE ELEMENTS ~ THE FIRE ELEMENT \u00a9 Copyright 2008 NAHA All rights reserved 13 By David Crow, L.Ac. History Essential oil -containing aromatic plants have been used for anti -infectious purposes for millennia. Sewage, rotting garbage, sick people, environmental pollution, and other sources of unpleasant smells reveal the presence of proliferating microbial toxins. Without knowing the details of what pathogenic agents were present, people understood that where there were bad vapors, diseases lurked. Aromatic plants have been the primary antidote for these evil spirits. Traditional medical systems, such as Ayurveda, had a general concept of microscopic pathogens and knew that substances such as essential oils cou nter- acted those toxins. Historically, people have known that essential oils had many uses, including medicines and preservatives of foods. The medici nal powers of essential oils have been utilized in various forms for millennia, such as unguents, lotions, perfumes, perfumed waters, fr agrant baths and massage, incense, and innumerable other preparations. Essential oil preparations were highly esteemed by the ancient phys icians. Essential oil -containing spices were one of the primary methods of food preservation; the search for those spices led to the dis covery of the New World. The anti -microbial actions of essential oils are one of the most extensively studied aspects of botanical medicine. Research int o the anti- septic properties of essential oils has been going on since the 1880s, starting with oils such as oregano, cinnamon, and clov e. By the 1930s a considerable amount of conclusive studies had been amassed, including proof that essential oils used in perfumes had antibiotic powers, but these were eclipsed by the discovery of penicillin and the emergence of antibiotic drugs. The origins of the curr ent aromather- apy movement can be credited largely to the research and work of people such as Dr. Jean Valnet in the 1960s. Essential Oil Research Thousands of studies on the anti -microbial effects of essential oils are available online in hundreds of databases and journals. Research has been conducted on a vast array of essential oils and essential oil constituents from a multitude of species, varieties an d chemotypes of aromatic plants, including details of their geographic origins, harvesting and extraction, analytical methods, and compara tive results. Many of these studies have been performed on aromatic plants with a known history of use in ethnobotanical medicine. In these cases, testing the plants oil components against microbial strains frequently confirms what local practitioners have known. In some cases new information emerges which might improve the use of the plant. For example, the entire aerial portion of a species may be used traditionally for anti -infectious purposes, but testing will reveal that the strongest concentrations of effective compounds are in the leaves rather than the flowers, or that the flowers contain properties that are best used in other ways. Frequently, the oils used in research are distilled in small quantities for the purpose of the study only, and are therefore not found on the market. Bringing these oils into commerce would expand the range of natural medicines available to practitioners, create new products, and give farmers new sources of income. The body of research includes not only examination of the antibiotic, antiviral, and anti -fungal properties of the oils, but oth er important functions including anti -inflammatory, immune -stimulating, hormone -regulating, anti -parasitic, and anti -cancer powers. Furthermo re, the research is not limited to human health and medical applications, but extends to other important fields including veterinary medicine, food preservation, natural flavoring and fragrancing, industrial applications, and agricultural uses such as pesticides and fertil izers. Even a brief perusal of the available literature reveals that essential oils represent a vast and underutilized botanical res ource, a non -toxic and ecologically sustainable industry capable of replacing a high percentage of the toxic fossil fuel -derived chemical compounds now rou- tinely used in almost every consumer product. Essential oils are steadily moving to the next level of practical application i n a new genera- tion of non -toxic products; this will reduce the toxic biological burden at the root of countless diseases and hasten the transi tion from un- sustainable fossil fuel -based economies and industries to sustainable plant -based economies and industries. This is the true pot ential of botanical medicines: agents of healing on all levels, including ecological, agricultural, industrial, economic, and medical. In the field of natural medicine, essential oils are important anti -infectious and anti -microbial agents, whose importance grows as microbial resistance to antibiotic and antiviral drugs increases. Research papers frequently conclude with the observation that these o ils are promis- ing alternatives for standard anti -microbial drugs. The challenge in applying this information is making the transition from in -vitro studies on The Anti -Microbial Effects of Essential Oils 14 pure microbial strains grown in petri dishes to the realities of human physiology. Because of their potency and documented pharmaceutical efficacy, essential oils represent an important interface between allo- pathic and herbal systems of medicine; as their antibiotic powers are recognized they will first replace routine prescription s for eas- ily treatable conditions, and will later be applied to more serious conditions. Testing Oils for Antimicrobial Properties Essential oils are being tested in -vitro, in -vivo in animals, and in human clinical trials. In-vitro testing of essential oils against microbial strains generally proceeds in three stages. The first step is distillation of the oil from a specific species of plant. The second is analysis of the chemical constituents of the oil, done through gas chromatogr aphy. The third is in -vitro testing of the oil or its primary compounds against various strains of microbes. The most commonly used in -vitro method for determining which pathogens are susceptible to which oils or oil constituent is the agar diffusion technique; this is the same method used to determine the bactericidal activity of antibiotic drugs. The proced ure be- gins by inoculating a standardized microbial strain on agar medium. A series of sterile paper disks are saturated with differ ent oils at different concentrations, and placed over the culture; alternately, the oil is dropped directly into holes in the medium. Aft er a latency period the inhibition halo around the disks is measured, and the anti -microbial activity of the oil is rated according to its si ze and essential oil concentration. Although the agar diffusion technique is the most commonly used, it is not necessarily the most accurate, as the essential oi ls have volatile as well as aqueous properties. Newer methods are now being employed to test the anti -microbial effects of essential oil vapors, rather than direct aqueous contact on disks. Results show that the concentrations of oils needed in the vapor state a re far less than when applied in agar medium, thus confirming that not only are the oils highly anti -microbial, but that they are also more potent than originally thought. The Role of Essential Oil Production in Plant Physiology Traditional medical systems such as Ayurveda and Chinese medicine are fundamentally systems of eco -physiology, which describe the functioning of the human body using terms and concepts derived from observing the elements and energetic patterns of plan e- tary biospheric physiology. If students contemplate these principles deeply, they begin to develop a kind of macro -thinking that re- veals not just the basic elemental correspondences taught in acupuncture colleges, but vast patterns of interrelationships be tween living beings and the underlying commonalities of biological functions. When this type of synthetic and integrative thinking is com- bined with an understanding, even rudimentary, of botany, physiology, and chemistry, a truly holistic vision of life emerges. A holis- tic vision of life awakens a sense of reverence for the intelligence operating within every aspect of nature, and this awaken ing in turn is the foundation of spiritual wisdom. In the field of essential oil chemistry, numerous parallels and examples of biological unity can be discovered using this mac ro- thinking at the intuitive level, which reveal why and how essential oils work. The lungs, for example, have a similar structu re to trees: the trachea is the trunk, the bronchi are the large branches, bronchioles are smaller branches, and alveoli are the le aves. Likewise, the majority of essential oils used for treating upper respiratory conditions and the mucous membrane level of the lungs are derived from the leaves of trees, such as eucalyptus and ravensare, or from needles of conifers such as pine, spruce, and fir. In Chinese medical terms, these oils are specifically for Wind Cold and Wind Heat, i.e. airborne pathogens; likewise, the oils p roduced within these leaves and needles are released directly into the air. The immunological functions of essential oils within plants are also directly related to their effects on human immunity. Ess ential oils are secondary metabolic byproducts which serve several physiological purposes, including anti -bacterial, anti -vital, and wound healing. The molecules within an essential oil can be thought of as the expression of the plants immunological intelligence; when we utilize essential oils we are using botanical immuno -chemical intelligence to repel and destroy pathogens common to both plan ts and humans, and to activate healing processes that are likewise similar in both. It is interesting to note that most aromatic plants are not vulnerable to common pathogens and pests that affect non -aromatic plants; likewise, those who have worked with essential The Anti -Microbial Effects of Essential Oils 15 oils during times of epidemics, such as distillers and professional perfumers, have a historical reputation of being less vul nerable to contagious illnesses. Modes of Antimicrobial Actions Different molecular compounds work differently against different microbes. One of the major models of anti -microbial action that has been confirmed is cellular membrane toxicity caused by monoterpenoid components. Although essential oils are complex mixtures, research suggests that the monoterpenes, being lipophilic, diffuse into cell me mbranes and cause them to expand, thereby increasing their fluidity, disordering membrane structures, and inhibiting membrane -embedded enzymes. Studies on the effects of essential oils such as oregano, ravensare, and tea tree show that they cause rapid cellula r dam- age to bacteria. By inhibiting the enzymes and cofactors involved in the respiratory electron transport chain spanning the cy toplasmic membranes of bacteria and mitochondrial membranes of yeast, the monoterpenes cause inhibition of respiratory oxygen of microb es. Even slight changes to the structural integrity of cell membranes can detrimentally affect cellular metabolism. In the case o f monoter- pene toxicity, potassium ions are lost, which disrupts ionic disturbs chemiosmotic control of energy -dependent p roc- esses such as metabolism and motility. Antibiotic drugs interrupt specific metabolic pathways, such as the formation of a particular protein used to build a cell me mbrane; bacteria can learn how to resist this specific disrupting influence within ten days of being exposed to the drug. The biochem ical action of essential oils prevents this from happening; by blocking the entire cellular respiratory function, bacteria are simply suf focated. Some of the strongest anti -microbial compounds, such as the phenols thymol and carvacrol, can completely block oxygen intake in cell membranes. Essential oils not only neutralize pathogenic germs, but also help to restore and correct the underlying humoral terrain, suc h as ex- pectoration from congested mucous membranes, as well as enhancing and stimulating the immune system. Used properly, essential oils do not harm or disrupt beneficial intestinal flora. They are effective against bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungus, and yeast. Be- cause of their wide -spectrum action against pathogens and immune enhancing functions, essential oils are an increasingly importa nt alternative to antibiotic therapy. Antimicrobial Compounds in Essential Oils For safe and effective therapeutic use of essential oils it is important to have a basic knowledge of their constituents. Ess ential oils usually contain several major compounds and many more minor compounds, sometimes numbering hundreds. Researchers have identified many specific compounds responsible for the anti -microbial powers of oils; however, like other herbal preparations an d phyto -medicines, the effect of synergies is probably more biocompatible and therapeutically balanced than using an isolated acti ve ingredient. The chemical compounds in essential oils fall into two primary groups: hydrocarbons, which are mainly terpenes (monoterpenes, tones, some compounds are distinctly more anti -microbial than others, there are many adjunctive uses for the l ess potent anti -microbial oils. Terpenes Terpenes, which include monoterpenes, sequiterpenes, and diterpenes, comprise a large group of molecules found in some form i n almost all essential oils, with a wide range of therapeutic functions. Different monoterpenes have anti -inflammatory, antiseptic, antiviral and antibacterial properties; some are stimulating with a t onic effect; others are expectorant and mucous membrane stimulants and decongestants; others are atmospheric antiseptic agents. Li mo- nene, found in most citrus oils, has expectorant and antiviral actions. Pinene, found in pine, cypress, and tea tree oils and cymene, found in thyme oil, have powerful antiseptic actions. Other monoterpenes include tea tree). Sesquiterpenes have outstanding anti -inflammatory properties which can be used in conjunction with stronger anti -microbials or f or chronic inflammation following infections. The sequiterpene group contains chamazulene pe rcent sesquiterpenes. Diterpenes are rarely found in essential oils, as they are less volatile and distill only in minute amounts. The Anti -Microbial Effects of Essential Oils 16 Terpene Alcohols Terpene alcohols as a group are among the most beneficial and versatile of the essential oil compounds. They have broad spec- trum anti -infectious, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties; they also possess uplifting and energizing stimulant and tonic properties. In general they are nontoxic, non -irritating, and relatively safe. Two of the more common terpenic alcohols found in anti -microbial oils are radiata. terpenic (coriander), thyme Mentha arvensis (field mint). Phenols Phenols are among the most potent of the anti -microbial compounds. Phenols have powerful broad spectrum anti -infectious and antibacterial functions, are antiseptic and disinfectant, and have strong anti -parasitic properties. They have moderately strong tonic, stimulant, anti -viral, anti -fungal, and immune enhancing properties. Although they have excellent antiseptic properties, phenols are skin and mucous membrane irritants which can be caustic, espe- cially when used neat. Oils high in phenols should be used in low concentrations and for short periods of time, after which t hey should be replaced by others that are less potentially toxic. Three of the most important phenols from essential oils are thymol, carvacrol, and eugenol. Thymol is found in Monoterpene aldehydes are found primarily in the lemon -scented oils. This group contains oils that have anti -inflammatory, anti - infectious, anti -fungal, anti -bacterial, and disinfectant powers. These oils must be used with caution as they can cause skin ir rita- tion. Monoterpene citronellal (citronella, grapefruit, rose, melissa). Aromatic aldehydes are among the most powerful broad -spectrum anti -infectious and antibacterial compounds found in essential oils. They have moderately powerful antiviral, anti -fungal, and anti -parasitic functions, and moderately strong functions as imm une system stimulants and general tonics. They are dermo -caustic and must be diluted appropriately. Cinnamic aldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with potent anti -microbial power. It is found in oils from Cinnamomum verum or zey- landicum (Ceylon bark), Cinnamomum loureirii (Vietnamese cinna- mon bark). Other aromatic aldehydes are cuminal, found in Cuminum cyminum (cumin), and polybractea (blu e mallee eucalyptus). Ketones Ketones are some of the most toxic of the compounds found in essential oils. However, some ketone -containing oils have excellent therapeutic value, although they are not generally considered strongly anti -microbial. Some oils containing ketones aid in wound healing and dissolving mucus, some are immune system stimulants, and some are anti -fungal. They can be used effectively in con- junction with stronger anti -microbial oils. Oils such as hyssop, eucalyptus and rosemary have moderate amounts of ketones; pep- permint, spearmint, and rose geranium, which contain menthone, can be very beneficial when used properly. Esters Esters are not major anti -microbials, but they can be used in conjunction with stronger anti -microbial oils. Esters found in ess ential oils are normally very fragrant with a fruity aroma. Their therapeutic effects are balancing to the nervous system, calming, anti-The Anti -Microbial Effects of Essential Oils 17 inflammatory, and antispasmodic. An example of a well -known ester is linalyl acetate, which is found in lavender, clary sage, an d pe- titgrain. Some esters also have anti -fungal and anti -microbial properties: geranium oil, which contains geranyl acetate, and hel ichry- sum, which contains neryl acetate, possess anti -fungal properties; lemongrass oil, which contains geranyl acetate and linalyl ac etate, has been found to be bactericidal against Helicobacter pylori (see below). These components are normally gentle in their acti ons and can be used with a wide safety margin. Oxides Oils containing oxides are generally camphoraceous in nature. As a group they are considered to have only mild anti -infectious e f- fects, but they have excellent expectorant properties that can be used in conjunction with other oils. One of the most well -know n of the non -toxic oxides is cineol (eucalyptol), which is found in eucalyptus and rosemary oils; these oils combine well with phenol -rich oils such as thyme and oregano for treatment of respiratory viral and bacterial infections. In-vitro, In -vivo, and Clinical Testing An extensive amount of documentation exists for in -vitro, in -vivo animal testing, and human clinical trials using essential oils . Below is a brief sample of some of these trials, to give a general overview of the range of possibilities that essential oils have for future clinical practice, including antibacterial, antiviral, and -fungal, and acaricidal. Herpes Simplex Essential oil of Melissa officinalis (lemon balm) was found to inhibit Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV -2), indicating that the oil con- tains an anti -HSV-2 substance. (Antiviral activity of the volatile oils of Melissa officinalis L. against Herpes simplex virus N, Ozguven Koltas S.; Tropical Diseases Center, Faculty of Medicine, Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey.) UTI The antibacterial activity of essential oils extracted from Ocimum gratissimum (basil chemo -type), Cymbopogum citratus (lemon grass), and Salvia officinalis (sage) was assessed on bacterial strains derived from 100 urine samples. Salvia officin alis showed enhanced inhibitory activity, with 100 percent efficiency against Klebsiella and Enterobacter species, 96 percent agai nst Es- cherichia coli, 83 percent against Proteus mirabilis, and 75 percent against Morganella morganii. (Antibacterial activity of essential oils on microorganisms isolated tract infection; Rogrio Santos Helicobacter pylori at 0.01 percent. In in -vivo studies, the density of H. pylori in the stomach of mice treated with le mongrass was significantly reduced compared with untreated mice. Resistance to lemongrass did not develop, whereas resistance to clari thro- mycin developed under the same conditions. The researchers concluded that the essential oils are bactericidal against H. pylo ri with- out the development of acquired resistance, and since resistance to antibiotics is emerging, that these essential oils may ha ve poten- tial as new and safe agents for inclusion in anti -H. pylori regimens. (Antimicrobial activity of T, Kita M, Yamaoka Y, sufuji S, Kodama T, Kashima K, Imanishi J.; Third Department of Internal Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, 602 -8566, Japan.) Hepatitis Fifty patients with chronic hepatitis C and ten with chronic hepatitis B were treated with essential oils such as ravensare, thyme, lau- rel, niaouli, and helichrysum, either in monotherapy or combined with standard allopathic drugs (interferon for hepatitis C). In patients with HCV treated with bitherapy and essential oils, tolerance and response to treatment was improved (80 percent good toleran ce and 100 percent complete response especially for genotype 1). For patients with HCV treated with monotherapy (essential oils only ), an improvement in hepatitis was noted in 64 percent of cases. For HBV, two cures were obtained with essential oils in monotherap y. (The role of aromatherapy in the treatment of viral hepatitis; A.M. Giraud -Robert International Journal of Aromatherapy; Volume 15, Issue 4, 2005, Pages 183 -192) The Anti -Microbial Effects of Essential Oils 18 Oregano Oil Effective Against Shigella Dysentery The results of this test showed that origanum volatile oil has obvious protective effect on mice infected with two strains of Shigella, and that it had germistatic and germicidal effects on dysentery bacteria. The researchers con- cluded that Origanum volatile oil is an effective medicine against the infection of dysentery bacteria. (Experimental study on the antibacterial effect of origanum volatile oil on dysentery bacilli in vivo and in vitro; Liao F, Huang Q, Yang Z, Xu H, Gao Q.; Department of Microbiology, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Sci- ence and Technology, 430030, China.) (Tinea / Japanese researchers conducing both in -vitro and in vivo experiments found that the essential oils of cinnamon bark, lemongrass, thyme, lavender, tea tree, and citronella oils (in increasing effectiveness) had potent anti - Trichophyton actions by vapor contact. (In-vitro and in -vivo anti -Trichophyton activity of essential oils by vapour contact.; Inouye S, Uchida K, Yamaguchi Otsuka, Hachioji, Tokyo 192 -03, Japan.) Malodor of Tumor Necrosis Oils of eucalyptus and tea tree have been found to be highly effective in removing the malodor of necrotic tumors in cancer patients, thereby improving the quality of life. Necrotic neoplastic ulcers are usually superinfected with an- aerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides, Enterobacter, or Escherichia coli species. Additionally, these oils promote ulcer healing and re -epithelization. Adverse effects are uncommon and are usually limited to minor irritation at the time of application; the beneficial effects, however, have been quite pronounced. (Antibacterial Essential Oils Reduce Tumor Smell and Inflammation in Cancer Patients Journal of Clinical Oncology, Vol 23, No 7 (March 1), 2005: Scabies The acaricidal activity of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil and some of its individual active components were tested on the itch mite Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis. A five per cent concentration of the oil was highly effective in reducing mite survival times, both in vitro and in vivo. The researchers suggest that because of increased resis- tance against anti -ectoparasitic compounds, tea tree oil has a potential role as a new topical acaricide, and confirm terpinen -4-ol as the primary active component. (Acaricidal activity of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil: in var hominis to pinen -4-ol.; Walton Dougall A, Williams E, Currie BJ.; Menzies School of Health Re- search, and Northern Territory Clinical School, Flinders University, Darwin, Australia.)

The predominance of Esters and Monoterpene Alcohols in Lavender vera makes it especially useful for Rectifying the Skin and Regulating the Spirit of the Liver and Heart. The preponderance of the Esters makes it slightly Yang, a factor that is more than balanced by the presence of the Yin Monoterpene Alcohols. The Esters also help in dis- persing the Liver Qi and Relieving Pain, a function that is supported by the minor amount of Ketones, which also support the overall Yin character and target the urogenital system as well. The balance of these chemical constitu- ents makes Lavender vera the best all -purpose Lavender oil. Spike Lavender contains Monoterpene Hydrocarbons camphor and 1.8 cineole vary; Portuguese varieties have up to 70% camphor; 1.8 cineol dominates north of Provence. There are three variations of Lavender: Lavender vera, Lavender spica (or Spike Lavender), and Lavender stoechas. They can be chemically dis- tinguished from each other by the noticeable dif- ferences in their chemical proportions. Lavender vera contains Esters (50%) and Oxides (35%); while Lavender stoechas contains an even greater predominance Ketones (75%). 20 The predominance of Ketones and Oxides in Lavender spica offers the stimulating Yang properties of the Oxides together with the more Yin calming and tissue regenerating qualities of the Ketones. Spike Lavender is considered the male Lavender and, while less appreciated for its fragrant qualities, is good for fungal infections, and can be used as an antiviral expect orant for colds as well as to relax the heart in place of Rosemary camphor, which quickly turns to hypertensive in higher doses. Spike Lavender is administered primarily through the skin but also orally. Lavender Lavender stoechas brings forth the tissue regeneration and mucolytic properties together, particularly for stubborn and intense earaches. Properties Slightly bitter and pungent.

Discussion The name Lavender, or Lavendula, comes from the Latin lavare, which means, \"to wash\". The ancients used the flowers and leaves to create perfumed baths. In France, there are three species of genuine Lavender growing in the wild: Lavendula vera and Lavendula spica, each yielding very different essential oils with specific properties after distillation. The most prized quality is picked at elevations over 1000 meters. The cultivated True Lavender, the Lavendula vera, comes close to possessing the properties of genuine high -altitude wild Lavender even though it does not contain all of the same properties. While other species can be appreciated for their intrinsic qualities, they should never be confused with the \"authentic and true\" Vera, which is the most adulterated of all essential oils in France. The Lavandins are natu- ral hybrids created when the female Lavendula vera meets the male Lavendula spica at the common elevation of 700 and 800 meters. Since the Lavendula vera is so rare, it is usually replaced by cultivated clonal varieties of Lavindin, which smells similar and is difficult to distinguish from the vera by the layperson. This replacement is made commercially be- cause the yield of the Lavandins is from two to five times greater while the production cost is three to four times lower. Nevertheless, the therapeutic quality of the Lavandins is much lower than the Lavendula vera. It is essential that true lavender oil is purchased from a credible supplier who can provide a nameable source so that one can be assured that the oil has not been tampered with. In aromatherapy, Lavendula vera is thought of as the essence of the Female Yin while Rosemary bornyl is thought of as the Male Yang. Lavendula stoechas from Turkey is useful in aromatherapy even though it is not used in the perfume industry because its smell is less pleasant. It is particularly powerful for serious earaches. Although Lav- endula vera is non -toxic, it loses much of its effectiveness when used orally. Lavender is a small bush whose size ranges from two to three feet in circumference and one to two feet in height. From the roots it sends up a series of shaggy brownish -gray stalks. Each stalk splits off into several square -shaped dusky -green colored stems containing alternating pairs of leaves. As the plant flowers, these stems shoot upward in a profusion of spikes above the plant as high as the bushy part of the plant itself. It is as though the flow- erettes on these spikes burn from the lavender bush in a cool, violet, cleansing flame. The upper end of each spike contains the lavender flowers, which are arranged in groups of three, four, or five clusters. Each cluster contains eight flowerettes in four groups of two. The uppermost cluster contains an additional two flowerettes in the center to make a total of ten flowerettes in the topmost cluster. Figure 1: Lavender Flower Clusters and the Five Phases 22 It is interesting to note that in acupuncture there are ten main organs consisting of a similar arrangement of five double pairs. Five clusters of ten flowerettes makes for a possible total of fifty flowerettes per stem. The number fifty symbolizes the universe in ancient Chinese philosophical classics (Yijing). Five is the number of harmony and transformation (the Five Phases in balance). Ten is the number of completion. The number fifty, therefore, symbol- izes the Order of the Universe through the transformation of chaos into universal harmony, or the interconnection of All Things in a harmonious and orderly arrangement. Making harmonious connections with All Things is particularly important for the Shen/Spirit of the Heart. The violet color of the lavender flower further symbolizes the psycho -spiritual level of this integration. This color itself is a synthesis of polar opposites (red/hot and blue/cold). In acupuncture theory, this synthesis takes place through the Shen/Spirit, or the Spirit Essence, Jingshen, residing in the Heart. The Shen/Spirit connects with the external world in a way that is most appropriate so that the human potential of the individual can be fulfilled. Too much Yang agitates the Shen/Spirit so that it rushes prematurely into making connections while too much Yin causes it to shrivel inside and shrink back from making any connection at all. Lavender seems to especially embody the Yin -Yang harmony of the Shen/Spirit on three fundamental levels: 1. It Clears Heart Fire and opens the Mind so these connections can lead to fulfillment on the social, psycho - emotional, and biological (or circulatory) levels 2. It Rectifies the Skin and Clears Heat in the Skin and membranes so that these three levels of functions are well supported. In this way the skin and membranes can be seen as an extension of ones ability to connect through sight and touch It opens and cools the reproductive system, which is the system where the most intimate of connections are made, either between members of a loving couple, or between the mother and child when life first begins Lavendula vera is a universal oil that works for many types of people suffering from many types of problems. It is especially useful with young children, newborn babies and infants. In old Tuscany, for example, it was used to rid the \"evil eye\" in children. Today this could symbolize a combination of psycho -emotional affectations possibly due to the mothers physical or mental absence, or disharmony within the family environment. In sensitive children who struggle in making their first connections with the world, disruptions of family harmony push the child into a reaction- ary process that only serves to create more distress. Symptoms could include fear of the dark, and the grumpiness and misery associated with childhood insomnia. Lavendula vera comforts and prepares these children for sleep rather than induces drowsiness. Combinations Lavendula vera can be universally blended and brings a feminine gentleness to powerful oils like Bay Leaf and Pep- permint. Blend with Helichrysum italicum and Rosemary cineole for hematomas. Blend with Ravintsara for asthma (relaxes and helps a person breathe more easily). Blend with Peppermint for abscesses or headaches in adults. Blend with Rosemary cineole, Ravintsara, and Hyssop for lung complaints. Blend with Sage and Clary Sage for late or painful periods. Blend Spike Lavender with Petitgrain and Bay Leaf for oozing acne. Blend Spike Lavender with Rosemary cineole for rheumatism as an anti -inflammatory and efficient pain -killer.
