It is used to address a broad array of conditions. [Dr. Randy ](/meet-dr-randy-nafziger/)is certified in acupuncture, which requires 300 hours of coursework in class. He took 200 of those hours at Logan Chiropractic College and 100 through Parker University. Dr. Randy then took his board exam to become certified in the state of Ohio. Intrigued by Acupuncture's Holistic Aspect Dr. Randy was always intrigued by the wellness or holistic view of acupuncture where you're dealing with energy in the body and healing the body through energy. \"I'm not putting something into the body to fix the patient, but rather I'm assisting the body and helping it to work better,\" he said. With acupuncture, your body is healing itself and working properly. That's what intrigued Dr. Randy about acupuncture. Your body has 12 main organs, systems or meridians that circle your body. Each meridian connects to the next and it's a continuous circle throughout your body. That circle of energy takes 28.8 minutes to complete. It's a whole energy circle throughout your body. Acupuncture works by stimulating specific points on the meridian to improve the movement of the energy flow. At your first visit, Dr. Randy will have a consultation with you, asking you what you hope to achieve with acupuncture. From there, he will make a recommendation as far as what treatment plan we would do each visit. When Dr. Randy does an acupuncture treatment, he will have you lie on a table. Then he will insert the needles and then you will lie on the table for about 30 minutes. \"I want the needles to be in a patient's body for the full 28.8 minutes of the cycle so that we can free any stagnant areas,\" said Dr. Randy. According to Dr. Randy, those energy systems or meridians end up with stagnation or spots where the energy is stuck. The needles are trying to stimulate the energy flow. For the treatment, you will be on the table for about 40 minutes, including inserting the needles, the treatment and removal of the needles. We recommend that patients plan to wear comfortable clothing to appointments. You usually do not need to undress. Dr. Randy will usually working on the points from the elbows and knees down. Depending on the patient's problem, other areas of the body may be treated as well. As we are a chiropractic office, most of our patients come in with some sort of pain complaint. Here are some of the conditions that acupuncture may help: - Fertility struggles - Headaches - Hormonal imbalances - Low back pain - Sciatica - Sinus congestion Providing TCM and Taoist Acupuncture There are different theories and different practices that can be integrated. Most of what Dr. Randy will do in the office will be TCM, but he will add some Taoist philosophy, the oldest type of acupuncture. TCM was built on that philosophy. The Taoist method uses fewer needles but is sometime more effective. So What About Those Needles? The needles used in acupuncture are small and thin, nothing like needles used to have your blood drawn. You typically won't feel the needles and acupuncture isn't considered to be painful. Many people find it quite relaxing. Most of the needles would be placed on your arm, between your elbows and fingers and areas between your knees and your toes. Occasionally, Dr. Randy will put needles on your back. Depending on your ailment, he may put needles on your abdomen. Sometimes, he will put needles on the ear to include auricular acupuncture as well.
