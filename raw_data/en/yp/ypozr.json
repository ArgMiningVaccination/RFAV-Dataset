Learn more about these and other cancer-fighting foods here.", "sitename": "Medical News Today", "date": "2019-01-15", "cleaned_text": "People often talk about berries, fatty fish, walnuts, and other items as cancer-fighting foods. It means they contain nutrients that may lower the risk of developing cancer. No foods protect people against cancer completely, but some foods contain nutrients that may help reduce the risk. It is worth noting that [polyphenols](/articles/319728), [resveratrol](/articles/resveratrol-benefits), [vitamin C](/articles/219352), and other nutrients are present in many plant-based foods. Consuming a varied diet that includes the items mentioned below may help keep a person healthy and reduce their risk of cancer. This article looks at some foods that may lower the risk of cancer. It also explains the science that supports these claims. There may be some truth to the saying \"an [apple](/articles/267290) a day keeps the doctor away.\" Apples contain polyphenols that have promising anticancer properties. Polyphenols are plant-based compounds may cells while not affecting healthy cells. This polyphenol inhibits a protein called glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), which plays a role in advanced-stage cell growth in certain types of [cancer](/info/cancer-oncology/). Berries are rich in [vitamins](/articles/195878.php), minerals, and [dietary fiber](/articles/146935). Their [antioxidant](/articles/301506.php) content may mean they have health benefits. One [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570951/) [colon cancer](/articles/150496.php). Another [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24364759) [blueberries](/articles/287710.php) can prevent the growth of breast cancer tumors in mice. The authors of a [2016 research article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5187535/) There is also evidence they may help prevent or slow the development of various cancers, including breast cancer and cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. Cruciferous vegetables, such as [broccoli](/articles/266765), [cauliflower](/articles/282844), and [kale](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/270435.php), contain beneficial nutrients, including vitamin C, [vitamin K](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/219867), and [manganese](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325636). Cruciferous vegetables also contain sulforaphane, a plant compound with potential anticancer properties. One [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5577390/) Other [research](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/19/6/1754/htm) shows that sulforaphane in combination with genistein \u2014 a compound in soybeans \u2014 can significantly inhibit breast cancer [tumor](/articles/249141.php) development and size. Sulforaphane also inhibits histone deacetylase, an enzyme with links to cancer development. One review suggests [3-5 servings](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5842175/) [Carrots](/articles/270191) contain several essential nutrients, including vitamin K, [vitamin A](/articles/219486), and antioxidants. Carrots also contain high amounts of [beta-carotene](/articles/252758.php), which is responsible for the distinct orange color. Recent studies reveal that beta-carotene plays a vital role in supporting the [immune system](/articles/320101) and may prevent certain types of cancer. One [review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27823732/) [prostate cancer](/articles/150086.php). Another analysis shows that higher consumption of carrots results in a [26%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4722993/) [stomach cancer](/articles/257341.php). Fatty fish, including [salmon](/articles/307811), mackerel, and nutrients, such as [vitamin B](/articles/324856), [potassium](/articles/287212.php), and [omega-3](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/40253.php) fatty acids. One study found that people with diets high in freshwater fish had a [53%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4532991/) [colorectal cancer](/articles/155598.php) those low in freshwater fish. Another [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3629172/) [fish oil](/articles/40253) later in life may be linked to a significantly lower risk for prostate cancer. Finally, a review of data for 68,109 people found that those who consumed [fish oil supplements](/articles/when-to-take-fish-oil) at least four times a week were [63%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3961554/) According to the [American Institute for Cancer Research](http://www.aicr.org/foods-that-fight-cancer/walnuts.html), all nuts appear to have cancer-preventing properties, but scientists have studied walnuts more than other types. [Walnuts](/articles/309834) contain a substance called pedunculagin, which the body metabolizes into urolithins. Urolithins are compounds that bind to [estrogen](/articles/277177.php) receptors and may play a role in preventing breast cancer. In one animal [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4259176/) [walnuts and walnut oil](/articles/260288) had higher levels of tumor-suppressing genes than the mice receiving vegetable oil. In 2019, females with breast cancer ate walnuts for [2 weeks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6853029/) [biopsy](/articles/biopsy-for-breast-cancer) and the day of [surgery](/articles/302035). Researchers tested tumor tissue samples removed during surgery and compared them with the original biopsy results. They found signs that genetic changes had taken place, which could suggest the suppression of cancerous cell growth. [Legumes](/articles/what-are-legumes), such as [beans](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320192), [peas](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/peas-nutrition), and [lentils](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/297638), are high in fiber, which may help lower the risk of some types of cancer. One [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4350074/) Another [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5943543/) The study results indicated that people with diets high in bean fiber were 20% less likely to develop breast cancer than those who did not meet their daily fiber intake. [Resveratrol](/articles/resveratrol-benefits), an antioxidant in red grape skins, [has shown promise](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28945938/) well resveratrol, grape [also contain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7754981/) - flavonols - phenolic acids - anthocyanins (in red and purple grapes) - proanthocyanidins and other tannins - catechins Supplements can also provide nutrients and antioxidants that may help prevent cancer by reducing oxidative stress, [such as](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29210648/) [vitamin D](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/161618), and [vitamin E](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/vitamin-e). Most of the compounds listed throughout this article, such as phloretin, anthocyanin, and sulforaphane, come in pill form. Always speak with a medical professional before starting a new medication or supplement regimen. Research into preventing cancer through diet is still in the early stages and requires further testing. Scientists carried out most of the studies mentioned in cells or mice. However, it is important to remember that eating a balanced diet high in fresh fruits, vegetables, and good fats will benefit overall health.
