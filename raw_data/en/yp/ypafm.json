Your doctor may use a light and a magnifying device to examine your eyelid. Treatment In most cases, a stye doesn't require specific treatment, but using warm compresses can hasten the healing. A stye typically goes away on its own. Recurrences are common. For a stye that persists, your doctor may recommend treatments, such as: - Antibiotics. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotic eyedrops or a topical antibiotic cream to apply to your eyelid. If your eyelid infection persists or spreads beyond your eyelid, your doctor may recommend antibiotics in tablet or pill form. - Surgery to relieve pressure. If your stye doesn't clear up, your doctor may make a small cut in it to drain the pus. From Mayo Clinic to your inbox [Click here for an email preview.](https://links.e.response.mayoclinic.org/EmailPreview-GeneralHealth) Self care Until your stye goes away on its own, try to: - Leave the stye alone. Don't try to pop the stye or squeeze the pus from a stye. Doing so can cause the infection to spread. - Clean your eyelid. Gently wash the affected eyelid with mild soap and water. - Place a warm washcloth over your closed eye. To relieve pain, run warm water over a clean washcloth. Wring out the washcloth and place it over your closed eye. Re-wet the washcloth when it loses heat. Continue this for five to 10 minutes. Then gently massage the eyelid. Repeating this two to three times a day may help the stye to drain on its own. - Keep your eye clean. Don't wear eye makeup until the stye has healed. - Go without contacts lenses. Contact lenses can be contaminated with bacteria associated with a stye. If you wear contacts, try to go without them until your stye goes away. Preparing for your appointment Start by seeing your family doctor or a general practitioner if your stye is painful or doesn't start to get better in two days. In some cases, your doctor may refer you to a specialist who treats eye diseases and conditions (ophthalmologist). Because appointments can be brief, it's a good idea to be prepared for your appointment. Here's some information to help you get ready. What you can do - List any symptoms you're experiencing, including those that seem unrelated to the stye. - List key personal information you feel may be important for your doctor to know. - Make a list of all medications, vitamins and supplements that you're taking. - List questions to ask your doctor. Your time with your doctor is limited, so preparing a list of questions can help you make the most of your time together. For a stye, some basic questions to ask your doctor include: - What is the likely cause of my stye? - When can I expect my stye to go away? - Is this contagious? - What kinds of tests do I need? - Are there any treatments for my stye? - What are the benefits and risks of these treatments? - What can I do to prevent future styes? - Can I continue wearing contact lenses? - Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing me? - Do you have any brochures or other printed material that I can take with me? - What websites do you recommend? - Do I need a follow-up visit?
