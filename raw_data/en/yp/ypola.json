A lot of people do not know that these are two different things. Both of these involve a vaccine but getting vaccinated won't make you immunised. For instance, more than half of the world's population is vaccinated against COVID-19 but all are not immunised. Basically, a person becomes immunised after vaccination. Immunisation Vs. Vaccination Vaccination is the process of administering a vaccine to a person to prevent them from getting an infection or disease. Vaccines stimulate the immune system to fight against the pathogens. Immunisation, on the other hand, is the mechanism of boosting the immune system either with or without vaccination. Some people become immunised after contracting the infection or disease.

These are called antigens that make us safe against a disease/infection. Vaccines are generally given through injections but these can also be administered in the form of nasal sprays and tablets. These days, vaccines also contain DNA and RNA for effective response. Vaccination is the process of administering a vaccine and the main goal is to build an immune response to prevent and manage a disease/infection. There are so many life-threatening diseases whose vaccinations are cent percent effective in preventing the problems. These include polio and smallpox. Anyone who has got vaccinated for such diseases is completely protected and won't get these diseases ever in life. How immunisation works First and foremost, immunisation doesn't depend on vaccination. To become immunised, a person need not take a jab as immunisation against any infection or disease also occurs after contracting it. When antigens enter the body, the body develops antibodies to fight against them. The ability of the body to make antibodies decide the immunity of a person. Vaccines contain either attenuated or dead bacteria or viruses that enter the body and allow the production of antibodies. Our immune system assumes that these are antigens and so, initiates immune response. After this, the body gets equipped with the bacteria/virus and thus, gets immunised.

However, if a person is immunised against a pathogen, he is less likely to develop complications related to the disease if not fully protected against the same. In a nutshell, immunisation is more important than vaccination. A lot of people have not contracted COVID-19 or developed its severe complications despite not getting jabbed. This is because they got immunised against the Coronavirus. The risk reduces once the body has developed antibodies against a problem. Certain diseases like polio and smallpox are required to be administered during childhood to make the person immune against them. Parents must check the vaccine and immunisation schedule for kids and follow it. If you get the child immunised, you can keep your kid safe from all these "}
