It is a consensus-based guideline, taking available evidence from other guidelines, systematic reviewsand published studies into account. This second part of the guideline covers antimicrobial therapy, systemic treatment, aller-gen-speci c immunotherapy, complementary medicine, psychosomatic counselling and educational interventions, whereas therst part covers methods, patient perspective, general measures and avoidance strategies, basic emollient treatment and bathing, dietary intervention, topical anti-in flammatory therapy, phototherapy and antipruritic therapy. Management of AE must consider the individual clinical variability of the disease. Systemic immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporine,methotrexate, azathioprine and mycophenolic acid is established option for severe refractory cases, and widely available. Biologicals targeting the T helper 2 pathway such as dupilumab may be a safe and effective, disease-modifying alternative \u00a92018 European Academy 32,850 -878DOI: 10.1111/jdv.14888 JEADVwhen available. Oral drugs such as JAK inhibitors and histamine 4 receptor antagonists are in development. Microbial colo- nization and superinfection may cause disease exacerbation and require additional antimicrobial treatment.

Antimicrobial therapy In patients with AE, the inflammatory micro-milieu initiated by TSLP, IL-4 and IL-13 HBD-3.1,2This is one of the reasons why these patients are more susceptible to secondaryskin infections, which tend to generalize. 2The understanding of colonization and infection in AE has largely increased by struc-tured investigation of the human microbiome in the context of AE. Flares of AE are signicantly associated with a Staphylococcus aureus -caused loss of diversity in the cutaneous microbiome, which is not signicant if patients have followed a proactivetherapy regimen before the flare. 3 Antibacterial In up to 90% of AE patients, even the normal looking skin is exten-sively colonized by S. aureus. This bacterium is a major trigger of AE, as it leads to inflammation thro ugh the release of superantigen toxins, which enhance ation of cells, expressio n of IgE antistaphylococcal anti- bodies and as it increases expression of IL-31 which leads to pruri-tus. 4Scratching favours binding of S. aureus to the skin, and the increased amount of S. aureus -derived ceramidase aggravates the skin barrier defect. Moreover, superantigen production increasesexpression of alternative glucocorticoid receptors that do not bind to topical corticosteroids, which leads to resistance. 5Biolm forma- tion by AE-associated staphylococci most certainly also plays amajor role in the occlusion of sweat ducts and leads to inflamma-tion and pruritus. 6Recent investigations have shown that besides S. aureus the dysbalance of skin microbiome may play an impor- tant role in AE pathophysiology.7,8New developments in emollients are the incorporation of active compounds that repair the barrierfunction or influence the microbi ome of AE Vitr eoscilla liformis species. 9Ab e t - ter understanding of the skin microbiome in AE is a promising direction for the development of new treatment strategies. A systematic review of 26 studies including 1229 participants showed no clear benecial evidence of antiseptic bath additives orsoaps, or of antimicrobial agents added to topical therapies innon-infected atopic dermatitis. Nevertheless, if there is no responseto topical glucocorticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors, or evident infection, the use of topical antiseptics can be considered, and these are preferred over topical antibiotics with regard to the devel-opment of bacterial resistance. 10Sodium hypochlorite 0.005% is not only antiseptic but enhances epidermal thickness and prolifer-ation. 11Its intermittent use showed a signicant decrease in AE severity.12S y s t e m i ca n t i b i o t i c ss h o u l do n l yb eu s e di nc a s eo f apparent and extensive bacterial superinfection. On the basis ofcurrent resistance spectra, cephalexin, or another rst-generation cephalosporin can be recommended. Children with AE seem to have a much lower rate of community-acquired methicillin resis-tant S. aureus infection compared to the general paediatric popu- lation. 13In any case, treatment with emollient and corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors should be continued. Underestimated sources of bacteria are cream and ointment containers, of which up to 53% are contaminated, up to 25% withS. aureus. Thus, the following recommendations seem to be use- ful14: (i) keep open moisturizers in refrigerator; (ii) use pumps or pour bottles rather than jars; (iii) avoid direct contact with handsand decant; (iv) avoid sharing personal hygiene items. Antimicrobial textiles Silver-impregnated textiles have shown signicant antimicrobial activity, as well as improvement of local-ized SCORAD in an unblinded, side-to-side controlled clinicaltrial. uninfected AE, the use of silver-impreg- nated textile compared to cotton underwear did not reduce AEseverity. 16-18However, some functional textiles (silver-coated, acid-coated and silk textiles) as well as chitosan, a natural biopoly-mer with immunomodulatory and antimicrobial properties, may possibly improve AE manifestations, as they decrease skin colo- nization by S. aureus, and they reduce itch. 19Some of these newer options are still under investigation and there seems to be someconcern about the safety of silver-coated textiles in infants andtoddlers. AEGIS-coated silk textiles did not show clinical benet ina well-controlled, multicenter clinical trial. 20 zoster, frequently in AE patients than in healthy individuals, witha tendency to disseminated, widespread disease. 21 Eczema herpeticum (EH), a disseminated herpes simplex virus infection, is a potentially serious complication of AE thatrequires immediate medical action. Patients, mostly children,present with disseminated vesicles, fever and lymphadenopathy and can develop complications such as keratoconjunctivitis, meningitis and encephalitis. Predisposing factors of EH areearly onset of AE, severe or untreated forms of AE, laggrindeciency and high total serum IgE level. 21Pretreatment with topical corticosteroids does not seem to imply an increased riskof developing EH, whereas topical calcineurin inhibitor may doso and should be discontinued immediately. 22Mainstay of EH therapy is a systemic treatment with aciclovir or valaciclovir, in a majority of cases administrated intravenously.23Treatment should be started immediately once the clinical diagnosis ismade. 24 Varicella-zoster virus (VZV ) infection in an immunocompe- tent child is usually a mild, self-limited disease. This infection is,however, known to facilitate secondary local or systemic bacte-rial infection, which is cause for particular concern in AE chil-dren. Earlier studies demonstrated the safety and efcacy of VZV vaccination in these children who appear to benet from this vaccination. 25Moreover, in children with AE, common childhood immunization in the rst year is not associated withan increased risk of more severe AE or allergic sensitization; alsoimmune response to VZV vaccine is comparable to healthy chil-dren. 26Therefore, parents of atopic children should be encour- aged to fully immunize their children. \u00a92018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology II 853Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV ) infection is in general benign and self-limited, but in patients with AE dissemination is frequentand therefore treatment is recommended. A large variety of topicaltreatments have been reported such as cantharidin, potassiumhydroxide, tretinoin cream, topical cidofovir and others. 27Physical therapies including cryotherapy and curettage are also effective, but not always well tolerated in paediatric patients.28Topical treatment of AE with TCS may be continued during MCV infection. Eczema vaccinatum (EV) is a complication of smallpox vaccina- tion known to occur in AE patients. The vaccinia virus dissemi-nates and causes an extensive rash and severe systemic illnesswith a mortality rate estimate at 5 -40%. 29Therefore, smallpox vaccination is contraindicated in patients with a history of or currently active AE.30The existence of an attenuated vaccine and three antiviral drugs, in addition to vaccinia immunoglobulin,provides means of preventing or treating EV. 31,32Should a smallpox outbreak necessitate an emergency mass vaccination,the choice of vaccination strategies, such as ring or mass vaccina-tion, has to be determined by policymakers. Eczema coxsackium (EC) is a disseminated form of Coxsackie virus infection mostly occurring in children with active AE lesions. The Coxsackie virus A6 strain leads to atypical disease manifestations, which are classied as diffuse form (lesionsextended to the trunk), acral form (lesions with a mainly acraldistribution) or eczema coxsackium (disseminated lesions onpre-existing eczematous areas). 33Symptomatic treatment includes use of topical steroids and wet wrap therapy.34,35 Regional vaccination programmes should be followed by all AE patients as recommended. The denial of vaccination because of diagnosed AE is a misconception possibly leading to fatal con- sequences (see chapter: general measures). Antifungal Despite its role as a commensal on healthy human skin, Malasse-zia spp. is attributed a pathogenic role in AE, as it may interactwith the local skin immune response and barrier function. Theprecise mechanisms by which Malassezia spp. may contribute to the pathogenesis of AE are not fully understood and remain to be elucidated. 36Several randomized, placebo-controlled trials investigated the benet systemic antifungal treat-ment for AE patients. 37,38The ambiguous results of these clinical trials might be attributed to a selection bias. It can be speculatedthat antifungal therapies are more effective in certain subgroupsof AE. It seems, for example, that antifungal therapy shows bene-cial effects in patients with a head -neck-type distributed AE and detectable IgE-mediated sensitization against Malassezia. 39 It has also been shown that sensitization against this skin-colo- nizing yeast can correlate with disease activity.40The most common class of antifungal drugs prescribed for AE patients areazoles such as ketoconazole and itraconazole which (fluconazole oritraconazole) should be prescribed instead of ketoconazole for systemic treatment. In summary, antifungal treatment witheither topical ketoconazole or ciclopirox olamine or systemicitraconazole or fluconazole can be considered for those patientswho suffer from head -neck dermatitis, particularly for those who are characterized by clear IgE sensitization to Malassezia spp. Summary of evidence Oral antibiotics have no benet on the skin condition in AEas long as skin lesions are not obviously superinfected. (1b)A Cochrane review showed no clear benecial in non-infected AE. Topical glucocorticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors reduce the colonization rate of S. aureus in AE. Antiseptic textiles have a moderate clinical effect on AE. (2b)AEGIS-coated silk garments do not show clinical benet overstandard care (2b).VZV vaccination is may be efcient in some AE patients, mainly in those suffering from the 'head and neck' variant of AE or with demonstrated IgE sensitization to Malassezia spp. (2b) Recommendations \u0081A short course of systemic antibiotics, such as cephalos- porin, may be considered in AE patients clinically infected with S. aureus . (2b, B) \u0081The long-term application of topical antibiotics is not recommended due to the risk of increasing resistancesand sensitizations. (2, D) \u0081Treatment with topical antiseptic drugs -including antiseptic baths e.g. with diluted sodium hypochlorite - should be considered, if clinical signs of bacterial super- infection are present. (4, C) \u0081Treatment with topical antiseptic drugs -including sodium hypochlorite 0.005% baths -may be considered treatment-resistant, chronic course ofAE. (2b, B) \u0081Eczema herpeticum should be treated without delayusing systemic antiviral therapy, such as systemic aci-clovir. (4, D) \u0081VZV vaccination is recommended for children withatopic dermatitis. Parents of atopic children should beencouraged to fully immunize their children. (2a, B) \u0081Topical or systemic antifungal therapy may be effectivein some AE patients, mainly in those suffering from the'head and neck' variant of AE or with demonstrated IgEsensitization Malassezia Oral glucocorticosteroids used in many Europeancountries for treatment of AE. Well-known side-effects limit their useespecially for long-term treatment (see Table 4). Funding of expensive clinical trials in the near future is unlikely. Controlled clinical trial data demonstrating efcacy. There is one controlled trial available that demonstrates lower efcacy oftherapy with systemic prednisolone compared to cyclosporine insevere adult AE patients. 41Broad experience from clinical use by many experts indicates some efcacy, as well as prompt reboundafter withdrawal. Summary of evidence Short-term treatment with oral glucocorticosteroids is mod-erately effective. (1b)Systemic steroids have a largely unfavourable risk/benetratio for treatment of AE. (1b) Recommendations \u0081Short-term (up to 1 week) treatment with oral gluco-corticosteroids may be an option to treat an acute flarein exceptional cases of AE. Restrictive use, largely lim-ited to adult patients with severe AE, is recommended.(/C0,D ) \u0081The daily dose should be adjusted to and not exceed 0.5 mg/kg bodyweight. ( /C0,D ) \u0081Long-term use of oral glucocorticosteroids in AE patients is not recommended. The indication for oralsteroids in children should be handled even more cau-tiously than in adults. ( /C0,D ) Cyclosporine A Cyclosporine is licensed in many European countries for treat- ment of AE and is therefore considered to be the rst-line optionfor patients with severe disease who require systemic immuno-suppressive treatment (see Figure 1). Controlled clinical trial data demonstrating ef cacy Cyclosporine vs. placebo. A meta-analysis and review of pooled data from 15 RCTs42clearly demonstrated the efcacy of cyclosporine in AE with a 55% improvement on average after 6 -8 weeks of treat- ment. Body surface area, erythema, sleep loss and glucocorticos-teroid use were reduced in the cyclosporine group. Cyclosporineis more effective than placebo, but there is often prompt relapse ifcyclosporine is stopped. All scores are back to pretreatment values8 weeks after the end of cyclosporine therapy in most patients.Cyclosporine dose nding study for AE treatment in adult patients. A xed-dosage cyclosporine regimen was evaluated in 106 adults with severe AE. 43Initial treatment was performed with 300 mg/day or 150 mg/day and reduced after 2 weeks to50% of the initial daily dose until a nal evaluation was per- formed after 8 weeks. Clinical efcacy was detectable after 2 weeks in both treatment groups, but the higher dose was sig-nicantly more effective ( P<0.05). The authors recommended to start therapy with 150 mg/day, because this regimen showed alower incidence of serum creatinine increase. It is recommendedtoday to start with a higher dose of 4 -5 mg/kg/day to obtain a good initial result unless the patient is old or suffers from rele-vant concomitant diseases. 44Some patients may tolerate low- dose cyclosporine therapy for a longer time than the usually rec- ommended therapy length of 2 years.45 Continuous or intermittent cyclosporine therapy study of AE groups showed signicantly better results in clinical scores and quality of life assessments. Enhanced sustained improvement was seen in the continuously treated group. As the intermittent therapy was sufcient in some patients but associ-ated with a lower cumulative cyclosporine dose, the authorsrecommendedchoosingtheregimenonanindividualbasis. Cyclosporine or UV therapy for AE. Cyclosporine was tested against a combined UV/UVB regimen in a 1 year, open-label,multicentre trial involving 72 patients. 47Cyclosporine therapy induced a signicantly higher number of days in remission, as compared to UV therapy. Compounding of cyclosporine. Micro-emulsions of cyclosporine show an earlier onset and higher peak value of efcacy comparedto traditional formulations. 48The clinical efcacy evaluated after 8 weeks of therapy was, however, identical for both formulations. Drug safety prole of cyclosporine. Patients receiving cyclosporine should be monitored for blood pressure and renal parameters, ascyclosporine is known to induce structural and organic kidneydamage. Nephrotoxic effects are more likely to occur if the dailydose exceeds 5 mg/kg bodyweight, serum creatinine values areelevated or elderly patients are treated. Life vaccination is con-traindicated during cyclosporine therapy. Summary of evidence Many RCTs indicate the efcacy of cyclosporine vs. placeboin AE. (1a)Cyclosporine is also effective in children and adolescent AEpatients. (2b)Self-willed reduction in the recommended cyclosporine dosemay reduce the clinical efcacy of cyclosporine and is notrecommended. (2b) \u00a92018 Dermatology and -part II 855A micro-emulsion of cyclosporine has the advantage of an earlier onset and peak level of clinical efcacy, which may beuseful in short-term treatment. (1b)Long-term intermittent cyclosporine therapy for 1 year ismore effective than an intermittent UVA/UVB therapy fol- lowing a 2 -3 times weekly regimen. (1b) Recommendations \u0081Cyclosporine may be used in chronic, severe cases of AE in adults. Treatment should not exceed a 2-yearcontinuous regimen. Careful monitoring for potential severe side-effects must be performed. (1a, A) \u0081Cyclosporine may be used (off label) in children and adolescent patients showing a refractory or severecourse of disease. A detailed patient monitoring, espe-cially of the renal status, is advisable. (2b, B) \u0081The duration of cyclosporine therapy is guided by clini-cal efcacy and tolerance of the drug. Both short-termand long-term therapies may be useful in AE. ( /C0,D ) \u0081Common side-effects of cyclosporine (e.g. nephrotoxic- ity, hypertension) argue against a long-term treatmentof AE with cyclosporine. Therefore, an interval of 3 - 6 months is usually recommended. ( /C0,D ) \u0081Cessation of therapy or switch to another systemic drug should be attempted after 2 years of therapy, althoughmany patients tolerate much longer therapy with low-dose cyclosporine. ( /C0, D). \u0081An initial daily dose of 5 mg/kg/day, divided upon two single doses, is recommended. A dose reduction of 0.5 - 1.0 mg/kg/day every 2 weeks is recommended, onceclinical efcacy is reached. ( /C0,D ) \u0081Dose reduction should be considered according to clinical efcacy. Long-term treatment prescribing the lowest clini-cally useful dose may be advisable in selected cases. ( /C0,D ) \u0081Since an intermittent-dosage regimen (e.g. 'weekend lead to lower cumulative doses of cyclos- porine and is effective in some AE patients, an individu-alized dosage regimen is recommended for underagepatients. ( /C0,D ) \u0081Cyclosporine trough levels do not need be assessed routinely during therapy. ( /C0,D ) \u0081Although there are no controlled studies available regarding the efcacy of vaccination during cyclospor- ine therapy, there is no evidence for a failure during cyclosporine either. Hence, a cessation of therapy of2 weeks before and 4 -6 weeks after vaccination may be advisable. Clinically, there is no evidence for this rec-ommendation. ( /C0,D ) \u0081A combination therapy of cyclosporine with UV ther- apy is not recommended, and effective UV protectionshould be used. ( /C0,D )Azathioprine (AZA) Azathioprine is used (off label) for many years for treatment of AE in adult patients. Funding of expensive clinical trials in thenear future is unlikely. Controlled clinical trial data demonstrating ef cacy Efcacy of AZA was tested in a randomized, controlled, 6-month, crossover clinical trial involving 37 patients aged 17 -73 years.49The drop- out rate was high (12 patients on AZA, 4 patients on placebo).AZA (2.5 mg/kg/day) or placebo was given for 3 months each ina crossover design. The SASSAD skin severity score was reducedby 26% in the AZA group and 3% in the placebo group(P<0.01). Pruritus, sleep loss and fatigue improved signi- cantly during AZA, but not during placebo treatment. Another randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12 weeks, clinical trial involved 63 outpatients with AE. 50Follow- ing a low-dose introduction phase, azathioprine was dosed in 42patients according to the results of a thiopurine methyltransferase(TPMT) polymorphism, which may be indicative for the myelo-toxicity of azathioprine -the other 21 patients received placebo. Patients with a normal TPMT activity were treated with 2.5 mg/kg/day AZA, whereas patients with a reduced TPMT activity (heterozygous phenotype) received 1.0 mg/kg/day AZA. The AZA regimen was more effective in AE, as the disease activity droppedby 37% in the azathioprine group and by 20% in the placebogroup. None of the patients showed myelotoxic symptoms. A prospective, randomized controlled trial showed equal clin- ically relevant improvement of AZA 1.5 -2.5 mg/kg/day com- pared to methotrexate 10 -22.5 mg/week after 12 weeks of treatment in adults with severe AE. Both treatments were safe in the short term. 51 Twelve children with severe, recalcitrant AE were treated with oral AZA and followed prospectively. AZA therapy was associ-ated with clinical improvement in all but one patient. Therewere few adverse effects. 52 A retrospective, uncontrolled study investigated 48 children and adolescents aged 6 -16 years diagnosed with severe AE.53 After 3 months of therapy, 28 patients showed very good and 13 patients showed good improvement of their symptoms, while seven patients showed little or no improvement. None of thepatients showed myelotoxic symptoms, TPMT activity wasdetermined in all patients before treatment. All patients werestarted on 2 mg/kg/day AZA, and the dose was increased to3 mg/kg/day in 14 patients due to insufcient clinical response.The mean time to achieve clinical response was 4 weeks. A retrospective, uncontrolled study in a heterogeneous group of 17 children and adults with a mean age of 16 years showed signicant improvement of SCORAD after 3 and 6 months ofAZA, and signicant reduction in total serum IgE levels. 54 Safety pro le of azathioprine The authors of the Berth-Jones study concluded that AZA would be an effective and clinically \u00a92018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology JEADV 2018, 32,850 Wollenberg et al.useful drug for treatment of severe AE, but would be associated with a high rate of unwanted drug effects.49Leucocyte counts and liver enzymes must be controlled during therapy. The higherdose caused gastrointestinal symptoms in 14 patients; leukopae-nia in two and elevated liver enzymes in eight patients. Long- term efcacy and safety data in AE patients are sparse, but AZA increased the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer and lymphomain inflammatory bowel disease patients. 55 Summary of evidence AZA is effective for treatment of severe AE in adults. (1b)One small prospective clinical trial in children showed ef-cacy of AZA. 4 Recommendations \u0081AZA may be used (off label) in adult AE patients, ifcyclosporine is either not effective or contraindicated.(1b, A) \u0081AZA may also be used (off label) in children. (4, C) \u0081Patients should be screened for TPMT activity beforestarting AZA therapy to reduce the risk for bone mar-row toxicity by dose adaptation. The suggested doserange is 1 -3 mg/kg bw/day. (1b, A) \u0081Alternatively, an initial AZA dose of 50 mg/day in adults and a slow increase in the dose under close mon-itoring of full blood and liver function count is possible.(/C0,D ) \u0081In pregnant women, AZA should only be used on strict indication. ( /C0,D ) \u0081AZA should not be combined with UV therapy, and effective UV protection should be used. ( drug licensed in many European countries for the treatment of sys-temic lupus erythematosus and prevention of transplant rejec-tion.Controlled clinical trial data demonstrating ef cacy There is one controlled trial with enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) vs. cyclosporine A as long-term treatment showing almost equal efcacy.56Some case reports or uncontrolled clini- cal trial data from adults indicate that it would be clinicallyeffective in AE. 57,58There is one uncontrolled retrospective report involving 14 children indicating efcacy in this age group,with MMF 40 -50 mg/kg/day in younger children and 30 - 40 mg/kg/day in adolescents 59and another including 12 chil- dren.60A xed dose of 2 g MMF per day for adults is common practice in Europe.24 Drug safety pro le of MMF Gastrointestinal adverse events such as nausea or diarrhoea are the most relevant side-effect ofMMF. They are most common during initiation of treatmentand tend to disappear during long-term treatment. Leukopaeniaor thrombocytopenia may also occur. Recent data indicate thatMMF should be discontinued 6 weeks before a planned preg- nancy. 61 Summary of evidence Positive case reports and uncontrolled clinical trial data indi- cate that MMF may be effective in AE.4 There is no randomized clinical trial data for use of MMF inchildren or adolescents. ( /C0) teratogenic substances. (3a) Recommendations \u0081MMF may be used (off label) for treatment of AE inadults in a dose up to 3 g/day, if cyclosporine is noteffective or not indicated. (4, C) \u0081MMF may be used for treatment of AE in children or adolescents. (4, C) \u0081As MMF and EC-MPS are both teratogenic, men and women of childbearing potential must use effective con-traception during therapy. (3a, B) Methotrexate (MTX) The immunosuppressant MTX is frequently used in psoriasis,but there are little published data on its use in AE. Some clini-cians have used this drug in AE with good responses since manyyears. MTX can be given by oral, intravenous or subcutaneousTable 1 Grades of evidence 1a) clinical trials (RCTs) 1b) Single RCTs 2a) Systematic review of cohort studies 2b) Single cohort studies and RCTs of limited quality 3a) Systematic review of case -control studies 3b) Single case -control study 4) Case series, case cohort studies or cohort studies of limited quality Recommendations (see Table 2) were classi ed based on the grade of evi- dence.Table 2 Classi cation of strength of recommendation Recommendation 1a, 1b B 2a, 2b, 3a, and Venereology JEADV atopic eczema -part II 857application. Funding of expensive clinical trials in the near future is unlikely. Controlled clinical trial data demonstrating ef cacy A random- ized trial with MTX vs. Azathioprine showed comparable effectsin severe AE. 51 Forty children with severe AE were randomly assigned to receive either methotrexate 7.5 mg weekly or cyclosporine2.5 mg/kg daily for 12 weeks. At week 12, patients in the methotrexate group had a mean reduction in SCORAD which was not statistically different from the cyclosporine-treatedgroup. Both drugs were associated with minor adverse effects,none of which required changing the treatment regimen. 62An open 24-week dose escalation clinical trial involving 12 adult patients investigated the efcacy of increasing doses MTX.63The starting dose of 10 mg/week was increased weekly in steps of 2.5 mg/week until clinical efcacy was seen. The skinscore SASSAD improved by 52% after 24 weeks. The mediandose administered was 15 mg MTX/week. Improvementremained stable in nine patients 12 weeks after end of treatment. An uncontrolled, retrospective report involving 20 adult AE patients treated with 10 -25 mg/week MTX showed response in 16 patients after 8 -12 weeks. 64First improvement was observed after a period ranging from 2 weeks to 3 months (mean9.95 weeks /C63.17). Treatment was more effective in adult onset AE than in childhood onset.Table 3 Language of recommendations Wording in standard situations Free text explanation Must be used This intervention should be done in all patients, unless there is a real good reason not to do it Should be used Most expert physicians would do it this way, but some would prefer other possible action May be used It would be correct to do this intervention, but it would also be correct not to do it; the choice depends largely on the speci c situation Is possible Most expert physicians would do something else, but it would not be wrong to do it May be used in selected patients only This intervention is not adequate for most patients, but for some patients there may be a reason to do it Is not recommended Most expert physicians would not choose this intervention, but some speci c situation may justify its use Must not be used This intervention is inadequate in most situations Table 4 Systemic drugs for treatment of severe atopic eczema Cyclosporine Methotrexate maintenanceCan be used long term++little toxicity Outdated Long-term maintenance Time to respond (weeks) \u00a7 28 -12 8 -12 8 -12 1 -24 -6 to relapse (weeks) blood pressure \"Haematological liver enzymes \" gastrointestinalHaematological liver enzymes \" gastro-intestinalHaematological skin infections gastro- intestinalCushing 's diabetesConjunctivitis g/day)0.2-0.5 mg/kg/day 600 mg loading dose Maintenance dose adult 2.5 -3 mg/kg/day Most often 15/week; canincrease to max (EC-MPA 1.44 g/day)Not for maintenance 300 mg/2 weeks Starting dose children 5 mg/kg/day 10 -15 mg/m 2/week 25 -50 mg/day MMF 20 -50 mg/kg/day 0.2 -0.5 mg/kg/day No data yet Maintenance dose children 2.5 -3 mg/kg/day Increase 2.5 -5 mg/ week, decrease 2.5 mg/week toeffective/lowest effective dose2-3 mg/kg/day Increase daily total dose by 500 mg every 2-4 weeks up to 30-50 mg/kg/dayNot for maintenance No data yet Pregnancy Possible Teratogenic, absolutelycontraindicatedConflicting data, possible withstrict indicationTeratogenic, absolutely contraindicatedPossible No data yet Fathering Possible Little information, conflicting data, contra-indicatedLittle information, possible with strictindicationConflicting data Possible No data yet TPMT heterozygote 1 -1.5 mg/kg/day.

At week 12, patients in themethotrexate group had a mean reduction in SCORADwhich was not statically different from the cyclosporine-trea-ted group. Both drugs were associated with minor adverseeffects, none of which required changing the treatmentregimen. 62 Safety pro le of MTX All available drug safety data for MTX are largely derived from clinical experience from other low-doseindications for MTX, indicating liver toxicity and teratogenicityas main areas of concern. There are no AE-specic safety dataavailable for MTX. Summary of evidence An open, uncontrolled clinical trial, as well as broad clinical experience, indicates that MTX may be effective in AE.4 MTX is a teratogenic substance. (3a) Recommendations \u0081MTX may be used (off label) for treatment of AE in both adults and children. (4, C) \u0081The recommended dosing regimen is similar or slightlylower compared to psoriasis. (D, /C0) \u0081As MTX is teratogenic, men and women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during ther-apy. (3a, B) Biological agents Biological agents (biologics) have been used in dermatology formore than 10 years for other inflammatory skin diseases, espe-cially psoriasis, but so far only one registered biologic for AE isavailable in Europe. Biologics present a relatively new group oftherapeutics created by using biological processes that includerecombinant therapeutic proteins such as antibodies or fusion proteins. Biologics specically target inflammatory cells and/ormediators, respectively. In AE, biologics may be helpful in reducing inflammation by modulating the number, activation and function of immune cells or the action of cytokines or dis-ease relevant antibodies. Several case reports, pilot studies andretrospective analyses on the effect of biologics in patients withmoderate-to-severe AE refractory to topical and/or systemictherapy have been published, and randomized, placebo-controlled studies evaluating the efcacy and safety of a few bio-logics in AE are now available. Approved biologic therapy Dupilumab Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks the common a-chain of the receptor for inter- leukin-4 and interleukin-13, has been approved as rst-linetreatment for moderate-to-severe adult AE in the USA inMarch 2017 and in Europe in September 2017. Dupilumab has previously shown efcacy in patients with asthma and elevated eosinophil levels and now also in AE. 65Randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled trials involving adults AE were performed. In 4-week monotherapystudies, dupilumab resulted clinicalparameters. Side-effect proles were andmostly mild side-effects were observed. In a 12-week double- blind study where topical corticosteroids were combined with dupilumab or placebo, the group treated with dupilumab hadsignicantly better effect on both AE activity and pruritus. 65 The positive outcome for dupilumab-treated moderate-to-severe adult AE patients was conrmed in a double-blind, pla-cebo-controlled study involving 380 randomly assigned to dif-ferent dosages of dupilumab or placebo. 66Recently, the two identical phase III SOLO studies in adults have completed the clinical development programme for dupilumab, again con- rming the efcacy of dupilumab monotherapy on skin signsand symptoms, and overall improvement of the QoL in AE. Asignicant proportion of patients achieved an IGA score ofclear and almost clear and at least a 75% improvement in EASIscore. 67The LIBERTY AD CHRONOS studies indicateTable 5 Upcoming systemic drugs for treatment of atopic eczema Substance code Target PF-03893787)H4R H4R blocker II See full text. \u00a92018 Academy of Dermatology and Venereology JEADV -part II 859maintenance of efcacy over 1 year of continued treatment with dupilumab.68The safety prole of dupilumab was good, with conjunctivitis being the only adverse event that wasobserved more frequently with dupilumab than with placebo.In view of all trials published so far, about 1/3 of all treated patients are clear or almost clear in IGA from their AE. Up to 70% of patients achieve an EASI 75 or higher skin improve-ment, and it takes about 4 weeks to reach the full clinical out-come. Skin signs, QoL and symptoms including pruritussignicantly improved as early as 2 weeks after treatment initia-tion. Several ongoing studies involving both children and ado-lescents will show if these subgroups of the AE population mayexperience equally positive effects, expanding the treatment indication for dupilumab even further. Summary of evidence A number of large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials indicate that dupilumab is effective in AE, with theresponse maintained for at least 1 year of continuous treat-ment in the majority of patients. (1b)Dupilumab-treated AE patients did not show systemic side- effects in clinical studies, but showed a higher incidence of conjunctivitis. (1b) Recommendations \u0081Dupilumab is recommended as a disease-modifyingdrug for patients with moderate-to-severe AE, in whomtopical treatment is not sufcient and other systemic treatment is not advisable. (1, a) \u0081Dupilumab should be combined with daily emollients and may be combined with topical anti-inflammatorydrugs as needed. (2, b) Upcoming biologic therapy Nemolizumab Nemolizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti- body directed against the IL-31 receptor A, has shown ef-cacy in patients with moderate-to-severe AE. 69There was a signicant improvement in the primary endpoint pruritus, aswell as in the objective signs of the AE with, however, lessefcacy. Nemolizumab is currently not approved for anyindication (see Table 5). Summary of evidence A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial indicates thatnemolizumab is effective in treating pruritus in AE patients.(1b)Nemolizumab-treated AE patients did not show systemicside-effects in clinical studies, but showed a higher incidenceof peripheral oedema. (1b)Off-label use of other traditional biologicals Rituximab The depletion of B cells by an anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab (2 91000 mg), resulted in a rapid reduction in skin inflammation in all patients with a sustained effect over 5 months in ve of six patients. These results may suggest a pathogenic role of B cells in AE, although CD20 may also play arole in some DC-T-cell mediated reactions. 70A report on two cases of severe AE receiving rituximab could not conrm thesendings. 71 Mepolizumab Inflammation in AE is characterized by a T helper 2 cytokine expression including interleukin (IL)-5 and eosinophil inltration. Upon with the anti- IL-5 antibody mepolizumab (2 9750 mg), a moderate improvement of clinical symptoms was observed, although arapid depletion of eosinophils in the peripheral blood wasnoted. 72The patients were not stratied for eosinophilia in this study. Mepolizumab had no effect on atopy patch test reac-tions. 73Based on the promising results in AE and the experi- ences in bronchial asthma therapy, long-term trials with anti-IL-5 antibodies are now performed. Omalizumab Most AE patients have elevated serum IgE levels, but the pathogenic role of IgE in AE remains unknown. In a pla-cebo-controlled study in 20 patients, omalizumab administeredfor 16 weeks failed to improve AE symptoms and itch despite adepletion of free serum IgE and reduction in IgE receptor satura-tion. 74Other studies reported that accompanying AE signi- cantly improved receiving omalizumab because of severe bronchial asthma.75-77First explorative open-label trials did not indicate good efcacy.78An open-label study on 20 adult patients with severe AE has indicated an increased efcacy ofomalizumab in patients laggrin status and treated withomalizumab for 12 -68 months showed signicant improvement of their AE. 80By contrast, a recent small, randomized, trial including eight children with severe treatment refractory AEtreated for 24 weeks with omalizumab or placebo showed nosignicant clinical differences between the two groups 81and this was conrmed in another similar study.82In summary, the data concerning omalizumab are conflicting, and omalizumab cannotbe recommended for treatment of AE. Ustekinumab pathways, which are report-edly active AE. Results regarding the use of ustekinumab insevere AE have, however, been conflicting and only case reportshave been published so far. Some have reported signicantimprovement of AE, 83and some have not.84The rst two ran- domized controlled trials comprising 79 and 33 patients in total \u00a92018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology JEADV 2018, 32,850 -878860 Wollenberg et al.have been completed, and results are quite uniform showing no signicant decrease in severity scores.85,86 Other substances Some older biologics such as infliximab or efalizumab, which are outdated for use in atopic dermatitis or withdrawn from the market, are not discussed anymore in this version of the guideline. On the other hand, a number of highly interesting substances are in progress and may soon be registered for treatment of AE.Therefore, the committee decided to produce a table in theaddendum on potential new biologics or small molecules for AE'in the pipeline', which will be continuously updated by theguideline committee (Table 5). Substances to be included in this table will be, among others, the anti-IL-13 antibody tralok- inumab, the anti-TSLP antibody tezepelumab and the Januskinase (JAK) inhibitor upadacitinib. Summary of evidence None of the traditional biologics has been approved forthe therapy of AE in Europe. At present, the use of tradi-tional biologics in AE should be tried only in patients with severe AE refractory to other topical and/or systemic treat- ment. Besides the lack of efcacy and safety data in AE,the potential side-effects must be taken into accountbefore using biologics. On the other hand, treatment withbiologics may provide important information on patho-genetic mechanisms in AE. Today, the imminent availabil-ity of Th2-blocking biologics has further reduced theclinical need for therapy with traditional bio- logics. ( C) of AE with mepolizumab may be tried inselected cases unresponsive to standard therapy. ( /C0,D ) Other systemic treatment Alitretinoin Alitretinoin is a binding both retinoid and rexinoid receptors, thus delivering anti-inflammatory and antiprolifera-tive effects. It is licensed in some European countries forthe treatment of chronic hand eczema irrespective of itspathogenesis. Controlled clinical trial data demonstrating ef cacy There is one large, multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled clinicaltrial involving 1032 patients with chronic hand eczema, about one-third of which are probably atopic hand eczema patients.87 Improvement of eczema symptoms was seen in 75% of thepatients. The response rate of hyperkeratotic hand eczema(49%) and pulpitis sicca type patients (44%) than the dyshidrosiform subtype of hand eczema (33%). The patient group suffering from atopic hand eczema has not been analysedseparately, and extrapalmar symptoms have not been assessed inthis trial. Six patients with AE and prominent hand involvement have been treated with alitretinoin for 12 weeks in an uncontrolled,open-label trial. 88Palmar and extrapalmar lesions improved during the trial, as shown by the mTLSS hand eczema score and the SCORAD. Drug safety pro le of alitretinoin As alitretinoin is highly ter- atogenic, all females of childbearing potential must adhere toa strict birth control programme. Headache is the most fre-quent clinical side-effect of alitretinoin especially in the rst2 weeks of treatment. Serum lipid and TSH elevation mayalso occur. Summary of evidence Direct evidence from an uncontrolled clinical trial, as well asindirect evidence from a large, double-blind, placebo-con-trolled clinical trial indicates that alitretinoin may be effectivein eczema. 4 Alitretinoin is a teratogenic substance. ( /C0) There are no trial data for its use in children or adolescents. (/C0) Recommendations \u0081Alitretinoin may be used for atopic hand eczema in adult patients of non-childbearing potential unrespon-sive to topical steroid therapy. (1b, A) \u0081Alitretinoin might lead to an improvement ofboth extrapalmar and hand lesions in a small-molecule phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhi-bitor that has been approved for the treatment of psoriasisarthritis moderate-to-severe plaques of the regula-tory cytokine IL-10. A pilot study investigating the effect ofapremilast in patients with moderate-to-severe AE has demon- strated moderate improvement of skin lesions, and \u00a92018 Academy of Dermatology and Venereology atopic -part II 861QoL,89but the drug development programme of apremilast for AE has been stopped. Recommendations \u0081Apremilast may be used in selected cases unresponsive to standard therapy for treatment of AE. ( /C0,D ) Tofacitinib So far only one trial with the oral JAK inhibitor tofacitinib citrate has been performed in six patientswith moderate-to-severe, treatment refractory AE. After 8 - 29 weeks of treatment, they had a mean SCORAD reduction of 66%. No adverse events were observed. 90 Recommendations \u0081There is not enough evidence to support the use oftofacitinib in AE. (4, C) Immunoadsorption Immunoadsorption (IA) has been used in patients with AE andhigh serum IgE levels based on the assumption that a reductionin IgE might result in a reduction in disease activity. An investi-gator initiated open-label pilot study in patients with severe AErecalcitrant to topical and systemic therapy showed that IAresulted in a signicant decrease in SCORAD 3 weeks after the rst cycle of 5 IA and a further improvement after the second cycle 1 month apart, and in parallel a reduction in skin-boundIgE. 91A recent study conrmed these results and showed long- term clinical effect of IA in AE patients.92Another pilot study in severe AE showed a benecial effect of immunoadsorptiontogether with subcutaneous application of omalizumab; theserum levels of free IgE and the SCORAD decreased signi-cantly. 93 Recommendations \u0081Immunoadsoption might be considered for patientswith severe AE and high serum IgE levels if the technol-ogy is available. (4, C) Mast cell stabilizers Mast cell stabilizers inhibit mast cell degranulation and thus pre-vent the release of histamine and other mediators. Oral cro-molyn, ketotifen and pemirolast are used for asthma and otherallergic diseases, but have not shown any signicant effect forthe treatment of AE. In the last 5 years, studies investigating these substances in AE have not been published. Recommendations \u0081Mast cell stabilizers are not recommended for the treat- ment blocks the action of LTD4, LTC4 and LTE4. It has been used atdoses of 10 mg daily (5 mg/day in children below 12 years), with some reduction in SCORAD indexes. 94,95A systematic review stated that limited evidence exists to recommend mon-telukast for the treatment of AE. 96Studies on leukotriene antag- onist zarlukast for the treatment of AE have not been reportedin the last 5 years. Recommendations \u0081There is not enough evidence to support the use of leu- kotriene substances, but not as immunosuppressiveagents. IVIG have been tried for both adults and children with severe, treatment refractory AE, but clinical trials did not indi- cate a high efcacy or quick onset of action despite the high costof treatment. 97,98IVIG may be considered as a last resort treat- ment in severe, treatment refractory AE in children only. It islikely that the availability of novel biologics for AE may furtherreduce the indication for IVIG in AE. Recommendations \u0081The use of IVIG in AE is not recommended. (4, D) H1R-blocking antihistamines Traditional histamine 1 receptor (H1R)-blocking antihistamineshave been used for decades, in an attempt to relieve pruritus inpatients with AE. However, only a few randomized controlled trials have been conducted and they have in the majority shown only a weak or no effect in decreasing pruritus. 99-104According to a Cochrane search, clemastine fumarate, doxylamine and dimetindenemaleate may allow better pattern in acute situations with exacer-bations of AE (evidence level D). Concerning the newer non-sedating antihistamines, studies using loratadine, cetirizine or fexofenadine demonstrated no or only a weak relief of pruritus in AE. 106-108A signicant, but clinically small, antipruritic effect of fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily has been described.109An effect on itch of a high dosage of 20 -40 mg cetirizine daily has been observed, but this effect was primarily attributed to seda-tion. 107 The corticosteroid sparing effect of cetirizine in infants with severe AE has been attributed to its decreasing effect on pruritus.110A recent study reported a benecial effect of the non-sedating H1 antihistamine olopatadine decreasing nocturnal quality. 111Possible mechanisms of action of second-generation antihistamines are a reduction in theurticarial component of AE, blocking histamine interac-tion with bradykinin, proinflammatory cytokine produc- tion 112. In general, antihistamines are safe to use, also for a long per- iod of time,113and the major advantage seems to be relief of the symptoms of comorbidities such as allergic asthma, rhinocon-junctivitis, urticarial dermographism and urticaria. Topical anti-histamines have no effect on itch beyond that of their coolingvehicles. H4R-blocking antihistamines Among the 4 histamine receptors described in humans, the his-tamine 4 receptor (H4R)-blocking antihistamines represent anadditional promising treatment for AE. 114Clinical trials have been performed with H4R-blocking agents, but the results arenot published yet. Recommendations \u0081There is not enough evidence to support the general useof both rst- and second-generation H1R antihistami-nes for treatment of in These may be triedfor treatment of pruritus in AE patients, if standardtreatment with TCS and not sufcient.(1b, A) \u0081Long-term use of sedative antihistamines in childhood may affect sleep quality and is investigated for treatment of and the two relevant therapeutic regimensare subcutaneous immunotherapy of allergen-specic in AE has been shown in a number of case reports and smaller cohort studies,115,116and more recently in a larger multicenter trial with subcutaneous house dust mite immunotherapy.117 These data showed that ASIT can be used for treatment ofallergic rhinitis or mild asthma also in AE patients, since theAE was obviously not worsened and sometimes even improvedduring or after ASIT. A few prospective studies have been per-formed which address the question if AE alone may be an indi- cation for ASIT. Even if the results of the studies are interpreted very care- fully with regard to the therapeutic effects of ASIT, it isremarkable that exacerbations of the skin disease during treat-ment were rare, while the treatment was well tolerated inmost patients. The same was true for studies in patients withcoexistent AE who were treated with ASIT for respiratory ato-pic diseases and experienced not more often flares of eczema- tous skin lesions. The role of allergens in the pathophysiology of AE has been proven in controlled studies on allergenavoidance and atopy patch testing. 118-120In respiratory atopic diseases, ASIT plays an important role not only for treatment,but also for the prevention of further sensitizations and pro-gress to more severe respiratory disease (change from rhinitisto bronchial asthma). Hypothetically, patients with a positive atopy patch test and corresponding history of eczema flares may be candidates for ASIT with the eliciting allergen. The performed studies point tothe safety of ASIT also in AE, if the treatment is performedaccording to the guidelines. However, the nal judgement onthe efcacy of ASIT in this diagnosis is still not possible due tothe lack of large, controlled and randomized clinical trials withmodern allergen vaccines. 116 Evidence from controlled clinical trials Experience in a pair of monozygotic twins with AE (with springand summer exacerbations) treated either with grass pollen ASITor placebo in a double-blind fashion showed signicantimprovement and decrease in serum IgE in the patient treatedwith ASIT. 121Several open uncontrolled study designs also demonstrated advantages of ASIT in patients with AE, and thesedata were often published in national or non-anglosaxon jour- nals. Some investigators in the 1970s and 1980s also showed improvement of AE in controlled trials. 116 Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) trolled trial Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus in chil- dren with AE failed to demonstrate superiority over placeboafter a standard 8-month course of treatment with tyrosine- \u00a92018 Academy of Dermatology and Venereology atopic eczema -part II 863adsorbed house dust mite extracts in 24 house dust mite-allergic children with AE.122However, in a second study phase children were randomly allocated to continue with active treatment orplacebo for a further 6 months. The placebo effect was high, andthe numbers were too small to permit condent conclusions, but the clinical scores suggested that prolonged ASIT may be effective with regard to several objective parameters of AEseverity. 122 A small placebo-controlled study showed AE improvement in 13 of 16 ASIT-treated AE patients, whereas only 4 of 10placebo-treated AE patients improved. 123Similar results were reported for AE lesions under ASIT with house dust miteextracts. 124,125Oral ASIT for D. pteronyssinus was not effective in a controlled study enrolling 60 children with AE which were followed for 3 years.126Conventional efcacy, with drug reactionsoccurring in 15 -20% of both groups. 127A controlled study applying SLIT with house dust allergens was performed in 56children with AE aged 5 -16 years, but the outcome of this intervention was positive only in patients with mild to mod- erate AE, but not with severe AE. 128 A pilot study reported the improvement of AE together with changes in T-cell subpopulations induced by IFN gamma pre-treatment before ASIT with house dust mite allergens. Patientsreceiving placebo, IFN gamma only or ASIT only showed notreatment effect. 129 A large randomized, assessor-blinded clinical trial investi- gated 89 patients with AE showing a sensitization to house dust mite (CAP-FEIA 4).117Patients were injected weekly with three different doses of HDM allergen extract. Withhigher allergen doses, a benecial SCORAD decrease occurredafter 8 weeks compared to a control group with an 'activeplacebo' consisting of very low allergen dose. The effect wasmaintained over 1 year and was accompanied by lower gluco-corticosteroid use. A smaller DBPC study involving 20 patients with HDM- or grass pollen sensitization also showed objective and subjective symptom relief accompanied by immunological changes underASIT. 130 Another large, randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study investigated 168 adult AE patients for 18 months. Thestudy did not reveal efcacy in the AE patients studied, but asubgroup analysis showed statistical signicance of SCORADreduction in subgroup of severe AE patients with SCORAD >50. 131Longer treatment duration was associated with higher efcacy. The best outcome was observed duringSeptember to February, which may be due to the use of indoorheating and subsequent high HDM exposure. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized con- trolled trials published until December 2012 assessed theefcacy of immunotherapy for AE. Eight randomizedcontrolled trials that comprised a total of 385 subjects were analysed. It has been found that ASIT has a signicant posi-tive effect also signicant long-term treatment severe atopic dermatitis 4.27; 95% CI, 1.36 -13.39). This meta-analysis moderate level evidence for the efcacy of SCIT inAE. However, these ndings are based on an analysis of asmall number of patients, with considerable heterogenicityamong trials. 132 Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) A rst 18 months, placebo- controlled study investigating the effects of SLIT on AEfound a signicant decrease in the SCORAD starting frommonth 9. 128 Another study analysed 107 patients undergoing SLIT for 12 months. A total of 84 patients nished the trial, compared tothe placebo group (53.85%), and the treatment group (77.78%)showed improvement in symptoms. 133 Another group of authors has investigated SLIT in AE patients allergic to HDM in a murine model.134The mouse model induced by Der f allergen extract reflected the typical hallmarks of AE in humans. In the Der f allergens-sensitized mice, SLIT treatment with Der f vaccine signicantly inhibited AE symp- toms through correction of Th2 and Th1 cytokine predomi-nance; therefore according to the authors, SLIT couldbe considered as an alternative treatment for patients with extrinsic AE. Summary of evidence There is conflicting evidence regarding ASIT in AE, with more recent literature being more in favour of it. ASIT mayhave positive effects in selected, highly sensitized patientswith AE. (2a)The best evidence so far is available for ASIT with house dust mite allergens. (2a) There is no contraindication for performing ASIT in patientswith respiratory allergic diseases (allergic rhinoconjunctivitis,mild allergic bronchial asthma) and concomitant AE. (2b) Recommendations \u0081ASIT is currently not recommended as a general treat-ment option for AE. (2a, B) \u0081ASIT may be considered for selected patients withhouse dust mite, birch or grass pollen sensitization, who have severe AE, and a history of clinical exacerba- tion after exposure to the causative allergen or a posi-tive corresponding atopy patch test. eczema: adult \u0081 For every phase, additional therapeutic options should be considered \u0081 Add antiseptics / antibiotics in cases of superinfection \u0081 Consider compliance and diagnosis, if therapy has insufficient effect \u0081 Refer to guideline text for restrictions, especially for treatment marked with 1 \u0081 Licensed indication are marked with 2, off-label treatment options are marked with 3 SEVERE: SCORAD with topical tacrolimus 2 or class II or class III topical glucocorticosteroids 3, wet wrap therapy, UV therapy (UVB 311 nm, medium dose UVA1), psychosomatic counseling, climate therapy Reactive therapy with topical glucocorticosteroids class II 2 or depending on local cofactors: topical calcineurin inhibitors 2, antiseptics incl. silver 2, silver coated textiles 1 Educational programmes, emollients, bath oils, avoidance of clinically relevant allergens (encasings, if diagnosed by allergy tests)(a) Treatment recommendation for atopic eczema: children \u0081 For every phase, additional therapeutic options should be considered \u0081 Add antiseptics / antibiotics in cases of superinfection \u0081 Consider compliance and diagnosis, if therapy has insufficient effect \u0081 Refer to guideline text for restrictions, especially for treatment marked with 1 \u0081 Licensed indication are marked with 2, off-label treatment options are marked with 3 SEVERE: SCORAD >50 / or 3, mycophenolate mofetil 1,3 Proactive therapy with topical tacrolimus 2 or class II or III topical glucocorticosteroids 3, wet wrap therapy, UV therapy (UVB 311 nm) 1, psychosomatic counseling, climate therapy Reactive therapy with topical glucocorticosteroids class II 2 or depending on local cofactors: topical calcineurin inhibitors 2, antiseptics incl. silver, silver coated textiles Educational programmes, emollients, bath oils, avoi- dance of clinically relevant allergens (encasings, if dia-gnosed by allergy tests)(b) Figure 1 Treatment recommendations for adults (a) and children (b) with atopic eczema. \u00a92018 European Academy of Dermatology and II 865Complementary and alternative medicine in atopic eczema There is evidence of growing interest of so-called complemen- tary alternative medicine (CAM) as treatment for AE.135-137 CAM has been dened as 'diagnosis, treatment or prevention which complements mainstream medicine by contributing to a common whole, by satisfying a demand not met by orthodoxy or by diversifying the conceptual frameworks of medicine'.136 This chapter summarizes available RCT-based evidence on CAMfor AE. Essential fatty acids The most commonly used preparations in the treatment ofAE are polyunsaturated fatty acids, evening primrose oil (EPO), borage oil (BO), or animal and sh oil. A systematic review published in 2016 showed conflicting results onEPO. 138-141Four smaller trials,142-145as well as two larger tri- als146,147and an Indian study on EPO148also gave conflicting results. Negative results were obtained in a trial on eicosapentaenoic acids from Germany.149 A study from Berlin compared the daily administration of 5.4 g docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in 21 patients who com- pleted the trial with an isoenergetic control of fatty acids(N=23) over 8 weeks. The SCORAD dropped signicantly in the DHA group, however, signicant differences to control werenot observed. 150 In a comparison of dietary hempseed oil with olive oil, some parameters of skin physiology and symptoms improved underhempseed oil, but obviously without signicant difference to the control group. 151 A RCT in 20 hospitalized patients with AE comparing infu- sions of sh oil to soya bean oil revealed marked improvementswithin 1 week in both groups but a signicantly greater effect inthose treated with sh oil. 152Some smaller RCTs have also indi- cated a benecial effect,153-155although the largest and well reported trial did show a difference between the sh oil and theplacebo. 156 Evening primrose oil has also been used as topical treatment. Although a pilot study has indicated some benecial effects,157 further studies were unable to establish a dose -response rela- tionship.158Additional studies could not prove a benecial effect on skin barrier function.159Large trials on that issue, however, are lacking. In one pilot study, the addition of gamma-linolenic acid to emollients was able to decrease elevated TEWL in atopic eczema.160 The most recent Cochrane review on EPO and BO included 19 studies on EPO and 8 on BO.161The authors concluded that EPO and BO lack effect on AE and that further studies would behard to justify.Summary of evidence There is partly conflicting, mostly negative evidence regard-ing the efcacy of oral or topical applications of unsaturatedfatty acids in the treatment of AE. (1a) Recommendations \u0081Oral application of unsaturated fatty acids rec-ommended for of AE. A) \u0081Topical application of unsaturated fatty acids as in emollients may be tried in selected cases.(D,/C0) Phytotherapy Detailed background information on herbal therapy in derma- tology is published.162Two RCTs investigated the efcacy and safety of topical chamomile preparation163and a hypericum extract cream for AE.164 The chamomile cream was mo derately superior to 0.5% hydrocortisone cream regarding pruritus, erythema anddesquamation, but not differe nt to the vehicle cream. The cream containing hypericum ex tract standardized to 1.5% hyperforin was compared to the corresponding vehiclecream in a half-side comparison in 18 patients with mildto moderate AE. The modied SCORAD index improvedover 4 weeks with both therapies, but the improvement was signicantly higher under active treatment. A further study compared a topical preparation of Mahoniaaquifolium, Viola tricolor and Centella asiatica with thevehicle patients and could not nd signicantdifferences. 165A subgroup analysis revealed superiority of the plant preparation under dry and cool weather condi-tions. Plant extracts are well known to induce contact sensitisation and subsequent contact allergy. 166,167It was demonstrated that so-called phytocosmetic creams containing a mixture of plantextracts may also contain triamcinolone acetonide as an activeingredient. 168 The concerns regarding side-effects of phytotherapy with crude plant extracts must not be generalized toemollients containing protein free oat plantletextracts. 169,170(see section 'Emollients plus' in chapter 'Basic therapy'). Summary of evidence Besides many negative results, there is only one small RCT indicating a benecial effect of hypericum cream as a topicalphytotherapy. (1b)Topical use of crude plant extracts may cause contact sensiti-zation and contact dermatitis. (1a, A) \u00a92018 Wollenberg et al.Recommendations \u0081Topical use of crude plant extracts is not recommended for treatment of AE. (1b, C) Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) Chinese herbs are part of the traditional Chinese medicinewhich consists of Chinese herbs administered orally or topi-cally, acupuncture, diet and exercise. 171,172CHM is promoted as treatment for AE, taken orally as decoction, usually consist-ing of about 10 different herbs. The rst positive RCTs ofCHM in the treatment of AE outside China were publishedby Sheehan in 1992. 173Serious adverse effects including fatal hepatitis have been reported by independent investigators fol- lowing these trials.171,174 -176Further trials on Zemaphyte/C226,a commercial product of Chinese herbs, revealed conflictingresults. 177,178 The oral application of a combination of Eleutherococcus, Achillea millefolium andLamium album was not superior to pla- cebo after 2 weeks.179 The most recent Cochrane review on CHM included 28 studies encompassing 2306 patients.180When compared to placebo, CHM showed higher clinical effectiveness (RR 2.09,95% CI 1.32 -3.32) in two studies. The total effectiveness rate in CHM groups was found to be superior (RR 1.43, 95% CI1.27-1.61) when compared to conventional therapy in 21 studies. The authors assessed most studies at high risk of biasand found substantial inconsistency between studies. There-fore, it was concluded that there is no conclusive evidence that CHM could reduce the severity of AE. A similar result was achieved by the systematic review of Tan and co-work-ers. 181The most recent RCT showed signicant effects of CHM on SCORAD and QoL scores when compared to theplacebo group. 182 Summary of evidence There is no conclusive evidence to support the use of Chinese herbs in the treatment of AE. (1a) Recommendations \u0081The use of Chinese herbs is not recommended for treat- ment of AE. (1a, A) Acupuncture/Acupressure Acupuncture has been studied considering allergen-induced itchas primary endpoint but not systematically or within random-ized controlled trials as a treatment for AE. Case series ofpatients including those with AE indicate some benecial effects but studies implying a rigorous methodology are needed. 183-186 There is initial evidence from a small pilot trial that acupressure might be helpful in reducing pruritus and lichenication in AEpatients. 187 Summary of evidence There is absence of evidence to support the use of acupunc-ture or acupressure in the treatment of AE. ( /C0) Recommendations \u0081The use of acupuncture or treatment One RCT intramuscular re-injection of 1 - 3 mL autologous blood over 5 weeks to the injection of theequivalent amount of sterile saline solution. 188Patients were recruited via press advertisement and nally 30 subjects par-ticipated. Over a 9-week period, AE severity measured bySASSAD dropped signicantly in the verum group from23.2 to 10.4 and did not change in the placebo group(21.0 -22.5). Signicant differences were not observed in health related quality of life and the subjective assessment of pruritus skin appearance and sleep quality. The data suggesta benecial effect of autologous blood therapy with respectto the signs score. This nding should be conrmed in lar-ger trials and different settings. Summary of evidence There is very limited evidence supporting the use of autolo-gous blood therapy in the treatment of AE. (2b) Recommendations \u0081The use of autologous blood therapy is not recom-mended for the treatment of AE. (2b, B) Bioresonance One RCT has been published so far, comparing bioresonancewith a sham (inactive pseudo-) procedure in 36 children withAE attending a specialized rehabilitation unit in Davos, Switzer- land. 189After 4 weeks, AE severity had improved in both groups with slight superiority of the active group but without statisticalsignicance. Further studies under more usual outpatient condi-tions are needed. \u00a92018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology atopic eczema -part II 867Summary of evidence Current evidence from a single trial does not indicate a sub- stantial clinical effect of bioresonance for treatment of AE.(2b) Recommendations \u0081The use of bioresonance for treatment of AE is not rec-ommended. (2b, B) Homoeopathy Homeopathy is a system of alternative medicine created in1796 by Samuel Hahnemann, based on his doctrine of likecures like. Large case series illustrating the therapeutic bene-ts of homeopathy have been published as papers orbooks. 190,191A recent uncontrolled trial of 17 patients with longstanding AE in Japan revealed a marked improvementafter the introduction of homoeopathic treatment. 192A clas- sical randomized placebo-controlled trial was initiated in Germany including 60 patients,193showing no difference between placebo and verum homeopathy in the outcome ofAE. 194 Summary of evidence There is absence of evidence to support the use of homeopa-thy in the treatment of AE. (2b) Recommendations \u0081The use of homeopathy is not recommended for treat-ment of AE. (2b, B) Massage therapy/aroma therapy The effect of additional massage therapy for AE, applied dailyfor 20 min over a 1 month period compared to standardtherapy alone, was investigated in a randomized trial in 20children. 195Greater degrees of improvement in anxiety scores, tactile defensiveness and coping index were reported by par-ents of children in the active group. Furthermore, clinicalsigns such as scaling and excoriation improved signicantly inthe massage group. Appropriate statistical comparisons between groups, however, were not performed. A further small crossover trial in eight children compared massage withessential oils (aroma therapy) to conventional massage. 196 Both treatment groups improved signicantly without signi-cant differences between groups. Given the small sample size,conclusions on the benecial effects of additional aroma ther-apy cannot be drawn.Summary of evidence There is insufcient evidence to support the use of massage/aroma therapy in the treatment of AE. 4 Recommendations \u0081The use of massage/aroma therapy is not recommendedfor treatment of AE. (4, C) Salt baths and thermal spring water balneotherapy Salt bath has been used for a long time to control chronicinflammatory skin diseases, especially psoriasis. Based on thisexperience and anecdotal evidence, salt was recently recom-mended also in the treatment of AE. The efcacy of saltbath alone, however, has not been studied systematically inAE. In the current reports, salt baths were investigated aspart of a complex climatotherapy or in combination withUV therapy. 197-204From these studies, it cannot be con- cluded that salt baths provide a consistent and signicant clinical effect on AE. Conventional balneotherapy with orwithout synchronous UV therapy has been shown to beeffective in AE but was not considered as CAM in thischapter. Balneotherapy with thermal spring water has beenshown to be benecial in children with mild to moderateAE with an effect similar to mid-potency topical corticos-teroids. 205 Summary of evidence There is insufcient evidence to support the use of salt bathsin the treatment of AE. 4 Cohort studies indicate that thermal spring water balneother-apy with or without phototherapy may be effective in mild tomoderate AE (2a, 2b) Recommendations \u0081The use of salt baths is not generally recommended fortreatment of AE. (4, C) \u0081Thermal spring water balneotherapy may be consideredin mild to moderate AE (B, 2a, 2b) Vitamins and minerals A total of six trials were identied investigating vitamins orminerals in the treatment of AE. 206-211A placebo-controlled study from Italy studied oral vitamin E (400 IU) in 96patients. 210Greater clinical improvement was reported for the vitamin E group but without results of statistical tests. Similarly, a smaller study of 49 patients comparing vitaminE plus vitamin B2 to vitamin E or vitamin B2 alone \u00a92018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology JEADV 2018, 32,850 -878868 Wollenberg et al.revealed a superiority of the combination treatment with respect to the physician's assessed overall usefulness andglobal rating. 208A further trial in 60 adults with AE com- pared selenium or selenium plus vitamin E vs. placeboover a 12-week period. 207The AE severity score fell in all three study arms without signicant differences. A Hun- garian study compared multivitamin supplementation in2090 to supplementation in2032 pregnancies over a 17-month period. 206AE occurred more frequently in the multivitamin group (0.7% vs.0.2%). Although this unexpected result could be a chancending as suggested by the authors, detailed studies inthe prospective setting are needed. A small trial has inves- tigated the zinc supplementation vs. placebo in 15 chil- dren over a 2-month period. 212The severity score increased in both study groups without signicant differ-ences. There is one published RCT comparing pyridoxine(vitamin B 6) vs. placebo in 41 children over a 4-week period.209The median severity score increased in the pyri- doxine group, whereas an improvement was observed inthe placebo group. None of the differences were statisti- cally signicant. Following a pilot study on vitamin D, 211more RCTs on that subject were published recently. Thereby vitamin Dsupplementation showed statistically signicant improve-ment in clinical scores in 20, i.e. 60 adults 213,214and 107 children,215whereas another trial in 60 adults failed to prove signicant effects by vitamin D supplementation.216 Vitamin D supplementation of mothers during lactation did also not improve facial eczema in 164 children stud- ied.217A further RCT in 45 adults patient showed equal and signicant reduction in the SCORAD score by vitaminD or E supplementation (34.8%, 35.7% resp.) and an evenhigher reduction by the combination of both vitamins(64.3%). 218 Summary of evidence There is preliminary evidence that vitamins, especiallyvitamin E and D, may be useful in the treatment of AE.(1b) Recommendations \u0081There is not enough evidence to recommend vitaminsupplementation for routine use in AE patients. (2b, B) Topical vitamin B12 in avocado oil There are two smaller studies with half-side comparisons, whichindicate a mild benecial effect of a preparation containing0.07% vitamin B12 in avocado oil compared to a placebo prepa-ration. 219,220Summary of evidence There is preliminary evidence that a topical preparation ofVitamin B12 in avocado oil may be useful in the treatment ofAE. (2b) Recommendations \u0081There is not enough evidence to recommend topicalpreparations of Vitamin B12 in avocado oil for routineuse in AE. (2b, B) Harms of CAM Contrary to widespread assumptions of the public, CAM is notfree of side-effects. Dietary regimens involving strong restric-tions can lead to harmful sequels in terms of malnourishment.Therapeutic procedures involving organic material from plantsor animals can be associated with severe toxic or allergic reac-tions. Finally, patient's and parent's adherence to assumingly effective CAM may delay or hinder a severely affected patient's access to effective or even lifesaving therapy. Psychosomatic counselling Psychological and emotional factors influence the clinicalcourse of AE, which is mirrored in the German term 'neuro-dermitis'. Interventions including patient education, eczemaaction plans, and a quick return for a follow-up visit improve adherence. 221The reason for treatment failure in more than one-half of patients referred to specialist centres is that thetreatment is not being administered. Doctors often haveinsufcient time to educate patients and their caregivers aboutthe correct application of ointments and creams, and thisadversely affects compliance. Many countries have patientorganizations and support groups that provide useful supple-mentary literature. 222 Poor adherence to treatment Poor adherence to treatment is a major factor limiting treatmentoutcomes 223and may have different causes: stress can elicit sev- ere exacerbations of eczematous skin lesions.224-226The itch- scratch cycle is especially vulnerable to psychological influences and can show a tendency to self-perpetuation.227-229Psychoso- matic disease in the sense of anxiety or depression can be a comorbidity of AE.228,230Intrafamiliar psychodynamics are also well-known factors influencing the clinical course of AE.231,232 Educational interventions A Cochrane review analysed ten RCTs of psychological oreducational interventions, in addition to conventional therapy,for AE in children. 233One study of a psychological interven- tion used biofeedback and hypnotherapy as relaxation tech- niques vs. discussion only. Three of the four educational \u00a92018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology JEADV II 869studies identied signicant improvements in disease severity in the intervention groups. The fourth trial evaluated long-term outcomes and found a statistically signicant improve-ment ( P<0.01) in disease severity and parental quality of life over 12 months in all studied age groups (3 months to 18 years). Heterogeneity in outcome measures and inadequate methodology limited data synthesis in this review. The psy-chological and educational interventions were delivered bynurses or multidisciplinary teams. 234Quality of life (QoL) is severely impaired in AE patients,235as shown in a recent review: Statistically signicant improvements in QoL of AEpatients by patient education were reported in ve studies,whereas the severity of skin disease improved signicantly in three studies of ten studies evaluated. In conclusion, patient education appears to be effective in improving QoL and inreducing the perceived severity of skin disease. 236-238(See chapter: Educational interventions for AE). Psychotherapeutic approaches Most psychological training programmes include relaxationtechniques, 239habit training for social competence and commu- nication as well as coping behaviour and improvement of self- control with regard to disrupting the itch-scratch cycle. Psychosomatic counselling Randomized controlled trials compared the use of topical corticosteroid alone with steroidstogether with a behavioural therapy programme which led to asignicantly pronounced improvement of skin condition anditch-scratch behaviour. 240 Behavioural therapy Behavioural therapy against itch was stud- ied, showing a signicant improvement in symptoms after1 year. 241-243Especially habit reversal techniques improve itch in atopic dermatitis.244 Autogenic training Together with cognitive behavioural ther- apy was studied in a standardized educational programme (see chapter 'Education').245 Relaxation Relaxation methods may be more effective in reduc- ing disease severity than discussion only.246 Parents who had negative treatment experiences in the past and possessed only poor coping abilities with regard to scratchcontrol benetted the most from the training programme. Theoutcome of the education measure was independent of parents' schooling, vocational level and income. 247Another publication stated that there is currently only limited research evidence onthe effect of educational and psychological approaches whenused alongside medicines for the treatment of childhoodeczema. 233It is well possible that there is limited research activity in this area of intervention, thus providing limited evidence ofthe measurable effects of interventions.Summary of evidence Psychosomatic counselling can be a helpful adjuvant proce-dure in the management of patients with AE including psy-chotherapeutical approaches and behavioural therapytechniques. (3b) Relaxation techniques may cause signicant improvements in disease severity. (1a)Individual psychotherapeutic approaches can be helpful inindividual patients. ( /C0) Psychological and psychosomatic interventions are an essen-tial and helpful part of educational programmes. (1a) Recommendations \u0081Psychosomatic counselling, psychotherapeuticalapproaches, behavioural therapy techniques, autogenictraining, relaxation psychological psy-chosomatic interventions are recommended in selectedpatients. (1a, A) \u0081The indication should be conrmed by specialists in the eld of psychodermatology. ( /C0,D ) Educational interventions for atopic eczema Adherence to treatment and poor quality of life (QoL) are key issues in patients with AE.248Patient education (PE) interventions can help patients and their families to better understand their disease and cope with treatment in order to maintain or even improve QoL and treatment adherence.The aim of PE is not simply to provide information byleaflets in the waiting rooms, but entails the transfer ofskills (e.g. self- management of the disease, treatment adap-tation) from a trained healthcare professional to the patientor their parents. Additionally, PE should aim to reducedoctor's visits, facilitate a better partnership between the doctor and the patient/parents and restore family dynamics. PE should also lead to a decrease in the long-term costs ofAE treatment. A recent study showed that parents withnegative treatment experiences in the past and poor copingabilities regarding scratch control benetted most from PEprogrammes. 247 High-quality PE programmes should ideally be evidence- based, tailored to a patient's individual educational and cultural background (rather than being standardized in form and content) and have well-dened content andactivities. 233,236,249 Educational service delivery models There are different types of PE programmes running allaround the world. These differ in number and certicationof the educators, number of participants, age of patients, teaching techniques, duration and frequency of \u00a92018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology JEADV 2018, 32,850 Wollenberg the content of the PE pro- grammes varies greatly, comparison between studies is dif-cult. For example, while the intervention by Staab 237entailed 2-h sessions, involving a trained multidisciplinary team, oncea week for 6 weeks, the intervention by Shaw et al. 251 involved a trained medical student running a single 15-min session. Most of the published intervention programmes arestructured as follows: Multidisciplinary age-related structured group training educa- tional programmes (eczema school) There is evidence that structured age-related programmes are signicantly improvingseverity score, improving coping behaviour, parents handling their affected children and increasing disease knowl- edge. 237,241,252 -255A recent multidisciplinary eczema school pro- gramme tailored to the adult situation showed also highefcacy. 238 Eczema workshops Eczema workshops may improve the dis- ease severity of patients with AE.256,257There is also a greater adherence to eczema management (coping behaviour, parent's handling their affected children) in the eczema school, compared with the standard dermatologist-led clinic.254 Nurse-led eczema workshop There is evidence that the bene- ts of nurse interventions are the reduction in the severity of thecondition and the better use of topical therapies. There is areduction in referrals to general practitioners or dermatologists,disease knowledge and self-management techniques are improv- ing. 254,256,258,259The relative of nurse-led pro- grammes multidisciplinary age-related, structuredprogrammes is unclear. Structured lay-led self-management education training pro- grammes They lead to a small statistically signicant reduction in disease status (pain/ itch, disability, fatigue) and a small, sta-tistically signicant improvement in depression and psychologi- cal well-being but there was no difference in quality of life. 260 There is no evidence that such programmes improve psychologi- cal health.261,262 E-health during follow-up of patients with AE E-health intervention follows the initial diagnosis and treatmentwith face-to-face contact. This is just as effective as usual face-to-face care with regard to quality of life and severity of disease. However, when costs are considered, e-health is likely to result in substantial cost savings. Therefore, e-health is a valuable ser-vice for patients with AE. 263,264 Forms of educational intervention tools Depending of cultural backgrounds and healthcare systems, awide variety of tools are used in PE programmes (practicaldemonstrations sessions as florescent cream advices, 265written action plans,266lectures, question and answer sessions, leaf- lets, online videos) but there is no evidence that a specictool is more efcient than another. 233 Summary of evidence PE programmes for AE in children and adults are efcientand established already in many countries. The multidisci-plinary age-related structured group training educationalprogrammes (eczema school) have the most evidence-basedbenet. (1a)Eczema workshops lead to an improvement in severityscores, there is greater adherence in eczema management, itch-scratching cognition, and there is additional psychologi- cal benet. (2a, 2b)Nurse-led programmes result in more effective use of topicaltherapies. (3b)Nurse-led programmes result in an improvement of severityscores. (2a)Nurse-led programmes may be sparing doctor's time.(2b) There is some evidence that a direct-access, online model for follow-up dermatologic care is equivalent to classical in-person care for patients with AE. (2a)There is no evidence of change in severity scores due to lay-led self-management education programmes, which haveweak effect in improvement although the disease knowledgeis increasing ( /C0) Recommendations \u0081PE programmes for AE in children and adults are rec- ommended as an adjunct to conventional therapy ofAE. (1a, A) Conclusion and outlook The complex pathophysiology of AE explains why the thera-peutic strategies also comprise multiple aspects and are com-plex in nature. Although there is a strong geneticpreposition, patients with AE must not be desperate. Label-ling AE as 'incurable' is not correct, since the eczema with its symptoms can very well be treated and may disappear totally. Adequate treatment needs the cooperation of thewell-informed patient with the physician and time; educa-tional programmes are extremely helpful. In the recent past, new medications resulting from immunological research have been licensed for AE. Theappearance of biologics specic for immune mediators andreceptors is extremely promising and will be available soon for patients in many European countries and the rest of the world. \u00a92018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology JEADV and skin infections atopic Med 2002; 1109 -1122. 3 Kong HH, Oh J, Deming C et al.
