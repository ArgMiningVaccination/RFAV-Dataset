Here's a complete breakdown so you can decide which holistic approach is best for you.", "sitename": "Rahav Wellness", "date": "2021-12-08", "cleaned_text": "Our society is becoming more and more focused on more comprehensive and root-cause oriented approaches to health care. We want to be in control of our own health through the use of natural healing options, a healthy diet, herbal and nutritional supplements, and the medical professionals we choose to partner with. Clearly, the \"pill for an ill\" approach of the current healthcare model is not impacting our health trajectory, as evidenced by the ever increasing burden of chronic disease on our lives (and budgets). That's why personalized medical care is being called the future of healthcare. It fulfills our need to take charge of our own health and work in partnership with an evolving and visionary generation of health professionals. You've probably heard the terms \"integrative\" or \"functional\" medicine, but you're not really sure what they mean. The first thing you need to know is that integrative and functional medicine both work to promote the body's natural healing response, they simply use different strategies to get there. In essence, integrative medicine seeks to address the individual as a whole and applies many different therapies to achieve wellness. Functional medicine uses the latest in research and nutritional and laboratory science and knowledge-gathering to further create personalized treatment plans that address the root cause of illness. But of course, there's much more to it than that. Today we're going to demystify the similarities and differences between integrative medicine vs functional medicine to help you decide which personalized approach is best. The Origins of Integrative Medicine What is integrative medicine? What is alternative medicine? What is holistic medicine? What is functional medicine? These terms can be confusing and are often used interchangeably. To understand these terms and shed light on them we need to look at things from a more historical perspective. Once upon a time, humans in families or in groups would use the natural world around us to try and solve problems of dis-ease. Healing traditions are diverse and organically come from the place and time where people developed strategies to treat the problems they confronted. There was no separation between the mind and the body. For example, in Chinese medicine, organs are taught as housing seats of emotion. In Chinese medicine the liver houses anger, the spleen houses worry, the kidney houses fear, and the lungs grief. In the textbook Integrative Medicine, Dr. David Rakel and Dr. Andrew Weill, both prominent leaders in the field, review a history of integrative medicine. They describe the split between mind and body as a key defining moment to understand how we have these paradigmatic differences between modern medicine as we know it and integrative medicine. \"It was not until the 1600s that a spiritual mathematician became worried that prevailing scientific materialistic thought would reduce the conscious mind to something that could be manipulated and controlled. Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596-1650), respecting the great unknown, did his best to separate the mind and the body to protect the spirit from science. He believed that mind and spirit should be the focus of the church, thus leaving science to dissect the physical body.\" This philosophy led to the \"Cartesian split\" of mind-body duality. Shortly afterward, John Locke (1632-1704) and David Hume (1711-1776) influenced the reductionist movement that shaped our science and medical system. The idea was that if we could reduce natural phenomena to greater simplicity, we could understand the larger whole.\" [Integrative Medicine, David Rakel, Pg. 2]. This reductionist thinking ushered in a time of great discovery and advancement in Western culture. \"The scientific model led to greater understanding of the pathophysiologic basis of disease and the development of tools to help combat its influence. Subspecialization of medical care facilitated the application of the new information.\" [Integrative Medicine, David Rakel, Pg. 2]. The Evolution of Integrative Medicine The success of medical science in the 20th century also came with high costs. \"The system encourages patients to believe that tools are the answer to their physical woes and discourages them from paying attention to the interplay of mind, community, and spirit. Technology is the golden calf in this scenario. We have become dependent on it, and overuse has widened the barrier of communication between patient and provider. The old tools of the trade\u2014rapport, gestalt, intuition, and laying on of hands\u2014were used less and less as powerful drugs and high-tech interventions became available.\" [Integrative Medicine, of Integrative Medicine\", page 3] What the field of medicine had lost in its modernization, Integrative medicine was created to reclaim and restore. It refers to a re-integration of mind, body, and spirit reclaiming tools from a diverse and profound history of healing traditions and strategies, which put the patient in their entirety of existence, in the center of the care model. As the need for integrative medicine approaches increased, the need to also understand its tools from an evidence-based and mechanistic perspective also arose. Where does functional medicine come in? I had studied several traditions of medicine from Ayurveda [Ayurvedic Healing, A Comprehensive Guide, David Frawley], to Western Herbology [Heal Your Life with Home Remedies and Herbs, Hanna Kroeger], to native American herbology [Cleanse and Purify Thyself, Rich Anderson], to Chinese Medicine [The Spark In The Machine, How the Science of Acupuncture Explains the Mysteries of Western Medicine; by Daniel Keown]. The healing traditions of the world are incredible to delve into and to apply in clinical practice. However, to match the mechanistic and systematic detail that became the standard language of science, there grew a need to understand integrative medicine through the lens taught to physicians in modern practice, i.e., the biochemistry and mechanics of the application of plants or practices or nutritional strategies to specific dis-ease states. However, our knowledge base as humans continues to evolve. In the words of Jeffrey Bland, a leader in the field of Functional Medicine: \"Disease is a delusion, one that has been shattered by the still-emerging science of genomics. Breakthrough discoveries over the last decade of the twentieth century and the first decade-plus of the 21st have demonstrated that your heart disease is not the same as mine, that everyone with type 2 diabetes is not just like everyone else with type 2 diabetes, that the people with rheumatoid arthritis or Alzheimer's disease are not all similar to others with the same diagnosis. Rather, these so-called diseases are dysfunctions of each individual's physiological functioning; they are due to varied causes, and they demand treatment approaches as different from one another as are the individuals.\" [The Disease Delusion, by Jeffrey Bland (Part one, The Context)]. What Dr. Bland is describing is not just applying healing traditions to disease states, but asking ourselves, what is an individual's sum-total of exposures (physical/genetic/environmental/nutritional/emotional/spiritual/ancestral) has resulted in a state we call a disease state but represents an imbalance and can be addressed in a bio-individual way as opposed to an empirically prescriptive way. Functional medicine takes integrative medicine and further \"integrates\" it with our growing understanding of how our bio-individuality interacts with our exposures to lead to imbalance, where the greater our consciousness of the bio-individual drivers (supported by ever-growing to appreciate these in an evidence-based way) the greater our ability to unravel disease drivers and restore optimal health. Functional medicine no longer aims to understand the body in terms of its organ systems alone (lungs, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, endocrine, nervous, immune, etc., but rather as a network of systems working in concert in incredibly complex networks to achieve the core physiological processes that define how we function: - Assimilation and elimination - Detoxification - Defense - Cellular communication - Cellular transport - Energy - Structure Functional medicine represents the next organic evolution of medicine, where it thinks about how all our systems relate to one another. Functional medicine continues to remedy the shortcomings of the reductionist Western model that Integrative Medicine answers but evolves it to include this relational systems thinking, with evolving bench research especially in the interplay between our genetic blueprints and our environment, a burgeoning field dubbed \"omics\" for short. What is integrative medicine in modern times? Integrative medicine doctors make use of all appropriate therapies to treat the underlying cause of disease. Treatment options may include homeopathy, herbal medicine, bodywork, chiropractic care, acupuncture, energy work, and behavioral therapy. Integrative practitioners [evaluate the patient as a whole](https://integrativemedicine.arizona.edu/about/definition.html), not just a disease. The patient's physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual needs are considered equally important because each one affects the others, as well as the entire well-being of the patient. Practitioners and patients are equal partners in the healing process and treatments are tailored to each patient's unique needs. Less invasive, more natural interventions are preferred over medication and surgery, and all healing sciences are utilized to support the body's natural ability to heal itself. Integrative medicine is a specialty that emphasizes the integration of complementary therapies and conventional treatment. It's like getting the best of both worlds, with a priority on evidence and safety. Integrative medicine also teaches healthy skills and behaviors that support the patient's ability to care for their health and remain disease-free for their lifetime. What are some examples of integrative medicine? - Acupuncture for chronic pain, neuropathy, or hot flashes - Healing touch therapy/Bodywork for anxiety or chronic pain - Diet and supplement recommendations for general health - Lifestyle interventions such as yoga and meditation to reduce stress What is functional medicine in modern times? The beauty of functional medicine is how it partners with the evolution of our forward-thinking society. In many ways, it's like a bridge between integrative and conventional medicine. Functional medicine seeks to address the underlying cause of illness related to gut health, genetic predispositions, and the environment in which the patient lives. Functional medicine centers around the principle that one condition can have many causes, or there could be one cause for many different conditions. For example, depression can be caused by a combination of things, such as low thyroid, overuse of antibiotics, and vitamin D deficiency. On the other hand, chronic inflammation could be the cause of a number of inter-related conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, and depression. Functional medicine recognizes that all of the body's systems are connected. What affects one system generally affects them all. Therefore, when one system isn't functioning correctly, it can throw the others off balance. The functional medicine doctor develops a connection with their patients, discovers unhealthy patterns, determines the root cause of those problems, and recommends personalized treatment plans and lifestyle modifications to address the underlying cause of illness. Functional medicine dives deep into the patient's history, environment, lifestyle, and biochemistry to determine what is causing the illness. The strategy is used to find imbalances that may lead to disease and restore maximum function between all physiologic functions of the body. What are some examples of functional medicine? - Specialized testing to determine the root cause of illness - Nutritional and botanical supplements [Tailored IV infusions](https://rahavwellness.com/iv-therapy/) - Detoxification with [colon hydrotherapy](https://rahavwellness.com/colonics/)to promote balance and healing - Hormone therapy - Natural treatments over drugs or surgery - Microbiome and [immune system support](https://rahavwellness.com/functional-medicine-services/immunology/) Frequently Asked Questions About Integrative vs Functional Medicine - Are integrative and functional medicine holistic? Holistic medicine is a beautiful and broad term used to describe a medical approach that is equally focused on physical, mental, and spiritual health. Functional and integrative medicine are both considered holistic because they utilize a big picture approach to whole-person health. - Is functional medicine legit? Yes, functional medicine is 100% legit. Functional medicine doctors are board-certified medical doctors who have gone through the same rigorous medical school training required by all licensed physicians. In fact, many have also received additional specialized training. For example, [Dr. Rahav is triple board-certified](https://rahavwellness.com/dr-miriam-rahav/) in the fields of internal medicine, functional medicine, and hospice and palliative medicine, and also holds an additional certification in acupuncture. - How are integrative and functional medicine different from conventional medicine? In conventional medicine, the body is viewed as a series of organ systems that are typically considered separately. The assessment, treatment, and even the practitioner are generally focused on the specific organ system the disorder is associated with. This model of medicine has made spectacular advances in many areas, such as emergency medicine, surgical interventions, diagnostic radiology, and infectious disease. Unfortunately, it has also become the medical model applied to the entire spectrum of healthcare, including preventive medicine, nutrition, and chronic disease management... with less-than-ideal results. Perpetual suppression of symptoms without addressing the root cause of illness has led to widespread dissatisfaction among practitioners and patients alike. Integrative medicine and functional medicine are becoming more mainstream in modern times as a result of this continued deterioration and dissatisfaction. The primary focus of integrative medicine and functional medicine is to provide symptom relief while also addressing the underlying cause of illness and promoting the body's natural ability to heal itself, with the ultimate goal of achieving lasting wellness. The term alternative medicine is generally used to describe a non-mainstream medical modality that is being used in place of conventional medicine. Complementary medicine simply means that an alternative medicine modality is being used in conjunction with conventional medicine. Integrative vs Functional Medicine: What's the Best Approach? The human body is incredibly complex when it is in a state of good health, but when you add an imbalance or disorder to the mix, that complexity grows exponentially. Integrative and functional medicine each have their own merits, so choosing an approach that encompasses both modalities is the obvious choice. At Rahav Wellness, we use a combination of integrative and functional medicine to evaluate each patient and provide the optimal, personalized care required for treatment, recovery, and lifelong health. Our goal is to provide our patients with treatment options that help them avoid surgery and medication overload while empowering their ability to be their own best health advocate.
