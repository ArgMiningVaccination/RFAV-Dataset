UVM is ranked among the \"10 Best Colleges to Study Health Professions\" for its number of quality majors within the field, small class sizes and collaborative learning with prof essors, and high salaries following graduation and at the mid -career level. The ranking was reported by USA Today and compiled by College Factual. 2. Together the College of Nursing and Health Sciences , the UVM College of Medicine, and The University of Vermo nt Medical Center form one of just 138 academic medical centers in the U.S. The UVM Medical Center is a regional referral and Level 1 trauma center providing advanced care to approximately one million people in Vermont and northern New York. 3. CNHS graduate programs in communication sciences and disorders, physical therapy, and nursing are ranked among U.S. News & World Report's Best Graduate Schools . What Is New For The Coming Year? The Nursing and Health Sciences First Year Interest Group (nhsFIG) provides a unique opportunity for students to live together in Davis Hall on Redstone campus , with access to on -site advising and mentor support, study and discussion groups, and social events. The Program in Integrativ e Health is an initiative by CNHS, the UVM College of Medicine, The UVM Medical Center, UVM Medical Group, and the Laura Mann Center for Integrative Health to foster collaboration in the academic study and clinical application of integrative medicine. Exp eriential Learning Opportunities: All CNHS students engage in case -based and clinical simulation scenarios beginning in their first year of study. A clinical simulation laboratory, human motion analysis laboratories, child language labs, and clinical site s across the state, region, and nation provide practical experience side -by-side with nurses and physicians, athletic trainers and exercise scientists, speech -language pathologists and audiologists, medical laboratory scientists, radiation therapists, and nuclear medicine technologists. Opportunities for undergraduate research mentorship are prevalent in all disciplines. Some students have published work with their faculty mentors. CNHS students in all majors have studied abroad - in Bali, Norway, Mexico, and Australia, among other places. The nursing curriculum offers an opportunity to study public health in Uganda. What Makes Your Program Unique Compared To Peer Institutions? UVM's College of Nursing and Health Sciences is part of the University of Ve rmont Health Network, and just steps away from the University of Vermont Medical Center and the College of Medicine, with access to talented faculty practitioners and hands -on learning opportunities. We offer interprofessional experiences and engage studen ts in case -based clinical simulation scenarios from the first year of study. What is your college doing to further the first year experience for new students? First -year students in all CNHS majors take NH 50: Applications to Health , an introduction to the personal, professional, and academic challenges involved in studying health -related disciplines, and the platform for the College's first -year student advising program. The Nursing and Health Sciences First Year Interest Group ( nhsFIG) (see above) Is there important information for transfer students? CNHS cohort sizes are limited by the number of clinical placements available in each program. Selection of applicants is competitive, and the opportunity to transfer into a major, ev en from within the university, is not assured. In addition to GPA, relevant volunteer or work experience in a clinical setting is taken into consideration in the selection process. Our Graduates Have Gone On To...
