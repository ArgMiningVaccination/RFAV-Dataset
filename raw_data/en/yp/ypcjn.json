In this article: [Ashwagandha, Fatigue, and Stress](#ashwagandha) [Bitter Potent Antioxidant](#turmeric) Ayurvedic medicine is an ancient form of healing popular throughout Asia and India. Believed to be over 3,000 years old, ayurvedic medicine relies on a thorough understanding of the chakras, or energy centers of the body. The premise of Ayurvedic medicine is that true health occurs only when the mind, body, and spirit are in alignment. Ayurvedic medicine relies on using natural and holistic approaches to health and wellness, balancing diet and exercise with herbs. The following are commonly used ayurvedic herbs. Ashwagandha, Fatigue, and Stress [Ashwagandha](https://www.iherb.com/c/ashwagandha) is an adaptogenic herb that is reportedly helpful in managing chronic fatigue among other issues. Native to Asia, specifically India and regions of China, ashwagandha has been commonly used in ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years. Studied Benefits of Ashwagandha Include: - Anxiety and Stress: A 2014 study1 showed improvement in symptoms of anxiety and stress symptoms when taken. - Energy and Endurance: Animal studies2 have also shown that ashwagandha can help improve energy levels and endurance. A 2015 study3 of athletes in Ayu showed that ashwagandha could help improve endurance and improve quality of life. - Sexual Function: A 2015 study4 concluded that ashwagandha could improve sexual function in healthy women, specifically, increased libido. Suggested dose: [Ashwagandha](https://www.iherb.com/c/ashwagandha) - 500 mg once or twice per day. Bitter Melon, Digestion, and Blood Sugar This tropical plant, also known as bitter gourd, bitter melon, or (Momordica charantia), is commonly found in Asia (where it's edible fruit is often consumed), Africa, and the Caribbean region. [Bitter melon](https://www.iherb.com/c/bitter-melon) has been used since the days of antiquity for its health-promoting abilities. Studied Benefits of Bitter Melon Include: - Digestion - Bitter melon is frequently used in ayurvedic medicine to help soothe an upset stomach. - Blood Sugar Levels - A 2009 animal study showed bitter melon could help reduce insulin resistance, which regularly occurs in those with diabetes. More recently, a 2015 study5 in Nutrition Journal showed the fruit's ability to lower blood sugar levels when taken at doses of 2,000 and 4,000 mg per day. - Cholesterol Levels - Studies6 show this fruit can help lower cholesterol levels. Suggested dose: [Bitter melon](https://www.iherb.com/c/bitter-melon) - As directed on the label. Boswellia (Boswellia serrata) and Inflammation [Boswellia](https://www.iherb.com/c/boswellia) is an Ayurvedic herbal supplement that has been used for thousands of years to alleviate chronic health conditions. Studied Benefits of Boswellia Include: - Inflammation - Known for reducing inflammation in the body, bitter melon was used by ancient healers for bowel inflammation, ulcerative colitis, asthma, and arthritis-related joint pain. - Asthma - A 2015 study7 showed that Boswellia could reduce inflammation in the lungs of asthmatics by reducing inflammation. This has the potential to help reduce breathing difficulties, which are routinely experienced by some with asthma. - Arthritis - A 2019 randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial8 showed that Boswellia could reduce inflammation in those with arthritis, improve function, and reduce joint stiffness and pain. Further, researchers in a 2018 study9 also found that the combination of turmeric and Boswellia was even more effective in reducing arthritis pain, as it provides a synergistic effect. Suggested dose: [Boswellia](https://www.iherb.com/c/boswellia) - As directed on the label. Bacopa and Cognitive Function Traditionally used in ayurvedic medicine for its memory-enhancing benefits, [Bacopa monnieri](https://www.iherb.com/c/bacopa) (Brahmi) has become more popular outside India over the last decade, due to studies showing its effectiveness. Studied Benefits of Bacopa monnieri include: - Memory and Cognition - A 2012 study10 in Evidence Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine concluded, \"...Bacopa monnieri can improve attention, cognitive processing, and working memory....\". In addition, a 2014 meta-analysis study11 (a study that looked at several studies combined) concluded, \"Bacopa monnieri has the potential to improve cognition, particularly speed of attention.\" Similarly, in a 2016 study12, a \"statistically significant improvement was seen in the tests relating to the cognitive functions with use of Bacopa monnieri.\" Suggested dose: [Bacopa monnieri](https://www.iherb.com/c/bacopa) - As directed on the label.

Suggested dose: [Gotu kola](https://www.iherb.com/c/gotu-kola) - As directed on the label. Licorice (DGL), Hormonal, and Digestive Health When most think of licorice, candy \u2014 not an herb \u2014 comes to mind. However, [licorice](https://www.iherb.com/c/Licorice-Root-DGL) (deglycyrrhizinated licorice) is an herb that has played an important role in Traditional Chinese Medicine. In China, licorice is called gancao, which means \"sweet grass.\" Licorice's use goes back to 2100 BC and was first described in Shennongs Classic of Materia Medica17. It is frequently used for those with adrenal fatigue, a condition that many women experience. The active ingredients in licorice are glycyrrhizin and genistein among others. Studies have shown the benefit of DGL licorice for decades. Licorice may have benefits for the following: - Digestion - A 1968 study18 showed this natural medicine's ability to help heal stomach ulcers and intestinal ulcers. A 1978 study19 in the British Medical Journal reported that it may be of help in the prevention of stomach ulcers, as well. It can also relieve upset stomachs, according to a 2012 study20. - Menopause - A 2013 study21 showed that licorice could help balance hormones in women who were having symptoms related to menopausal changes. Suggested dosage: [Licorice root](https://www.iherb.com/c/Licorice-Root-DGL) - As directed on the label. Neem's Antibacterial Properties [Neem](https://www.iherb.com/c/neem) originates from the seeds, barks, and leaves of the neem tree. It is also known as Azadirachta indica and Indian lilac. Indigenous to India, this plant also grows in the southern parts of Persia.

Triphala, Arthritis, and Diabetes [Triphala](https://www.iherb.com/c/triphala) is an herbal superstar with a 1,000-year-plus history. A polyherbal medicine, it is a favorite among ayurvedic practitioners and consists of the following three herbs: - Amla (Emblica officinalis) - Also known bellirica) - Haritaki (Terminalia chebula) Studied Benefits the following: - Arthritis - A 2017 study25 showed that haritaki could help reduce symptoms of joint arthritis, a common ailment associated with aging. - Diabetes- The amla component of Triphala can help lower blood sugar, according to a 2014 study26. A more recent 2017 study27 concluded that the active ingredient in amla \"...exerts anti-diabetic activity through the action on -cells of the pancreas that stimulates insulin secretion and decreases glucose intolerance.\" - Gout - Gouty arthritis is a common ailment caused by uric acid crystals building up in the joints, leading to excruciating pain. Triphala may be able to help prevent this. A 2016 study28 showed that both bibhitaki and haritaki could lower uric acid levels in the blood. However, bibhitaki was more effective. While Triphala is frequently used by some for constipation with success, I was unable to find any studies specifically on constipation. I did, however, find a study that shows the herb had a positive effect on the gut microbiome, which may explain why it has reportedly been helpful in the treatment of this common digestive issue. Suggested dose: [Triphala](https://www.iherb.com/c/triphala) - As directed on the label. Turmeric is a Potent Antioxidant [Turmeric](https://www.iherb.com/c/turmeric), also known as Curcuma longa and Indian saffron, is a rooted plant in the ginger family, often consumed for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and digestive health properties. [Curcumin](https://www.iherb.com/c/Curcumin), a chemical found in turmeric, is believed to provide many of the health benefits. While many people have used turmeric as a spice to enhance their food for over the past 4,000 years, turmeric has played an important role in medicine. Today, its use continues to be researched as an alternative treatment approach for many common sicknesses, injuries, and chronic diseases. Studied Benefits of Turmeric Include the following: - Arthritis - Turmeric may be helpful in reducing pain for both rheumatoid and osteoarthritis29. Scientists have discovered that turmeric can reduce inflammation similar to multiple widely used prescription drugs. - Antioxidant boost - Turmeric is also a potent antioxidant, either when consumed as a spice or when taken as a curcumin supplement. Turmeric can help prevent oxidation, according to a 2016 report in the journal Diseases30. - Memory - A 2017 study31 in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease concluded that turmeric could also play an important role in preventing memory loss. It may be an essential supplement for anyone wanting to optimize memory. - Asthma - A 2010 study32 has demonstrated improved management of bronchial asthma with the use of turmeric when consumed with [Boswellia serrata](https://www.iherb.com/c/boswellia)and [licorice root](https://www.iherb.com/c/Licorice-Root-DGL). A 2014 study in the Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research33 also concluded that turmeric, when taken orally, could help improve lung function in those with asthma. Other conditions that turmeric may help with, according to studies, include: - Diabetes - High blood pressure - Indigestion - Gallstones34 - Bacterial infections - Ulcerative colitis (colon inflammation) - Helps remove toxins like mercury from the body35 Suggested Dose: Many people consume turmeric by drinking it in tea form, using it as a powder for some skin conditions, and also swallowing it in capsule form.
