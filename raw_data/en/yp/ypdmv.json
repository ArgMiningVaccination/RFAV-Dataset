Honestly, I can't believe how quickly I was able to see progress - in my ability to calm my brain as well as my ability to handle stress. I have become a meditator after only four months of this one year program, and I look forward to my next meditation each week.\" \"We at Parsley Health recommend David's work to all our patients as a great option to learn meditation. I've been using his meditations for years, and his incredible sense of humor and calm voice create a comfortable, calm space to meditate.\" \"Meditation School has helped me dive deeper into my meditation practice. David's meditations have enabled me to stop taking my stress so seriously, move out old energy, and start to cultivate the new kind energy I want in my life. I even felt less tired and more energized at the end of the meditations, and I continue to use those tools daily!\" \"Finally a teacher that takes you deep without being woo-woo or boring. I'm actually excited to meditate and every topic is so right on point.\" Subscribe Want to receive free meditations, course announcements and be the first to know about upcoming events?
