Shionogi's Action GuidelinesMission Vision ValuesWe will deliver pharmaceuticals that offer an even higher level of satisfaction to patients, their families, and healthcare providers and improve the quality of life for patients and their families. A company with a strong presence worldwide A company that has pride and dreams and embraces challengesCustomer focus Trust Professionalism On-site orientation Respect for the individualUnder our Medium-Term Business Plan SGS2020, we positioned infectious diseases and pain, as well as central nervous sys- tem (CNS) disorders, as our main areas of research and development. We also outlined our vision: to grow in service to soci-ety as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company. In the 1960s, Shionogi successfully made its full-fl edged entry into the antibiotics market. With the development and sale of proprietary antibiotics in the 1980s, we gained a rm foothold that allowed Shionogi to become the pharmaceutical man- ufacturer it is today. To support the treatment of patients with infectious diseases worldwide, our products were subsequently out-licensed to companies overseas. Treatment periods for infectious diseases tend to be short, which can make turning a pro t challenging. Many global phar- maceutical manufacturers have abandoned or stepped back from discovery research in this critical area. Not Shionogi. Drawing on our expertise and strengths, the Shionogi Group remains fully committed to meeting the needs of society with aggressive R&D, especially into severe infectious diseases, viral infectious diseases, and emerging or re-emerg - ing infectious diseases. Of course, the Company has other strong suits. Shionogi has been supplying pain relief drugs since before World War II. In the late 1980s, we received a request from Japan's former Ministry of Health and Welfare to develop prescription narcotics for the treatment of cancer pain. This proved to be a major turning point for the Company in the area of pain relief. Our success was underpinned by a management decision asserting that ethical drugmakers have a duty to relieve the pain of their patients. Today, this seems obvious. At the time, it was revolutionary. We will continue to work on a daily basis to supply the best possible medicine to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve.

Out-licensed to Roche, Shinomin helped treat patients with infectious diseases worldwide. Shionogi continued to develop antibiotics, launching the rst in class (FIC)* 1 antibacterial agent Shiomarin (latamoxef Flomox (cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride hydrate) in 1997 and a range of other proprietary compounds that continue to infl uence our products today. Shionogi is also active in the eld of antiviral treatments, developing a steady stream of FIC and last in class (LIC)* 2 drugs such as anti-HIV agent dolutegravir, related pipe- drugs and anti-infl uenza drug candidate S-033188. *1 First-in-Class: Innovative medicines with particularly high novelty and ef cacy that can signi cantly change the existing therapeutic paradigm. *2 Last-in-Class: Unrivaled medicines with clear superiority over others that have the same mechanism of action.7 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017Core Therapeutic Areas Pain and Shionogi Shionogi has been supplying prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs for pain relief since before World War II. In the late 1980s, we received a request from Japan's former Ministry of Health and Welfare to develop prescription narcotics (opioid pain relievers) for the treatment of cancer pain. This proved to be a major turning point for the Company in the area of pain relief. At the time, pre-scription narcotics for cancer pain were not widely used in Japan and pharmaceutical companies were reluctant to respond to requests from the government, partly due to the negative image of narcotics. In line with the spirit of our Company Policy, we decided to take on the challenge. Since then, we have worked to promote wider use of cancer pain treatments in Japan. Today, we supply a wide range of chronic pain treatments. We have high hopes for Symproic , a new treatment for opioid- induced constipation (OIC) and our rst-ever globally developed proprietary compound, which is set to have a positive impact on patient health worldwide.WHAT WE DO SPECIAL FEATURE HOW WE DO IT OUR VALUE CREATION FINANCIAL SECTION 8 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017Commitment to Sustainability The UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which outlines 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 speci c targets. We believe that Goal 3\u2014Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages\u2014is especially aligned with our objective as a pharmaceutical company to improve access to healthcare. Goal 3 speci cally calls for protecting the health and well-being of small children, pregnant women, and nursing mothers as well as ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic, among other targets. We are helping to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic through our R&D activities as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company. And through the Mother to Mother SHIONOGI Project, we are working to protect the health and well-being of small children, pregnant women, and nursing mothers.Tackling Global Issues *SDGs: Sustainable Development GoalsOur Stance on Social Responsibility Since Shionogi was established, we have remained fully com- mitted to developing even better medicines and delivering them to patients in need. By constantly improving our technol-ogies and services, we have worked to enhance the positive impact of our products on patient health. In a world driven by dramatic change, this commitment remains an unshakeable feature of Shionogi. Our Purpose was formally established in 1957 as the Company Policy of Shionogi. Today, it remains the template for the kind of company we want to be and the basis of our value to society. The fundamental tenet of this policy\u2014to protect the health and wellbeing of the people we serve\u2014has always been our guiding principle as a pharmaceutical company. Anchored by this principle, we will continue to deliver and create new value well into the future. Our efforts to ful ll Our Purpose and improve everyone's access to healthcare constitute the very heart of our corporate social responsibility (CSR) and value creation. Addressing Social Issues We launched SGS2020 with the vision of \"growing in service to society as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company,\" focusing on the two core therapeutic areas of infectious dis-eases and pain / CNS disorders. Our decision to focus on those two elds refl ects our long track record of developing drugs to treat infections and pain. Since the dawn of time, infectious diseases have been an inseparable part of the human condition. With Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin in 1928, humankind nally gained a foothold against infection. Since then, it has been a constant struggle. We race to develop drugs that are effective against various pathogens, which then build up resistance to survive, requiring renewed efforts to discover effective new medicines. Shionogi has played an important role in the global ght against infections, including emerging infectious diseases and the resurgence of existing diseases. This Shionogi strength must always be nurtured. In pain and CNS disorders, demand for more effective treatment is rising globally amid rapidly aging demographics. New drugs and other healthcare improvements have extended average life expec-tancy around the world. Increasingly, attention is turning to ways of using healthcare to improve healthy life expectancy from the perspective of quality of life (QOL). Pain and deteriorating cognitive functions can have a major negative impact on QOL. By providing drugs that extend healthy life expectancy, we can make life better for people around the world. However, developing effective treatment is not enough. To promote health and wellbeing, we must ensure treatment options are widely known, raising awareness about the impor-tance of accessibility, while also putting in place systems that expand access to health services. Similarly, we need to improve access to healthcare in developing countries, where systems and infrastructure are typically not as robust. Educating the public about the correct use of medication is another increas-ingly important area. As a pharmaceutical company, we have a role to play in driv-ing sustained improvement in the quality of healthcare, as well as promoting health and wellbeing by supplying products, ser-vices and opportunities that bring together leaders in the healthcare sector. This is how the Shionogi Group can ful ll its responsibility to society. Our Intellectual Property and Access to Healthcare Intellectual property (IP) is an extremely important business asset for pharmaceutical companies. Under our IP strategy, we protect various innovations, such as drug compounds, applica-tions, crystalline forms, manufacturing methods, formulations, drug discovery targets and basic research technologies. As part of drug in-licensing and out-licensing activities, we conduct IP due diligence and take every possible step to prevent the Group's business activities from infringing third-party IP . We also carry out brand design activities aimed at building trust in the Shionogi brand and preventing counterfeiting. Shionogi works to protect its IP , taking all legal means necessary if the Group's intellectual property appears to have been infringed. Although we do not subscribe to the idea that systems to protect IP necessarily pose an obstacle to accessing healthcare, we do recognize instances when a certain level of latitude is required. Shionogi does not currently possess patents in least developed countries (LDCs) or other low-income countries (LICs). Until the problems surrounding access to pharmaceuti-cals have been satisfactorily resolved, we will refrain from applying for or enforcing patents in these countries. In addition, ViiV Healthcare Ltd. enables the low-price provi-sion of dolutegravir\u2014a anti-HIV agent developed by Shionogi and U.K.-based GlaxoSmithKline\u2014to over 80 countries, including Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda thanks to the royalty-free voluntary licensing policy. As one of the patent holders, Shionogi supports this project. Addressing Social Issues 9 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017Commitment to Sustainability Creating a Society where Everyone Can Thrive Support reintegration of those who've become isolated from society due to anxi-ety, pain, or suffering. Lighten psychological burden to help indi- viduals tap their innate potential and thrive. Maintain the dignity of the individual throughout all the stages of lifeProtecting People from the Threat of Infectious Diseases Develop new drugs against infectious dis- eases that lack effective medical treatments. Prevent the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria and viruses by promoting antimi-crobial stewardship.*1 LDCs: Least developed country *2 LICs: Low Income CountriesWHAT WE DO SPECIAL FEATURE HOW WE DO IT OUR VALUE CREATION FINANCIAL SECTION Promoting Antimicrobial Stewardship Infectious diseases, by their nature, are a transmission risk to all people. As borders become more porous and globalization gathers pace, we also face the risk of emerging and re-emerg-ing infectious diseases, as well as antimicrobial resistance\u2014pressing issues that must be addressed by society as a whole. At Shionogi, antimicrobial stewardship means selecting the most appropriate antimicrobial agent, dose and administration method and ensuring treatment ends at the optimal time in order to make treatments safe and reliable, control the spread of drug-resistant bacteria and viruses, and support the effective use of healthcare resources. We organize and provide relevant information to promote appropriate use of antimicrobial agents. This involves using antimicrobial susceptibility surveil-lance programs to gather accurate epidemiological data, rigor- ously analyzing industry guidelines and improving understanding about pharmaceutical pro les. In 2010 Shionogi established an Antimicrobial Stewardship Unit, through which we have discussed the appropriate use of antimicrobial agents with healthcare providers, as well as the importance of drug discovery. We have presently established similar organizations at subsidiaries in Taiwan, China, and Singapore to initiate discussions with a broad range of medical-related professionals and specialists. The organizations also work to disseminate correct information and conduct sales activities aimed at promoting the appropriate use of antimicro-bial agents. Combating Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) The emerging threat of multidrug resistant Gram-negative bac-teria poses a major public health challenge worldwide. In 2010 Shionogi and GlaxoSmithKline began joint R&D efforts, focus-ing on cephalosporin antibiotic agents, with the aim of devel-oping antibiotics with new mechanisms of action. This resulted in the successful discovery of two compounds with different pro les: S-649266 and GSK3342830. However, we wrapped up our joint efforts when we realized the urgent medical need for both compounds. Each company has concentrated man-agement resources on one of the respective compounds to speed development along and get both into the hands of healthcare providers as soon as possible. S-649266, the com-pound Shionogi is continuing to develop, is currently in Phase II and Phase III trials. We aim to step up our role in the global ght against multi- drug-resistant bacteria through international collaboration, illustrated by our commitment to a joint declaration calling for greater cooperation at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2016 and as a signatory to the September 2016 Roadmap for Progress on Combating Antimicrobial Resistance. 10 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017Protecting People from the Threat of Infectious DiseasesNeglected tropical diseases (NTDs) also remain a threat to the lives of many people in developing countries amid limited progress in developing effective antibiotics. One reason for this lack of progress is that many pharmaceutical companies have withdrawn from infectious disease research due to poor pros-pects for substantial pro ts. Against this backdrop, many funds are being set up world-wide to advance research into new antibiotics. In Japan, the not-for-pro t GHIT Fund has been established to promote col- laboration with overseas partners and provide research fund-ing. Shionogi has been a contributor to the GHIT Fund since it was founded and has received funding to advance the discovery of new drugs that can treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Under the auspices of the fund, Shionogi is also actively work- ing to eliminate the threat of infectious diseases in general, such as taking part in a program to discover candidate com-pounds to treat leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. In early 2015, the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DND i) announced that it was teaming up with Shionogi and three other pharmaceutical rms (Eisai, Takeda, and U.K.-based AstraZeneca) to launch the \"Neglected Tropical Diseases Drug Discovery Booster\" consortium. This project is a groundbreak-ing attempt to accelerate drug discovery for two highly neglected diseases\u2014leishmaniasis and Chagas disease\u2014and also reduce associated costs. U.S.-based Celgene and Germany-based Merck subsequently joined the consortium, bringing the total number of participant companies to six. Two years since its launch in 2015, the consortium has start-ed 13 screening projects for the parasites that cause leishmani-asis and Chagas disease, and most of these projects have discovered promising compounds with improved antiparasitic effects. Already, each project has reduced the costs of synthe-sizing compounds by tens of thousands of dollars and short-ened the drug discovery period by roughly 30-50%. In recognition of these achievements, the consortium received the DND i Project of the Year Award for 2016. The candidates for the award are considered by the DND i Board of Directors and the DND i Scienti c Advisory Committee, which comprises around 20 external members. The award ceremony was held at the 6th World Congress on Leishmaniasis, which is held once every four years, and each company participating in the project was presented with a commemorative painted plate, for which the host city Toledo (Spain) is renowned. Contributing to the GHIT Fund The DND i Project of the Year Award 2016 Measures and Policies Regarding Access to Healthcare Combating Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) R&D for AIDS Treatments Shionogi and ViiV Healthcare have conducted joint R&D on the new HIV integrase inhibitor dolutegravir. Since December 2012, ViiV Healthcare has submitted new drug applications for dolutegravir to regulatory bodies in Japan, the United States, and Europe. The drug is currently sold around the world as Tivicay . Since October 2013, ViiV Healthcare has also submit- ted new drug applications for a triple drug combination that includes dolutegravir to regulatory bodies in Japan, the United States, and Europe. This combination is currently sold around the world as Triumeq . Based on our previously stated policy regarding intellectual property and access to healthcare, Shionogi licenses the patent for dolutegravir through ViiV Healthcare to the Medicines Patent Pool at no cost. We believe this will help AIDS treat-ments in developing countries. 11 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017Commitment to SustainabilityWHAT WE DO SPECIAL FEATURE HOW WE DO IT OUR VALUE CREATION FINANCIAL SECTION Collaborating to Support Children's Futures To promote initiatives supporting the future of Osaka's chil- dren, we proposed collaboration with the Osaka prefectural government. This led to the signing of an agreement on sup-porting children's futures at a ceremony with Governor Ichiro Matsui in January 2017. Under this agreement, the Osaka gov-ernment and Shionogi intend to closely collaborate through the following measures.1. Support children's health: Hold classes geared toward children on the proper way to handle medicine. 2. Promote career education: Hold after-school science classes for children and career-oriented seminars for children with disabilities. 3. Support children and adults with developmental dis- abilities: Collaborate on raising awareness of develop-mental disabilities, providing career training early on, and taking other measures. 4. Promote measures that combat child poverty: Collaborate on local activities to look after and support children. Japan's graying population now leads the world, and the low birthrate and aging population are creating major social problems. Shionogi intends to build a sustainable society by solving social problems. As a part of this effort, in July 2016 we established the Children's Future Support Preparation Of ce (currently the Children's Future Support Of ce) within the Corporate Strategy Division, and began promoting an array of initiatives. Going forward, we will promote the growth and health of children who will become future leaders and seek to lighten psychological burden in order to help build a society where individuals can tap their innate potential and thrive. Chie Kishimoto, General Manager of the Children's Future Support Of ce Creating a Society where Everyone Can Thrive 12 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017Mother to Mother SHIONOGI Project We launched the Mother to Mother SHIONOGI Project in October 2015 as part of our efforts to protect the health and wellbeing of people worldwide. Under this project, we support the health of mothers and children in both Japan and Kenya through sales of our Popon Series of multivitamin supplements, popular for many years in the domestic market. Mothers in Japan who use Popon gain health bene ts, while a portion of product sales, along with additional Shionogi employee contri-butions, is donated to a program that improves the health of mothers and children in Kenya. The program is run by World Vision International, a global NGO. Despite its vast size, Kenya has a remarkably small number of medical clinics. This makes it dif cult for expectant mothers to receive regular prenatal checkups, give birth in a clinical set-ting and return home healthy with their newborn child; some-thing we take for granted in Japan. Kenya's maternal mortality rate* is staggeringly high, at around 400 deaths per 100,000 live births. In Japan, that number is just 6 per 100,000 and the world average is 210. Similarly alarming, Kenya's under- ve mortality rate* is 71 deaths per 1,000 live births, while in Japan it is 3 and the world average is 46. The dire situation is an urgent call to action. To address the health problems confronting mothers and children, Shionogi built a clinic in Ilaramatak, which opened in November 2016. Situated in Kenya's Narok County, this new facility supports a vastly underserved region where the percent-age of births performed at health facilities hovers around 9.4%, far below the national average of 62%. In addition, we initiated an educational program for clinic staff, including local volunteers, and community health workers (CHWs). Our donations have so far contributed to the construction of a local medical clinic and health network in the traditional lands of the Maasai people, helping to improve the health of local people by improving access to healthcare. * Statistics taken from UNICEF's The State of the World's Children 2015 A clinic we opened Photograph provided by World Vision Japan Collaborating with Tokushima University on Botulinum Toxin Shionogi has signed a license agreement with Tokushima University on a novel type A2 botulinum toxin candidate. Going forward, Shionogi will undertake its development, man-ufacturing and promotion worldwide. Botulinum toxin is a naturally occurring protein produced by Clostridium botulinum . It is well known for reducing excessive muscle contraction by blocking the release of acetylcholine. This novel type A2 botulinum toxin is expected to contribute to the treatment of post-stroke spasticity of upper and lower limbs. Today in Japan, it is estimated that there are about 2.8 mil-lion stroke patients, and about 40% of those patients suffer from post-stroke spasticity. Due to its ability to reduce excessive muscle contraction, botulinum toxin has been established as a treatment for post-stroke spasticity to help patients more readi-ly carry on rehabilitation. We're striving to contribute to the better health and better QOL of people all over the world by conducting in-house drug discovery research and promoting collaboration with compa- nies and academic institutions.

Shionogi has established an EHS policy and built a man-agement system. Our EHS initiatives encompass not only the Group but also extend to engage our suppliers. We are helping to create safe workplaces and enrich society by protecting the global environment, preventing pollution, and ensuring the health and safety of all those who work with us as well as the communities in which we operate. Address Climate Change Risks As a measure to address global warming, we are working to reduce our CO 2 emissions. In addition to reducing energy con- sumption by installing highly ef cient equipment, we are con- tinuing to revise the ways we operate. For example, in scal 2014, we switched the fuel used in the energy supply equip-ment at the Kanegasaki Plant and installed a gas-turbine cogeneration power system, greatly reducing our CO 2 emis- sions. In addition, we have adopted hybrid cars for our fl eet used by sales personnel, except in frigid regions. We are also work-ing to prevent leaks from equipment that uses chlorofl uorocar- bons (CFCs) and are exploring conversion to non-CFC equipment.President Corporate Executive Meeting Energy Conservation Committee Environment Committee Safety and Health CommitteeShionogi Group Central EHS Committee EHS General Manager MeetingEHS Manager EHS General Manager Plant Research Laboratory Office Sales 2014 2015 2016 (FY)(t-CO 2) CO 2 emissions Net sales / CO 2 emissionsWHAT WE DO SPECIAL FEATURE HOW WE DO IT OUR VALUE CREATION FINANCIAL SECTION We have adopted biomass bottles (bio-polyethylene bottles) for Cymbalta capsules as well as Irbetan and Pirespa . The bottles are compliant with biomass plastic identi cation labeling stan- dards set by the Japan BioPlastics Association. These pharmaceutical packaging containers are made from polyethylene derived from materials leftover in sugarcane pro-cessing. By switching from conventional bottles made from petroleum-derived polyethylene, we are helping to reduce CO 2 emissions and conserve fossil fuel resources.Switching to Biomass Bottles Front Side 14 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) Initiatives CO 2 emissionsProtecting Aquatic Environments Shionogi is working to protect water resources by using them more effectively and managing wastewater quality. In addition to our efforts to conserve water, at water treatment facilities we set voluntary management gures that exceed mandated levels and constantly monitor wastewater for irregularities. At plants that manufacture antibiotics, the antibiotics are rst deactivated locally at each building prior to central processing at our water treatment facilities. We have con rmed that upon discharge, the levels remaining in the treated wastewater pose no threat. In addition, for new products, we limit ambient con-centrations in wastewater, and have con rmed that the levels do not impact the natural environment. Engaging Our Suppliers To ensure eco-friendly and safe processes in manufacturing, Shionogi conducts EHS audits on suppliers that have been con-tracted to manufacture important active pharmaceutical ingre-dients. The increasing globalization of our supply chain has heightened the need for responsible procurement that encom-passes environmental protection, health and safety, ethics, and labor. To promote a global standard, we joined the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI)* and have begun taking additional measures in accordance with this initiative. 15 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017Commitment to Sustainability Shionogi Group EHS Policy In support of Shionogi's mission to supply the best possible medicine to protect the health and well-being of the patients we serve, we are helping to create safe workplaces and enrich society by protecting the global environ-ment, preventing pollution, and ensuring the health and safety of all the people who work with us as well as the communities in which we operate. Speci cally, Shionogi is committed to: 1. Clarifying organizational responsibility and decision-making authority while building a high-quality EHS management system. 2. Complying with all relevant laws and regulations related to the environment, health, and safety while striving to steadily improve the EHS level. 3.

During the intervening decades, both Shionogi and the world around it have undergone dramatic change. Still, the spirit of our founding is alive and thrives. Even today, our head of ce is based in Doshomachi, where the Company was founded nearly 140 years ago. The newfound enterprise originally engaged in the wholesale of Japanese and Chinese medicines. During the course of its rst eight years, Western medical science began gaining widespread popularity, and, in 1886, the young rm began importing and selling Western medicine. Shortly thereafter, the founder Gisaburo Shiono grew determined to manufacture pharmaceutical products in-house. After his second son, Chojiro, graduated from the Pharmaceutical Department of the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmaceuticals at Tokyo Imperial University, the Company began full-fl edged pharmaceutical research. The antacid agent Antacidin , which was developed using a German pharmaceutical book, was the rst new drug developed by Shiono Gisaburo Shoten. Founder, Gisaburo Report (1950-2008) In 1959, Shionogi began sales of Shinomin , the rst sulfonamide synthesized at a Shionogi research laboratory. The product garnered praise for its superb ef cacy, and, after two years, it was being sold around the world. Noticing the global growth potential of antibiotics, Shionogi built a spe-cialized plant to manufacture them. As one of the rst Japanese companies to import medicines from overseas pharma-ceutical companies, Shionogi developed an especially close relationship with U.S.-based Eli Lilly. In 1952, we obtained exclusive manufacturing and marketing rights in Japan for a new antibiotic discovered by Eli Lilly called Ilotycin . Then in 1966, we in- licensed the cephalosporin antibiotic Kefl in, followed by Kefl odin in 1967 and Kefl ex in 1976. Together, these products provided a huge boost to Shionogi's sales. Through our alliance with Eli Lilly, we boost- ed not only sales but also our research and manufacturing capabilities. We advanced research related to antibiotics at Shionogi Research Laboratories, which was complet-ed in 1961 and is now integrated into the Shionogi Pharmaceutical Research Center. This research led to the in-house discovery of Shiomarin , the world's rst oxacephem antibiotic, which went on sale in 1982. After launching Flumarin in 1988 and Flomox in 1997, Shionogi became known as \"the antibiotics expert,\" receiving acclaim from around the world for the aca-demic rigor of our research. In the early 1980s, antibiotic usage plateaued due mainly to concerns over drug-resistant bacteria. Then, from 1990 onward, usage plummeted. Due to our high dependence on antibiotics, this caused business performance to rapidly deteriorate. In 2000, Shionogi for-mulated the First Medium-Term Business Plan, taking its rst step toward bold structural reform. Under the plan, we transferred several businesses, including agrochemicals and ani-mal health products, to other companies. In addition, we established a development-ori-ented subsidiary in the United States in 2001 with the aim of narrowing the focus of our research elds and accelerating development. Furthermore, we began joint development of new drugs with U.K.-based GlaxoSmithKline. As a result, we made steady progress in our drug development pipeline. In particular, we received a large amount of royalty income from the hyperlipidemia treatment Crestor , which was out-licensed to AstraZeneca. The product launched in the United States in 2003 and went on to be sold in over 100 countries worldwide. Its runaway success made Shionogi one of the world's largest pharma-ceutical manufacturers.

However, less than two weeks later on September 15, Lehman Brothers led for bankruptcy, causing the business environ- ment to implode and share prices to plummet. Two drugs that we were planning on selling through Sciele Pharma stalled at the nal stages of development. Further complicating matters, operations initially suffered from various problems, including those related to quality and supply, placing the Sciele employ-ees under even greater pressure. Dr. Isao Teshirogi, Shionogi's president, did not waver. He held fast to his continuing belief that the path to long-term success lies overseas. Still, this was a particularly dif cult period for the Company, which had been working for many years to build an overseas sales network. As Crestor lacked an overseas sales channel, we out-licensed it to AstraZeneca. This meant the only pro t Shionogi received was in the form of royalty income, effectively limiting our potential growth. While Sciele Pharma initially operated at a loss, eventually our in-house developed gynecological treatment Osphena helped us build a foundation for growth in the U.S. market.Two Major Turning Points (2008-2017) Purchase of U.S.-Based Sciele Pharma and Ensuing DisarrayHaving broken free from corporate overdependence on antibiotics, Shionogi purchased U.S.-based Sciele Pharma, with the ultimate aim of full-scale entry into the U.S. market. Immediately following this acquisition, the collapse of Lehman Brothers touched off the global nancial crisis, throwing our undertaking into disruption. To make matters worse, the patent for Crestor , which had been bolstering our results, was nearing the end of its term. The future of Shionogi was at stake. First Major Turning Point(Stock price)2013200 04006008001,000 2014 2015 2016 (FY)(Millions of pounds) Tivicay Triumeq Reduced royalty rate (by several percent)Established minimum royalty income (hundreds of millions of dollars per year, to 2020)Extended licensing period (by 7 years, to 2023) 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2023 (FY)Old agreement New agreementCrestor , a hyperlipidemia treatment discovered in-house, grew to blockbuster status both in Japan and overseas. At its peak in scal 2013, the product earned a remarkable \u00a565.7 billion in royalty income, propelling the Company's results. In 2013, with just three years to go before the end of the Crestor patent, we modi ed the licensing agreement with our U.K.-based business partner AstraZeneca to lower the royalty rate in exchange for extending the period to 2023. With this change, we success-fully secured an earnings base to underpin medium- and long-term growth after the patent ends while moderating the timing of the so-called Crestor cliff, which had been our big- gest management issue. Although we extended the period of royalty payments for Crestor , we have been steadily working to develop a future mainstay product. That product, which we developed in-house and out-licensed to ViiV Healthcare, is Tivicay the combina- tion drug containing it Triumeq have grown into blockbusters, selling \u00a31,318 million worldwide in scal 2015. Despite the large decline in royalty income from Crestor , overall royalty income for scal 2016 rose to \u00a5114.9 billion. Although Tivicay was jointly developed by Shionogi and ViiV Healthcare, our agreement changed in 2012. ViiV Healthcare received the rights to Tivicay and related products while Shionogi acquired 10% of ViiV Healthcare's shares so that the Company receives dividends as a ViiV Healthcare shareholder in addition to royal-ty income. As ViiV Healthcare's performance has risen, so too have dividends, earning Shionogi over \u00a510 billion in 2015. Through these efforts we have completely overcome the Crestor cliff. New Growth Driver: Anti-HIV Agent 2017 2019 The Crestor cliff forecast in the 3rd Medium-Term Plan We overcame the Crestor cliff by amending contracts related to Crestor and anti-HIV agents.

This plan identi ed infectious diseases and pain / CNS dis- orders as core therapeutic areas. It also outlines our vision of growing as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company underpinned by impressive strength in small-molecule drug dis-covery. Under the plan, we aim to realize our Company Policy of striving constantly to supply the best possible medicine to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve. We focused business resources on strategic areas to boost sales while working to continuously improve business opera-tions to lift pro ts. Thanks to these efforts, we are poised to achieve our initial scal 2020 targets for ordinary income and return on equity (ROE) two years ahead of schedule. However, the environment surrounding Shionogi's business is changing. Going forward, we expect stark impacts from social upheaval, such as deteriorating solvency for health insur-ance systems as graying populations lead to increased and diversifying medical needs. We therefore updated SGS2020 in October 2016. We set new, higher business targets and, with the aim of becoming an indispensable member of society, we outlined a new vision: Growing in service to society as a drug discovery-based phar-maceutical company. When setting our new targets, we focused on new growth beyond 2020. To achieve this growth without relying on royalty income, we set targets for three categories: growth, ef ciency, and shareholder returns. For our growth targets, we clari ed what constitutes a new product. We aim to swiftly maximize product value and provide new value to society by focusing business resources on these new products, mainly in the core therapeutic areas of infec-tious diseases and pain / CNS disorders. We subsequently set new numerical targets for growth for scal 2020: \u00a5200 billion in net sales of new products and \u00a5150 billion in ordinary income. As for our ef ciency targets, one is to raise business ef - ciency by enhancing our business management and cash cre-ation capabilities. Another is to pursue ef cient and effective development as well as in-house drug discovery. We then set the following numerical targets: return on invested capital (ROIC) of at least 13.5%, a cash conversion cycle (CCC) of 5.5 months, and an in-house drug discovery ratio of at least 50%. ROE and DOE remain our KPIs for shareholder returns. We will continue to maximize corporate value while balancing shareholder returns, strategic business investment, and growth-oriented investment.

Of the \u00a5338.9 billion generated in net sales, \u00a5115.7 bil- lion was attributable to royalty income on overseas sales. Although royalty income from Crestor , a hyperlipidemia treat- ment out-licensed to the U.K.-based AstraZeneca, had long bolstered our results, its patent came to an end in 2016. The mainstay products that will take over from Crestor are the HIV treatments Tivicay and Triumeq , which were developed in- house and out-licensed to ViiV Healthcare. Sales of these prod-ucts have steadily expanded, with royalty income for scal 2016 exceeding \u00a5100 billion. As for S-033188, a new antiviral drug for treating infl uenza that is expected to become a lead- ing product further down the line, we already signed a licens-ing agreement with Switzerland-based Roche. In Japan, prescription drugs account for 90% of our net sales. The domestic market is stagnant due in part to declining drug prices, with generics expected to enter the market in rapid succession after patents for mainstay products expire. The concentration of resources on strategic areas is therefore a clear management priority in the run-up to 2020. We will con-tinue to build a pro t-generating business structure that is not dependent on royalty income.

This included domestic prescription drug sales of \u00a5158.0 billion, which struggled to overcome the decline from transferring the rights of off-patent drugs.* Sales from overseas subsidiaries and exports dropped slightly to \u00a529.2 billion, but surging royalty income hit \u00a5115.7 billion, up 13.7% year on year. Operating income totaled \u00a5108.2 billion, up 18.3%, setting a record for the second year in a row. Ordinary income came in at \u00a5123.0 billion, up 22.0%, setting a record for the fth year in a row. Thanks to the rise in operating income, pro t attributable to owners of parent increased 25.8% to \u00a583.9 billion, setting a new record. As a result, return on equity (ROE), the indicator that shows how much pro t was generated from the capital shareholders invested in the Shionogi Group, reached 16.3%.Higher Royalty Income Global sales of Tivicay , the anti-HIV agent out- licensed to U.K.-based ViiV Healthcare, and the combination drug Triumeq amounted to over \u00a32.6 billion, or around \u00a5360.0 billion. Royalties from ViiV Healthcare totaled \u00a573.3 billion, up 8.1% year on year. As business remained rm, the dividend income from ViiV Healthcare grew due not only to an increase in the regular annual dividend but also to the addition of an interim dividend. Royalty income for Crestor from U.K.-based AstraZeneca decreased 30.6% to \u00a533.0 billion due to a change in the royalty rate. This decline, howev-er, was outstripped by the increase in royalty and dividend income from ViiV Healthcare. * Drugs with generic versions available because their patents have expired or their extension reevaluation period has lapsed.

Sales of our top seven products amounted to \u00a599.1 billion, up 2.7% year on year. As a result, these seven products accounted for 62.7% of the Company's total domestic prescription drug sales, up 3.2%. In addi-tion, Shionogi transferred the rights of 24 off-patent drugs during the scal year, further clarifying its shift to business centered on new drugs and free from reliance on off-patent drugs. In overseas businesses, we formed two strategic alliances: one for the opioid-induced constipation (OIC) treatment Symproic with Purdue Pharma, a leader in the U.S. pain treatment market; and another for the postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) treatment Osphena with Duchesnay, which specializes in obstetric and gynecological businesses. We will continue to pursue ef cient operations by making full use of these alliances while ef ciently stewarding our own business resources. Looking ahead, we aim to run a highly produc-tive business that focuses on hospital markets by selling such treatments as in-house developed injectable antibiotics and treatments for thrombocy-topenia associated with chronic liver disease. 28 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017 Higher Royalty and Dividend Income \u0081 Tivicay and Triumeq royalty income rose \u00a532.8 billion year on year. \u0081 Dividend income from ViiV Healthcare grew.

Shionogi has identi ed the following eight changes.1. Impact of graying populations worldwide2. Economic pressure on healthcare systems3. Growing problem of drug-resistant bacteria and viruses 4. Rising social needs for longer healthy life expectancy 5. Greater challenges in drug discovery6. Accelerating pace of industry-academia col- laboration 7. Increasing number of intra- and cross-indus- try partnerships 8. Tighter focus on therapeutic areas by major pharmaceutical companies There is an increasing need for us to leverage our own strengths to respond to these changes in the environment.Remaining Goals Shionogi has identi ed the following goals pertain- ing to domestic businesses, overseas businesses, and productivity.Domestic Business GoalsExpand our lineup of new products, which Cymbalta , Mulpleta , and sublingual dust mite allergens.Overseas Business GoalsEnsure sales and pro t contributions from overseas, including the United States\u2014the largest market\u2014and China\u2014a growing market.Productivity GoalsImprove per-employee net sales and operating income excluding royalty income. We updated SGS2020 in light of the achievements, remaining goals, and responses to changes in the environment in scal 2016. In scal 2017, we will continue working to realize the new vision outlined in the update: Grow in service to society as a drug discovery-based pharmaceutical company. (See page 20 for more details.) 29 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017Performance and OutlookWHAT WE DO SPECIAL FEATURE HOW WE DO IT OUR VALUE CREATION FINANCIAL SECTION Measures for Fiscal 2017 In scal 2017, net sales of prescription drugs in Japan are expected to decline due to the transfer of the rights of off-patent drugs in the previous year. Generic versions of strategic products in Japan are expected to enter the market at the end of scal 2017. Royalty income from Crestor will decline due to the change in the agreement made in scal 2013. And selling and general expenses will rise with the launch of multiple new products. Aiming to achieve the targets set out in SGS2020, Shionogi has positioned scal 2017 as the starting point for ramping up its global competi-tiveness as a company. In domestic businesses, we will continue focus-ing business resources on new products, including Cymbalta , the constipation (OIC) OxyContin tablets, and sublingual Actair tablets for house dust mites, to quickly expand sales. In overseas businesses, we have been conduct-ing ef cient operations using fewer of our own business resources while maximizing the product value of Symproic and Osphena through strategic alliances formed with Purdue Pharma and Duchesnay. Furthermore, as we build a highly effective business base, we are preparing to establish highly productive business operations for ce derocol and lusutrombopag, which are exclusively for the hospi tal market and expected to go on sale in the near future. In both domestic and overseas businesses, we aim to improve productivity as well as per-employee net sales and operating income excluding royalty income by continually enhancing business opera-tions.

To achieve sustained growth, compa-nies require a solid base of capable personnel. We are working to train new leaders through a diverse range of personnel training programs for young, mid-level, and executive-level employees. The President's Management Seminar, which I lead, was set up to train senior managers, while the Management Seminar is run by division heads who conduct training programs to foster Shionogi's future leaders. The President's Management Seminar began in 2012 and each year around 10 people are chosen to participate by attending monthly seminars, for a total of seven to nine semi-nars, over the course of the year. Five years have passed since the seminars began, and there are now over 40 graduates of the program, including four current corporate of cers. Through this program, Shionogi trains its next generation of leaders by developing tenacious human resources who can consider issues from a Companywide perspective. 31 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017Performance and Outlook *1 Medical representative (MR): Employee who provides, collects, and disseminates information with the aim of encouraging appro priate widespread adoption of prescription drugs. *2 Medical liaison (ML): Employee who, based on scienti c discussions with doctors, helps to maximize product value and ne-tune currently marketed drugs.WHAT WE DO SPECIAL FEATURE HOW WE DO IT OUR VALUE CREATION FINANCIAL SECTION The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's Equal Opportunity Employment & Work-Life Balance Award (December 12, 2016) Shionogi has worked to promote the active participation of women in the workplace, centering its efforts on working teams set up in the headquarters of each department, including the R&D and Sales departments. This has led to the steady retention of female employees and an increase in female managers. The Company received an award in recogni-tion of these positive results. Selected as Health & Productivity Stock for 2nd Straight Year and Recognized as a Health & Productivity Management Organization (February 21, 2017)The Health & Productivity Stock selection program started in 2015 as a joint effort between the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The program selects listed companies that undertake strategic mea-sures aimed at managing the health of their employees. Shionogi was among 24 companies selected in 2017 and the only pharmaceutical company. The Health & Productivity Management Organization Recognition Program began in 2017 as a joint effort between METI and the Nippon Kenko Kaigi, which comprises leaders of businesses, medical organizations, and local governments. The program cooperates with insurers to recognize companies that conduct excellent health management. In 2017, Shionogi was among the 235 companies selected for recognition. Received Kurumin Certi cation from the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare (Since April 2011) Based on the Act on Advancement of Measures to Support Raising Next-Generation Children, this certi - cation is given by the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare to companies that support employees rais-ing children. Shionogi received this certi cation for introducing a child support system that enables employees to raise their children while building their careers and a work schedule system that enables a range of different working styles. Barrier-Free Communication Project This project mainly includes employees who have hearing impairments. It was launched with the aim of eliminating barri-ers to communication and supplying the best possible medicine as stated in the Company Policy. In scal 2016, we intro- duced an application for internal use that converts speech to text and added subtitles to the Shionogi Group's television commercials.Topics Our Measures to Promote DiversityEnsuring Both Innovation and Healthcare Affordability At Shionogi, we believe that ensuring both innova- tion and healthcare affordability is vital to growing in service to society as a drug discovery-based phar-maceutical company. To ensure both, we need to pursue ef ciency centering on small-molecule drug discovery and to continuously enhance business operations. We continue to raise the ef ciency of the value chain centering on our strength of small-molecule drug discovery and continuously discover new drugs. We also promote external alliances that rou-tinely produce innovations from synergies with Shionogi's drug discovery capabilities. As for the development candidates these pro-cesses produce, we ensure effective and ef cient launches with regular ne-tuning through optimal planning as we attempt to maximize product value. In addition, by continuously improving business operations from the perspectives of production, pro-curement, logistics, inventory management, quality, reliability, pharmaceuticals, and safety, we will con-tinue to safely and economically provide innovative and high-quality products. Moreover, the six newly founded domestic Group companies and the rest of the Shionogi Group are working to strengthen and improve busi-ness operations. We are all also aiming to ensure both innovation and healthcare affordability by reforming work practices, promoting diversity, addressing the needs of society (extending employ-ment for older workers and ensuring equitable pay), and improving productivity. 32 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017 Shareholder Returns We will continue striving to maximize corporate value while balancing future-oriented investments and stra-tegic business investments. We implement sharehold-er return policies that provide all our shareholders with a stake in Shionogi's medium- and long-term growth. In scal 2016, Shionogi made steady progress under SGS2020, and, with the aim of enhancing shareholder returns and capital ef ciency, the Company acquired 6,802,100 shares of common stock between November and December 2016 as part of its shareholder return policies. In addition, Shionogi retired 22 million shares of common stock on January 10, 2017. The 22 million shares had accounted for 6.27% of all shares issued and out-standing. Shionogi increased its annual dividend by \u00a510 from the previous scal year to \u00a572 per share, gener- ating a total return ratio of 69.1%. We increased div-idends because we achieved record net sales, ordinary income, and operating income in scal 2016. Turning to our priority benchmarks for divi-dends, return on equity (ROE) reached 16.3%, and dividends on equity (DOE) rose to 4.5%. Going forward, we will continue implementing shareholder return policies that provide all our share-holders with a stake in Shionogi's growth.Dialogue with Investors and Corporate Governance Around 40% of Shionogi's shares are held by foreign- ers. While we, of course, hold meetings in Japan, we also spend a considerable amount of time engaging in dialogue with institutional investors in the United States, Europe, and the rest of Asia. I personally han-dled 142 of the nearly 400 investor outreach activi-ties that took place in scal 2015. I value the opportunity for dialogue with investors. Each conver-sation provides a source of sound criticism from a fair vantage point. I talk about my ideas in a straightfor-ward manner, and investors tell me whether they think it's good or bad from their perspective. We strive to use this input to maintain balance in man-agement. Let me provide two examples. In terms of governance, the Company adopted an outside director system in 2009, the year after my appointment as President. From around 2005 or 2006, we started elding more questions and com- ments about Japanese corporate governance, mainly from overseas institutional investors. Today, over half of our Board of Directors (6 of 11, or 54%), including Audit & Supervisory Board members, is comprised of outside directors. I think this accomplishment was enabled by our efforts to listen to frank opinions about the Company during conversations with inves-tors, and our determination to make advances. More recently, from around three or four years ago, we began getting more questions about non- nancial information, including management's views on corporate growth and coexistence with society. This especially arose through dialogue with European investors. Incorporating non- nancial information into action policies and other corporate matters is not always easy, but we are taking a range of steps to achieve this end, such as publishing an integrated report each year since scal 2015.Dialogue with Investors, Corporate Governance, and Shareholder Returns FY2016: Acquired \u00a535 billion of common stock Retired 22 million shares (6.27% of total issued shares before retirement) FY2014: Acquired \u00a530 billion of common stock 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 (FY)0204060100 80 40 4246526272(Yen)Dividends per Share Increased dividends for 5th straight year 33 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017Performance and OutlookWHAT WE DO SPECIAL FEATURE HOW WE DO IT OUR VALUE CREATION FINANCIAL SECTION Advancing Our Discovery Research Program, Utilizing Our Peptide Drug Discovery Platform while Focusing Research on Small-Molecule Drug DiscoveryValue Creation Process Discovery Research 34 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017 Drug development candidates 1.

A cardiovascular disease program, which has been licensed to U.S.-based MedImmune, entered Phase I clinical trials. Development assets in the eld of diabetes have been out- licensed to global pharmaceutical companies. Multiple drug discovery programs using peptide drug discovery platform technology have commenced.In scal 2016, the Shionogi Group advanced its discovery research program, utilizing its peptide drug discovery platform while focusing research on small-molecule discovery for the creation of FIC and LIC compounds. As a result, the Company discovered multiple develop-ment candidates and drugs currently under development in core therapeutic areas (infectious diseases and pain / CNS dis-orders) and frontier therapeutic areas (obesity / geriatric meta-bolic disease and cancer / immune disorders). In addition, we have been working tirelessly on drug dis-covery through open innovation. By engaging in joint research with companies and academic institutions around the world, the Group has enhanced its drug discovery program and built up development assets that will become competitive strengths.Society's Needs for New Drugs New, Higher Expectations The pharmaceutical industry is under increasing pressure to discover revolutionary new drugs while also striving to meet expectations for affordable healthcare. To Meet Expectations and Grow in Service to Society, We Must: Provide Reliable and Effective DrugsImprove Healthcare AffordabilityImprove Success Rate of In-House Drug Development Develop high-quality, high-value products that ful ll needs Deliver relief and reliability to allReduce cost of goods sold and achieve streamlined, insightful development Realize sensible cost performanceApply CMC research from the initial stages of drug discovery and developments Provide new solutions to drug discovery researchCollaborating with PeptiDream on Nonstandard Peptide Drug Discovery Founding PeptiStar for R&D, Manufacture, and Sale of Nonstandard Peptide APIsShionogi entered into a joint R&D agreement with PeptiDream in February 2016 to discover nonstandard multi-target peptides. We have been moving ahead with this project with the aim of pursuing synergies with our long-established strength in small-molecule drug discovery. In June 2017, Shionogi became the rst Japan- based company to receive a non-exclusive licensing agreement for the use of PeptiDream's unique peptide discovery platform system (PDPS). Under this agree-ment, we have taken on new joint R&D projects with PeptiDream and accelerated innovation by bringing together the strengths of both companies. For more information on PeptiDream, visit the link below. http://www.peptidream.com/ PeptiDream is collaborating with Shionogi and other pharmaceutical companies around the world to advance R&D for nonstandard peptide drugs. However, no country in the world is home to a contract manu-facturing organization (CMO) that can stably provide high quality nonstandard peptide active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). With this in mind, Shionogi, PeptiDream and Sekisui Chemical signed an agreement in August 2017 to establish PeptiStar, a new CMO pos-sessing specialized technology for nonstandard peptide drugs, with the aim of helping to expand the market for these drugs. Underpinned by the knowl- edge and technologies related to nonstandard peptide drugs pos-sessed by PeptiDream, this new venture will bring together exper-tise and knowhow from across Japan. The company will strive to promote R&D into methods of synthesizing and manufacturing peptide APIs in Japan, which leads the world in this area, as well as to realize the manufacture and sale of these APIs. For an overview of PeptiStar, refer to the press release dated August 7, 2017. http://www.shionogi.co.jp/company/news/2017/qdv9fu00000173iz-att/170807.pdf (Japanese only) 35 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017In the updated version of SGS2020 released on October 31, 2016, Shionogi outlined two growth strategies looking toward 2020: 1) addressing society's needs and 2) ensuring both innovation and healthcare afford-ability. Through our efforts, we aim to help build a sustainable society and achieve our vision of growing in service to society as a drug-based pharmaceutical company.Value Creation Process Ensuring both innovation and healthcare affordability through small-molecule and nonstandard peptide drug discovery Develop drugs with intracellular targets, which are dif cult for antibody-based drugs.Achieve balance with healthcare affordability by reducing manufacturing costs.Innovation Healthcare Affordability Small-molecule drugs Nonstandard-peptide drugs Antibody-based drugs Molecular weight 500 or below 500 to 2,000 Around 150,000 Speci city Medium to high High High Side effects Few to moderate Few Few Intracellular targets Targetable Targetable Untargetable Manufacturing costs Low Low High Responding to Society's Changing Needs for New Drugs and Establishing Four New Synthesis TechnologiesWHAT WE DO SPECIAL FEATURE HOW WE DO IT OUR VALUE CREATION FINANCIAL SECTION CMC Research*1 In scal 2016, we were able to establish a solid foundation of new CMC technologies, including synthesis technology to modify peptides with very low solubility, uniformity technology for ultra-low doses, formulation technology for inhalation drug delivery systems (DDSs), and highly sensitive analytical technology that meets global standards. Furthermore, to meet society's need for the discovery of revolutionary new drugs that take into account healthcare affordability, we will continue to take measures aimed at eco-nomically providing patients with high value-added products. We succeeded in establishing a method for synthesizing peptides by changing the structure of peptides with low solubility to make them highly soluble, more than doubling the yield while reducing impuri-ties to less than one fth. This technology has enabled the manufac- ture of APIs for the development of cancer peptide vaccines.*1 Chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) research encompasses API manufacturing process research, pharmaceutical development research, and quality control research. 36 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017Under conventional methods of testing for residual metals in pharmaceutical products, successful detection required on the order of several dozen ppm, but was still unable to identify indi-vidual metal types. Now, however, we are able to detect less than 1 ppm and identify individual metal types. We achieved this by introducing inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) following the adoption of new standards by the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). We were subsequently able to re ne this technology as a base for analytical techniques that are effective on less than 0.1 ppm, can still pinpoint speci c met- als and require less time for con guration. Difficult-to-Synthesize Peptides with Poor Solubility Poorly soluble peptides are difficult to synthesize and purify. s\u00003YNTHESIZES\u0000PEPTIDES\u0000BY\u0000MODIFYING\u0000THE\u0000MOLECULAR\u0000STRUCTURE\u0000 to be readily soluble s\u0000-ODIFIED\u0000STRUCTURE\u0000IS\u0000THEN\u0000CONVERTED\u0000INTO\u0000TARGETED\u0000PEPTIDES\u000eSynthesis Technology Using Structural Changes to Improve Physical Properties This enables API manufacture and facilitates development of cancer vaccines.Peptide Synthesis Technology Overcomes Poor Solubility Formulation Technology for Inhalation DDSsUniformity Technology for Ultra-low Doses Conventional Method Highly Sensitive Analytical Technology that Meets Global Standards Uniformity in low-dose formulations is challenging.APIs and excipients bond during mixing.

This technology enables the manufacture of the 0.2 mg naldemedine tablet. To develop inhalation drug delivery systems (DDSs), active ingredi-ents need to be micronized. This, however, allows the ingredients to aggregate very easily, making it hard to reach the lungs. Shionogi has succeeded in micronization technology for inhala-tion DDSs that promotes good absorption into the lungs by form-ing an optimal complex with the micronized API. This technology enables ef cient delivery of drugs to the lungs and trachea, mak- ing inhalation around 40 times more ef cient. This innovative technology serves as a base that can be applied to a wide range of development candidates.Naldemedine Opioid-induced constipation (OIC)\u0081 Acquired approval in Japan and the United States, and applied for approval in Europe Ce derocol Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections\u0081 Completed global Phase II trials for complicated urinary tract infections \u0081 Began global Phase III clinical trials for hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia S-033188 Infl uenza infections\u0081 Began global Phase III clinical trials Cymbalta \u0081 Acquired approval in Japan for additional indication of relieving osteoarthritis- associated pain Abuse-deterrent OxyContin tablets \u0081 Acquired approval in Japan Intuniv Attention-de hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\u0081 Acquired approval in Japan Actair sublingual tablets \u0081 Applied to additionally treat pediatric patients in Japan Development Achievements In scal 2016, with the implementation of the Shionogi Group's rst independent full-fl edged global Phase III clinical trials, the Group worked to manage the cost of the trials and strengthen its global operations. As a result, we were able to receive approval in Japan and the United States for the in-house discovered naldemedine and apply for approval in Europe. As for ce derocol, the treatment candidate for multidrug- resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections, we nished global Phase II clinical trials for complicated urinary tract infections and are advancing with global Phase II clinical trials for hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia. We are presently conducting Phase III clinical trials in Japan and overseas on S-033188, a drug candidate to battle infl uenza with a new mechanism of action. Cymbalta acquired approval in Japan for an additional indica- tion of osteoarthritis-associated pain in December 2016. As for abuse-deterrent *1 OxyContin tablets, a treatment for chronic pain, we applied for marketing approval in Japan and, in response to a request from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's study group, *2 applied for an additional indication for relieving moderate to severe chronic pain. In March 2017, we received approval in Japan for Intuniv , the attention-de cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatment that we have been jointly developing with Ireland-based Shire plc. And as for Actair sublingual tablets, we have applied in Japan to treat children between ve and 11 years old in addition to the current adult patients.

Nevertheless, sales of strategic products continued to expand in the previous s- cal year. Sales of our top seven products *1 amounted to \u00a599.1 billion, up 2.7% year on year. As a result, these seven prod-ucts accounted for 62.7% of the Company's total domestic prescription drug sales, up 3.2%. In addition, Shionogi trans-ferred the rights of 24 off-patent drugs during the scal year, further clarifying its shift to business centered on new drugs and free from reliance on off-patent drugs.

It reduces the risk of atherosclerotic diseases and affords physicians and patients a greater sense of sat-isfaction and peace of mind. Crestor OD tab- lets were developed using Shionogi technology to improve patient adherence. The tablets are hard yet disintegrate rapidly.Cymbalta is a serotonin and norepinephrine reup- take inhibitor approved as an antidepressant in more than 100 countries. It is recommended as the rst-line treatment for diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) in domestic and international guidelines. Cymbalta received approval in Japan for the additional indication of pain associated with bro- myalgia in May 2015 and for the additional indica-tion of chronic lower back pain in March 2016. Pirespa is the world's rst drug to be indicated for idiopathic pul-monary brosis. Pirespa is expect- ed to inhibit the decrease in vital capacity and slow the progression of idiopathic pulmonary brosis.Shionogi-developed Finibax is a carbapenem antibiotic for injection with strong antibacte-rial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There is increasing expectation surrounding this product's effectiveness as a treatment for serious and intractable infections such as sepsis, pneumonia, and peritonitis.Rapiacta is the world's rst neuramini- single-dose intravenous drip infusion, Rapiacta can be expected to produce reliable treatment bene ts, enabling it to be used to treat outpa-tients and hospitalized patients in all age groups, from infants to the elderly.Irbetan is a long-acting angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) with a powerful hypotensive effect lasting 24 hours that helps protect organs from metabolic syndrome. Shionogi also sells the drug as part of combination formu-lations, such as AIMIX combination tablets with calcium antagonist amlodipine, and IRTRA combination tablets with diuretic trichlormethiazide, contributing to the treat-ment of hypertension through a family of Irbetan products. A combination of 12-hour sustained- release OxyContin tablet and immedi- ate-release OxiNorm powder enables more effective relief of cancer pain.

Looking ahead, we aim to run a highly productive busi- ness that focuses on hospital markets by selling such treat-ments as in-house developed injectable antibiotics and treatments for thrombocytopenia associated with chronic liver disease.Global Business Operations Shionogi INC.,CEO, John KellerTransforming Our Business Structure through Strategic Partnerships 40 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017Following Osphena's launch in 2013, we began delivering it to patients in the United States who were suffering from moderate to severe dyspareunia associated with postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA). As a result, prescriptions for the drug exceeded 9,000 per week and totaled over one million. In addition, we have largely completed the clinical trials required to request FDA approval for the additional indication of vaginal dryness associated with VVA. However, under the Medium-Term Business Plan SGS2020, we are focusing business resources on the core therapeutic areas of infectious diseases and pain / CNS disorders. In the development pipeline, there is not another candidate to fol-low Osphena in the gynecological eld. To maximize the product value of Osphena going forward, we have shifted to a partnership with Duchesnay in the U.S. mar-ket. This positions the future of the drug with a leading company in women's health that seeks to realize Osphena's full potential and continue investment. To sharpen our focus on a few select strategies, Shionogi Inc. (SI) had to under-take a drastic reorganization. The results have been favorable enough to contribute to the successful implementation of SGS2020. In scal 2017, we leveraged our alli- ance with Purdue Pharma to concentrate on the new and early launch of Symproic while preparing for entry into hospital/highly specialized markets with ce derocol and lusutrombopag, which both fall into our core therapeutic area of infectious dis-eases. SI has entered the critical phase following rebirth. By focusing on what we need to do with fewer business resources and maximizing the potential of our new products, we aim to break even in scal 2018 and go into the black in scal 2019.Board of Directors Back row Shiono, Isao Teshirogi, Ph.D. Basic Views and Guidelines on Corporate Governance The Shionogi Group has created a corporate governance structure to make its Company Policy - the Group's corporate philosophy - a reality worldwide. In accordance with the spirit of Japan's Corporate Governance Code, the Group de nes corporate governance as a structure for transparent, fair, time-ly and decisive decision-making that pays due attention to the needs and perspectives of shareholders, customers, employ-ees, local communities and other stakeholders. Based on this, the Board of Directors formulated the Group's Basic Views and Guidelines on Corporate Governance in October 2015 to real-ize the best possible corporate governance. In accordance with the Group's Basic Views and Guidelines on Corporate Governance, the Shionogi Group will ful ll its duciary responsibility to shareholders and its obligations to all stakeholders in order to deliver sustained growth and increase corporate value over the medium and long term.Corporate Governance Structure The Shionogi Group has adopted a Company with a Board of Auditors governance structure to support ef cient manage- ment oversight. Under this system, the Group is working to strengthen the audit capabilities of our auditors and the moni-toring functions of the Internal Control Department to ensure business execution is based on appropriate management deci-sions. In order to separate business management and business execution, the directors are responsible for making manage-ment decisions in line with the Group's medium- and long-term plans, while the executive of cers are responsible for implementing business strategy, resulting in business execu-tion based on rapid and fl exible decision-making. Half the Company's directors are outside appointments and we plan to enhance their supervisory functions further to reinforce man-agement oversight.

Aiming to strengthen the board's oversight of business execution, we appointed two out-side directors in scal 2009 and added another outside director in scal 2012 to promote highly transparent and equitable manage- ment by drawing on perspectives from outside the Company. In scal 2015, we appointed our rst female director to the board and increased the number of directors to six in order to strength-en management further and promote diversity. All three outside directors are independent appointments and are tasked with ensuring accountability and a high level of transparency in man-agement. The Board of Directors is advised by the Nomination Advisory Committee and the Compensation Advisory Committee, which are chaired by outside directors. To ensure management decisions are equitable, these committees carefully assess the aptitude of candidates for director positions, the impact directors have on business management, and the suitability of individuals for cer-tain roles and their respective levels of remuneration. Audit Framework To ensure directors and each organization in the Company con-duct their duties in a legally compliant and appropriate manner, the Company has established systems to enable members of the Board of Auditors and the Internal Control Department, which is responsible for conducting internal audits, to carry out audits of business execution and exchange opinions with the representa-tive directors as required. The Board of Auditors has ve members, comprising two standing members and three outside members. All three outside members of the Board of Auditors are independent appoint-ments. The members of the Board of Auditors attend meetings of key management bodies, such as the Board of Directors and the Corporate Executive Meeting, providing their opinions as necessary. Also, in accordance with the corporate auditing stan-dards, members of the Board of Auditors conduct business and accounting audits to verify whether directors and corporate of -cers responsible for business execution are carrying out their duties in a legally compliant and appropriate manner. Business Execution Framework Shionogi has introduced an executive of cer system to support dynamic and fl exible business operations, enabling the Group to respond rapidly to signi cant changes in the operating environ- ment. The Company has also established the Corporate Executive Meeting as a body to discuss business execution. It is composed of directors, auditors and the corporate of cers responsible for business execution and meets every week in principle. The Corporate Executive Meeting is a forum for discussing issues relat-ed to business execution and important management matters. Role and Composition of Advisory Committees Nomination Advisory Committee The Nomination Advisory Committee supports the Board of Directors in an advisory role. The committee is chaired by an out-side director and is tasked with assessing the suitability of candi-dates for the position of director in a fair and equitable manner. Compensation Advisory Committee The Compensation Advisory Committee is also an advisory body for the Board of Directors. The committee is chaired by an out-side director and assesses appropriate levels of compensation for directors in accordance with their duties.

The following is a summary of the results. Based on the above, we assess that the Company's Board of Directors is operating appropriately and its effectiveness has been secured. We will use the results of this self-evaluation as a basis for making continuous improvement to make the Board of Directors even more effective.1. Framework In our evaluation, the Board of Directors has secured the number of independent outside directors necessary for strengthening oversight of business execution and conducting fair management from an out-side perspective. The Board further secured the necessary framework from the viewpoint of securing various elements and diversity, includ-ing diversity of expertise and experience, by reappointing an outside director with expertise in nance in 2016. 2. Roles and Responsibilities To enhance reporting on operation of compliance and internal con-trols, which was an issue in the previous scal year, and reporting on management development, the status of compliance activities was reported at meetings of the Board of Directors, and the status of management development was reported at meetings between out-side directors and the president to exchange opinions. In view of the improvements above, in our evaluation, the Board of Directors engages in constructive discussions on supervision of business execution and decision-making on important matters that have an impact on the Company's management, and ful lls its roles and responsibilities, including supervision of business execution, man-agement development and risk management. The Board of Directors plans to continue to enhance reports on compliance, the operation of internal controls, and management development, and will also supervise business execution, manage-ment development and risk management. 3. Operation To enhance the quality and quantity of information provided to the Board of Directors, which was an issue in the previous scal year, the general manager in charge of the Corporate Executive Meeting pro-vided explanations on topics discussed at the Corporate Executive Meeting, the deliberative body for business execution, when making advance brie ngs on Board of Directors meeting documents. In view of the improvements above, in our evaluation, the Board of Directors is operating appropriately from the standpoint of schedul-ing the Board of Directors meetings, providing the Board of Directors meeting documents and other information and securing the meeting time necessary for active discussion with free and constructive debate and exchange of opinions by all members, including outside directors and auditors. To further stimulate discussion, the Board of Directors will enhance advance brie ngs and secure time for deliberation of impor- tant and highly specialized matters. 43 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017Corporate GovernanceWHAT WE DO SPECIAL FEATURE HOW WE DO IT OUR VALUE CREATION FINANCIAL SECTION Members of Boards (As of June 30, 2017) Directors 44 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017Akio Nomura Outside Director 1998 Representative Director and President, Osaka Gas, Co., Ltd. 2000 Director, West Japan Railway Company2003 Representative Director and Chairman, Osaka Gas, Co., Ltd.2008 Outside Director, Royal Hotel, Ltd.

Domestic Sales of Prescription Drugs Sales of the top seven strategic prescription drugs in Japan remained firm, increasing 2.7% year on year to \u00a599.1 billion. Despite the effect from NHI drug price reductions, overall sales of strategic products continued to increase. As a result, these seven products accounted for 62.7% of the Company's total domestic prescription drug sales, up 3.2%. In addition, Shionogi transferred the rights of 24 off-patent drugs during the fiscal year, further clarifying its shift to business centered on new drugs and free from reliance on off-patent drugs. 2. Exports and Overseas Subsidiaries Sales from overseas businesses fell 1.7% year on year to \u00a529.2 billion despite the contribution from the licensing and sale of products from our U.S.-based subsidiary Shionogi Inc. In overseas businesses, we formed two strategic alliances: one for the opioid-induced constipation (OIC) treatment Symproic with Purdue Pharma, a leader in the U.S. pain treatment market; and another for the post-menopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) treatment Osphena with Duchesnay, which specializes in obstetric and gynecological businesses. We will continue to pur - sue efficient operations by making full use of these alliances while efficiently stewarding our own business resources. 3. Royalty Income Global sales of Tivicay, the anti-HIV agent out-licensed to ViiV Healthcare, and the combination drug Triumeq amounted to over \u00a32.6 billion, or around \u00a5360.0 billion. Royalties from ViiV Healthcare totaled \u00a573.3 billion, up 81.1% year on year.Gross Profit The cost of sales rose 4.0% to \u00a577,777 million and the cost of sales ratio improved from 24.1% in fiscal 2015 to 23.0% in the year under review. As a result, gross profit increased 11.0% year on year to \u00a5261,113 million. Operating Income and Profit Attributable to Owners of Parent Operating income increased 18.3% year on year to \u00a5108,178 million, setting a new record high for the second year in a row. Profit growth was buoyed by our continuing efforts to promote more efficient use of selling, general and administrative expenses, despite our ongoing commitment to research and development. Reflecting growth in operating and other income, profit attributable to owners of parent increased by 25.8% year on year to \u00a583,881 million, a new record high for Shionogi. Cash Flows In fiscal 2016, net cash provided by operating activities totaled \u00a5111,903 million, an increase of \u00a59,613 million compared with the previous fiscal year. This mainly reflected the increase in profit before income taxes, which out- stripped the increase in income taxes paid. Net cash used in investing activities totaled \u00a531,644 mil- lion, a decrease of \u00a51,251 million compared with the previ- ous fiscal year. The improvement mainly reflected increased proceeds from time deposits (with original maturities exceeding three months), despite a decrease in proceeds from short-term investments. Net cash used in financing activities totaled \u00a557,411 mil- lion, mainly for purchases of treasury stock and cash divi-dends paid. As a result, cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2017 totaled \u00a5149,324 million, an increase of \u00a521,580 mil- lion compared with the end of the previous fiscal year.Management's Discussion and Analysis49 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017Net Sales and Profits Capital Investments The Shionogi Group (Shionogi & Co., Ltd. and its consoli- dated subsidiaries) continued to invest in manufacturing, research and development, and marketing facilities to increase sales, reduce costs and support the smooth opera- tion of the business in areas such as new product launches and research and development. In fiscal 2016, capital investment by the Shionogi Group totaled \u00a59,659 million, a decrease of \u00a5284 million, or 2.9%, year on year. Capital investment by Shionogi & Co., Ltd. totaled \u00a58,793 million. Spending was mainly focused on manufacturing facilities at the CMC R&D Division Tokushima Site. Most investment projects were funded from internal sources. There were no sales or disposals of property, plant and equipment during the fiscal year that had a material impact on the Group's manufacturing capabilities. Assets, Liabilities and Net Assets As of March 31, 2017, total assets stood at \u00a5670,271 mil-lion, an increase of \u00a530,632 million from a year prior. Current assets increased \u00a527,774 million from the end of the previous fiscal year, mainly reflecting an increase in cash and cash equivalents as well as in notes and accounts receivable. Property, plant and equipment increased \u00a5114 million from the end of the previous fiscal year. Investments and other assets increased \u00a52,744 million from the end of the previous fiscal year due mainly to an increase in market-ing rights, which more than offset a decrease in investment in securities attributable mainly to exchange rates. Current liabilities increased \u00a518,612 million due primarily to increases in accrued income taxes as well as notes and accounts payable for construction. Long-term liabilities declined \u00a5315 million. As of March 31, 2017, total net assets stood at \u00a5526,211 million, a year-on-year increase of \u00a512,335 million. Shareholders' equity rose \u00a526,752 million, mainly reflecting an increase in profit attributable to owners of parent and a decrease in distribution of retained earnings. Total accu-mulated other comprehensive income declined \u00a513,870 million due primarily to the impact of exchange rates. Share subscription rights increased \u00a564 million to \u00a5416 million and non-controlling interests declined \u00a5611 million to \u00a53,475 million.Dividends When updating its Medium-Term Business Plan Shionogi Growth Strategy 2020 (SGS2020) in October 2016, Shionogi raised its target dividend on equity (DOE) ratio upward to at least 4.0%, from 3.5%, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Sales of anti-HIV drugs by ViiV Healthcare are growing steadily, as are royalties for these drugs. The Group owns a 10% stake in ViiV Healthcare and these shares are deliver - ing dividend growth. In addition to the firm sales growth of Shionogi's new products and the steady progress of its R&D activities, the Company acquired and retired treasury stock during fiscal 2016. Given these factors, the Company paid a year-end dividend of \u00a538 per share for fiscal 2016, up \u00a54 from the previous year. Including the interim dividend, the Company paid a full-year dividend of \u00a572 per share.WHAT WE DO SPECIAL FEATURE HOW WE DO IT OUR VALUE CREATION FINANCIAL SECTION 50 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017Millions of yenThousands of U.S. dollars 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2017 For the years ended Millions of yenThousands of U.S. dollars Property, plant on equity [ROE] 5.4 7.3 4.8 11.9 6.0 8.1 17.5 9.2 9.4 13.6 16.3 Payout ratio 29.3 29.6 59.9 31.2 66.9 49.4 21.1 37.9 39.2 emissions (Thousand tons - CO 2)*1\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 104 87 93 89 84 68 69 68 Amount of waste generated (t) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 6,218 4,961 4,744 4,564 4,275 and electric vehicles (%)*2\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 40 49 80 91 91 93 100\"Accelerating toward significant strides\" Reinforced R&D and enhanced global operating structure Focused on priority therapeutic areas (infectious diseases, pain and metabolic diseases) Acquired US-based company Sciele Pharma, Inc.11-Year Performance Highlights *1 The electric power CO 2 conversion uses internally specified figures.

Subsidiaries March 31, 2017 1. Basis of Preparation The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Shionogi & Co., Ltd. (the \"Company\") and its consolidated subsidiaries (collec-tively, the \"Group\") are prepared on the basis of accounting princi-ples generally accepted in Japan, which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards, and are compiled from the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan. In preparing the accompanying consolidated financial state- ments, certain reclassifications have been made to the consolidated financial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a format which is more familiar to readers outside Japan. In addition, the notes to the consolidated financial statements include certain information which is not required under accounting principles generally accepted in Japan but is presented herein as additional information. Certain reclassifications of previously reported amounts have been made to conform the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2016 to the 2017 presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on consolidated profit or net assets. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a) Principles of consolidation and accounting for investments in affiliates The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all companies controlled directly or indirectly by the Company. The Company has not applied the equity method to its invest- ments in four affiliates, including TAKATA Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2017 since the effects on profit and retained earnings on the accompanying consolidated financial statements were immaterial. Investments in affiliates not accounted for by the equity method are carried at cost. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The fiscal year end of seventeen overseas consolidated subsidiar - ies is December 31, which is different from that of the Company. These subsidiaries are consolidated by using the financial state-ments as of and for the year ended December 31. The fiscal year end of one overseas consolidated subsidiary is June 30. For consoli-dation purposes, financial statements for this subsidiary are pre-pared as of and for the year ended December 31. As a result, adjustments have been made for any significant transactions tak-ing place during the period from January 1 to March 31. (b) Foreign currency translation All monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign curren-cies are translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and the gain or loss on each translation is cred-ited or charged to income. Revenue and expense items arising from transactions denomi- nated in foreign currencies are generally translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the respective transaction dates. Gain or loss on foreign exchange is credited or charged to income in the period in which such gain or loss is recognized for financial report-ing purposes. Assets and liabilities of the overseas consolidated subsidiaries are translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses of the overseas consolidated subsidiaries are translated into yen at the average exchange rates. The components of net assets excluding non-controlling interests are translated at their historical exchange rates. Adjustments result-ing from translating the foreign currency financial statements are not included in the determination of profit or loss and are reported as \"Translation adjustments\" in accumulated other comprehensible income and \"Non-controlling interests\" in the consolidated bal-ance sheet. (c) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and in banks and other highly liquid investments which are readily convertible to cash subject to an insignificant risk of any change in value and which were purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. (d) Short-term investments and investments in securities Securities are classified into three categories: trading securities, held-to-maturity debt securities or other securities. Trading securi-ties, consisting of debt and marketable equity securities, are stated at fair value. Gain and loss, both realized and unrealized, are charged to income. Held-to-maturity debt securities are stated at amortized cost. Marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at fair value with any changes in unrealized holding gain or loss, net of the applicable income taxes, reported as a sepa-rate component of net assets. Cost of securities sold is determined by the moving average method. Non-marketable securities classi-fied as other securities are carried at cost determined by the mov-ing average method. Investments in investment partnerships are stated at the amount of net assets attributable to the ownership percentage of the Company. (e) Money in trust for cash management Money in trust for cash management is carried at fair value. (f) Derivatives Derivatives are carried at fair value. (g) Inventories Inventories are principally stated at lower of cost, determined by the average method, or net selling value. (h) Property, plant and equipment (other than leased assets) Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The useful lives of property, plant and equipment are summa- rized as follows: Buildings and structures 2 to 60 years Machinery, equipment and vehicles 2 to 17 yearsWHAT WE DO SPECIAL FEATURE HOW WE DO IT OUR VALUE CREATION FINANCIAL SECTION 60 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017 Significant renewals and additions are capitalized at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred. (i) Intangible assets (other than leased assets) Amortization of intangible assets is calculated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Expenditures relating to computer software developed for inter - nal use are charged to income as incurred unless these are deemed to contribute to the generation of future income or cost savings. Such expenditures are capitalized as assets and amortized by the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives, generally a period of 5 years. (j) Leases Finance lease transactions that do not transfer ownership are depreciated to a nil residual value over the period of the lease con-tract using the straight-line method. (k) Goodwill Goodwill is amortized over periods of no more than 20 years by the straight-line method. (l) Research and development expenses Research and development expenses are charged to income when incurred. (m) Income taxes Income taxes are calculated based on taxable income and charged to income on an accrual basis. Certain temporary differences exist between taxable income and income reported for financial report-ing purposes which enter into the determination of taxable income in a different period. (n) Allowance for doubtful accounts The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries provide an allow-ance for doubtful accounts at an amount calculated based on their historical experience of bad debts on ordinary receivables plus an additional estimate of probable specific bad debts from customers experiencing financial difficulties. (o) Provision for employees' bonuses Provision for employees' bonuses is provided at the estimated amount of bonuses to be paid to the employees in the following year. (p) Provision for sales returns The Company provides a reserve for sales returns at the amount of estimated loss expected to be incurred subsequent to the balance sheet date based on a product sales margin and historical sales return ratio. Certain consolidated subsidiaries provide a reserve for sales returns at the amount of estimated loss expected to be incurred subsequent to the balance sheet date based on total product sales and historical sales return ratio. (q) Retirement benefits The asset and liability for retirement benefits are provided based on the amount of the projected benefit obligation after deducting plan assets at fair value at the end of the year. The retirement benefit obligation is attributed to each period by the benefit formula basis. Prior service cost is amortized as incurred by the straight-line method over a period of 10 years, which is within the estimated average remaining years of service of the eligible employees. Actuarial gain or loss is amortized from the year following the year in which the gain or loss is recognized, principally by the straight-line method over a period of 10 years, which is within the estimated average remaining years of service of the eligible employees. Unrecognized actuarial gain and loss and prior service cost, net of tax effect, are recognized as \"Retirement benefit liability adjust-ments\" in accumulated other comprehensive income as a compo-nent of net assets in the consolidated balance sheet. (r) Hedge accounting The Company utilizes derivative transactions for mitigating the fluctuation risks of foreign currency assets, liabilities, forecast trans-actions and interest rates of loans from financial institutions. Hedging instruments are forward foreign currency exchange con-tracts, currency options and interest rate swap agreements. Hedged items are foreign currency assets, liabilities, forecast trans-actions and interest rates of loans from financial institutions. Gain or loss on derivatives positions designated as hedges is deferred until the loss or gain on the respective underlying hedged items is recognized. Interest-rate swaps which meet certain condi-tions are accounted for as if the interest rates applied to the swaps had originally applied to the underlying debt (special accounting treatment). Receivables and payables hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts which meet certain conditions are translated at the corre-sponding contract rates (allocation method). The Company evaluates the effectiveness of its hedging activities by comparing the movements of cash flows of hedging instru-ments and the corresponding movements of cash flows of hedged items. However, with regard to the forward foreign exchange con-tracts accounted for by the allocation method and the interest-rate swaps accounted for by the special accounting treatment, the eval-uation of hedge effectiveness is omitted. (s) Distribution of retained earnings Under the Company Act of Japan, the distribution of retained earnings with respect to a given financial period is made by resolu-tion of the shareholders at a general meeting held subsequent to the close of the financial period. The accounts for the period do not reflect such distributions. (Refer to Note 20.) 3. Additional Information Implementation Guidance on Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets Effective April 1, 2016, the Company and its domestic consoli- dated subsidiaries adopted \"Revised Implementation Guidance on Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets\" (Accounting Standards Board of Japan, Guidance No. 26 of March 28, 2016). 4. U.S. Dollar Amounts The translation of yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts is included solely for convenience, as a matter of arithmetic computation only, at \u00a5112.19 = U.S. $1.00, the approximate rate of exchange in effect on March 31, 2017. This translation should not be construed as a representation that yen have been, could have been, or could in the future be, converted into U.S. dollars at the above or any other rate.61 Shionogi Integrated Report 20175.

Policy for determining expected long-term rate of return on plan assetsThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is derived as a combination of the portfolio allocation of current and expected plan assets, and the forward-looking view of the long-term expect-ed rates of return from multiple plan assets at present and in the future. The assumptions used in accounting for the defined benefit plans for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows: 2017 2016 Discount rate 0.8% 0.8% Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (Weighted average) 2.7% 2.8% Expected rate of salary increase (Weighted average) 3.4% 3.4% (3) Defined contribution plans for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 The total contributions paid by the Group to the defined contribu-tion plans were \u00a51,655 million ($14,752 thousand) and \u00a51,879 million for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.11. Income Taxes Income taxes applicable to the Company and its domestic consoli-dated subsidiaries comprise corporation tax, inhabitants' taxes and enterprise taxes which, in the aggregate, resulted in statutory tax rates of approximately 30.8% and 33.0% for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The overseas subsidiaries are subject to the income taxes of the respective countries in which they operate. The effective tax rates for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 differ from the above statutory tax rates for the following reasons: 2017 2016 Statutory tax rates 30.8% 33.0 % Expenses not deductible for income tax purposes 0.2 0.3 Dividends not taxable for income tax purposes (2.9) (2.2) Amortization of goodwill 1.0 1.3 Tax credits (4.3) (5.7) Inhabitants' per capita taxes 0.1 0.1 Difference in statutory tax rates of overseas subsidiaries (1.5) (1.3) Decrease in deferred tax assets due to change in statutory tax rates \u2014 0.0 Increase in valuation allowance 8.7 6.9 Other (0.2) (0.8) Effective tax rates 31.9% 31.6% The tax effects of temporary differences at March 31, 2017 and 2016 which gave rise to significant deferred tax assets and liabili- ties are presented below: Millions of yenThousands of U.S. dollars 2017 2016 2017 Deferred tax assets: Tax loss carry forwards \u00a533,352 \u00a531,720 $297,281 Loss on revaluation of investments in affiliates 18,217 2,007 162,376 Adjustments to the carrying value of investments in a subsidiary 12,462 12,462 111,080 Research and other current liabilities 2,606 2,330 23,229 Loss on revaluation of investments 22,310 Accrued enterprise taxes 1,057 1,460 9,422 Liability for retirement benefits 910 - 8,111 Provision for sales returns 597 920 6,958 6,215 62,020 Valuation 18,027 25,120 160,683 liabilities: Unrealized gain on other securities (8,121) (8,505) (72,386) Reserve for advanced depreciation of property, plant and equipment (1,798) (2,469) (16,027) Investments in securities (1,283) (1,283) (11,436) benefits \u2014 (2,905) \u2014 (4,349) (43,123) Total deferred tax assets \u00a5 1,987 \u00a5 5,609 $ 17,711WHAT WE DO SPECIAL FEATURE HOW WE DO IT OUR VALUE CREATION FINANCIAL SECTION 64 Shionogi Integrated Report 201712. Financial Instruments (1) Overview (a) Policies for financial instrumentsThe Company obtains necessary funding principally by bank bor - rowings and bond issuance under the business plan for its main business for the production and sales of pharmaceuticals. Temporary surplus funds are managed by low-risk financial assets. Derivatives are utilized for mitigating risks described in the latter part of this note and not utilized for speculative purpose. (b) Types of financial instruments and related risk Trade receivables, notes and accounts receivable, are exposed to the credit risk of customers. Trade receivables denominated in for - eign currencies are exposed to the fluctuation risk of foreign cur - rencies. Short-term investments and investments in securities are exposed to fluctuation risk of market price. Trade payables, notes and accounts payable, are due within one year. Certain trade payables denominated in foreign currencies for the import of raw materials are exposed to the fluctuation risk of foreign currencies. Loans and bonds are utilized principally for neces-sary financing under the business plan and those maturity dates are due in three years, at the longest, subsequent to March 31, 2017. Derivative transactions are made for hedging foreign currency fluctuation risk of trade receivables, trade payables, forecasted transactions and intercompany loans receivable denominated in foreign currencies by using forward foreign exchange contracts and currency option contracts. Refer to \"Hedge accounting\" in Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" for informa-tion on hedge accounting such as hedging instruments, hedged items, hedging policy, evaluation method of effectiveness of hedg-ing activities and so forth. (c) Risk management for financial instruments (i) Monitoring of credit risk (the risk that customers or counterpar - ties may default) In accordance with the procedures determined in the Company, the Accounting and Finance Department and related sections of the Company periodically monitor the conditions of major custom-ers, manage collection due dates and balances of each customer and try to identify credit risk of customers with worsening financial conditions at the early stage and mitigate the risk. Consolidated subsidiaries perform the similar credit management in accordance with the internal rules of the Company. The Company enters into derivative transactions with financial institutions with high credit ratings to mitigate the counterparty risk. The maximum amount of credit risk at balance sheet date is rep- resented as the carrying value of financial assets exposed to the credit risk. (ii) Monitoring of market risks (the risks arising from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and others) The Company utilizes forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency option contracts for hedging to mitigate fluctuation risk identified by each foreign currency of trade receivables, pay-ables, forecasted transactions and intercompany loans receivable. The Company continuously reviews securities holdings by moni- toring periodically the market and financial condition of the securi-ties' issuers (companies with business relationships with the Group) and also reviews holding conditions for securities other than held-to-maturities by evaluating the relationship of those companies. The Accounting and Finance Department enters into derivative transactions under the rules determined in the Company and utiliz-es forward foreign exchange contracts and currency option con-tracts within the normal range of transactions. The Accounting and Finance Department manages information on transactions by reporting periodically to the Board of Directors' meetings. Consolidated subsidiaries do not utilize derivative transactions. (iii) Monitoring of liquidity risk (the risk that the Group may not be able to meet its obligations on scheduled due dates) The Company manages liquidity risk with the Accounting and Finance Department preparing and updating cash flow plans on a timely basis and keeping necessary funds based on the reports pre-pared by each department. (d) Supplementary explanation of the estimated fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments is based on their quoted market price, if available. When there is no quoted market price available, fair value is reasonably estimated. Since various assump-tions and factors are reflected in estimating the fair value, different assumptions and factors could result in different fair value. (e) Concentration of credit risk At March 31, 2017 and 2016, 52% and 56%, respectively, of out-standing trade receivables represented receivables due from a spe-cific and large-scale customer. (2) Fair value of financial instruments Carrying values of financial instruments on the consolidated bal-ance sheets as of March 31, 2017 and 2016, their fair values and their differences are shown in the following table. The following table does not include financial instruments for which it is extreme-ly difficult to determine the fair value.

(a) Methods to determine the fair value of financial instru- ments, short-term investments and investments in securities Assets Cash and cash equivalents Since these items are settled in a short time period, their carrying value approximates fair value. Notes and accounts receivable-trade and affiliates Since notes and accounts receivable are settled in a short time peri-od, their carrying value approximates fair value. Short-term investments and investments in securities With regard to short-term investments and investments in securi-ties, fair value of debt securities is mainly determined by quoted market price or price offered by financial institutions and that of equity securities is determined by quoted market price. Refer to Note 5 \"Short-Term Investments and Investments in Securities\" for the information of securities by holding purpose. However, the carrying value of money in trust for cash manage- ment included in short-term investments approximates fair value, because these items are settled in a short time period.Liabilities Notes and accounts payable-trade and affiliates and accrued income taxes Since these items are settled in a short time period, their carrying value approximates fair value. Bonds The fair value of bonds is determined by quoted price offered by financial institutions. Long-term loans The fair value of long-term loans is based on the present value of the total of principal and interest discounted by the estimated interest rates to be applied if similar new loans are made. Derivative transactions Please refer to Note 13 \"Derivative Transactions\" of these notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Shareholders' Equity The Company Act of Japan (the \"Act\") provides that an amount equal to 10% of the amount to be disbursed as distributions of capital surplus (other than the capital reserve) and retained earn-ings (other than the legal reserve) be transferred to the capital reserve and the legal reserve, respectively, until the sum of the cap-ital reserve and the legal reserve equals 25% of the capital stock account. Such distributions can be made at any time by resolution of the shareholders, or by the Board of Directors if certain condi-tions are met. The Company's legal reserve included in retained earnings at March 31, 2017 and 2016 amounted to \u00a55,388 million ($48,026 thousand). Under the Act, upon the issuance and sale of new shares of common stock, the entire amount of the proceeds is required to be accounted for as common stock, although a company may, by res-olution of the Board of Directors, account for an amount not exceeding one-half of the proceeds of the sale of new shares as additional paid-in capital included in capital surplus.

(b) Estimated remaining period was the average period of stock option holders until retirement in accordance with internal regulations. (c) The estimated dividend was calculated at the actual amount for the year ended March 31, 2016. (d) The risk-free rate was based on the average rate of compound interest yield bonds, for which redemption dates were within three months of the estimated remaining period, in the statistics data for long-term interest-bearing government bonds pub- lished by the Japan Securities Dealers Association.WHAT WE DO SPECIAL FEATURE HOW WE DO IT OUR VALUE CREATION FINANCIAL SECTION 68 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017 Because it is difficult to reasonably estimate the number of stock options that will be forfeited, the estimation reflects only the actual number of forfeited stock options. Movements in issued shares of common stock and treasury stock during the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized as follows: Number of shares 2017 April 1,2016 Increase Decrease March 31, 2017 Issued shares of common stock 351,136,165 stock of shares 2016 April 1,2015 Increase Decrease March 31, 2016 Issued shares of common stock 351,136,165 \u2014 \u2014 351,136,165 Treasury stock 25,564,239 5,183 10,400 25,559,022 The decrease in the number of shares of common stock during the year ended March 31, 2017 is due to the retirement of treasury stock. The increase in the number of shares of treasury stock during the year ended March 31, 2017 consists of 6,802,100 shares due to the purchase of treasury stock based on resolution of the Board of Directors and 2,754 shares due to the purchase of fractional shares of less than one voting unit. The decrease in the number of shares of treasury stock during the year ended March 31, 2017 consists of 22,000,000 shares due to the retirement of treasury stock and 16,000 shares due to the exercise of share subscription rights.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Shionogi & Co., Ltd. and its consolidated subsidiar - ies, which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at March 31, 2017, and the consolidated statements of income, com- prehensive income, changes in net assets, and cash flows for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, all expressed in Japanese yen. Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, and for designing and operating such internal control as manage- ment determines is necessary to enable the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. The purpose of an audit of the consolidated financial statements is not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control, but in mak- ing these risk assessments the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Shionogi & Co., Ltd. and its consolidated subsidiaries as at March 31, 2017, and their consolidated financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.

June 21, 2017 Osaka, Japan WHAT WE DO SPECIAL FEATURE HOW WE DO IT OUR VALUE CREATION FINANCIAL SECTION 72 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017Business and Other Risks The main types of risk that might have a significant impact on the Shionogi Group's management performance and financial condition are listed below. Forwar d-looking statements in the text reflect the Group's judgment as of March 31, 2017. (1) Systemic and Regulatory Risk In the pharmaceutical industry, revisions to Japan's National Health Insurance (NHI) system are being considered, includ-ing revisions to the NHI drug price system. These trends could affect the results of the Shionogi Group. In addition, tougher Japanese and overseas regulations in areas such as the development and manufacturing of pharmaceuticals could present the Group with additional expenses or make it difficult for its products to comply with regulations. This could impact the Group's performance. (2) Risk of Adverse Drug Reactions Pharmaceuticals entail the risk of unanticipated adverse drug reactions that could lead to the termination of sales, product recalls, and other outcomes that could affect the results of the Shionogi Group. (3) Pharmaceutical R&D Risk Pharmaceutical R&D requires substantial commitment of resources and time. In addition, new drugs are subject to numerous uncertainties prior to the start of actual sales. (4) Intellectual Property Risk The Shionogi Group uses patents as intellectual property to protect the pharmaceuticals it discovers and generate income from them. However, the various types of intellec-tual property may be unable to provide adequate protec-tion, or may infringe on the intellectual property of third parties. Furthermore, the expiry of intellectual property rights (patents) of pharmaceuticals developed by Shionogi or the launch of generics after such expiry could affect the results of the Shionogi Group.(5) Risk of Dependence on Certain Products Crestor product sales and royalty income from Crestor, Tivicay and Triumeq roughly account for a combined 44% of net sales (fiscal year ended March 31, 2017). If an unex-pected factor were to cause a drop in or the discontinua-tion of the sales of one of these products, this could impact the Group's performance. (6) Risk of Alliances with Other Companies The Shionogi Group engages in diverse forms of alliances with other companies with respect to joint research, joint research, development and marketing, and other activities. These alliances include collaboration with research and development projects, in and out licensing of technologies and also marketing. If such collaboration were to either change or cease, it could impact the Group's performance. (7) Risk of Natural Disasters or Pandemics The sudden occurrence of a natural disaster, pandemic, or other unforeseen incident could lead to the closure of plants, laboratories or other business sites, which could affect the results of the Shionogi Group. (8) Capital Market and Foreign Exchange Risk Fluctuations in stock and foreign exchange markets that exceed the projected range could affect the results and financial position of the Shionogi Group. (9) Litigation Risk Through its business activities, the Shionogi Group is exposed to the risk of litigation related to medication side effects, product liability, workplace disputes, fair trading and other issues. Litigation in those and other areas could affect the results of the Shionogi Group. (10) Other Risks In addition to the above-listed risks, the Shionogi Group's business activities involve various other risks, including those related to regulatory, political, and economic factors. The above list of risks does not include all the types of risks the Shionogi Group is exposed to.73 Shionogi Integrated Report 2017Corporate Information Head Office / Branch Offices Head Office Shionogi & Co., Ltd.
