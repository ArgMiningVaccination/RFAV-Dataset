One of the most interesting alternative medicine approaches of today is the use of Bioresonance therapy. And Bioresonance therapy has often been associated with the holistic medicine. In today's article, we thought that it would be nice if we discussed these two terms separately so that you can understand the difference and perhaps decide on at least one of these two fascinating treatment methods that you can use in the future. What is holistic medicine? Holistic medicine is the term that is being used to describe a form of healing in which the whole body is taken into consideration and not just the single injured or diseased body part. The holistic method looks upon the human body as a true combination of the body, mind, spirit, and emotions and believes that all of them are highly associated with each other, affecting each other's functions and structures and causing problems to develop when one of them is affected. The goal of the holistic medicine is to keep your body, mind, soul, and spirit in BICOM optima\u00ael balance and in order to do so, the holistic medicine teaches its followers how to gain proper balance in their lives. The holistic approach focuses on removing the root of the problem instead of simply reducing the present symptom. Only a professional, holistic practitioner may apply the rules and methods of the holistic medicine. A holistic practitioner may also use every known method and technique from both alternative and conventional medicine in order to help his/her patients. The holistic medicine believes that unconditional love and support can help treat the patient and maintain his/her BICOM optima\u00ael health. The holistic medicine finds a special role in dentistry as a new dental approach has been found - the [holistic dentistry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6942025) which analyses every single part of the patient's life in order to determine the root and cause of the dental problem and to teach the patient how to take better care of their dental health. What is Bioresonance therapy? Bioresonance therapy, also known as BICOM\u00ae therapy, is an alternative [treatment method](https://www.amoils.com/health-blog/what-is-bioresonance-testing-amoils-com/) that is considered to possibly be the most commonly used holistic medicine method worldwide. Developed in Germany, most of the Bioresonance therapy practitioners are found spread around in Germany, but there are numerous practitioners which can be found in other parts of the world as well. The Bioresonance therapy uses the power of the body to heal itself. What is being used during a session of Bioresonance therapy are special applicators linked to a machine, attached to the patient's skin. These applicators help measure the frequencies which are emitted by every single substance, both living and dead, and the machine later analyses it. The Bioresonance approach helps to determine the wrong frequencies which are emitted from the injured or diseased cells and tissue and helps to restore the frequencies back to normal. This is why Bioresonance therapy is also known as restorative therapy. Until today, there has been scientific research that has proven the beneficial effects of the Bioresonance therapy when used against common health issues such as [Rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12511993), [nicotine addiction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25231565), frozen shoulder, [gastrointestinal problems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16582548) and so on. However, more research needs to be done in order to determine every single thing that there is to know about the Bioresonance therapy and its use in the treatment of various medical issues and problems. Bioresonance therapy can be used as a single treatment method, or it can also be used in combination with another treatment method - alternative or conventional. Is Bioresonance therapy safe? Bioresonance therapy has been considered to be one of the best alternative medicine approaches of today. It has been declared as safe, non-invasive and highly-effective. No pain should be felt during a session of Bioresonance therapy. In addition, the Bioresonance therapy does not practice the use of various medications, and until today, there have been no reported complications or side-effects of its use. Knowing this, we can recommend the use of Bioresonance to our readers and to anyone who is interested in trying something new that is both highly-effective and pain-free. Is Bioresonance therapy coved by your health insurance? Because Bioresonance therapy offers the unique chance for fewer medications and invasive procedures - both diagnostic and curative, to be used, that would create the need to change the policy of most hospitals and medicine in general. That said, it would not cause great satisfaction to the pharmaceutical companies and other interested parties. This is the sole purpose why Bioresonance therapy is not covered by the health insurance and probably will never be until we accept the fact that some diseases can be treated using an easier, less expensive and less invasive method. Conclusion Holistic medicine has its fair share of followers, and with a good reason, that is. The holistic approach looks at the human being as a whole instead of looking only at the problems. Bioresonance therapy is one of the most commonly used holistic methods out there in the world, with most Bioresonance practitioners being located now in many countries all over the world. Bioresonance therapy does not use any medications or invasive procedures. What it does use is special techniques to measure and later restore our body's frequencies so that they can be normal as before anything has happened. The Bioresonance therapy is a restorative method that promises to help its patients in their fights against common medical issues such as Rheumatoid arthritis, frozen shoulder, and nicotine addiction apart from many others. The Bioresonance therapy has been and remains to be one of the most commonly used holistic medicine approaches of today with its fascinating solved cases with no pain to be felt. "}
