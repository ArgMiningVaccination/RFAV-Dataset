Artigo em Chin\u00eas | EMBASE | ID: covidwho-20235800 ABSTRACTObjective To explore the core targets and important pathways of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 ( [SARS-CoV-2]) induced [atherosclerosis](AS) progression from the perspective of immune [inflammation], so as to predict the potential prevention and [treatment]of [traditional Chinese medicine](TCM). [Methods]Microarray data were obtained from the [Gene Expression]Omnibus (GEO) database for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [patients]and AS [patients], and the \"limmar\" and \"Venn\" packages were used to screen out the common differentially expressed [genes](DEGs) [genes]in both encyclopedia [genes]and [genomes](KEGG) analyses were performed on the common DEGs to annotate their functions and important pathways. The two [gene]sets were scored for immune [cells]and immune function to assess the level of immune [cell]infiltration. The [protein]- [protein]interaction (PPI) network was constructed by STRING database, and the CytoHubba plug-in of Cytoscape was used to identify the hub [genes]. Two external validation datasets were introduced to validate the hub [genes]and obtain the core [genes]. Immuno-infiltration [analysis]and [gene]set enrichment [analysis](GSEA) were performed on the core [genes]respectively. Finally the potential TCM regulating the core [genes]were predicted by Coremine Medical database. Results A total of 7898 [genes]related to COVID-19, 471 [genes]related to AS progression;And 51 common DEGs, including 32 highly expressed [genes]and 19 low expressed [genes]were obtained. GO and KEGG [analysis]showed that common DEGs, immune infiltration [analysis]demonstrated the [state]of immune microenvironment of COVID-19 and AS. A total of 5 hub [genes]were obtained after [screening], among which [Toll-like receptor 2](TLR2), cluster core [genes]showed strong correlation with [immune process]and inflammatory response in both immune infiltration [analysis]and GSEA enrichment [analysis]. A Conclusion TLR2, CD163 and C1QB were the core molecules of [SARS-CoV-2]-mediated immune inflammatory response promoting AS progression, and targeting predicted herbs were potential [drugs]to slow down AS progression in COVID-19 [patients].
