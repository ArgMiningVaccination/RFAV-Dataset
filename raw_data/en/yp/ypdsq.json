Deepak Chopra's Perfect Health is the original guide to applying the ancient wisdom of Ayurveda to everyday life. Although we experience our bodies as solid, they are in fact more like fires that are constantly being consumed & renewed. We grow new stomach linings every five days, for instance. Our skin is new every five weeks. Each year, 98 percent of the total number of atoms in our bodies are replaced. Ayurveda gives us the tools to intervene at this quantum level, where we are being created anew each day. Ayurveda tells us that freedom from sickness depends on contacting our own awareness, bringing it into balance & then extending that balance to the body. Perfect Health provides a complete step-by-step program of mind-body medicine tailored to individual needs. A quiz identifies the reader's mind body type: thin, restless Vata; enterprising, efficient Pitta; tranquil, steady Kapha; or any combination of these three. This body type becomes the basis for a specific Ayurvedic program of diet, stress reduction, neuromuscular integration, exercise & daily routines. The result is a total plan, tailor-made for each individual, to reestablish the body's essential balance with nature; strengthen the mind-body connection; and use the power of quantum healing to transcend the ordinary limitations of disease & aging\u2014in short, for achieving Perfect Health.
