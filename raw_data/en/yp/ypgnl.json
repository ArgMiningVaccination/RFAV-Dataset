Join Sahara Rodriguez to become a certified Reiki practitioner. Learn the fundamentals of Reiki and how to practice on yourself and others for deep personal healing and transformation. Reiki is an ancient Japanese technique that promotes healing and stress reduction. It is practiced by \"laying on hands\" to or above the body and channeling Chi (life force energy). In today's fast paced world, stress and toxins deplete our life force energy leaving us more vulnerable to illness or dis-ease. Reiki is a simple and safe method to boost our immune system and also works in conjunction with Western medicine. Reiki is a wholistic therapy that supports a person in body, mind and spirit. It can create feelings of peace, relaxation, bliss and overall well being. Class size is limited and students must register in advance to ensure comfort. $275 Reiki 1 Arrival and check in circle Grounding and centering meditation What Reiki is and how to use it History of Reiki and Reiki principles The Power Symbol and how to use it Hand Positions & Reiki self treatment Ceremony for receiving the Reiki symbols After the Attunement: 21 days of self healing How to navigate a healing crisis Closing meditation and group Reiki healing session.
