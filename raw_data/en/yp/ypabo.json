Abstract Pediatric rhabdomyolysis is a common diagnosis that pediatricians need to be able to recognize because prompt treatment can preventpotential complications, such as acute kidney injury. The triggersfor rhabdomyolysis are extensive, with viruses being the mostcommon cause in pediatric patients. The pathophysiology behindrhabdomyolysis is complex and still being researched, but having arm understanding of the cascade that results when muscle injury occurs is essential for proper management. Guidelines for managingpediatric rhabdomyolysis currently do not exist, but this article aimsto review the available literature and give clinicians a general approachto aid in history taking, physical examination, diagnosis, acutemanagement, follow-up, and prevention.

(1) Consensus criteria are lacking, but based on a recent adult literature review, themost-used strict de nition of rhabdomyolysis is a serum creatine kinase (CK) level greater than 5 times the upper limitof normal, or greater than 1,000 U/L ( >16.70 mkat/L), with the pediatric literature often using the same de nition. (2)(3) This laboratory nding is often coupled with the ndings of myalgias, weakness, and pigmenturia. (2) This differsfrom myositis, in which there is muscle in flammation but the cell wall remains intact so there is no or minimal intra-cellular contents leaked into the circulation and the serumCK level is much lower than 1,000 U/L (16.70 mkat/L) or is normal. The triggers for this process are numerous andinclude infections, excessive muscle use, trauma, drugs, metabolic conditions, and myopathies. (4) The exact inci- dence of pediatric rhabdomyolysis is unknown, but 1 study has reported an incidence of 4 cases of rhabdomyolysis per 1,500 pediatric neurology consults in a large tertiary chil- dren 's hospital over a 3-year period. (5) In addition, there are 25,000 pediatric and adult cases reported annually in theUnited States, with many mild cases likely going unrecog- nized. (3) Rhabdomyolysis is a relatively common diagnosisthat most pediatricians will encounter, and, as such, they should have a rm understanding of this disease process. In particular there is a broad spectrum of severity and causalitythat needs to be appreciated to individualize care. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY The pathophysiology of rhabdomyolysis is complex but es- sential for understanding the clinical manifestations of thedisease process. Understanding can be simpli ed by divid- ing the course into 2 broad categories: cell death and therelease of contents that occurs after cell death. Cell Death Muscle injury can occur via either an insult to the cell 's membrane or cellular energy depletion. Both insults even-tually lead to the path of cell death, but the paths they take to get there differ. (6) When the membrane itself is directly injured, free extra- cellular ionized calcium can enter the cell. (2) On the other hand, when cellular energy, or adenosine triphosphate (ATP), is depleted due to impaired production or consumption, the transmembrane 3Na \u00fe/2K\u00fe/ATPasepump no longer can function, resulting in sodium accumu-lation in the cell. (7) To compensate, the 2Na \u00fe/Ca2\u00feex- changer is activated to pump excess sodium out of the cell. (2) As noted previously herein, we again have calcium entering the cell. The cell has a Ca2\u00fe/ATPase pump to eliminate this excess calcium but without ATP cannot do so. (2) Excesscalcium also causes repeated skeletal muscle contraction, further depleting ATP stores. (3) Normally, intracellular sodium and calcium levels are kept low and the potassium level is kept high when cellular homeostasis is maintained with these pumps and channels. (8) In fact, the intracellular concentration of calcium is 10,000 times lower than the calcium concentration in theextracellular space. (1) However, with both paths we have an excess of intracellular calcium, which is catastrophic to cells. This imbalance activates proteases and phospholipases that destroy the cell membrane, allowing further accumulation of calcium. (2) This, in turn, destroys mitochondrial walls, leading to apoptosis and muscle cell necrosis. (2) Release of Cellular Contents Once muscle cell death has occurred, the release of intra- cellular contents into the extracellular space and circulation is responsible for the clinical manifestations we observe in rhabdomyolysis and set it apart from myositis. (6) All of the contents affect the surrounding tissues, including damage to local vasculature, edema, increased compartmental pres- sure, and ischemia. (1) Speci c contents with their systemic effects and how they translate to the clinical ndings we see are as follows: 1. Intracellular fluid is released into extracellular spaces, activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, de- creasing renal blood flow and contributing to AKI. (2) 2. Myoglobin (an oxygen-carrying heme protein in muscle cells) is released, and when levels in the blood exceedthe protein-binding capacity it precipitates in the glo- merular ltrate. (9) Myoglobin goes on to cause AKI via 2 mechanisms. It is broken down into free iron, whichreacts with hydrogen peroxide compounds to generate re- active oxygen species, which damage renal tubules. (2)(10) It also directly reacts with the lipid membrane compo- nents of the kidney to cause further damage. (2)(10) 3. Uric acid (a purine metabolite) is released from nucle- osides and forms crystal deposits in an acidic environ-ment, causing tubular destruction and AKI. (2)(7)(10) 4. Excess potassium, calcium, and phosphorous can lead to a variety of clinical manifestations. (2) Speci cally, hy- perkalemia can cause cardiac conduction distur- bances (that evolve from peaked Twaves to prolonged PR 266 Pediatrics in Review at Health Sciences Library, Stony Brook University on August 19, 2020 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from interval to bundle branch block to ventricular brillation) that can ultimately lead to asystole if unrecognized. Hypercalcemia can cause nephrolithiasis, acute renal insuf ciency, vomiting, constipation, muscle weakness, shortened QT interval, bradycardia, and hypertension. Last, hyperphosphatemia can cause acute 5. Aldolase, CK, lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate trans- aminase also leaked into circu- lation. (8) HISTORY/CAUSES There are a variety of acquired and inherited causes ofskeletal cell injury that signal the process of rhabdomyolysis (Table 1). The most common cause in children is viruses, followed by inherited diseases and trauma/exercise. (3)(11)(12) Viruses and inherited diseases are a more common cause in therst decade of life, and trauma and medications peak as a cause in the second decade. (13) Infections Infections have been cited as the leading cause of pediatricrhabdomyolysis. In fact, viruses account for more than one- third of cases of pediatric rhabdomyolysis. (3) Infl uenza, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus have been repeat-edly reported as responsible viruses. (3) Bacterial infections such as group A b-hemolytic streptococci and salmonella have been documented in the pediatric literature. (3) Last,protozoal infections such as malaria can be culprits as well. (3) Asking for travel history, vaccination status, and history of sick contacts can be helpful in revealing some of these causes. Trauma/Exercise Although trauma is the main cause of rhabdomyolysis in adults, it is less common in children. However, the inci- dence of exertional rhabdomyolysis in teenagers has been increasing. (14) Athletes and those in the military are pop- ulations to consider at risk for rhabdomyolysis due to excessive activity often after a period of being less active during the off season or before training camps. The pres- ence of concomitant factors can put one at higher riskfor exertional rhabdomyolysis, such as high humidity, sickle cell trait, electrolyte abnormalities, dehydration, high BMI, high altitude, or use of medications known to cause rhabdomyolysis. (3)(14) The type of exercise can also increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis. Eccentric contrac- tions, which put tension on and elongate the muscle (such as when running downhill, resistance training, or weight lifting exercises when the muscles are extended), rather TABLE 1.

(3) Overemphasis on a single muscle group, not allowing recovery time between exercises, increasing weight amounts too quickly when weightlifting, and workouts after a practice or a game are other risk factors for developing rhabdomyolysis. (14) In addition, it has been postulated that some people are athigher risk for muscle breakdown in response to exercise than others due to genetic polymorphisms that have been described. (3) Medications/Toxins/Ingestions Medications are a much more common trigger in adults,and it is important to note that more than 200 medica- tions have been cited to cause rhabdomyolysis. (3) The medications listed in Table 1 have been more commonly known to cause rhabdomyolysis and are medications more frequently used in the pediatric population. When obtain-ing a history of the patient it is important to think of these causes and tailor questions appropriately to try to unveil a trigger. A thorough social history should be ob- tained to screen for illicit drug use in adolescents. Known agents include alcohol (acute intoxication or withdrawal symptoms, including delirium tremens and seizures), cocaine, TABLE 1.

(3) Inherited Disorders There are a variety of genetic causes for rhabdomyolysis, many being rare metabolic conditions as listed in Table 1, but they are important to consider when faced with a patient with recurrent rhabdomyolysis. Inherited disorders can be characterized by those of lipid metabolism, glycogen metab- olism, mitochondrial function, muscular McArdle disease (an autosomal recessive dis-order caused by a mutation of the PYGM gene leading to myophosphorylase de ciency) are the most common in- herited myopathies that cause recurrent rhabdomyolysis.(4)(15)(16)(17) It is important to obtain a thorough family history because many of these conditions are inherited. Differences in symptomatic presentation can help differen- tiate between these conditions and be suggestive of an underlying inherited cause. SYMPTOMATIC PRESENTATION The classic acute presentation of rhabdomyolysis includesmyalgias, muscle weakness, and tea-colored urine. Not many other conditions present with this triad, but be mind- ful of other diagnoses if all 3 symptoms are not present. Myalgias are the most common presenting symptom and often the only symptom in pediatric patients, so index of suspicion based on history and severity of myalgias needs to be high. (12) Fever should make you think of an infectious cause or malignant hyperthermia if the patient had exposure toanesthetics recently. If an infectious cause was the trigger, symptoms such as a sore throat or upper respiratory symp- toms may be present. Patients may also present with oli- guria or anuria if AKI is present. (2) It is important to take a history of symptoms associated with exercise and fasting because this can often help un- cover an underlying inherited disorder. In general, one should consider an underlying neuromuscular condition if the symptoms exceed the possible cause. Patients report-ing myalgias and cramps within minutes of moderate- to high-intensity activity, a phenomenon known as \"out of wind, \"should be screened for glycogen storage diseases. (4) Furthermore, a history of resolution of symptoms after resting for approximately 6 to 10 minutes (a phenomenon known as \"second wind \") is suspicious for McArdle disease. (4) A history of stiffness or weakness after low-intensitybut prolonged activity lasting greater than 30 minutes orfever/heat-triggered symptoms is suspicious for a fatty acid oxidation defect. (4) Last, symptoms of rhabdomyolysis afterfasting are suspicious for a mitochondrial disorder. (4) EXAMINATION FINDINGS When patients present with signs and symptoms suspicious for rhabdomyolysis, it is important to rst assess the patient clinically, including completing a full examination and assessment of vital signs to ensure that no interventions are needed emergently. A thorough neuromuscular exam-ination to assess for extremity muscle weakness, tender- ness, and abnormal gait due to pain should be performed. Because compartment syndrome is a known complication of rhabdomyolysis, one should assess extremities for pallor, diminished pulses, tenderness, and paresthesia. Physical examination can also determine underlying causes for rhabdomyolysis. Mental status and pupil size should be assessed because this can provide insight into drug or toxin exposure. Ptosis and ophthalmoplegia can be seen in some mitochondrial disorders and muscular dys- trophies. (4) Hepatosplenomegaly can be seen in Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and glycogen storage diseases. Proximal muscle weakness may indicate a muscular dys- trophy as well. (4) Nasal congestion, rashes, lymphadenop- athy, and pharyngitis can reveal a possible infectious cause. A thorough skin examination for signs of injury, drug use, bites, and stings should also be performed. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES The diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis needs to be made vialaboratory testing as soon as rhabdomyolysis is suspected. Children seen in the outpatient setting should be sent to the emergency department for laboratory testing. Once the diagnosis is con rmed, if not apparent from history, more specic investigative studies to look for an underlying cause should be initiated. Initial Studies When rhabdomyolysis is suspected based on history and examination ndings, initial studies that need to be sent include a serum CK level, comprehensive metabolic panel, microscopic urinalysis, and complete blood cell count to evaluate for electrolyte abnormalities, kidney function, hydration status, and leukocytosis suggestive of infection. Urine and serum myoglobin can also be sent, but limita- tions and disadvantages of these studies are discussed later herein. If electrolyte abnormalities are present, an electro- cardiogram should be obtained and cardiac monitoring with telemetry considered depending on severity. Vol. 41 No. 6 JUNE 2020 269 at Health Sciences Library, Stony Brook University on August 19, 2020 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from Although there are no set criteria for the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, an elevation in CK level is used for diag- nosis by clinicians because it is the most sensitive enzyme marker for muscle breakdown. (3) There is no consensus on the cutoff value in pediatric or adult patients, but most consider more than 5 times the upper limit of normal (or w1,000 U/L [ w16.70 mkat/L]) diagnostic. The CK level rises 12 hours after the initial insult, peaks at approximately2 to 5 days, and returns to normal in most patients 6 to 10 days later. (2) The myoglobin level, which rises before the CK level, can be measured in serum or urine to con rm the diagnosis. (2) However, the drawbacks include a high false-negative rate because it has a half-life of only 1 to 3 hours, and results are not reported in a timely manner. (18) Dipstick urinalysis positive for blood and negative for red blood cells is suspi- cious for myoglobinuria and also supports the diagnosis. Myoglobinuria causes color change in the urine when levels exceed 250,000 mg/L (14,535 nmol/L), at which point more than 100 g of muscle tissue has been destroyed. (19) The incidence of AKI may be lower in children than in adults, with the largest pediatric case series (N \u00bc191) reporting an incidence of approximately 5%. (13) Higherinitial CK levels have been shown to be a risk factor for AKI in pediatric patients. (13)(20) However, larger adult studies have shown that initial CK and myoglobin levels are not good predictors of AKI or mortality. (2) A validated tool for predicting AKI and mortality in adult patients with rhabdomyolysis takes into account age, sex, etiology, and initial levels of creatinine, calcium, phosphate, and serum bicarbonate. (21) Disseminated intravascular coagulation can be a late complication of rhabdomyolysis, so checking coagulationstudies should be considered in those with a delayed diag- nosis, with thrombocytopenia, or who are ill-appearing. (3) Cause-Related Studies Evaluation for a single initial episode of rhabdomyolysis isbased on clinical history and examination ndings. For example, when an infectious etiology is suspected, testingdirected at speci c viruses or cultures for bacteria can be sent based on clinical presentation. In addition, if a med- ication or toxin is suspected, serum drug levels and/or a urine toxicology screen can be obtained. If history strongly suggests or diagnostic evaluation con rms a cause for rhabdomyolysis, no further evaluation is necessary. However, when an initial episode cannot be attributed to infection, exercise, medications, or toxins based on history,physical examination, or diagnostic studies, further evalu- ation is necessary to look into other causes. In addition,those with an initial episode and a personal history of myalgias or a family history of a myopathy should alsoundergo additional investigations. Last, those with more than 1 episode of rhabdomyolysis also deserve further diagnostic studies. In the acute setting, when an inborn error of metabolism is suspected, diagnostic testing should target the speci c disorder suspected. For patients with concern for a glycogenstorage disease, levels of liver enzymes, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and uric acid as well as fasting glucose, ammonia, lactate, and lipid panel can be performed as screening tests. (4) Speci c genetic testing can be consid- ered as well, such as PYGM sequencing for McArdle ease. (4) When fatty acid oxidation defects are suspected,levels of liver enzymes, fasting glucose, ammonia, lactate, ketones, total and free carnitine and acylcarnitines, free fatty acids, urine organic and amino acids, and urine acylglycines can be determined. (4) Speci c gene testing can again be performed as well. (4) When mitochondrial disorders aresuspected, serum lactate, pyruvate, and urine organic and amino acids can be sent for laboratory testing. (4) When it is hard to decipher which inborn error of metabolism couldbe causing symptoms, all of the above can be performed. A pediatric neurologist and a geneticist are often helpful in guiding this initial evaluation as well. Other tests can be helpful at arriving at a cause but are usually requested by a pediatric neurologist in the outpa- tient setting on follow-up. Muscle biopsy will show only nonspeci cndings of muscle injury but will not assist in determining the underlying etiology until 6 weeks to3 months after symptom resolution. (4) At that time speci c enzyme assays can be performed. (4) Findings from elec-tromyography and muscle magnetic resonance imaging canbe suggestive of an underlying myopathy when abnormal once patients are asymptomatic, but these ndings are very nonspeci c and often are only suggestive of a myopathy or muscle in flammation. (4) In patients with recurrent exer- cise-induced rhabdomyolysis, a forearm exercise test can beperformed to screen for a metabolic myopathy by looking at lactic acid and ammonia levels before and after sphygmo- manometer cuff placement. (3) ACUTE MANAGEMENT The Figure gives a general algorithm for the managementof patients with rhabdomyolysis. When patients are diag- nosed as having rhabdomyolysis, they need to be admitted to the hospital for IV fluids, close clinical monitoring, possible consults, and frequent laboratory tests. Admis-sion to the ICU may be required for those with severe 270 Pediatrics in Review at Health Sciences Library, Stony Brook University on August 19, 2020 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from electrolyte abnormalities, arrhythmias, or AKI requiring dialysis. The overall goal in the treatment of rhabdomyolysis is to preserve renal function and prevent AKI. There is consen- sus and evidence that this is achieved via administration of IVfluids. (3) However, there is much variation in the type, rate, and duration reported, without any set guidelines foradult or pediatric patients. (14)(22) Normal saline is the most commonly used fluid choice. (3) The addition of sodium bicarbonate to IV fluids or the use of lactated Ringer solution has been considered in the acute management of rhabdomyolysis because animal stud- ies have shown that alkalinization of urine decreases cast formation. (3) Studies comparing the use of lactated Ringer solution and normal saline showed no difference in the incidence of AKI or the rate of reduction of the CK level. (2) Studies comparing outcomes of those who received normal saline versus IV fluid with sodium bicarbonate are lacking in adult and pediatric patients. (22) Many experts recom-mend adding only sodium bicarbonate to IV fluids if the patient is acidotic. (22) Rate of IV fluid resuscitation practices vary greatly. In adults, a rate of 1.5 L per hour initially is suggested. (3) Some experts recommend using a urine output goal of at least 200 mL per hour for the rst 24 hours and tailoring IV fluid rates accordingly for adult patients. (3)(22) In pediatric pa-tients, many clinicians will give an initial 20-mL/kg bolus a n dt h e ns t a r tt w i c et h em a i n t e n a n c er a t eI V fluids. Additionalboluses can be given and the IV fluid rate can be adjusted based on urine output, serum CK level, and net fluid balance. There are no urine output goals for pediatricpatients published, but given that the recommended urine output is approximately 3 to 4 times normal urine output for an adult, one could hypothesize for children a targeted urine output to be 3 to 4 times the normal urine output for pediatric patients, or approximately 3 to 4 mL/kg per hour. It has been shown that rapid initiation of IV fluids decreases the risk of acute renal failure, speci cally if administered within the rst 6 hours after muscle injury. (22) The addition of mannitol has been postulated to assist in diuresis and, hence, prevent AKI. However, a systematicreview of adult patients by Scharman and Troutman (22) found no bene t over normal saline fluid but did state that it would be reasonable to add if a urine output of 300 mL perhour is not achievable with IV fluid therapy alone, based on expert opinion. In general, more randomized controlled studies need to be performed comparing fluid rates, use of mannitol versus normal saline alone, and use of sodium bicarbonate versusnormal saline alone. Studies are lacking in both the adult and pediatric literature. CK, electrolyte, and creatinine levels should be measured at least twice daily until the CK level is downtrending, electrolyte levels have normalized, and AKI has resolved. However, the frequency of laboratory testing should vary based on the severity of the CK level, rate of rise of the CKFigure. Management algorithm for pediatric rhabdomyolysis.

This requires some clinicaljudgment to ensure that complications are not missed. One can approximate when the CK level should peak based on its half-life and when the insult occurred. If the CK level continues to climb past the approximated peak, one should consider ongoing insult. If the CK level is not normalizing in an expected period, one should consider this to be the patient 's baseline, which would be concerning for an under- lying myopathy. In addition, nephrotoxic medications such as nonsteroi- dal anti-in flammatory drugs should be avoided. Drugs or medications that may have caused rhabdomyolysis shouldbe discontinued. Electrolytes should be replaced as needed. In patients who develop disseminated intravascular coagu- lation, fresh frozen plasma can be given. Pediatric neurology and genetics consults should be con- sidered when there is suspicion for an underlying myopathy based on history or physical examination ndings, espe- cially for patients with more than 1 episode of rhabdomy-olysis. An initial evaluation can begin in the hospital, but often a diagnosis is not made until after discharge giventhat many of these tests take days to weeks to result. A pe- diatric nephrology consult should be considered when AKI is present or the patient has poor urine output despite ag- gressive hydration. A retrospective study performed at a tertiary care center 's ICU reported that 29 of 182 patients (16%) admitted to their PICU with rhabdomyolysis requiredrenal replacement therapy. (11) A pediatric surgeon should be consulted if there is concern for compartment syndrome. Degree of elevation of the CK level has not been shown to be predictive of mortality, and chronic kidney disease is a rare complication of rhabdomyolysis in children requir-ing intensive care. (11) Reported mortality rates in children are 7% to 10%, but all died secondary to their underlying etiology and not rhabdomyolysis. (8) There is no consensus on discharge criteria, but based on expert opinion, patients should be asymptomatic (or greatly improved), with normal electrolyte levels, normal creatinine levels, good oral intake, good urine output, and downtrend- ing serum CK levels. (23) It is also reasonable to ensure that the serum CK level is less than 5,000 U/L ( <83.50 mkat/L) before discharge because this is the lowest abnormal level associated with renal failure in a large study of 2,083 adult trauma ICU patients. (24) FOLLOW-UP In patients with their rst episode of rhabdomyolysis ex- plainable by infection, drugs, or trauma with no personalhistory of myalgias and no family history of myopathy, nofurther evaluation is necessary. (8) These patients shouldfollow up with their pediatrician 2 to 3 days after discharge to ensure continued clinical improvement. If the CK level is still elevated at the time of discharge, it is reasonable to repeat a serum CK level in 4 weeks to ensure normalization of serum CK levels. Although recurrent rhabdomyolysis is not common (studies in pediatric patients have reported an incidence ofw5%-8%), one should assume that when there is recur- rence, the patient has an underlying myopathy until provenotherwise. (25) Patients with more than 1 episode of rhabdo- myolysis, a history of myalgias, or a positive family his-tory of myopathy should undergo initial evaluation as stated previously herein in the inpatient setting in con- junction with a pediatric neurologist and geneticist. They should also follow up in the outpatient setting because many tests cannot be performed in the acute setting and/or may take weeks for a nal result. For athletes, return to play is an important consideration, and there currently are no guidelines for when return to play is appropriate. Cleary et al (26) suggest that return to play issafe when the athlete is afebrile and asymptomatic, the CK level has returned to normal, and myoglobin is no longer present in the serum and urine. When athletes do return to play, types of exercise that are known to cause rhabdomyol- ysis, such as eccentric exercise, should be avoided initially, with a gradual increase in activity. (26) Aquatics has been suggested as an optimal means of return to activity, pro- viding strengthening with less muscle strain and exposure to heat. (26) PREVENTION Prevention of rhabdomyolysis largely depends on the under-lying cause. In children, infectious causes are hard to avoid, but certainly emphasizing the importance of vaccinations and good hand hygiene is always important. To prevent exertional rhabdomyolysis, athletes and those participating in any exercise need to be aware of the importance of gradually easing into exercise, espe- cially after a period of inactivity or less activity. Avoidanceof confounding factors such as heat and dehydration during exercise should be stressed as well. Coaches and players need to be educated and aware of the risk factors for developing rhabdomyolysis. The National Col- legiate Athletic Association established a guideline in 2005, updated in 2013, that stresses following a 5-day heat acclimation period to prevent heat-related illness. Other schools have adopted a similar protocol. (27) Pediatricians 272 Pediatrics in Review at Health Sciences Library, Stony Brook University on August 19, 2020 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from during sports physicals can also be a source of education to athletes. Prevention of rhabdomyolysis in those with underly- ing myopathies involves treating the individual cause suchas avoidance of fasting, dietary modi cations, and instruc- tions on hydration during times of stress, intense activity,and illness. Patients taking medications known to potentially cause rhabdomyolysis should be counseled at medication initia- tion regarding presenting signs and symptoms and to avoid risk factors associated with exertional rhabdomyolysis. In addition, patients undergoing anesthesia should be ques- tioned regarding personal or family history of anesthesiareactions before administration.POTENTIAL QI PROJECTS 1. Improve outcomes of cases of rhabdomyolysis by look- ing at time to treatment and residual effects on kidneyfunction after treatment. 2. Decrease the incidence of rhab domyolysis or increase aware- ness and understanding by educating coaches or incorporating education into sports physical examination visits. 3. Improve detection of patients with a chronic underlying cause for rhabdomyolysis by ensuring that all patients admitted with rhabdomyolysis have a documented causeor a plan for investigating cause if not documented.

Summary Infections are the leading cause of pediatric rhabdomyolysis, but other causes need to be considered when patients do not present with ndings from history, physical examination, or studies suggestive of infection. Based on expert opinion, a serum creatine kinase (CK) level greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal is used for the diagnosis of pediatric rhabdomyolysis. (3) Based on observational studies, intravenous (IV) fluids are the mainstay of treatment for rhabdomyolysis, with greatest prevention of acute kidney injury when initiated within 6 hours ofinsult. (3)(22) Based on observational studies and expert opinion, IV normal saline at a rate that provides urine output of at least 200 mL per hour is recommended for acute management of rhabdomyolysis.(3) For smaller pediatric patients, we can assume that a similar output of 3 to 4 mL/kg per hour would be an appropriate target, but more studies need to be performed to supportthis. There is a lack of randomized controlled trials and no observational study evidence to support routine use of mannitol and sodium bicarbonate in patients withrhabdomyolysis. (3)(22) Based on expert opinion, discharge can be considered once patients are asymptomatic (or greatly improved), with normal serum electrolyte levels, a normal serum creatinine level, goodoral intake, good urine output, and CKlevels (some clinicians use 5,000 U/L [83.50 mkat/L] as a goal given that this is the lowest reported serum CK level associated withacute kidney injury). (23)(24) Based on expert opinion, those with a single episode explainedby an infection, medication, or trauma require no additional evaluation. However, those with recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis, a personal history of myalgias, or a family historyof a myopathy warrant further metabolic and genetic testing.

Prevention of rhabdomyolysis largely depends on the underlyingcause and requires education of clinicians on the risk factors for the disease and education of patients who are at risk for rhabdomyolysis. Populations at risk include athletes and thosetaking certain medications. Handwashing and vaccination areimportant for preventing the spread of infection, which is the most common cause of rhabdomyolysis in pediatric patients.

A 15-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with new-onset tea-colored urine and right calf pain the morning after football practice. He reports that he has beenvomiting all morning and that his muscles are weak. On physical examination his heart rate is 50 beats/min and his blood pressure is 150/100 mm Hg. He was diagnosed as having suspected rhabdomyolysis. Which of the following laboratory abnormalities is most likelyto be seen in this patient and to account for his hypertension? A. Anemia. B. Hypercalcemia. C. Hypermagnesemia. D. Hypokalemia. E. Hypophosphatemia. 2. A 16-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by emergency medical services after her mom found her \"not acting right. \"She is breathing at a rate of 8 breaths/min and her heart rate is 60 beats/min. Her pupils are pinpoint and she is sleepy. The patient is admitted for observation. Over the next 12 hours she starts having emesis and cold shivers, but she does not have a fever. Her creatine kinase (CK) level is 7,000 U/L (116.90 mkat/L). Which of the following is the most likely cause of all of her symptoms? A. Autoimmune disorder. B. Cocaine use. C. Genetic disorder. D. Opioid use. E. Viral illness. 3. A 3-year-old girl is brought to your of ce by her mother with the concern of exercise intolerance. She started playing soccer at preschool and had to sit down after approxi-mately 5 minutes of activity as she was complaining of cramping and muscle pain. Momsays that this happens when she runs in the backyard, but not this bad. She remembers that her cousin had something similar, but the family moved away when he was young and she has not seen them in years. Evaluation for which of the following disorders is mostlikely to diagnose the cause of her symptoms? A. Congenital myopathy. B. Fatty acid oxidation defect. storage disease. D. In flammatory myopathy. E. Mitochondrial disorder. 4. A 6-year-old boy is brought to the clinic for follow-up. He was seen in the emergency department the previous day and was discharged with the diagnosis of in fluenza A. He is still having fevers and now has new-onset arm and leg pains bilaterally. He has not beenhaving good oral intake, and now his urine output is decreased. Serum laboratory studies are ordered and showed a CK level of 5,000 U/L (83.50 mkat/L). He is admitted to the hospital for intravenous (IV) hydration and is started on 1.5 /C2maintenance IV fluids. A recheck of the CK level is ordered for the following day. The following morning duringrounds mom is worried because the repeated CK level is now 20,000 U/L (334.00 mkat/L). The clinical team increases the IV fluid rate to 2 /C2maintenance. In explaining the clinical course to mom, which of the following approaches is the most appropriate for the clinicalteam to take at this point? 274 Pediatrics in Review at Health Sciences Library, Stony Brook University on August 19, 2020 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from A. Ask mom if he has been walking around the hospital because this is the most likely reason for the CK level increase. B. Because of lack of response to fluids, an evaluation for genetic causes of rhab- domyolysis is indicated at this point. C. Explain to mom that a muscle biopsy is indicated at this time to rule out other diagnoses. D. Explain to mom that this is not concerning because it is most likely a laboratory error. E. This is not unexpected because it takes typically 2 to 5 days for the CK level to peak. 5. The patient in the vignette in question 4 was sent home 3 days later with a CK level of 5,000 U/L (83.50 mkat/L). He returns to the of ce 48 hours later for follow-up. A repeated CK level at this time is 3,500 U/L (58.45 mkat/L). The mother wants to know when he can go back to playing tennis with his best friend. Which of the following is the best follow-up plan for this patient? A. Avoid playing sports because he is more likely to get rhabdomyolysis again. B. Order genetic testing; if the results are negative he can restart sports. C. Recheck the CK level in 4 weeks; if normal at that time he can gradually restart sports. D. Return to full sports participation now and premedicate with nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs before exercise for the next 4 weeks. E. Return to full sports participation because the CK level is going down; no repeated CK level is needed.
