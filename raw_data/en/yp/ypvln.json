Virgin Islands Folklife Festival. The Festival was a restaging of the 1990 Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife, which took place on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., and featured the U.S. Virgin Islands and the African country of Senegal. As the term implies, a \"folklife fes- tival\" is a living celebration of the history and cultural lives of the peo- ple of the Islands. At the U.S. Virgin Islands Folklife Festival, many school children from the Virgin Islands had a chance to visit the Festi- val and meet the tradition bearers present from the Virgin Islands and from Senegal. This educational kit is an extension of the festivals held in Washington, D.C. and on St. Croix. It was developed by the Smithsonian Center for Folklife Programs and Cultural Studies, using examples of folklife from the U.S. Virgin Islands and Senegal. The kit introduces students to aspects of the traditional culture of these two culture areas and provides \"building blocks\" to allow students to explore their own regional and family folklife. The kit includes a four-part videotape, maps, pho- tographs, audio tapes, teacher preparation information, background materials written at the student level, student discussion questions and classroom activities. (A complete checklist for the kit is included in Appendix D.) Appendices include vocabulary words, transcripts of the first three parts of the videotape, and resource lists for further study. The following publications are included in the kit for teacher back- ground: 1) a copy of the 1990 Festival of American Folklife program book; 2) a copy of the American Folklife Center's publication Folhlife andFieldworh;3) American Folhlife: A Commonwealth oJ Culture, anoth- er publication of the American Folklife Center. This Guide will help the teacher integrate the kit materials into their existing curriculum plans. It can also be used to plan a special unit on folklife which can last from several days to projects lasting an entire semester. INTRO 3I NTRODUCTION HOW TO USE THE GUIDE The Teacher's Guide includes teacher preparation information, objec- tives and teaching strategies for each lesson, student discussion ques- tions, copies of activity sheets, and ideas for follow-up on each lesson. It also includes maps, line illustrations, reproductions of photographs included in the kit, and printed copies of the narrative of the video available in the kit. The Teacher's Guide for the kit is prepared in the form of four units, each with three lesson plans. The units include ideas for extending the lessons with more student activities relating to that section. Lessons are geared toward particular kit items (videotape, maps, photos, etc.) or combinations of those items. They are arranged in a logical sequence, designed to build upon one another with the goal of providing a good introduction to the folklife of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Senegal. Teachers may also choose to only use a particular segment of the kit and its corresponding lessons. In any case, it is suggested that the teacher begin by showing the first section of the videotape to the class to establish the definition of folklife using examples from the Virgin Islands and Senegal. Materials are written at a student level of 6th grade and up, but may be adapted to lower grades by teachers. The units and lessons are as follows: DESCRIPTIONSUNIT uNrr l; lntroduction to Folhlife This unit uses the first section of the videotape and the complete set of 8\"xI0\" photographs to introduce students to the definition of folklife and some of its forms. ln Lesson One, students view the videotape and discuss what they see. They also engage in an activity related to the videotape. In Lesson Two, students use the photographs to further their understanding of folklife. In Lesson Three, students learn interviewing techniques to collect information about the traditions of their own fam- ily and community, following examples from the fieldwork for the folk- life festivals. INTRO 4INTRODUCT\u00a1ON uNrr 2.' Geography er Cultural Histoty This unit uses the maps, written descriptions of the Virgin Islands and Senegal, selected photographs and the second part of the videotape to further students' knowledge about these two areas of the world and the factors affecting their folklife. ln Lesson One, students read descrip- tions and study the maps to learn basic information about the two cul- ture areas. In Lesson Two, students view the second part of the video- tape in the kit, which focuses on traditional foodways to show how food, its gathering, growing, preparation and serving are reflections of region and culture. In Lesson Three, students collect their own cultural recipes and share with the class the ways rhey reflect their own family and cultural background. uNrr 3.' Music & Storytelling In Lesson One, students watch the storytelling segment of the video and listen to the Senegalese storytelling audio tape as the basis for discussion and a related activity. In Lesson Two, students listen to the music audio tapes and view photographs of musicians, discuss music in Senegal and the Virgin lslands, and form their own \"band.\" In Lesson Three, students explore the relationships between storytelling and music in the two cultures, and compose their own \"musical story.\" uNrr 4.' Folhlife Celebrations ln Lesson one, students view and discuss the third section of the video- tape on traditional celebrations in the Virgin Islands and Senegal. In Lesson Two, students compare photographs of the two celebrations in their home settings and at the Festival of American Folklife ro learn more about the problems and benefits oI restaging a traditional event at a folklife festival. In Lesson Three, students plan their own celebration, using elements of their own tradition and/or creating a new \"tradition\" of their invention. Each unit in the Teacher's Guide begins with teacher preparation infor- mation. A lesson plan is included for each lesson, with copies of perti- INTRO 5INTRODUCTION Mrs. Maqguerita Frett stretches, shapes, and twists \"jawbone\" candy on a marble slab as children anxiously await the cutting and cooling of this homemade treat.nent materials. These materials, along with the set of photographs, maps, student activity sheets, videotape and audio tapes, are found in the complete kit. The Teacher's Guide is designed to give teachers a chance to plan the use of the kit prior to its actual availability in the classroom. Each lesson is designed to be one class session (approximately one hour) in length. Suggested activities can be assigned as homework or completed in subsequent class time. Appendices include vocabulary words of terms that may be new to both teachers and students, written copies of the narration from the video- tape, a list of further resources, and a checklist for the kit . Please refer to this checklist when reassembling the kit when you are finished with it. An evaluation sheet is also included in the appendix folder - please fill it out and mail it to the Center for Folklife Programs and Cultural Studies, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. 20560.

Reading over the transcript of the narration (also in the Appendix) will help explain any confusing portions to students. Look over the photographs carefully and read the captions. Prepare to spend some time with the Festival Program Book to familiarize yourself with the traditions presented at the Festival. Reading the introductory articles about the Virgin Islands and Senegal will give you a basic understanding of the folkiiie of ihese iwo culture areas. If you have received a copy of the booklets Folhlife andFieldworh and AmericanFolhlife: A Commonwealth of Culture, both written by the staff of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, read them for background as well. The resource list in Appendix C will aid you in locating further information if needed or desired. After viewing the videotape and the photographs, engaging in dis- cussion, and completing the suggested activities, students should be able to: . give a simple definition of the rerms \"folklife\" and \"tradition\" . name several examples of folklife from the Virgin Islands and Senegal . recognize one of the functions of a folklife festival (i.e., to introduce a large audience to the folklife of particular parts of the world) . understand that everyone - even themselves - possesses folklife and a cultural heritage . see themselves, their families and their communities as worthwhile subjects of folklife studyUNIT I TEACHER PREPARATION LEARNING oBJECTTVES UNIT I -3UNIT I LESSON ONE: WHAT IS FOLKLIFE? STUDENT In this lesson, you will view the first segment of the videotape, which is EXPLANATION an introduction to folklife using examples from the Virgin Islands and Senegal. After this, you will discuss the videotape. Then, your teacher will introduce an activity which will help you understand \"folklife\" and \"traditions\" better. The videotape lasts about ten minutes. Its main purpose is to define the term \"folklife' with examples from the United States Virgin Islands and the country of Senegal. These cultures were featured at the 1990 Festival of American Folklife, and many of the scenes used in the videotape were shot at the Festival. Other scenes were shot during \"fieldwork\" (work done by folklife researchers in preparation for the Festival) in the Virgin Islands and Senegal. As you watch the videotape, think about the many types of folklife shown. Jot down some notes about the different kinds of folklife you notice and anything else that impresses you about the two cultures. Think about how the people in the videotape learned their skills, and how they pass these skills on to younger generations. Be prepared to discuss these things with your teacher and classmates. If there are some terms that you do not understand, look them up in the Vocabulary located in Appendix A. lf you have trouble understanding any of the persons speaking in the videotape, see the transcript. of the narration (located in Appendix D). DlscussroN I. Name five examples of folklife you saw in the videotape. Which example was most interesting to you? Why? 2. lHow did the people in the videotape learn their skills? Do you UN|T I.4QUESTTONSthink they will pass them on to younger generations? Why or why not? 3. Oia you notice any relationship between the folklife of the U.S. Virgin Islands and of Senegal? If so, explain this relationship. Discuss similarities as well as differences. 4. What do you think visitors to the Folklife Festival learned from the people from the U.S. Virgin Islands and Senegal? How did they learn these things? What do you think you could learn from visiting a folklife festival? 5. How do folklife researchers (folklorists) gather information about traditional culture? 6. oo folklorists planning a festival gather only enough information for the festival program? What do you think happens to any extra information gathered? 7. what are some other uses for folklife documentation (other than using it to plan a folklife festival)? 8.

This exploration will help you identfy the \"folhlife\" in your own life. Follow these steps: 1. Based on viewing the videotape, explain folklife in your own words. Share your explanation with the class. Compare it to the definition included in the vocabulary section in the appendix. 2. a. Write down as many examples of folklife from the videorape as you can. Use the written form of the narration, and/or view the tape again to refresh your memory. Be specific. Mention details as well as you can. Instead of just listing \"foods\" or \"crafts,\" for instance, list particular types of foods or crafts. b. Organize your list into large categories. lJse headings such as \"music,\" \"foods,\" \"crafts\" and list every example you found in these broader categories. Add more examples from your own experience. For instance, if someone in your family makes fish nets or goes fishing, list the type of nets they make or fishing they do. If you learned a story from someone in your family or school, list this. If you have ever danced in a Carnival troupe, list this as well. Ask your teacher, parents, grandparents, classmates, and other friends and acquaintances to help you add examples to your list. 3. Using your list of examples, design your own folklife festival. If your list is very long, you may wish to choose only a certain number UNIT I-7UNIT 1 of examples to highlight - however, choose at least one example from each of your categories. Think about the following: Would all of the musicians at your festival perform on a stage? How often? Would the craftspeople have booths? How would they demonstrate and display their crafts? What would be the best way for the audience to see and./or participate in other folklife activities (dance, foods, storytelling, occupational and domestic skills, etc.)? 4. Draw a diagram or map of your festival space. You may also wish to create a schedule of events at your festival. (For ideas, see the festival site map and schedule of events in the tan section of the Festival of American Folklife program book. Your teacher has a copy of this book.) Share your ideas with your teacher and classmates, and discuss the different spaces you've designed.

THOMAS A troupe of masqueraders parade down the street in the St. Thomas Carnival. (Photo by Myron Jockson) Carnival is the season when everybody comes together as one. People return home to the Virgin Islands for Carnival from hundreds and even thousands of miles away to cele- brate with family and friends. For months prior to the event, people join carnival troupes to participate in the parade. They begin to select themes for their floats and design cos- tumes. The Mocko Jumbies will also be thinking of new ideas for their outfits. Parade participants avidly compete for prizes. The traditional music of Carnival evolved from mas- querading traditions of the past. In the masquerade, musi- cians accompanied paraders, who wore disguises represent- ing characters. Today, brass instruments have been added to the \"scratch\" bands which provide the distinctive sound and rhythm for masqueraders dancing in parades at Carnival. 1.

Two such celebrations, the U.S. Virgin Islands Carnival and the Senegaleselambe, were re-created at the 1990 Festival of American Folklife in Washington, D.C. These events were chosen for presentation so that visitors could learn how tra- ditional arts - music, dance, costume-making, games, food- ways, and storytelling - combine in a folklife celebration. The participants, like these Carnival performers, brought the costumes, musical instruments, and other elements of their traditions with them to Washington, D.C., to show how they celebrate. These photographs will help you understand the difference between the ways Carnival and the lambe are pre- sented in their home settings, and at the Festival. 2. Special Events: C\u00f8rnival at the at a lombe tournament in the farming town of Samba Dia in the Sine region of Senegal. (Photo by A, Lomine Drome) Thelambe is a traditional wrestling match. Lambe tour- naments take place each year in rural towns and cities throughout Senegal in the months ofJanuary and February following harvest time. To win, each wrestler tries his best to force his opponent off balance and onto the ground. A serig- nou mbeur is the specialist who acts as a spiritual coach to the wrestlers and helps them win the match. In farming areas, the wrestlers grow crops and raise cattle at other times of the yea\u00cd, but during the harvest cele- bration, each champion wrestler represents his town\u00ednlambe contests with the champions from other villages. On the day of the lambe people come from miles around to see the fight- ers compete. Before a match, wrestlers parade into the space where the fight will take place surrounded by their support- ers, drummers, singers, and dancers. Wrestlers and their sup- porters make up songs which boast about their strength and how they will win. These ane a lot like some of the rap songs that African-American DJs compose. 3.

From left to right the instruments are: squash (scratch), guita\u00e7 claves, \"ass pipe\" and ukelele. (Photo courtesy Von Scholten Boo Public Librory ond Archives, S\u00bf,Thom os, Virgn /s/cnds) Scratch bands are called \"scratch\" because of the squash gourd which is scraped for percussion. As musician Sylvester \"Blinky\" Mclntosh, Sr., explained, some musicians make their instruments, others grow them. Some of the other instruments played by the band are made from recycled materials, such as the bass instrument called the \"ass pipe\" and the triangle, also called the steel. Scratch bands are best known for traditional quelb\u00e9 and quadrille music, but today they also play popular tunes from the Caribbean and from the mainland. 5. Music/Special Events: Fily Sock, and Souadou Seck sing to the rhythm of gourds which they hold in their hands. Cire Yene Demba Doro Ba (on the left) plays a Toucouleur stringed instrument called ahoddu. (Photo by RickVorgos) The type of music which the women sing is called yela. Dried and emptied gourds like the ones they use as musical instruments are also sometimes used as containers to hold milk and other beverages. This music from the Toucouleur ethnic group is part of a larger tradition of praise singing which has a long history throughout Senegal. Praise songs were sung in the past to honor rulers, heroes, and ancestors and to encourage men going off to war. Some praise songs tell the stories of a person's great deeds and noble character, other songs list the names of many generations of a person's family. In Senegal today traditional singers perform at many occasions - from weddings to political rallies - and can be heard on the national radio station. Only certain families had the right to become praise singers to the courts of the Toucouleur kings. These griot families passed down their skills from one generation to the next. 6.

Domestic IN SENEGAL Anta Diop and Maimouna N'Diaye prepare a typical Senegalese midday meal of fish stew with rice (thiebou-dienne) over an open f\u00ecre atthe 1990 Smithsonian Festival of American Folkli\u00ea, (Photo by B. Honzik) Senegal has a wide variety of foods and the people of Senegal have many ways to prepare them. Although some traditional foods may vary from region to region and from ethnic group to ethnic group, many foodways traditions such as thiebou-dienne andyassa (chicken stew with onions and Iemon) are enjoyed throughout the country. Rice and a sauce combining fish, meat, or chicken with vegetables are the basis for many dishes. One popular vegetable is okra, which is native to Africa. Senegalese cooks add special seasonings such as tamarind preserve, dried fish and conch to give their meals a flavor that is uniquely Senegalese. People from Senegal who live in the United States, like Anta Diop, often send for these seasonings from home. 7. Domestic Folklife: Fish stew in SenegalUNIT2 8. Domestic Folklife: Coohing in the Virgin lslandsUN fi2 ISLANDS Evarista Santiago grates a cassava root to prepare the dough for Puerto Rican turnovers called emponodillos, (Photo by RickVorgos) Virgin Islands cooking uses herbs, vegetables, and fruits both native to the Caribbean and brought to the islands by colonizers from Europe, Asia, and Africa. Basic food sta- ples like cassava and sweet potatoes are originally from the Americas, while plantains and bananas were first brought by the Spanish from the Canary Islands located off the west coast of Africa. Traditional dishes included beef, lamb, pork and chicken - meat from animals introduced by the Europeans. However, local fish are equally important in Virgin Islands cooking. Native and imported fruits such as mango, guava, tamarind, and soursop flavor favorite drinks. Coconut is often used for holiday treats. Cooking traditions a\u00cde as diverse as the ingredients. Hundreds of years ago, traditions came from Africa and Europe. Today, it is more likely that new traditions come from other islands in the Caribbean or from the U.S. main- Iand. 8. Domestic Folklife: Coohing in THE \\/IRGIN ISLANDS Mrs, Felicia Caines weaves a St, John market basket with hoopvine collecled in the forest of St. John. (Photo by Betz Robb) Plants native to the Caribbean characterize the bas- ketry brooms, and hats made in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The traditional St. John market basket, the melon, and the Tortola basket are all made with local hoop vine. According to bas- ketmakers from St. John, when this vine is collected \"in the dark of the moon,\" it is guaranteed to be worm- and termite- free. Basketmakers use the pliable whist reed for small bas- kets, trays, and other domestic items. Women from French- town on St. Thomas continue to make straw hats and baskets with plaited grass, usually brought from St. Barts, the island from which their ancestors emigrated. An African-style broom is made from the fan-shaped leaf of the tyre palm. For this type of broom, tyre palm bun- dles are tied together around a stick that serves as a handle. With the same leaf, on the other hand, a French-style broom is fashioned by weaving strips made from the tyre palm stem. Tiaditionall\u00a1 basketmaking enjoyed great social pres- tige. But materials have become increasingly more difficult to obtain because of changes in land ownership, clearing of forests for homes and for commercial developments, and restricted access to National Park lands. 9. Crafts: Bashetmcthing \u00edn the Virgin lslandsUNIT 2 IN SENEGAL A basketmaker in Dakar: Senegal, displays a variety of basket styles for sale in a local market, (Photo courtesy /NIRASAHEL) People make baskets throughout Senegal. The Wolof, Serer, and Bassari peoples all strong bas- ketry traditions. In rural areas, where grasses and other fibers are readily available, the technologies of basketmaking -coiling, weaving, and twining fibers - are used in various combinations for houses and buildings for storing grain (gra- naries) as well as for containers, mats, fans, and other woven articles of everyday use. In urban a\u00cdeas, basketmakers also use traditional skills and knowledge in the creation of furni- ture. The baskets made by the Wolof have a special signifi- cance for African Americans. Tiaditional African American craftspersons in the Sea Islands along the coast of the Carolinas and in Georgia make coiled baskets using a tech- nique and materials - in this case sea grass - similar to those used by Wolof and Serer basketmakers in Senegal. Historic links between the traditions of the Senegalese and the Sea Islanders (known as Gullah) are suggested by similar- ities in the forms, techniques, and uses of these baskets in the two communities, and by historical records pointing to the presence of substantial numbers of Africans from the region of Senegal who were brought to the Carolinas. I0. Crafts SenegalUNIT2 mit ties in SenegalUNIT2 HEAD TIES IN SENEGAL Women and children at a festive event in Senegal wear a variety of head ties and hair styles. (Photogro\u00deh by /NIRASAHEL) Women in Senegal wear head ties as apart of formal dress and because Muslim tradition requires that married women cover their heads in the company of men who are outside their immediate family. Head ties also offer protection from the hot sun. The ways that head ties are wrapped, like the hair styles that they cover, varied in former times accord- ing to the ethnic group a woman belonged to, her age, and personal style. Nowadays, head ties and hair styles are still an important part of a Senegalese woman's personal adornment, but, especially in large cities like Dakar, there is more choice both in personal style and in the decision whether or not [o wear a head tie. The three older women in the photograph above are dressed traditionally for a special occasion. They all wear head ties, as is expected for women of their age group. The woman second from the left wears a traditional Wolof wig adorned with gold baubles. Note the hair styles of the young woman whose back is turned to the camera and those of the little girls to her right. In Senegal cleanliness, good grooming, personal car- riage, and attention paid to detail in personal adornment are often linked to moral values, such as faida - Wolof for \"self- respect\" - and s\u00bf\u00fa, which means physical cleanliness, moral integrity, and purity of heart. 11.

In older times, head ties were part of women's everyday wear. In the Virgin Islands and at the 1990 Festival of American Folklife, the Heritage Dancers of St. Croix wore head ties to dance quadrille, bringing a West African element to a European dance tradition. Head ties are tied in different ways to identify the woman as single, available or married. If the tie ends in two points, the lady is married. If the tie ends in four points, she is saying, \"I'm willing, I'm available, and I will acceptany- thing that comes my way.\" L2. Costume: Head ties in the Virgin lsl\u00f8ndsUNfi2 13. Commerce/Trade/Products: Marhet in SenegalUNIT2 MARKET IN SENEGAL Foods eaten every day are available in this traditional marketplace on the outskirts of the capital city of Dakar: (Photo courtesy of /NIRASAHEL) Situated on the shores of the well-traveled Atlantic Ocean and also at the southwestern end of ancient trans-Saharan trade routes, Senegal's marketplaces have long been magnets for trade goods from all over the world as well as from within the country itself. Market vendors sell the ingredients for a wide variety of tra- ditional meals prepared at home, household goods and textiles manufactured in factories in Senegal and abroad, as well as tradi- tional crafts created in the workshops of blacksmiths, weavers, cloth dyers, and basketmakers. The Senegalese market is crowded - a virtual kaleidoscope of colors, voices, aromas, and textures. In the cities, the market is open each day of the week. Country markets travel from village to village in the same region, rotating on a regular weekly basis. Market stalls generally open at sun-up and carry on business until the last rays of the sun disappear. The market is a meeting place, where news of the day is spread by word of mouth and greetings are exchanged. Public declarations are made in which everything and everyone is subject to commentary. Negotiation skills and the arts of market display are devel- oped at an early age, as young people both buy and sell with older relatives. They learn quickly that the first price offered opens the bargaining but rarely concludes the sale. They also discover that market stalls where the goods are arrarlged attractively may sell more. Senegalese street vendors who have emigrated to other parts of the world have found these skills are useful in cities out- side Senegal like New York and Paris. 13.

(Photo by Beu Robb) Markets provide a variety of produce, fish, and crafts to meet people's needs. Vendors sit surrounded by \"bush,\" or wild herbs, local vegetables, such as hot peppers for souse, kallaloo (a spinach-like green), and yams, and fruits in sea- son. Customers consult with vendors about the medicinal properties of bush teas, which are prepared from wild herbs. Brooms, hats, mats, and baskets made by local craftspeople are also sold. Farmers from the countryside come mainly on Saturday mornings, when most Virgin Islanders do their shopping. On St. Thomas, the Northside Frenchies, descen- dants of lgth-century French immigrants from the island of St. Barts, provide a great deal of produce and culinary herbs grown on the north side of the island. The \"marriage\" of produce is one of the traditions of the marketplace. For example, a prized herb may be sold together as a \"marriage\" with a more ordinary item, such as a yam, which may not be selling very well. It is improper for a customer to break up a \"marriage\" and purchase one product without the other. In addition to produce markets, there are fish markets, where the local catch of the day is sold. Today's Virgin Islanders may go directly to a known fisherman's docked boat to select and buy their favorite seafood. 14.

Loolt close\u00fe at the photographs showinghead ties in both cultures, and read the inJormation providedby the captions. Then see how many more examples of head ties you can find in the other photographs. Think about the following: . Why are head ties worn in both cultures? Are they worn every day, or for special occasions? . Judging from the photographs, what are some of the different ways to tie the head ties? . Do the head ties match the rest of the women's costumes?'Why do you think this is important? . Why are some women wearing head ties in the photographs and some aren't? . Head ties are worn in the Virgin Islands nowadays only for special occasions. They used to be worn as everyday dress. What changes in the culture do you think caused head ties to become a special occasion adornment instead of everyday dress? uNrr I-lIUNIT I Do the following: . Take a piece of material or a scarf (you can either bring one from home, or your teacher can provide one.) Tfy to tie a head tie on yourself. How did you do? Have a classmate try to tie a head tie on you, and try to tie one on him or her. If you grew up learning to tie and wear a head tie, chances are you had no problem. You may even know how to tie a head tie several different ways. If you never tied a head tie before, chances are you had a big problem! . Find someone who is an expert at tying head ties - maybe your teacher, mother, aunt, neighbor, or grandmother. Have this person give you a \"lesson\" in tying head ties. While you are learning, ask the \"expert\" some questions: . Where did you learn to do this? . How often do you wear head ties? Why? . Are there different ways to tie a head tie, and do they mean different things? . Share your new skill and the information you gather with your classmates! Compare head ties - how many variations are there? Do any of them look like the ones in the photographs? uNrr l-12UNIT I LESSON THREE: FOLKLIFE IN YOUR WORLD The purpose of this lesson is to explore the \"folklife\" in your own life. STUDENT Everyone's life is special and unique, and folklife is a big part of this EXPLANATION specialness and uniqueness. Collecting information firsthand from people by interviewing them is an important way that folklorists learn about culture. An interview is a way of obtaining information by asking questions and writing down or tape recording answers. You can use this technique to gather informa- tion in your own family or community. You will find that this method of learning about culture is exciting and rewarding, and very different from 'Just reading about it\" in books! The activity sheet, \"Folklife in Your World\" will guide you through an exercise collecting more information about an example of folklife in your own experience. Your teacher may assign the first two steps in class and the interview as homework. Before you start your interview, your teacher will lead you in a discussion using the questions below. The teacher will go around the class and ask each student what his or her example will be, and who he or she will interview. If you are having a difficult time deciding on a topic, other students may be able to suggest ideas. Your teacher will review the six questions you plan to ask before you do the interview and will suggest improvements if necessary. The booklet, Foll\u00faife and Fieldworlc, included in the kit, will also help guide you in this activity. l.

Review the examples of folklife from your own experience that you listed in step 2.b. of the \"What is Folklife?\" activity. See if you can add any more examples of folklife from your own life. Did you learn to fish, cook, gather herbs or work with wood from a family member? Can you tell an old story or sing a calypso song? Did an older relative or friend teach you how to play marbles or spin a top? Does your family do anything special on holidays? List as many examples as you can think of. 2. Choose one example of folklife from your own life. Describe it in detail. Where did you learn the skill? How long did it take you to learn it? When do you practice your craft/ sing your song/ cook and ear your special food/ etc.? Share this item of folklife with your class. If possible, bring to class an example of something you made using your folklife skill (a basket, a bunch of dried herbs, a cake), sing to the class one of your songs or tell a story, or teach the rest of the class to play your traditional game. Or, you may choose to bring photographs of your family celebrating a special holiday that you can explain to the class. 3. Usittg this example of folklife from your own experience, think of one or more people who helped you learn about this tradition. Choose one of these people to interview. Here are some helpful suggestions onhow to conduct this interview: . Prepare at least six questions to ask the person you are going to interview. Give the person enough time to answer each question thoroughly before you go on to the next. If you have a tape uNtr l- l 5UNIT 1 recorder, use it, but only if the person to be interviewed agrees to be recorded. If the person has any photographs or objects that relate to your topic, ask to see them and have the person explain them for you. If you have a camera, ask if you can take some photographs. You may take portraits of the person, or photographs of the person doing something related to the item of folklife, like making a basket or cooking. 4. When you have finished your intervieq organize your notes, photographs, tapes and whatever else you have gathered. \"Log\" (make a list of the information covered in) your audio tapes.* Label your drawings or photographs. Make a chart that compares your survey information. 5. Take all of your organized information and write a 100-word summary of your interview. If you took a photograph, or if you have another picture to illustrate your interview (you may draw one, find one in a magazine, or use one of the photographs in the kit, for instance) put it together with your summary to create a complete idea of the tradition you researched. Show your summary to your classmates and find out if they understand the tradition from your explanation. 6. Make a bulletin board or scrapbook of the traditions collected by the class. *A format for logging tapes is suggested on page 30 of a booklet your teacher has called FolhliJe and Fieldworh, published by the Library of Congress' American Virgin lslander observes a scale full of f\u00ecsh being weighed for a customer on a pier on St. Thomas.UNIT2 Study the maps reproduced here and read the background information.

After working with the maps, viewing the videotape, and completing the suggested activities students should be able to: . locate the Virgin Islands and Senegal on a world map or globe . list major features of the terrain, climate and cultural history of the two areas . recognize how foodways - the gathering, preparation and serving of food - can reflect an area's cultural history and geog- raphy . use food traditions to learn more about the cultural history and geography of their own families and communitiesLEARNING oBJECTTVES St, John Market Basket made from hoop vine which grows wild on the island of St. John. UNIT 2.3UNfi2 BACKG ROU N D I N FORMATION: GEOGRAPHY & CULTURAL HISTORY [J.S. VIRGIN The U.S. Virgin Islands is a territory of the United States. It is located in ISLANDS the Caribbean region, and it consists of over 50 separate islands. The three main islands where people live are St. Croix, St. John and St. Thomas. The population of these three islands is about 104,000 people. The islands were home to Arawak and Carib lndians long before Columbus landed in 1493. During its history the U.S. Virgin Islands were settled and colonized by English, Dutch, Danish and French. In the I600s and 1700s, many enslaved Africans, especially those from West Africa, were brought to the islands to work on the large sugar plantations. In t9l7 the islands were purchased by the United States from Denmark and became a U.S. territory. In the 20th century many people from other Caribbean islands, including the British Virgin lslands and Puerto Rico, have made the U.S. Virgin lslands their home. The cultural heritage of the U.S. Virgin Islands, then, reflects a combi- nation of different influences - from Europe, Africa, orher Caribbean islands, and even from the Middle East. These influences can be traced in the dances, the music, the foods, the dress, the stories and the cele- brations of U.S. Virgin Islanders. The culture of the U.S. Virgin Islands was and is further influenced by its terrain and climate. Surrounded by water, and possessing a tropical climate, fishing has always been an important source of income and food. St. Thomas has steep mountains throughout the island making it difficult for planting. Its economy has depended on its deep harbor. St. John and St. Croix have flatter lands better suited for cultivation. In early years, many sugar plantations were located on these islands. Today in St. Croix plantations have been converted primarily to graz\u00edng lands for cattle. On St. John, two thirds of the land is claimed by a National Park. Residents still grow produce for home use. uNtr 2-4UNfi2 Because of their lovely beaches and mild climate, the u.s. Virgin Islands have also become a popular spot for tourists. Senegal is a country located at the wesrernmosr rip of the African conri- SENEGAL nent - in fact, at the closest point to the Americas. The population of the country is about 6.5 million. Roughly I million people live in the capital city, Dakar, which is located on a peninsula on the west coast of the country and bordered by rhe Atrantic ocean. The country also has several other large and modern cities, although many people live in smaller towns and villages. French is the official language, however, the Ianguage spoken most widely is wolof. Ninety-two percenr of the citi- zens of the country are of the Muslim faith. senegal has long been a point of contact and interchange between many cultures. The country was at the southern end of caravan trade routes that crossed the Sahara Deserr from the l2th to the l6th century. This trade brought senegal into conracr with Arabs from rhe Middle Easr, Africans from other parts of the continent, and Europeans. Goree Island, part of senegal, was the last dry rand that many enslaved Africans touched before being torn from their ancestral homes and transported to the Americas (in the I6th and lTth centuries). In the late lgth century the nation was coloni zedby the French and became the capital of French west Africa unril senegal received its indepen- dence in 1960. From the early 20th century it became a center for western trained artists, writers and scholars of French-speaking Africa. senegal is home to many ethnic also migrated to senegal from other African countries, France, Haiti, the French Antilles and the united states. Each group has its own language, and folklife traditions like music and dance, crafts, foodways and storytelling. But the cultural heritage of senegal as a whole has been influenced by the many cuhures with which it has come into contact over the centuries. senegal is a large countrx Lg6,Trzsquare kilometers, 2-5UNfi2 Senegalese woodcarver Abdoulaye \"Gadiaga\" Sene, uses a traditional tool to carve the base of a drum at the 1990 Festival of American Folklife.vast plain where the altitudes are rarely higher than 100 meters. There are 500 kilometers of sea coast which varies from rocky ro sandy. Dif- ferent parts of the country have different climate and terrain. The north is hotter and arid and the sourh lush and tropical. Some parts of the country are similar to rhe U.S. Virgin Islands in climate and ter- rain, and some of the same fruits and plants are grown there. Fishing is the second largest industry and an important source of food. Peanuts and cattle are also important as sources of income and subsis- tence. In recent years, tourism has become one of Senegal's major sources of income. Many people of African descent come to Senegal and make pilgrimages to Goree Island. The governmenr of Senegal is planning a major monument to the descendants of Africans who sur- vived slavery in the Americas. tY'.? 'r-\u00f9 2\u00a1n\u00a1'- /uNtr 2-\u00f3 ,/UNIT2 MAPS 7.

Using the small map that shows where Senegal is in rela- tion to the Virgin Islands, find both places on a world map or globe. Notice the location of these two areas in relation to each other and to the rest of the world. Check the details on the large maps, such as the map \"keys\" (the small boxes that tell what the symbols on the maps mean) and the \"scale\" (the bars that show how many miles one inch represents on the map). Then, answer the questions below.UNIT2 STUDENT EXPLANATION I. How large is Senegal compared to the Virgin Islands? (One way to DISCUSSION think of it: How many Virgin Islands could you fit inro an outline of QUESTIONS Senegal?) 2. How far is Senegal from the Virgin Islands?

What was the trip like? . What is your new \"home\" like, compared to your old one? What do you miss? What seems particularly strange? Is anything similar? . Will you be able to practice any of your Senegalese culture in this new place? If you tr\u00a1 what do you think the plantation owner will think? . Have you ever felt like a \"stranger in a strange place\"? (Perhaps when you traveled to another place where people spoke differently and ate some different foods.) How is this similar and different from the way the slaves must have felt? PART II: Imagine you ore a person Jrom the Virgin Islands today, planning o trip to Senegal for a vqcation. Using the maps and other information, plan your trip using the following questions os a guide. (You may be able to consult uNrr 2- l 5UNIT2 an octu\u00f8l travel agent to help you with some of the information!) . How long will it take to get to Senegal by air? Will it be a non- stop flight?

The foods featured are EXPLANATION \"kallaloo\" from the Virgin lslands, and \"thiebou-dienne\" from Senegal. Both dishes use many of the foods and seasonings that are grown, gath- ered wild, or fished for in these cultures, as well as traditional cooking methods reflecting their histories. Take note of the similarities and dif- ferences in the two dishes. Be prepared to discuss the videotape with your classmates. I. what are the main ingredients of kallaloo and of thiebou-dienne?

Can you think of any dishes in your own experience that are similar to thiebou-dienne or kallaloo? uNrr 2-17UNfi2 FORMATION: FOODWAYS Vl RG I N The diversity of Virgin Islands cooking springs from its multicultural ISLANDS heritage. African fritters, Danish salt fish and herring gundy, British FOODyyAyS black cake, Austrian Vienna cake, Danish candies and Spanish seasoned rice are but a few \"imports\" that come to mind. Native cooking, or spe- cialties of the islands, include meat-filled pat\u00e9s, kallaloo, stew beef, mutton (actually goat) and daub pork served with fungi and sweet potato. Fry fish andJohnny cake are prepared on a coal pot fired up at picnics and food fairs. The coal pot became particularly important after hurricane Hugo made electric home appliances useless. Maubi, ginger beer or fresh tropical fruit drinks complement a traditional meal. In the fall the guavaberry is harvested to make a fruit wine or rum for Christ- mas. SENEGALESE FOODWAYS AND TERANGA - THE ARTS OF HOSPITALITYIn Senegal, treating visitors and guests properly is very important. The Wolof word teranga describes the traditional hospitality observed in Senegal. Such things as laying out a ceremonial cloth for arriving guests to step on, sharing food with a stranger to the village, and presenting gifts to visitors when they depart are ways of showing respect for a guest, and also showing that the host is generous and well brought up. Other small but important gestures of rcranga include waiting for a guest to finish eating before leaving the common bowl and avoiding a loud tone of voice in conversation. These traditions help to build bonds between individuals and families and reinforce the cultural iden- tity of Senegalese people. uNtr 2- l8UN N2 STUDENT ACTIVITY SHEET #5 NOW YOU'RE COOK'NG!

Semes 10 to 12 Serving and eating: To serve and eat your meal Senegalese style, pile the rice in a large wide serving bowl and arrange the meat and sauce in the center with the chicken pieces more or less evenly distributed around the center. Spread a large cloth on the floor and place the bowl in the middle. After guests have washed their hands and removed their shoes, invite them to sit or squat around the bowl. Each guest should eat the portion of food which is directly in front of him or her, taking care to eat only using the right hand. (In Senegal it is considered very bad manners to use the left hand which is used to wash the body.) A good host or host- ess will make sure that there is enough food from the bowl's center in front of each guest and will be sure to invite guests to eat to satisfac- tion. To eat with the right hand, keep fingers together and scoop a mouthful of rice, chicken and sauce squeezing it into a compact ball against the side of the bowl directly in front of you. Then, you should be able to pop it neatly into your mouth. When you have finished eating, and only then, you are allowed to lick the sauce off of your fingers and wash your hands with soap and water. Often, the host or hostess will provide a bowl of warm soapy water and towels for this purpose. A polite guest will eat well, compliment the host or hostess and say sur- naa (\"I'm satisfied\") when finished eating. THREE: COOKING UP YOUR OWN CULTUR/AL HERITAGE In this lesson, you will collect some recipes from your own family, and STUDENT discuss what these foods tell us about the place where you live. Use the EXPLANATION Student Activity Sheet, as well as what you have already learned about foodways from the videotape, to help. Before you start, consider the fol- lowing questions: I. How can the things that your family eats reflect its culture and tra- DISCUSSION ditions? QUESTIONS 2. What are your family's favorite foods? Are they related to a celebra- tion? 3. Can you tell the class about the first time you tasted, or cooked, or served one of your family's favorite dishes? uNrr 2-27i' t' I tUNIT2 STUDENT ACTIVITY SHEET #6 COOK'NG UP YOUR OWN CULTURAL HERITAGE The goal of this activity is to create a class coohbooh th\u00f8t shows what food can tell us about cultural heritage. Each student needs to do the Jollowing: 1. Collect a recipe from someone in your family. (Usually, whoever does most of the family cooking is a good source!) Don't collect 'Just any old recipe.\" Ask for one that the cook remembers learning from his or her mother or father, grandmother or grandfather, or older friend or neighbor. This recipe should reflect the background of your family in some way, if possible. 2. Collect information with the recipe by interviewing your family member using such questions as: . Where did you learn this recipe? . Where do the ingredients come from? (Do you grow any of them in your garden, gather any in the woods, go fishing for any?) Did you ever have to substitute ingredients because you couldn't find the ones you needed? . When do you cook and serve this dish? (Is it an everyday dish or a special occasion dish?) . What other foods do you serve with this dish? . When you think of this food, what comes to mind? For uNrr 2-29UN.T2 instance, do you think of the person who taught you to cook it? The first time you tried to cook it on your own? something funny that happened once when you served it? The smells of your grandmother's kitchen? Do you think about a special holiday or time of year? , 3. Present this recipe ro the class with the other information you have collected about ir. Explain what it tells about your family and where they come from. If you are able to, cook the dish and bring it into the class for a tasting. 4. Take all of the recipes gathered by the class and organize them into a book. You may organize your book in one of a number of ways. Some suggestions: ' By main ingredient (all fish dishes together, all sweers rogerher, etc.) ' By the occasions or holidays (att birthday or wedding dishes together, all everyday dishes together, all dishes from a particular holiday rogerher, all seasonal dishes together) ' By the places people in the class are from, if you have people from many different cultural backgrounds in your crass 5. organize a \"cooking class,\" if possible, where stud,ents teach each other to cook family recipes. If your school allows it, you may make a lunch party with all of your dishes. uNrr 2-30UNIT 3 Music \u20ac\u00ec Storyltelling Ector Roebuck of St. Thomas delights local children with anansi stories at the remounting of the Vi\u00a1gin lslands Festival program at Estate Love on St. Croix.\\-----I\\- \u00c6\\ 4tf, i t_ L t I [,Watch the videotapes and listen to the audio tapes of storytelling and music, and read accompanying explanations.

UNIT 3.3UNIT 3 LESSON ONE: STORYTELLING STUDENT You are about to see a videotape from the Virgin Islands and listen to a EXPLANATION recording of a story from Senegal. You will also read stories from Sene- gal and the Virgin Islands. Listen carefully to the stories and read the descriptions. Be ready to discuss the stories with the class. DISCUSSION l. Name the different types of stories on the tape. on what occasions QUESTIONS would each type of story be told? Who would the teller be, and who would the audience be? 2. Do you think the stories would be more interesting to an audience who had heard them before, or to an audience that had never heard them? Why? 3. Oi\u00bf you ever hear any srories like these? Where and when? 4. Oo you know any stories like these? Where did you learn them? 5. Are some people better storytellers than others? Do women and men tell the same kind of stories? How are they different? Does every- one tell the same story the same way? UNIT 3-4UNIT 3 BACKGROUN D I N FORMATION: STORYTELLING In the Virgin Islands people still remember when family members and u.S. V|RGIN neighbors would gather in the evenings under the tamarind tree to tell ISLANDS stories. Stories often began: \"Once upon a time, in very hard times, STORYTELLING monkey chewed tobacco and spit white lime.\" They would then close with: \"and the wheel bends, and the story ends.\" Storytelling has always been an important way to teach children by example and humor how to behave with parents and other people, and among themselves. The most favorite are Anansi and 'Just So\" stories which come out of West African folktale traditions. Anansi or Bru Nansi stories, as they are called in the Virgin Islands, are about a spider character called Bru Nansi, who is very clever and plays tricks on peo- ple. The 'Just So\" stories explain how things in nature come to be. Stories about significant events or local heroes, like the legend about Tampo in the 1990 Festival Program Book, teach us about the history of our community. Following is a story about greedy Bru Nansi playing a trick on Bru Tukuma (a goat character) and a story about why dogs bark at animals larger than themselves. Bru T\u00fckuma and Bru Nansi were friends for a very long time. One day BRU NANSI, as they were strolling through the woods they found a keg of salt but- BRU TUKUMA ter. Now this was a great delicacy, as it was used to season food as well AND THE as butter bread. They hid the butter in the bushes and decided that they BUTTERwould come back soon and divide it equally between them. They promised to say nothing to anyone in the village. Several weeks passed, and finally Nansi said to Bru Tukuma: \"Bru, some friends in the next village have invited me to a christening. I will be UNIT 3.5UNIT 3 gone for a few days.\" Nansi packed and pretended to be going on a : journey. As soon as he was out of sight of the village, he hurried ro the place where he and Tukuma had hidden the burter. He took the top off and ate a quarter of the butter. Then he returned to the village. ! When he arrived, Tukuma said to him, \"What is the name of the child?\" \"Top off,\" replied Nansi. Several days later Tukuma, \"I am invited to another chris- tening. I will be back soon.\" Bru Nansi repeated the same maneuver. This time he ate to the halfway mark of the butrer. When he returned to the village, Tukuma asked him, \"What is the name of the baby this rime?\" \"Half gone,\" replied Nansi. Some days later he said to Tukuma, \"I don't know what is going on, but I have a third christening to go to.\" \"Well, you are a very popular fellow. Enjoy yourself,\" Tukuma returned. Nansi went and ate all of the butrer. when he returned, Tukuma asked him, \"How is the child called this time?\" \"Licked clean,\" replied Nansi. A couple of weeks later Tukuma suggested thar they go and divide the butter. Nansi agreed. He had his wife cook up some pea soup with cat- tle tongue dumplings. They walked all morning wirhout a resr. When theygottotheplacewherethebutterwashidden,Nansisaidthatthey should eat first because they had been rraveling atl morning. They ate, \u00ec and the heavy meal plus the weariness from walking soon had Tukuma snoring. As he slept, Nansi went to the barrel and scraped the remnants of the UN|T 3-\u00f3butter and smeared them on Tukuma's mouth and hands. Then he climbed ^ tree and started one big outcry. He shouted so long and so hard that pretty soon the entire village had turned out to see what the problem was. \"Look!\" Bru Nansi shouted, \"Tukuma is so greedy that he ate the whole keg of butter that we found, by himself. If you don't believe me, check his mouth and hands.\" The villagers did so and cried shame on Tukuma. Poor Tukuma was startled from sleep, and unaware of what was going on, found himself being berated and beaten on all sides. When he collected his senses, he took off for parts unknown, vowing vengeance on Bru Nansi. Bru Nansi had a hearty laugh but he remembered what Bru Tukuma said about repaying him. So he stayed up in rhe rree, and he is there ro rhis day. (Collected by Dr. Lezmore E. Emanuel) And there was once the one about the animal had a dance. And um, they invited all horned animals - only the horned animals were sup- posed to go. They had this party. Bru Cat and Bru Dog say, \"Man, what we gonna do? They got nice food in there, but we no got no horn! What we could do?\" So, Bru Cat say, \"Well, you bigger than me. We gonna look for two bone and tie on your head; and you sa go in, and when you go in, you bring some for me!\" Now, the animals that kept this party made provision so that no one else but horned animals could come in. Uh, when the horned animals came in, they told them some- thing - they gave them a secrer - like a password. Bru Cat and Bru Dog didnt know. Bru Cat was outside and Bru Dog went in. So, one ofUNIT 3 THE DANCE G\u00a1VEN BY THE HORNED ANIMALS UNIT 3.7UNIT 3 the horned animal told the master of the feast, \"They got somebody in here that isn't a real horned animal! We gonna find out who he be!\" So, the owner of the feast said, \"'Wait, I gonna do something' I got a trap door. I gon'set it up.\" And he went and told all the horned animals that - told everybody, \"'When you hear the music playing, dance a middle, no dance a corner!\" The dog, not understanding their language, didn't know what they were saying. So, the music began. And everybody said, \"Dance a middle, no dance a corner, dance a middle, no dance a cor- ner.\" And everybody was dancing. The dog didn't know bette\u00a1 and he went right and started dancing in the middle, and the trap door open, he fell right down. When the trap door open then, the other animals found out that was the dog that was in there, without real horns, and they beat him sick. And that is why dogs barking after all animals they see, that are bigger than themselves. (Story told by Eulalie Rivera, recorded in \"Virgin Island Voices: Old Time, Long Time Radio Program\" produced by MaryJane Soule.) SEN EGALESE The story of Coumba-with-a-mother and Coumba-without-a-mother STORYTELLING (Coumba-am-ndey agCoumba-amul-ndey) is one of the best known tales in the Wolof language. Many Senegalese children have learned one ver- sion or another of this story from their grandparents. It is a story about how it pays to be polite. Storytelling sessions, enjoyed by people of all ages, usually take place at night when everyone is relaxing after the day's work. Tiaditional story- telling in Senegal, as well as in the Virgin Islands, is a performance that actively involves both the storyteller and the audience. From the very beginning of the story listeners are expected to participate by answer- UNIT 3.8ing the storyteller's call, \"L\u00ea\u00e9bo\u00f3n!\" with says, here!\"); audience replies, \"Dasn naam!\" (\"It has happened many times!\"). Sometimes, when poems and songs are part of a story people join in, offering commentary encour- agement and accompaniment. In former times, stories like the one below were passed from one person to another only by word of mouth. Now readers can find some tales written down; sometimes by folklore researchers who transcribe the performances of traditional storytellers and sometimes by writers, like the Senegalese author Birago Diop, who retell the stories in their own words. In some cities, towns.and country villages, watching television is replacing participation in traditional storytelling performances as enter- tainment for families and communities. Can you think of some of the similarities and differences between these two kinds of entertainment? L\u00e9\u00e9boon! Lipoon! Amoonnafi! Daan na am! Once there were two young girls with the same father but different mothers. Both were named Coumba, and they lived in the same house. The mother of one of the Coumbas was dead, so the girl became known as Coumba-without-a-mother. Her sister, whose mother was still living, was called Coumba-with-a-mother. Coumba-without-a-mother was given all the housework to do. She pre- pared the meals, washed the dishes and cleaned the house without complaint. Her sister was allowed to grow up without doing any work. Her father was so afraid of his wife that he didn't say or change a thing. In her daily chores one day Coumba-without-a-mother forgot to wash a spoon. For this, her stepmother angrily threw her out of the house. She told Coumba not to come back until the girl had washed the spoon in the D\u00e9kidanaan Lake. Now no one had ever returned from the D\u00e9ki- danaan Lake, and the evil stepmother - who wanted everything forUNIT 3 THE T\\^/O COUMBAS A SENEGALESE FOLKTALE UNIT 3.9UNIT 3 her daughter alone - thought this would be an easy rvay to get rid of Coumba-withou t-a-mother. Coumba-without-a-mother tearfully left to do as she was told. She walked and walked. After two days and two nighs of traveling on foot to find the D\u00e9kidanaan lake she came upon a jujube tree using a stick to harvest its own fruit. Coumba-without-a-mother \\\u00f1\u00a1as a well brought up young girl. She knew better than to remark out loud upon strange- ness in others. As she had been taught by her mother, she knelt down on one knee and greeted the tree respectfully. The jujube tree asked he\u00a1 \"What are you doing here, polite young lady, so far away from the village?\" ' The orphan Coumba replied, \"My stepmother sent me to wash this spoon in the D\u00e9kidanaan Lake.\" The jujube tree said, 'Just follow the road straight on and you'll get to the D\u00e9kidanaan Lake.\" The tree gave her some of its fruit to eat, wished her good luck and sent her on her way. Coumba-without-\u00e2-mother thanked the jujube tree and walked on. As she walked, she becamevery thirsty. After a time, she came to a pool of water that would lift itself up in the air and then sink down to earth again. Coumba-without-a-mother knelt down on one knee and greeted the water politely. The water asked, \"Where are you going so far from home polite young lady?\" Coumba replied, \"My stepmother sent me to wash this spoon in the D\u00e9kidanaan Lake.\" The water said, \"Continue on this road, but first let me give you some- thing to quench your thirst.\" The water lowered itself so that Coumba the orphan could take a drink. The water wished her well, and after drinking and expressing her gratitude Coumba-without-a-mother con- i tinued on her way. uNtr 3- I 0UNIT 3 She walked and walked and walked some more until she came to the tiny house of a very old woman. The woman, who had only one leg, one arrn, one eye, one ear and one finger, was preparing her dinner. Coumba the orphan knelt on one knee and greeted the old woman. \"My granddaughter, so respectful, where are you going?\" asked the woman. Coumba replied, \"Grandmother, my stepmother sent me to wash this spoon in the D\u00e9kidanaan I-ake.\" \"The I-ake of D\u00e9kidanaan is not far but now it is almost nightfall,\" the old woman said. \"Stay the night with me and I will show you the way in the morning.\" Coumba offered to help the woman cook dinner. The old woman hand- ed her a millet sulk that didn't have a single grain of millet on it. \"Here,\" she said, \"pound the millet in my mortar and pestle.\" Coumba had often pounded millet at home, but never a bare stalk. However, she did as she was asked, and to her surprise, as she pound- ed, grains of millet filled the mortar to overflowing! The old woman gave Coumba a clean bone to put in the stew pot. As the girl dropped the bone into the pot it filled up with delicious, savory meat. As they finished eating the tasty meal, the old woman said to the girl, \"Listen carefully granddaughter. My children are wild beasts of the for- est. They will eat you if they find you here sleeping on the bed. Take t}ris rabb (a pointed stick used to part hair for braiding) and hide under the bed. Every few minutes jab them with it. They will think there are too many bed bugs, and they will leave early to go back into the forest.\" The beasts came home and greeted their mother. Bouki, the Hyena said, \"Mother, I smell human flesh.\" uNtr 3- l IUNIT 3 The old \\\u00c3/oman replied, \"The only human flesh here is mine. Are you going to eat me, your own mother?\" Bouki's brother Gaind\u00e9, the Lion, cuffed Hyena with his paw. \"Stop bothering our mother and go to sleep,\" he growled. As the two brothers slept, Coumba stuck them with her rabb from underneath the bed. The two animals were so uncomfortable that they got up and left for the forest long before the first cock crowed. In the morning,.after Coumba and the old woman had eaten breakfast, the woman pointed behind the house. \"There is D\u00e9kidanaan. Go and wash my dishes and your spoon and come back to me.\" Coumba found the lake, washed all of the dishes and the spoon and returned to the old woman's house. \"Granddaughter, since you are so well-mannered and kind I want to give you something to urke with you back to your village.\" With those words, the woman gave the orphan Coumba two small gourds. She explained, \"The first gourd, called 'kasing-kasing,' makes the sound of a rattle with little seeds inside. Break it open when you reach the middle of the forest. The second gourd makes the sound of a drum when you shake it, 'duk-duk.'Break it open when you reach the entrance of the village. May good luck travel with you.\" Coumba-without-a-mother thanked the old woman and set out for her village. In the middle of the forest she broke the first gourd, kasing-kas- ing. Out of it marched a great army of warriors and a troop of servants bearing gold, silver and precious stones, fine cloths and many other fabulous things. They swore allegiance to Coumba-without-a-morher and formed a procession behind her as their queen. At the entrance of the village the girl broke the second gourd, duk-duk. Out of the gourd came all manner of beasts - cattle and livestock as well as wild ani- mals. The soldiers shot all of the dangerous animals and led the domes- tic animals into the village to the house of Coumba-without-a-mother. When the stepmother saw Coumba-without-a-mother return in such a glorious entourage, she was not happy at her good fortune. She was uNtr 3- l 2UNIT 3 overcome with jealousy. She could hardly restrain her impatience as Coumba the orphan told the story of her travels and how she had gained such wealth. Enraged, the stepmother went to her own daughter and scolded, \"Arent you ashamed? Why wasnt it you who brought such honor to the fami\u00fe?\" The mother took a spoon and covered it with food and sent Coumba- with-a-mother to the D\u00e9kidanaan Lake. Coumba-with-a-mother saw the jujube tree using a stick to harvest iS own fruit and doubled over with laughter. \"Well, look at that,\" she bel- lowed. \"'Whoever heard of a tree picking its own fruit?\" With that she grabbed what fruit she could and continued on her way. The jujube tree shouted after her, \"May ill luck follow you, impolite girl that you are!\" Coumba continued on the road until she came to the pool of watel that rose from the earth and sank down again. \"I'm thirstyi give me a drink,\" she demanded. She caught a palm-full of water as it reached her level. \"'Where are you off to, ill-mannered one?\" inquired the water. Coumba-with-a-mother answered, \"It's not any business of yours. I'm going to the D\u00e9kidanaan l\u00bfke to wash a spoon.\" The water said, \"Well, just keep following the same path and you'll get your reward.\" Just before nightfall, Coumba came to the house of the old woman, who was preparing dinner. Coumba laughed at the lady with one eye, one ear, one arrn, one leg and one finger. \"What do you want, insolent young girl?\" asked the grandmother. \"I wanl to wash this spoon in the D\u00e9kidanaan Lake. I have to stay here uNtr 3- l 3UNIT 3 tonight because now it's too late to reach the Lake.\" Coumba-with-a-inother sat and watched while the old woman prepared the food all by herself. The old woman invited Coumba to eat and warned her to stay under the bed because the woman's children - who were beasts of the forest - would soon come home. The old woman gave her rhe r\u00f8bb to stick the animals so that they would leave early. Coumba-with-a-mother hid under the bed. When Bouki the \u00c9Iyena and Gaind\u00e9 the Lion came home, Gaind\u00e9 said, \"I smell human flesh.\" His mother said, \"The only human flesh here is my own, will you eat me?\" Coumba-with-a-mother subbed the animals so hard with the pointed stick that they bled and got out of bed soon after they lay down. \"The bed bugs are very bad tonight,\" they said. In the morning the old woman showed Coumba-with-a-mother the way to D\u00e9kidanaan Lake and gave her the two gourds: kasing-kasing, to break in the forest and duk-duk, to break at the entrance of the village. Coumba-with-a-mother was so impatient to get the gifts her sister had received that she barely took time to thank the old woman. She did not go as far as the lake. As soon as the girl reached the forest she cracked open both gourds at once. Wild beasts alone rushed out and tore her to pieces. An eagle swooped down, grabbed her head and flew with it back to the village where it fell right at the door of her mother's house.

Does Bru Nansi, for instance, remind you of Bugs Bunn\u00a1 or does Tampo (in the Festival Program Book article \"'Were There Giants?\") remind you of your favorite superhero? Pick one of the written stories or one from the audio or videotape and describe each main character. Now, compare these characters to characters you are familiar with from stories that you have heard; characters from television, movies or comics; or people in your own family or community.

Music can praise, boast, ISLANDS tease and tell a story. It can provide rhythm for dancing and carnival parades or celebrate a holiday. Many of the singing traditions have incorporated a \"call and response\" pattern (a lead group sings a verse and answers with a chorus) that has African roots. Immigrants from other islands have brought their own style of music. For instance, the Puerto Ricans who now live on St. Croix play plena and mountain or j\u00edbaro music. Spirituals (religious songs) have been an important part of a child's education and reflect the influence of European missionaries who were the early educators on the islands. Spirituals have also been influenced by West African \"call and response\" song patterns as demonstrated in the following example: Sister whe u bin so long When the Saviour was passing by? Sister whe u bin so long When the Saviour was passing by? Oh the Savior bin ya Praise de Lord, Saviour bin ya, Blessed be his name. Sister bin ya, yes he bin ya, and he bless my soul and he gone. Saviour bin ya, yes he bin ya And he bless my soul and he gone. (Transcribed by Eulalie Rivera, Growingup on St. Crotx,p.54) uNtr 3- l IUNIT 3 cariso, also known as kaiso on other caribbean islands, is an old form of commentary song. Cariso singing may be accompanied by guitar or drums. Everyday life inspires these songs that comment on current events and individuals, voice complaints and take sides on controver- sies. A Crucian cariso singer explains: \"When you did anything wrong, they look at you from head to foot - and they compose a song about you. And that lasts forever. Even though you die, somebody remembers the song.\" With time, some carisos have become historical. Mary Thomas, a canefield worker and one of the leaders of the famous r87B \"Fire Burn\" labor riots (when recently freed slaves revolted over the conditions of their contracts), is praised for her courage in a cariso called \"Queen Mary\": Queen Mary -'tis where you going to burn- Queen Mary -'tis where you going to burn- Don't tell me nothing t'all Just fetch the match and oil Bassin (Christiansted) jailhouse, 'ris where I'm going to burn. On an everyday subject such as food, a Cruzan may sing this cariso to boast to other islanders, and in particular to St. Thomians: You talk about your peas and rice, you like your fish and stew, But there ain't no grubs as sweet and nice like the Crucian kallaloo. It is good, we all like it, the babies like it too. We eat every bit and it keeps us fir, Crucian kallaloo. Some like corn pork, big dumplings,lik that mixture roo. some like fried fish with onion in, but please give me kallaloo. It is good, we all like ir, the babies like it too. We eat every bit and it keeps us fit, Crucian kallaloo. uNrr 3- I 9UNIT 3 It is good, we all like it, the babies like it too. We eat every bit and it keeps us fit, Crucian kallaloo. (Collected by MaryJane Soule from Marie Richards, St. Croix) Calypso is related to cariso and also tells a story while it comments on everyday events, but the upbeat rhythm of the music makes it a popular dance music as well. Like cariso, calypso lyrics are often in creole lan- guage. Hurricane Hugo became a popular theme for masqueraders, floats, and calypso songs for Carnival on St. Thomas and Three Kings' Day on St. Croix in 1990. Following are some lines from the ca\u00feso \"Hugo Gi Go\" by Sound Effex Band: It was the seventeenth of September 1989 Hugo take over Hey, that hurricane was a big surprise, When he hit St. Croix from the southeast side. Hey rantanantantan man the roof fall down. Rantanantantan galvanize around. Hey what a experience for the people of St. Croix What a disaster in the Virgin Islands... No water, no power, no telephone a ring. We people we dead; there's nothing for to drink. People never had pants. Hugo gi yo. People never had shirt. Hugo gi yo. People never had fridge. Hugo gi yo. And people never had stove. Hugo gi yo. Watch out for Hugo! Hugo have no mercy on nobody. He even hit the dead in the cemetery. Over 200 miles the wind was blowing. House to house galvanize flying. Rantanantantan the roof fall down. Rantanantantan galvanize around. uNtr 3-20UNIT 3 Hugo take from the rich, give to the poor. They getting vexed, they can't save us no more. (Sound Effex, f 989. \"Hugo Gi You\" record album) Scratch band music, also known as fungi band music, is played for dances, Carnival and for quadrille dancing. Taking its name from fungi, a traditional dish combining various available ingredients with corn- meal, the fungi band brings together a variety of instruments at hand including a squash gourd rasp, flute, drums, banjo ukulele, guitar, tri- angle and saxophone. Traditionally, it included a bass instrument called an \"ass pipe,\" made from the tubing of sugar refinery equipment. It is now more commonly called a scratch band because of the squash gourd which is scraped for percussion. Scratch bands accompanied earlier car- nival masquerades and perform today at dance halls, restaurants, and for social occasions. Their repertoire includes traditional songs known as quelb\u00e9 and quadrille music. The quadrille dance was introduced in the lgth cenrury by European planters. Led by a caller, or \"floor master,\" people dance sets which consist of seven separate pieces of music, each with its own characteris- tic steps, known as figures. Distinctive quadrille styles have developed on St. Croix and St. Thomas. \"Sly Mongoose\" is a popular scratch band tune in both sung and instru- mental versions: Sly mongoose, all the dog them know your name, Oh, yes, Sly mongoose, all the dog them a know your name. You went into the mistress'kitchen, Take out one of she fattest chicken, Put it in your waiscoat pocket, Sly mongoose. (Repeat) (Sylvester \"Blinkie\" Mclntosh, Sr. Croix, July 27,1979. \"2oop Zoop Zoop\" record album) Brass band music has become very popular on the islands and is played uNtr 3-21UNIT 3 for Carnival, dances, funerals and other social occasions. The brass band was first started on the islands by musicians who joined the U.S. Navy and experienced the music from around the world. Like the scratch bands, they play traditional tunes but they also capture the Latin rhythms of salsa, merengue and cumbia. Scratch bands are also now playing Latin music. MUSIC OF The people of Senegal enjoy a wide range of music and dance tradi- S E N E GAL tions, developed within the context of a history which brought rogerher diverse ethnic and cultural groups. Each group contribured unique styles of performance, song and musical instruments. The sabar of the Wolof people, the Serer serouba and the Diola bougarabouare a few of the distinctive drumming and dance styles that are a part of weddings, baptisms, and other celebrations in Senegal. Dances accompanied by drumming are by no means Senegal's only per- formance traditions. song and dance to the accompaniment of stringed instruments, such as the riti music of the Peul, the hora music of the Manding and the Toucouleur, and thehalam music of the Wolof are all important and rich aspects of Senegalese cultural heritage as are rhe Balante balaJon, a xylophone-like instrument, and the unaccompanied singing of the Serer. What is shared by all erhnic groups of Senegal is the cenrral role of music, song and dance within the social and ritual life of communities. Praise singing and the musical recirarion of family history greer rhe newborn infant. song and dance bid farewell to an elder of r.he commu- nity, who is believed ro be returning to the invisible world of the ances- tors. Between the beginning and end of life, music and dance play a role in, among other events, traditional healing, celebration and worship. uNrr 3-22UNIT 3 STUDENT ACTIVITY SHEET #8 ,NSTRUMENTS AT HAND Looh closely at the photographs of the virgin Islands \"scratchband\" and the Senegalese Toucouleur women\\ music group.

In some cases, the music tells a story. In other cases, the stories use music in them, or have the rhythm of music in their presentation. This lesson will help you make the connections between the music and the stories of these two cultures. l. what are the names of two types of songs that contain stories? 2.

The people who write and sing this music use many different sources for their stories in song. Some are funn\u00a1 poking fun at friends or government officials. Some are sad, telling of love affairs that did nor go too well. Some tell important stories of historic happenings. And, some are commentary on the latest news. Below are the words to a cariso and a calypso: Cariso You talk about your peas and rice, you like your fish and stew But there ain't no grubs as sweet and nice like the Crucian kallaloo.

Read the articles in the Festival Program Book. After viewing the videotape and the photographs, engaging in a discus- sion, and completing the suggested activities, the student should be able to: . understand the importance of a cultural celebration to people in the Virgin Islands and Senegal . name several elements integral to a cultural celebration, such as food, costumes, music and dance . recognize the roles of two important characters in the cultural celebrations of Carnival (Mocko Jumbies) and the lambe (serignou mbeur) . explain how a celebration changes if it is \"restaged\" outside of its own cultural setting (i.e., at a folklife festival) I t,' \u00ccfl ,l\\Mocko LESSON ONE: COMPARING T\\^/O CELEBRATIONS STUDENT In this videotape, you will learn how traditional celebrations - Carni- EXPLANATION val in the Virgin Islands, andlambe, a traditional wrestling match that includes music, dance and ritual in Senegal - are presented in a festi- val setting. You will see scenes from the celebrations in their home set- ting (in the Virgin Islands, Carnival taking place on a St. Thomas street; in Senegal, a lambe taking place in a village) as well as the \"restaging\" of the celebrations in Washington, D.C. at the 1990 Festival of Ameri- can Folklife. As you watch the videotape, notice how the celebrations are differenr in their home settings (which folklorists call the \"natural context\") and in the festival setting. Take note of, and think about, the different audi- ences in both settings. DISCUSSION 1. Name three things that are similar about the celebrations of Carni- QUESTIONS val and thelambe. Name three things that are different. 2. Name three things that are different in the celebrations of Carnival and the lambe in their home seming and in the fesrival serring. 3. How many types of folklife did you as parr of rhese celebra- tions (music, dance, etc.)? 4. How are these celebrations different from everyday rypes of folklife (cooking everyday meals, occuparional skills used everyday, etc.)? 5. Oi\u00bf you notice any interaction between the people from Senegal and the people from the Virgin Islands ar rhe celebrations? Explain. UNIT 4.4UNIT4 STUDENT ACTIVITY #IO CELEBRAT'ON PHOTO DETECTIVE Look closely at the photographs of the virgin Islands carnival and the Senegalese lambe presented in their home settings and at the 1990 Festival of American Folklife. Read the written information about the two traditional events. Answer the following questions: . What is differenr berween the folklife evenrs in their home setting and at the festival (costumes, audience, background scene)? . What is similar or the same? ' Do you think that it was easier to \"stage\" the carnival or the lambe at the Washingron, D.C. festival? Why? . How much do you think the Washingron, D.C. audience understood about rhe events? what helped them undersrahd more? using the photographs, the videotape and the written descriptions of these celebrations, make a list of the elements of carnival and the lambe in their home settings. Include as many aspects of these events as you can: costumes and other \"props\" (things that people carry or use as part of the celebration), music and dance, number and type of participants, schedule of events, decorations, etc. Think about packing up all of the elements of these events and bringing them to washington, D.c. to \"stage\" the events. Assume uur 4-5UNfi4 you can pack three large trunks full of items to bring. What would you choose to bring? What would you leave at home? How would what you bring affect how much the audience in Washington, D.C. understood about the events? Could you replace or rebuild some items with materials found in Washington, D.C.? Could you tell the audience about some of the things you had to leave behind, to make them understand more? Now, pick a traditional event that your family or community celebrates: for instance, a holiday celebration, a community festival, or a family reunion. Assume that you are \"staging\" this event in a place hundreds of miles from the usual setting for an audience who may not understand the meaning of the event to your family or community. Make a plan for restaging the event: . What will you bring? . Will the event last as long as it does in the home serting? . How will you make the audience understand the meaning of the event to your family or community? uur 4-\u00f3UNIT+ LESSON TWO: MOCKOJUMBTE & SERIGNOU MBEUR As you will learn from the videotape, the MockoJumbie is an important STUDENT part of Carnival, and the serignou mbeur (the man who travels with a EXPLANATION wrestler and uses his knowledge of spiritual forces to help his wrestler win) is an important part of the lambe.In this activity, you will discover more about these special people and their traditional roles in the two events. Before you begin, answer the following questions: l. How would the two celebrations be different without the Mocko Jumbies and the serignou the serignou mbeur have anything in common? 3. Compare the costumes of the two. 4. Whut special knowledge or skills do you have ro have to be a MockoJumbie?

Carnival wouldn't be so colorful or interesting without the Mocko Jumbies, and thelqmbe would just be another wrestling match without the special help of the serignou mbeur! Here is a summary of. their roles: Mocko Jumbie: Are stiltwalkers who perform in a masquerading tradition originally brought from Wesr Africa ro rhe Caribbean. Originall\u00a1 they formed part of religious ceremonies. Today they participate in Carnival and orher festivals individually, accompanied by a drummer, or in a troupe. Mocko Jumbie stiltwalkers say that when the Spirit enters them they are able to dance on stilts and perform fancy sreps. Young children are often frightened by Mocko Jumbies because of their size and because parents will tell them that if they don't behave the Mocko Jumbie will come and get them at Carnival. Mocko jumbie John McCleverty performs at the 199 I U.S. Virgin lslands Folklife Festival on St. Croix.UNfi+ UNIT 4.9UNfi4 Serignou Mbeur: Is the specialist who acts as a spiritual coach to the wrestlers and helps them win the match. He prepares special medicines and instructs the wrestlers about things to do that will make the fighters stronger. Sometimes it is translated to English as 'Ju-jr man.\" Write a story about a Mocko Jumbie and a serignou mbeur.

This could be a \"restaging\" of an existing celebration, such as Carnival, or an invention of a new celebration unique to your class (Mrs. Smith's Sixth Grade Class Cele- bration of Spring?). Use the activity sheet to help plan your celebration. You will use as many of the skills and information that you have learned in the earlier lessons as you can cram into your own celebra- tion! Before you start, discuss the following: I. what are some of the elemenrs of a good celebration? DISCUSSION QUESTTONS2. Name some celebrations that you are familiar with. Whar time of year do they occur? What makes them special? 3. Oo you think that a successful celebration takes a lot of planning and work? Why or why not? uN\u00a1r 4- l II f; t l.,UNfi4 STUDENT ACTIVITY SHEET #12 LET'S CELEBRATE! The first step is to decide on a celebration. This should take some thought. One way to decide is to put up a \"suggestion box\" for several days. Students in the class can write down ideas for the celebration, and place them in the box. When everyone has had a chance to submit at least one idea, your teacher should read them to the class. The class can then discuss the best ideas, choose three or four, and vote to see which idea they like best. Keep in mind that the chosen celebration should have some of the following elements: . music . dance . costumes . special foods . storytelling sessions . feats of strength or showings of talent . stalls to sell handmade crafts or treats . a parade Next, decide where the celebration will take place: in your classroom; in the gymnasium or auditorium; on the school grounds; at a local fairground or other public space. This will depend, of course, on the type of celebration you are planning. Now, decide when the celebration will take place. If you are planning an outdoor activity, be sure to pick a rain date! Also, make sure that uNrr 4- I 3UNfi4 you have enough time to plan and carry out your celebration. Form \"committees\" to plan different parts of the celebration. Depending on what type of celebration it is, you may wish to form a food committee, a costume committee, a music committee, etc. Each committee is responsible for their part of the celebration. All committees should report to the class as a whole, and get ideas and suggestions, on a regular basis. Don't forget publicity! If you are inviting other classes, parents or other community members to your celebration, have someone in the class design a ilyer or make posters, and put them up around the school and community.

Reviewing the meanings of these terrns will give you abet- ter understanding of the videotape. If you noticed other unfamiliar terms while watchingthe videotape,looh them up in a dictionary and discuss their meanings with your teacher Carnival - A festive celebration which takes place in the Caribbean as well as in other parts of the world, lasting several days, fea- turing elaborate costumes, masquerade, music and dance, pre- sented in a street parade. Celebration - A special time that marks a particular occasion, like a holiday, when traditional musics and dances may be performed, foods eaten and stories told. Carnival is a good example of a large celebration that has become traditional in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Smaller, more private celebrations that take place on the family level can include weddings, baptisms, or birthdays. Custom - A tradirion habitually carried our among a group of peo- ple. For instance, the tradition of serving a particular food or wearing special clothes on a holiday. Documentation - The act of garhering and \u00a1ecording information about traditional culture. This can be done by taking written notes or photographs, or by making audio or video recordings. Documentation is usually done through a combination of obser- vation and interview techniques. Domestic Folklife - A tradition carried on in or around rhe home, and used in the home, such as needlework, basketmaking, herbal healing, cooking. Ethnic Group - A group of people who have shared tradirions and customs, and often a shared religion and language. Folklife - The parr of everyone's lives thar is passed on by informal learning (observation and imitation in the home and communi- ty), and is usually passed on over several generations. Fieldwork - rhe process of collecring information for the purpose of presen'ing knowledge. Folklorists do fieldwork by going \"inro the field,\" where traditions exist in their home setting. Examples APPEND\u00a1CES 3APPEN DIX A of fieldwork are the documentation of fishing techniques in a coastal village, or musical traditions at Carnival on St. Thomas. Folklife Festival - A celebration of traditional culture, usually including musical and narrative performances and demonstra- tions of traditional crafts and skills. Folklorist - A researcher trained in recognizing and documenting traditional culture. Also called folklife researcher. Foodways - Traditional foods and their settings, such as a holiday meal or a recipe passed down over the generations. Home Setting\u00c6estival Setting - The original setting (also referred to by folklorists as \"natural context\") for traditional culture vs. the constructed setting of a folklife festival. Folk- lorists often document traditions in the home context, and then translate them to a festival setting in a way that gives the festival visitors an idea of the home without recreating the whole set- ting. Items and photographs from the \"home\" setting, where they are normally found, help visitors understand what the tra- dition is like. Interview - A means of obtaining folklife information by asking questions and writing down or tape recording the answers. Lambe - A traditional Senegalese wresrling match, accompanied by music and dance. Log - A list of the contents of an audio or video tape collected as part of a folklife fieldwork project. This list helps the folklorist remember what is on the tape, in order to use the information. Masquerade - In the Virgin Islands, masquerading means dressing up in costumes portraying different characters and parading through the streets during festive occasions. Masquerade groups design their costumes around a theme. In earlier times, mas- querading was done during special times like Christmas. Today, the tradition of masquerading has become parr of Carnival. Mocko Jumbie - A costumed stiltwalker who performs during Car- nival in the Virgin Islands and other parts of the Caribbean. The origin of the tradition is West African stilt-dancing. Muslim - A person who practices the religion of Islam. Ninety-two percent (92o/o) of all Senegalese citizens are Muslims. APPENDICES 4APPENDIX A Observation - The practice of carefully watching while a tradition is carried out in its home setting, noting important information for documentary purposes. Occupational Folklife - Folklife shared by members of groups who have skills, knowledge, and experience in a specific line of work, such as fishing, charcoal making or boat. building. These types of skills may somerimes be carried our as hobbies or pas- times as well as ways of earning a living. Presenter - A folklorist or orher person familiar with traditional cul- ture who helps visitors to a folklife festival better understand another culture. This is done by verbal explanations, short inter- views of festival participants, and pointing out interesting details about traditions. Sabaar - A traditional senegalese dance parrf often part of the cele- bration of a life passage such as a baptism or a wedding. senegal - A country on the west African coast. The country's eight million people live in large cities as well as rural villages. The official language is French, bur many other languages are spo- ken there, reflecting the many ethnic groups who live there such as Wolof, Toucoleur, Serer and Manding. During the slave trade of the 1600s-1800s, many people were raken forcibly from Sene- gal and brought ro the virgin Islands and other caribbean areas to work as slaves. Survey - To collect information about a tradition from several people in a particular area, all of whom may carry out that tradition slightly (or very) differentl\u00a1 to allow for rhe comparison of information. An example would be collecting information about a traditional recipe from three different cooks. Tradition - lnformation passed down among people within a com- munity, often over several generations. Tiaditions may include songs, dances, crafts, foods, holiday celebrations, healing prac- tices, beliefs, storytelling and occuparional skills. Traditional Crafts - useful and./or decorarive items made in a rra- ditional lnarlner, often by hand. Examples include wood carv- ings, baskets, woven cloth and needlework. Transcript - A wrirren document made by listening to audio or APPENDICES 5APPENDIX A video tapes and writing down all the words as they are spoken. U.S. Virgin Islands - The islands of St. Croix, St. John and St. Thomas, located in the Caribbean region, which form a territory of the United States. Vernacular Architecture - Buildings constructed using traditional methods and materials native to a particular cultural area.

Folklife is the ways people and communities express themselves in everyday life and at holiday times. These expressions include music, stories, domestic and occupational crafts, cooking and celebrations. Folklife is passed on through borrowing, imitating, and learning within families or groups, and it takes place everywhere around the world. In 1990, people from the United States Virgin Islands and the counrry of Senegal brought their folklife traditions to Washingron, D.C., helping more than one million people understand the cultural heritage of these two areas of the world a little better through performances and demon- strations of folklife. Learning more about the cultural heritage of these two areas of the world will help you understand more about folklife. You will find that you also have many examples of folklife to share with others, no matrer what your background is. The territory of the U.S. Virgin lslands is located in the Caribbean region, south of the state of Florida and east of Puerto Rico, and con- sists of the main islands of St. Croix, St. John and St. Thomas and over 50 smaller islands. Tiaditions of the virgin Islands show an influence of the cultures that were part of its history - African, Spanish, Danish, French, Dutch, German, English and the Caribbean itself. Senegal is a country in West Africa. Because of its location at the west- ernmost tip of the African continent, Senegal has been a major cross- roads for intercontinental and cultural exchange. It was once the capital APPENDICES I9APPEND\u00a1X D of French West Africa. Its citizens come from many different cultural groups, such as Wolof, Toucouleur, Serer, Soninke and Diola. There are also immigrants from France and from other countries in Africa, Europe and the Americas. Similarly to the Virgin Islands, many different influences important to Senegal's history have shaped this country's cultural heritage, blending with native Senegalese traditions to become something new. The traditions of these two places also have been affected by their envi- ronments. The two places are both in the tropical region, so they grow some of the same plants and crops. Also, they both have aLarge area of seacoast, so fishing is an important occupation and food source. The histories of the two areas have a connection as well. Beginning in the I600s, people from West African areas, including what is now Senegal, were enslaved and brought to places in the New World like the Virgin Islands. These people brought many traditions with them from Africa - So, we can see similar traditions in the folklife of Senegal and in the Virgin Islands. Drummers from the Virgin Islands and Senegal at the Festival of Ameri- can Folklife played together, recognizing common musical traditions and possibly inventing new ones during this encounter. Both of these areas have a rich tradition of crafts such as basketmaking, fabric arts, traditional building methods and woodworking. Many of these traditions have been passed down over generations. Sometimes, these traditions are learned through formal apprenticeships. For example, at the Festival, a Senegalese weaver demonstrated tradi- tional techniques of weaving cloth using a strip loom. Along with the master weaver came his young apprentice, who is learning to produce the intricate patterns. Children also grow up learning to do things from family and communi- APPENDICES 20APPENDIX D ty members in an informal method, by simply watching and imitating. Craftspeople from the Virgin Islands at the Festival in Washington explained to visitors how they learned their traditions. Let's watch and listen. \"My parents...my mother could do all of this. And she taught us from young. We had to be busy. (in background) \"When I was going to school, I went to school in Coral Ba\u00a1 St. John. My school was Benjamin Franklin School. And there is where I learned to make baskets by a man named Horace Sewer. I've been making baskets from nine years old.\" \"'When I was a young fellow, about I7, they encouraged me to learn this trade.\" \"This is one of the tricks we used to do - we call it saving. This is called saving.\" The Smithsonian Institution and the people of the Virgin lslands and Senegal think that their folklife is worth saving. This is one of the rea- sons they organized the 1990 programs at the Festival of American Folklife. In preparation for the Festival, and to preserve a record of many of the traditions of the two places for future generations, researchers in the Virgin Islands and Senegal collected information. In Senegal, traditions were researched in both large cities and in rural areas. One of the examples of traditional folklife recorded was the con- struction of a traditional house in a small farming village. As the build- ing took shape under the skilled hands of the traditional craftsmen, the researchers used photographs and videotapes to record a traditional house, which is not built in the cities, but continues to be important in rural life. The researchers recorded \"the whole story\" about this traditional prac- APPENDICES 2IAPPEND\u00a1X D tice: how the raw materials were gathered, how the house's framework was fashioned from wood, how the walls were woven from grass or mil- let stalks, and how straw can be twined together to make a strong, rain- proof roof. From this documentation, we can learn a great deal about Senegalese village culture in general - such as, what types of homes are preferred, what types of native materials are available, what tradi- tional skills are needed to build a home, and how homes fit in the vil- lage design. At the Festival, this information was used to construct a small-scale \"village compound\" for presenting Senegalese traditions. In the Virgin lslands, one of the many subjects researchers gathered information about was traditional fishing practises. At the Festival, this informarion was passed on ro visitors through the demonstrations of fishing crafts such as netrnaking, and through pre- sentations by some of the same people who did the research. At the Festival, the people presenring rhe folklife of their home setrings of Senegal and the U.S. Virgin lslands had a chance to share their tradi- tions with one another. For instance, during a re-creation of a tradition- al masquerade \"tramp\" in Washington, Senegalese musicians and dancers joined in this tradition, trading styles of playing and dancing with the Virgin Islanders. Who knows? This may have helped creare some new traditions in both Senegal and rhe Virgin lslands! Now you have a better idea of what folklife is all about. lt is a part of everyone's cultural heritage, even your own.... It is learned by observing and irnitating within a family or a community.... It can be anything from a very special celebration to an everyday task.... And, it can change and grow over time and through contact with other people and groups.... Visiting the Folklife Fesrival in Washingron, D.C. helped peo- ple from all over the united states and the world learn about the tradi- tions of senegal and the u.S. virgin Islands. But, it is just as important to learn more about the traditions in your own life.... Talk to your par- ents, grandparents, friends and neighbors. Look around - people have many ways of expressing their culture in everything they do. APPEND\u00a1CES 22APPENDIX D Food is an important part of everyone's life and everyone's cultural her- FOODWAYS itage. How we learn to buy, gather, grow, prepare, serve and celebrate with food tells much about our backgrounds and upbringing. \"Oh yeah, you can't have a meal in the U.S. Virgin Islands without rice and beans, and Arroz con Pollo, chicken and rice. You can't have a meal in the whole Caribbean without rice and beans.\" There are no stronger exponents of Virgin Islands culture, as you will soon see and hear, than those of the French tradition. *Well, most of my people was farmers and fishermen, ...the north side. The reason why we're farmers and fishermen, you get six months of the year calm water, the other six months we got calm in between, but we got rough, rough seas. We're in the Atlantic side of the island.\" At the Festival of American Folklife in Washington, D.C., participants from Senegal and the Virgin lslands prepared traditional foods that they make at home. The foods that they chose to cook reflect the rich boun- ty of the sea and land in these two parts of the world, and the cultural heritage of the two places. Two of the dishes, kallaloo from the Virgin Islands, and, thiebou-dienne from Senegal, use ingredients gathered, grown, or bought fresh at the marketplace. The recipes have been handed down by word of mouth for generations. \"Kallaloo uses native fish, a special bush, and other ingredients.\" \"Kallaloo is made of the local sea food. Crab, which you see here. We have a local land crab; it is a little different than the other crab that we see around. Then we have conch - that comes from the sea. We also have ham, which is smoked ham or you also could use ham knuckle. We have fish, that I usually fry it and bone it. And you use the other portion of it. We have here another salted meat, known as the pig snout and the pig tail. And these is all the meats that we use in it. Then we APPEND\u00a1CES 23APPENDIX D have here some spinach, okra, and a local kallaloo bush, grown togeth- er. That is what really gives the flavor. We have here some eggplant, and this is some of all that go into kallaloo.\" Thiebou-diennehas some similar ingredients, as you see here. \"Then you put the onions as the first step. Then you put your tomato in it. Then you mix it, and you make sure that your tomato paste is real thick, and then you wait for about 20 minutes, then you add some water in it. Of course you have cleaned your big fish previously and you have taken all the scales out and the inside has been cleaned. And you make some stuffing. The stuffing is made out of parsley, onions, hot pepper, peppers, salt and garlic, of course. Once you have stuffed your fish, you put the fish in it and you wait until it boils and cooks very well. Then you clean the vegetables and you put the vegetables -the vegetables are eggplant, they are okra, cabbage, hot pepper, yucca, carrots and yams. Of course, on the other side, you have rice because \"thiebou,\" that means rice and \"dienne,\" that means fish. So it's a rice and fish dish. The fish is inside, of course, and once all the vegetables and the fish are cooked you take them out and you put the rice in it. Then you're going to put another seasoning with the garlic, onion and salt and pepper and hot pepper. Once all the vegetables and the fish are taken out of the pot then you're going to put the onions in it and you just cover it, and you make it boil. The rice is in. It has to cook and take all the flavor of the different vegetables and the fish that were pre- viously cooked in this gravy. You wait for a good half hour until it boils and then you mix the rice and make sure it's evenly cooked because it has to be nice and tender, just so. Then you're going to put the lid on it, cover it just the way she does. You wait another half hour, then it is ready to be eaten.\" To gather the ingredients for dishes like kallaloo and thiebou-dienne, t\u00cda- ditional cooks may begin by growing some of the vegetables them- selves. ln the Virgin Islands, growing some of the food eaten by the family has always been important. APPENDICES24APPENDIX D \"Well, in the days when I was young, when working with my father, they used to plant sweet potato, sugar cane, bananas, tanias, sweet cas- sava, pumpkin, corn, okras, and peas, those are the gardens that they use to garden in those days. The way they plant the sweet potato in my days, they plant them by the moon. There are certain times of the moon you plant sweet potato of which you get a good crop. But if you don't plant them on that special time then you gets nothing at all.\" Fishing is a major industry in the Virgin Islands and Senegal, and a great deal of flsh is eaten in the two cultures. Fishermen use many methods to catch the different kinds of fish found in these two parts of the world. \"Making what we call a fish pot and what some people call a fish trap, represents one of maybe three major ventures into fisheries in the Vir- gin lslands. The fry net is used primarily ro ger the bait that is used for hand-line fishing, which is maybe the mosr conservarive of the fishing industries in the Virgin Islands, rhe one that has gone rhrough the least change. Then of course you have a seining tradition, which, you'll find out that that's of the tradition in West Africa.\" ln order to use the freshest ingredients in their traditional dishes, cooks in the Virgin lslands and Senegal also rnay garher foods ar rhe market- place. The marketplace has many foods to offer, and also serves as a place for people to meet and socialize. In both Senegal and the USVI, there is a strong tradition of cooking over open fires using wood or charcoal. Young cooks learn their methods from older cooks passing the tradition on to the next generation. \"Growing up as a srnall child I learned from my grandmother and my mother, Mrs. Evadne Petersen. She's a public health nurse, retired noq but she also did cooking and baking.\" Traditional food is used in everyday cooking, such as making kallaloo or thiebou-dienne , but it is also important on special occasions, like the APPENDICES 25APPEN DIX D Day of the Cross in the Puerto Rican community of St. Croix, USVI. So we can see, all over the world, food is much more than something we eat to stay alive and well. It is part of our cultural heritage, every da\u00a1 and at special times of the year. CELEBRATIONS All over the world, people celebrate at special times of the year with music and dance, games, food, costume-making and storytelling. Many of these celebrations have been taking place for centuries, although they have changed over the years - adding new elements. These cele- brations are an important part of the folklife of the people who partici- pate in them. Two such celebrations, the U.S. Virgin Islands Carnival and the Sene- galese lambe, were re-created at the 1990 Festival of American Folklife in Washington, D.C. The participants brought the costumes, musical instruments and other elements of their traditions with them to Wash- ington, D.C., to help visitors learn how they celebrate. The SenegaLeselambe is an annual harvest-time celebration featuring tradirional wrestling matches in local farrning communities. The wrestlers, many of whom are farmers, have a chance to show off their strength and stamina in the matches. Thelctmbe originated in the Sine region of Senegal. Over the years, ir became a popular tournament game all over Senegal, as exciting as the Superbowl or World Series in the United States. Today in Senegal, the lambe takes place in village centers or large public arenas. Although the wrestling match is the central focus of the celebra- tion, drumming, singing, and displays of magic are important parts as well. In Washington, D.C., as wrestlers warmed up in preparation and danc- ing and singing began, a researcher familiar with the tradition explained it to an audience who might otherwise have found elements APPENDICES 2\u00f3APPENDIX D of the celebration strange. Visitors watched the participants, and lis- tened to the researcher's explanation. \"Welcome to the lambe! Lambe being the national sport, that is, the indigenous, national sport in Senegal. And it is usually one of those occasions to show skill and strength. Also a special combination of skill because the two wrestlers try to out-do each other physically and added through direct confrontation or with the assistance of any mystical, if not medical strengths that there can be. And in such a way that you will hardly ever see a real wrestler, a good wrestler respecting himself and respecting the tradition, who would confront his challenger without the assistance of his own people. Because the wrestler is usually followed by junior wrestlers who - just to learn the trick and the trade, follow the master. Also, a juju man [keeper of spiritual powers] is always in the luggage of the champion. But the juju man is the one who should first try and out-do the juju man of the other wrestler so that his own wrestler can also out-do the wrestler of the opposite camp.\" In Washington, D.C., a large audience watched with interest, joining into the spirit of the match. All of the elements of a traditional lambe -music, dance, costumes and displays of magic - conveyed an idea of the richness of the event as celebrated in Senegal. ln the Virgin Islands, Carnival is the season when everybody comes together as one. People return home from hundreds and even thou- sands of miles away to celebrate with family and friends. The festivities include a parade with music and elaborately costumed dancers. The tradition of Carnival evolved from masquerading traditions of the past. ln Washington, D.C., visitors learned more about this earlier tradition from one of the presenters at the festival. \"Carnival took the place of masquerading from, like the 1950s on. And, prior to that, the masquerading tradition was one that was not orga- nized in sense that it was an organized parade. Today, we have an orga- nized parade that is supposed to start at a certain time and end at a cer- APPENDICES2TAPPENDIX D tain time. The masquerading tradition, it's like, all day, all night, depending upon the group that comes out. Most times it was done dur- ing the festival, a festive time, for example, Christmas. And on the estates, that, if you visit the U.S. Virgin Islands, you will find the old estate names. And on each one of these estates, you would have bands of masqueraders coming out of the estate areas, coming into town, and groups from town meeting masqueraders.\" In the masquerade, musicians accompanied paraders, who wore dis- guises representing characters. Their bands were often called \"scratch' bands.\" The instruments they played were usually a flute, a hollow gourd called a squash, the drums, and a triangle called a steel. More recently, contemporary brass and steel bands have become popu- lar in the Virgin Islands during Carnival. In St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands, an important element of the Carnival celebration is the Moko Jumbies, or stilt-dancers. They parade through the middle of town with other Carnival participants from their community. Like the scratch band, the Moko Jumbies were an indispensable part of the older masquerade tradition. The origins of the MokoJumbies can be traced to West Africa. ..Yes,itcertainlyisaWestAfricantraditionandthatiswherewegotit from in the Caribbean.\" Toda\u00a1 stilt-dancers such as this one, performing at a street party in Senegal, are still practicing their tradition in West Africa. In the Virgin Islands, the MokoJumbies originally had a religious func- tion for the people who were brought from West Africa to the Caribbean to become slaves on large plantations. \"This whole concept of MokoJumbies and masquerading was an inte- gral part of the religious ceremony. It was a way of giving thanks and APPENDICES 28APPENDIX D praise to God. And when they brought slaves from West Africa ro rhe Caribbean, the slave masters did not allow the slaves to practice their indigenous religions as they knew it. Therefore, rhis whole concept of MokoJumbie changed from religious in nature to festive in nature. The emphasis was not longer on the religious aspects, or I should say the obvious or superficial emphasis, because to the people that actually performed on the stilts and did the masquerading, it was srill religious. But, they had to masquerade it, or they had to hide it, so that the slave masters did not know that they were, in fact, practicing their religions.\" At the re-creation of the Carnival at the Festival in Washington, Moko Jumbies and other masqueraders displayed their traditional form of artistry for thousands of people, providing them with a \"taste\" of the celebration in the Virgin Islands. The celebrations of the lambe and carnival that visitors experienced at the Festival of American Folklife contain elements that have evolved over centuries of tradition. From its origins as a local match of strength and skill, thelambe in its modern form has become a national pastime in senegal. And, from the original tradition of masquerading in the Vir- gin Islands, carnival has grown to a huge, festive occasion with some of its roots still apparent in the west Africa of today. And, finally, the two celebrations were brought togerher in washingron, D.c., to help a large audience understand the traditions of these two parts of rhe world a lit- tle better, and perhaps learn to appreciare the tradirions of their own communities that much more.
