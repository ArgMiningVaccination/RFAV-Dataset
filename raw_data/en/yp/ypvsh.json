The plant is of great significance in the traditional Indian System of Medicine, such as Ayurveda, Unani, and Siddha. The seeds and their oil are extensively used to treat neurological disorders such as cognitive dysfunction, paralysis, epilepsy, insomnia, and other ailments like rheumatism, arthritis, sciatica, and leprosy. This paper aims to highlight the nootropic activity of C. paniculatus and explore its phytochemistry, traditional uses, and other pharmacological activities. Methods All available information concerning C. paniculatus has been searched in the internationally accepted scientific databases, including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Additional knowledge was gathered from the classical Textbooks and Unani Pharmacopoeia. Results C. paniculatus is a rich source of metabolites, (Benzoic acid, Cinnamic acid). The various study shows that the extracts and active constituent of this plant possess potent nootropic activity. Besides nootropic activity, it has also been reported anti-Alzheimer, anticonvulsant, antibacterial, antimalarial, and several other properties. Conclusions Several in vitro and in vivo trials confirm the conventional use of C. paniculatus in cognitive dysfunction. However, the relations between the possible mechanisms of other activities and traditional uses of the C. paniculatus remain indistinct. Still, pharmacological studies also explored the effects of C. paniculatus , which were not recognized in ancient times, such as cytotoxic, ACE inhibitor, and antidiabetic activities. These discoveries are may be beneficial in the development of the new drug to treat various diseases. It is also confirmed that the -dihydroagarofuranoids exhibit significant AChE inhibitory, cytotoxic, antibacterial, and insecticidal effects. This versatile medicine is truly a life elixir. Considering the therapeutic importance of the C. paniculatus and the absence of any reported clinical studies, extensive clinical trials are needed to explore its memory enhancing and other activities.
