All patient donations will benefit La Habra's non-profit Meals on Wheels, which provides home-delivered meals for anyone unable to prepare or obtain adequate meals, regardless of race, religion, sex, age, or ability to pay. No appointments are necessary, and patients will be seen on a first-come, first-served basis. Masks will be required as the Tent Event is an extension of the University Health Center, which is a healthcare facility. SCU Health has been hosting free Tent Event clinics since June 2020 as a way to serve the community and prepare health sciences students as future physicians. Licensed faculty clinicians supervise the students, and the care patients receive. SCU students receive course credit for volunteering but can also volunteer solely to practice. The next SCU Health Tent Event is scheduled for Saturday, Sept. 24, and full details will be released closer to the next event date. \"We wanted to provide an opportunity to reach the people who are interested in considering integrative medicine, including chiropractic and Ayurveda,\" said Sharon Martinez, SCU Health Provider Liaison. When the pandemic hit, we wanted to provide a way to reach our patients with minimal risks, but still receive the same quality treatment that patients would experience if they were to be seen in our clinic.\" SCU Health Tent Events currently do not receive any outside or donor support.
