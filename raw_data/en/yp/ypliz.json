This vaccine helps to ward off a frequent illness that is known as kennel cough. Kennel cough is easily spread from one dog to another and is highly contagious. In healthy adult dogs, the condition is typically not life threatening. However, it can give your dog a bad cough and a runny nose and cause them to feel bad. However, in puppies, older dogs and unhealthy dogs, this condition can be life-threatening. The vaccine can be given as injection under the dog's skin or through the nose, based on the behavior of their dogs and what they can tolerate. If you are a new dog owner, you may wonder how frequently this vaccine needs to be given. Here is some information you should know. Puppies Puppies should receive the injectable version of the bordetella vaccine between the ages of six to eight weeks. They should then receive a second injectable booster four weeks later, or between the ages of 10 to 12 weeks. If you have purchased a puppy who has not yet had these injections, or you are unsure, they will need to have two rounds of boosters to give them complete full protection. Adult Dogs Adult dogs should receive a booster form of the bordetella vaccine every six to twelve months, depending on the risk factors for the dog. If you board your dog, take your dog to doggy daycare, or have your dog in any kind of training classes, the facility will likely require your dog to have the booster every six months. This helps to keep your dog healthy, while also helping to prevent other animals in the facility from catching the germs. Always check with a facility to find out how frequently they require the booster if you are taking your dog to any kind of facility where multiple dogs may present. In addition to this, it is also strongly recommended that you give your dog a [bordetella booster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordetella) every six months if you take your dog to places where other dogs frequently mingle, including dog parks, outdoor shopping centers that allow dogs or restaurants that allow dogs. Having your dog near other dogs increases their risk for catching kennel cough, so giving the vaccine frequently helps to ward it off. If your dog primarily stays at home, only going for an occassional walk, their risk for catching kennel cough is low. As such, they should only have the booster given once every 12 months. However, it is still important to give the booster even if your dog's risk is low. Kennel cough can be caught through fence lines or while your dog is on a walk around your neighborhood if another dog was infected.
