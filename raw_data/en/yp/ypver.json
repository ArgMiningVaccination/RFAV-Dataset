INTRODUCTION & GENERAL PRINCIPLES The purpose of this document is to recommend international standards for, and promote harmonization of, the assessment of nonclinical developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) testing required to support human clinical trials and marketing authorization for pharmaceuticals. The guideline describes potential strategies and study designs to supplement available data to identify, assess, and convey risk. General concepts and recommendation s are also provided that should be considered when interpreting study data. This is a revision of the ICH guideline \"S5 Detection of Toxicity to Reproduction f or Medicinal Products\" that was originally published in 1993. This revision brings the guideline into alignment with other ICH guidelines, elaborates on the use of exposure margins in dose level selection, incorporates a section on risk assessment, and expands the scope to include vaccines and biopharmaceuticals . It also describes qualification of alternative assays , potential scenarios of use, and provides options for deferral of developmental toxicity studies. To assess a human pharmaceutical's effect on reproduction and development, there should generally be information available that addresses the potential impact of exposure to a pharmaceutical and , when appropriate, its metabolites (ICH M3 (1), ICH S6 (2)) on all stages of reproduction and development. No guideline can provide sufficient infor mation to cover all possible cases, and flexibility in testing strategy is warranted. Aim of Studies The aim of DART studies is to reveal any effect of the pharmaceutical on mammalian reproduction relevant for human risk assessment . As appropriate, the se t of studies conducted should encompass observations through one complete life cycle (i.e., from conception in one generation through conception in the following generation), and permit detection of immediate and latent adverse effects. The following stage s of reproduction are generally assessed: A) Premating to conception (adult male and female reproductive functions, development and maturation of gametes, mating behavior, fertilization). B) Conception to implantation (adult female reproductive functions, preimplantation development, implantation). C) Implantation to closure of the hard palate (adult female reproductive functions, embryonic development, major organ formation). D) Closure of the hard palate to the end of pregnancy (adult female reproductive functions, fetal development and growth, organ development and growth). E) Birth to weaning (parturition and lactation, neonate adaptation to extrauterine life, pre-weaning development and growth). F) Weaning to sexual maturity (post -weaning development an d growth, adaptation to independent life, onset of puberty and attainment of full sexual function, and effects on second generation). ICH S5(R3) Guideline 8 The risks to all stages should be assessed, unless the stage is not relevant to the intended population. The stages covere d in individual studies are left to the discretion of the Sponsor, although the timing of studies within the pharmaceutical development process is dependent on study populations and phase of pharmaceutical development (see ICH M3, ICH S6 and ICH S9 (3)). 2. SCOPE OF THE GUIDELI NE This guideline applies to all pharmaceuticals, including biopharmaceuticals, vaccines (and their novel constitutive ingredients) for infectious diseases, and novel excipients that are part of the final pharmaceutical product. For th e purposes of this guideline, the term \"pharmaceutical \" is used to encompass all of these treatment modalities. This guideline does not apply to cellular therapies, gene therapies and tissue -engineered products. The methodological principles (e.g., study d esign, dose selection and species selection, etc. ) outlined in this guideline apply to all compounds for which the conduct of reproductive and/or developmental toxicity studies is appropriate. This guideline should be read in conjunction with ICH M3, ICH S 6, and ICH S9 regarding whether and when nonclinical DART studies are warranted. 3. GENERAL CONSIDERATIO NS ON REPRODUCTIVE TOXICI TY ASSESSMENT The majority of pharmaceuticals being developed should be assess ed for all stages of the reproductive cycle identified above, although there can be some exceptions which should be justified, as indicated below. To support clinical development, t hese stages have typically been evaluated using three in vivo study types: 1) a f ertility and early embryonic development study (FEED - stages A and B), 2) embryo- fetal development studies in two species (EFD - stage s C and D ), and 3) a pre - and a postnatal development study (PPND - stages C through F). For each compound, the stages that are to be evaluated should be determined and the most appropriate studies to conduct should be identified. Key factors to consider when developing an overall integrated testing strategy to evaluate effects on reproduction and development include: The targeted patient population and conditions of use (especially in relation to reproductive potential and severity of disease); The formulation of the pharmaceutical and route(s) of administration intended for humans; Relevant data on toxicity ( which can also include data from in vitro , ex vivo and non-mammalian studies , and structure -activity relationships), pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacological similarity to other pharmaceuticals ; Aspects of the general biology of the pharmaceutical target , or known roles of the target in reproduction or development. These concepts are discussed in more detail throughout the guideline. To the extent that it does not diminish the overall risk assessment , the experimental strategy should minimize the use of a nimals. Approaches towards this goal can include the conduct of studies that combine typical study types (see Section 7), as well as appropriately ICH S5(R3) Guideline 9 qualified alternative assays for risk assessment (see Annex 2). Since many clinical development programs are terminated prior to Phase 3, a nimal use can also be reduced by appropriately timing studies to support ongoing clinical development (e.g., embryo -fetal developmental toxicity data to support enrollment of women of childbearing potential) as per ICH M3 . DART studies should, in general , be conducted according to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations , as they will contribute to the risk assessment. However, if a relevant DART risk is identified in a non- GLP study, repetition of the study to confirm the finding(s) under GLP conditions is not necessarily warranted . A relevant risk is one that occurs at or near intended clinical exposures and is of a nature that is reasonably likely to translate to humans (see Section 9). It is recognized that GLP compliance is not expected for some study types, or aspects of some studies, employing specialized test systems or methods . However, high quality scientific standards should be applied with data collection recor ds readily available. Areas of non -compliance should be identified within the study report and their impact on study results/data interpretation should be considered relative to the overall safety assessment. Target Patient Population/ Therapeutic Indicati on Considerations The intended patient population or therapeutic indication can influence the extent of DART testing. Studies evaluating all stages of reproduction and development are not warranted if the disease indicates that DART will have minimal impact on the risk of the pharmaceutical in the target population. For example, studies covering all stages are not necessarily appropriate for an exclusively post -menopausal female patient population, for use in the pediatric or juvenil e pre- pubescent population, or for patient populations in hospitalized settings where pregnancy can be excluded . Pharmacology Considerations Before designing a testing strategy, it should be determined if the intended pharmacologic effects of a pharmaceut ical are known to be incompatible with fertility, normal EFD, or assessment of particular endpoints (e.g., a general anesthetic and assessment of mating behavior). This assessment can be based on data with other pharmaceuticals with similar pharmacology, known effects of target engagement, or on knowledge of effects in humans with related genetic diseases. For example, it would be appropriate to modify the design of a PPND study for a pharmaceutical developed to prevent pre -term labor. If the intended pharm acologic effects are incompatible with the study endpoints, testing for a particular reproductive endpoint is not warranted , with justification. Toxicity Considerations Repeat ed-dose toxicity studies with sexually mature animals can provide important information on toxicity to reproductive organs that can affect the design of a DART study. The existing toxicology data for the compound should always be considered, taking into account the dose levels, toxicokinetic profile, and dosing duration. For example, the standard fertility study design can be modified to alter the duration of dosing, or the start of cohabitation, for a compound that affects testicular tissue. ICH S5(R3) Guideline 10 Timing Considerations General guidance on the timing for conduct of studies assessing reproductive and developmental endpoints is described in ICH M3, ICH S6, and ICH S9. The timing for when to conduct specific DART assessments should take into consideration the need for these data to support the safe use of the pharmaceutical in clinical t rials or the intended patient population. Consequently, it can be appropriate to consider altering the timing of the assessment of specific reproductive stages. Additional options are discussed in Section 4.2.2 and 4.2.3. Toxicokinetics (TK) Exposure data can be generated in either reproductive ( dose range finding ( DRF ) or pivotal) or repeat ed-dose toxicity studies. However, given the potential for meaningful changes in TK parameters induced by pregnancy, it is recommended to determine if pregnancy alters exposure . If dose selection is based on exposure ratio (see section 6.1.3), GLP -compliant TK data in pregnant animals is expected . Sampling day(s) should be justified. When warranted, determination of the pharmaceutical's concentration in the embryo or fetus can facilitate interpretation of discordant or equivocal evidence of developmental hazard. This i nformation can be collected in a separate study to determine the actual exposure . However, a direct comparison to the pot ential levels in the human conceptus is not appropriate. Evidence of lactational excretion can be obtained , when warranted, by sampling milk or by demonstrating exposure in offspring during the pre -weaning period. General concepts regarding TK data collection are discussed in ICH S3A ( 4). 4. DESIGN AND EV ALUATIO N OF IN VIVO MAMMALI AN STUDIES The strategy to evaluate the potential reproductive and developmental risk of a pharmaceutical generally include s one or more in vivo studies. The key factor is that, in total, they leave no gaps between stages and allow for evaluation of all stages of the reproductive process, although in some species (e.g., the non- human primate ( NHP )) it is not possible to evaluate all stages. For most pharmaceuticals, the 3 -study design will usually be appropriate , although various combinations of these study designs can be conducted to address specific product needs and to reduce animal use. Study details for the FEED, EFD, and PPND studies, and combinations thereof, can be found in Annex 1. The stages covered in individual studies are left to the discretion of the sponsor. All available pharmacological, toxico kinetic, and toxicological data for the pharmaceutical should be considered in determining which study design(s) should be used. Strategy to Address Fertility and Early Embryonic Development (FEED) The aim of the FEED study is to test for adverse effects resulting from treatment initiated prior to mating of males and/or females and continued through mating and implantation. This comprises evaluation of Stages A and B of the reproductive process. R esults from repeat ed-dose toxicity studies of at least two weeks duration can often be used to design the fertility study without conducting further dose ranging studies, although studies of such short duration can be insufficient to reveal all adverse effects. ICH S5(R3) Guideline 11 A mating phase is expected in most cases when a FEED study is warranted to support exposure of the target population. Such studies are typical ly performed in rodents. If no adverse effects on fertility are anticipated, both sexes can be treated and cohabited together in the same study. If effects on fertility are identified in the study, the affected sex should then be determined. In contrast, i f adverse effects are anticipated based on mode of action or on the results of repeat ed-dose studies, each treated sex can be cohabited with untreated animals of the opposite sex. This can be achieved using separate treatment arms within a single study or by the conduct of two separate FEED studies. Reversibility of adverse effects on fertility and early embryonic development can have an important impact on risk assessment. The FEED study design in female rodent s (see Annex 1) allows for the detection of e ffects on the estrous cycle, tubal transport, implantation, and development of preimplantation stages of the embryo. When estrous/menstrual cycles are evaluated, it is important to obtain baseline cycle data (over 2 or 3 cycles minimum) to distinguish betw een treatment -related effects and inter/intra animal variability. The monitoring of estrous cyclicity should continue through the time of confirmation of mating. The FEED study design for male rodents that includes 2 to 4 weeks of treatment prior to cohabi tation allows for the detection of effects on spermatogenesis and epididymal transport. When data from repeat ed-dose studies suggest toxicity to the testis, it can be appropriate to extend the duration of pre -cohabitation treatment to 10 weeks; this permits assessment of effects on the full spermatogenic cycle as well as epididymal transport. The FEED study additionally permits detection of functional effects (e.g., on libido, epididymal sperm maturation, ejaculation) that can not be detected by histological examinations of the male reproductive organs. When there is cause for concern based on mode of action or data from previous studies, additional examinations can be included in repeat ed-dose toxicity and/or fertility studie s (e.g., sperm collection for counts and morphology/motility assessments, measuring hormone levels, or monitoring of the estrous/menstrual cycle) to further characterize potential effects on fertility. 4.1.1. Considerations for Biopharmaceuticals If the biophar maceutical is pharmacologically active in rodents or rabbits , a FEED study in one of these species is recommended. Mating evaluations are not generally feasible in non - rodents such as dogs and NHPs. For example, if NHPs are the only pharmacologically relev ant species (as for many monoclonal antibodies, see ICH S6), histopathological examinations of the reproductive tissues from the repeat ed-dose toxicity studies of at least three months duration can serve as a substitute for the fertility assessments. Such an approach should include a comprehensive histopathological examination of the reproductive organs from both male and female animals (Note 1). Unless the biopharmaceutical is intended to treat advanced cancer, in which case FEED studies are not warr anted, animals should be sexually mature at study initiation in order for an adequate evaluation of the reproductive tissues to be made. T hese data would only provide information on the structure of the reproductive tissues, as no functional assessment of fertil ity can be made and predicting effects on fertility and early embryonic development is not always possible based solely on the results of histopathology assessments . ICH S5(R3) Guideline 12 Strategies to Address Embryo -Fetal Development (EFD) The aim of the EFD studies is to detect adverse effects on the pregnant female and development of the embryo and fetus following treatment (Stage C) of the pregnant female during organogenesis. EFD studies include evaluation of fetal development and survival (Stages C through D) . For most small molecules, effects on EFD are typically evaluated in two species (i.e. , rodent and non- rodent (typically rabbit)) . At least one of the test species should exhibit the desired pharmacodynamic response. If the pharmaceutical is not pharmacodynamically active in any routinely used species (Section 5.1) then non-routine species (Section 5.2) , genetically modified animals , or use of a species -specific surrogate molecule (Section 5.3) (e.g., in the case of oligonucleotides) can be considered, provided ther e is sufficient characterization of the model to ensure pharmacologic relevance. Genetically modified animals and surrogate molecules are generally most useful for hazard identification , but have limitations when used for risk assessment. Even w hen there are no relevant models (e.g., the pharmacological target only exists in humans, either normally or in the diseased state), EFD studies should be conducted in two species to detect the adversity of off -target effects or secondary pharmacology. Clearly positive results for the induction of malformations or embryo -fetal lethality (MEFL) , in a single species, at exposures similar to that at the projected clinical exposure at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD) can be sufficient for risk assessm ent. Under limited circumstances, other approaches can be used in place of definitive EFD studies (see Annex 2). Alternatively, there can be adequate information to communicate risk without conducting EFD studies. Evidence suggesting an adverse effect of the intended pharmacological mechanism on EFD (e.g., mechanism of action, phenotypic data from genetically modified animals) can be sufficient to communicate risk. 4.2.1. Considerations for Biopharmaceuticals The effect of biopharmaceuticals on EFD should typically be assessed in two species (one rodent and one non- rodent) if both are pharmacologically relevant. However, the rodent is often not pharmacologically relevant, in which case EFD assessment in a single pharmacologically relevant non- rodent species can be conducted. In cases where the NHP is the only relevant species, an enhanced pre- and postnatal development ( ePPND ) study can be conducted instead of an EFD study. Biopharmaceuticals intended for the treatment of advanced cancer typically need only be assessed in a single pharmacologically relevant species (ICH S9) . When no relevant species can be identified because the biopharmaceutical does not interact with the orthologous target in any species relevant to reproductive toxicity testing, use of surrogate molecules or transgenic models can be considered, as described in ICH S6. Calculating safety margins relative to human exposures with surrogate molecules is not appropriate. If there are no relevant species, genetically modified animals or surrogat es available, in vivo reproductive toxicity testing is not meaningful. In this case, the approach used for risk assessment, or rationale for not conducting studies, should be justified. ICH S5(R3) Guideline 13 4.2.2. Alternative Approaches for Addressing EFD Risk 4.2.2.1. Use of Alternative A ssays A number of alternative in vitro, ex vivo, and non-mamma lian in vivo assays (alternative assays) have been developed to detect potential hazards to embryo -fetal development . They have been used as drug discovery screens for adverse effects on EFD and have assist ed in the understanding of the mechanism of toxicity, which can be useful for translating nonclinical data to human risk (especially for human -specific targets). The continued use of alternative assays for th ese purpose s is encouraged. If properly qualified, alternative assays have the potential to defer or replace (in certain circumstances) conventional in vivo studies. This has the added benefit of potentially reducing animal use. Concepts to consider when qualifying these assays , and examples when the use of such assays could be appropriate , appear in Annex 2. Approaches that incorporate alternative assays should provide a level of confidence for human safety assurance at least equivalent to that provided by the current testing paradig ms described above . Based on the direction of scientific development as of the writing of this document, it is expected that for regulatory purposes multiple alternative assays will be used within a tiered or battery approach. These testing strategies will be qualified within a certain context of use, which is defined by the chemical applicability domain of the assa y, and by characterization of the biological mechanisms covered by the assay . 4.2.3. Potential Approaches to Defer Definitive In Vivo Testing as Part of an Integrated Testing Strategy The design of an appropriate testing strategy relies on a cumulative weight -of-evidence approach. ICH M3 allows preliminary embryo -fetal developmental (pEFD) toxicity data from two species to support the limited inclusion of women of childbearing potential (WOCBP ) (up to 150 WOCBP for up to 3 months) before conducting definitive EFD studies. Based on these considerations, this guideline expands on ICH M3 by allowing two additional options to support inclusion of WOCBP prior to Phase 3 clinical trials: 1) Qualified alternative assays which predict the outcome in one species (see Annex 2), can be combined with a pEFD from a second species to enable the limited inclusion of WOCBP (up to 150 WOCBP for up to 3 months). The altern ative assay and the second species should generally cover both a rodent and a non- rodent species. 2) Additional endpoints incorporated into at least one GLP pEFD study (specifically increasing the group size of evaluable litters with inclusion of skeletal exam inations ) performed in a pharmacologically relevant species , if available, combined with a pEFD in a 2nd species allows all regions to include an unlimited number of WOCBP in clinical trials through Phase 2. Strategy to Address Effects on Pre- and Postnat al Development ( PPND) The aim of the PPND study is to detect adverse effects following exposure of the maternal animal from implantation through weaning to evaluate effects on the pregnant or lactating female and development of the offspring. Since manifes tations of effects induced during this period can be delayed, development of the offspring is monitored through sexual ICH S5(R3) Guideline 14 maturity (i.e. , Stages C to F). The rodent is usually used to assess PPND; however, other species can be used as appropriate (See Annex 1). In most cases, a preliminary (dose range finding) PPND study is not warranted, because the appropriate information is generally available from prior studies. However, a preliminary PPND study with termination of the pups before or at weaning can be used to select dose levels or inform study design and/or to provide pup exposure data. If a modified PPND/ePPND study design is being considered to support pediatric development, see ICH S11 (5). 4.3.1. Considerations for Biopharmaceuticals For pharmaceuticals that can only be tested in the NHP, the ePPND study can provide a limited assessment of postnatal effects , but it is not generally feasible to follow the offspring through maturity (See Annex 1 and ICH S6) . 5. TEST SYSTEM SELECTIO N Routine Test Species Mammalian species should be used to detect DART . The use of the same species and strain as in already completed toxicity studies can eliminate the need to use additional animals or conduct additional studies to characterize pharmacokinetics and metabolism, and/or f or dose range finding. The species used should be well -characterized and relevant for detecting effects on the endpoints in a particular study (e.g. , with respect to health, fertility, fecundity, background rates of malformation and embryo -fetal death, etc.). 5.1.1. Selection of Species for DART Testing The rat is generally appropriate for DART testing and is the most often used rodent species for reasons of practicality, general knowledge of pharmacology in this species, the extensive toxicology data usually a vailable for interpretation of nonclinical observations and the large amount of historical background data. The mouse is also often used as the rodent species for many of the same reasons. For assessment of EFD only, a second mammalian non- rodent species i s typically evaluated, although there are exceptions (e.g., vaccines and biopharmaceuticals, see Sections 5.1.2 and 5.2, respectively). The rabbit has proven to be useful in identifying human teratogens that have not been detected in rodents and is routine ly used as the non- rodent species based on the extensive historical background data, availability of animals, and practicality. 5.1.2. Species Selection for Preventative and Therapeutic Vaccines The animal species selected for testing of vaccines (with or without adjuvants) should demonstrate an immune response to the vaccine. The type of developmental toxicity study conducted, and the choice of the animal model , should be justified based on the immune response observed and the ability to administer an appr opriate dose. Typically, rabbits, rats, or mice are used in developmental toxicity studies for vaccines. Even though ICH S5(R3) Guideline 15 quantitative and qualitative differences can exist in the responses (e.g., in humoral and cellular endpoints) between species, it is usuall y sufficient to conduct developmental toxicity studies in a single species. Although the degree and time course of transfer of maternal antibodies across the placenta var ies between species, a developmental toxicity study in rabbits, rats, or mice can still provide important information regarding potential embryo -fetal toxicity of the vaccine components/formulation and safety of the product during pregnancy. NHP should be used only if no other relevant animal species demonstrates an immune response. When there is a lack of an appropriate animal model (including NHP), a n EFD toxicity study in rabbits, rats, or mice can still provide important information regarding potential embryo -fetal toxicity of the vaccine components/formulation and safety of the product during pregnancy. Non-routine Test Species Species other than the rat, mouse or rabbit can be used to evaluate the effects of pharmaceuticals on various reproductive stages. When considering the use of other species, their advantages and disadvantages (sum marized in Table 1 of Annex 1) should be considered in relation to the pharmaceutical being tested, the study design and selected endpoints , and the ability to extrapolate results to the human situation . NHPs should be considered a non- routine test species . They are most typically used for evaluating effects on embryo -fetal development and early postnatal development for biopharmaceuticals that are only pharmacologically active in primates, as described in ICH S6. However, there are additional considerations that limit the utility of studies in NHPs for assessing some endpoints for DART risk assessment (see Annex 1 and ICH S6). Use of Disease Models, Genetically Modified Models, and Surrogate Molecules Animal models of disease, genetically modified models, and surrogate molecules can be valuable for investigat ing the effect of the intended pharmacology on development and reproduction. Studies in disease models can be of value in cases where the data obtained from healthy animals could be misleading or otherw ise not apply to the disease conditions in the clinical setting. The model should be pharmacologically relevant and appropriate for the development and reproductive endpoints being assessed. The pathophysiology of the disease course in the model should be characterized. Some differences from the human pathophysiology would not preclude its use if these are unlikely to confound data interpretation. Animal- to-animal variability should be characterized and appropriate within the context of the study. If histor ical control information is limited, r eference data for the study endpoints should be available or should be generated during the study to aid data interpretation. Genetically modified models can be used to provide information about on -target effects of a pharmaceutical on DART parameters through permanent or conditional alterations in target activity. Such models can inform on whether the biology of the target is closely linked to adverse effects on reproduction and development in routine test species . ICH S5(R3) Guideline 16 When the pharmaceutical does not have adequate activity against the target in the routine test species, surrogate molecules can be used to assess potential adverse effects on reproduction and development. 6. DOSE LEVEL SELECTION , ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION AND SCHEDULE The choice of dose levels, schedule and route of administration are important study design considerations and should be based on all available information (e.g., pharmacology, repeated -dose toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and dose range finding studies ). Guidance on the principles of dose selection for small molecules and biopharmaceuticals is given in ICH M3 and ICH S6, respectively. When sufficient information on tolerability in the test system is not available, dose range finding studies are advisable. Dose Selection There are a number of dose selection endpoints that can be used for DART studies. All endpoints discussed in this section are considered equally appropriate in terms of study design. The high dose in the definitive studies should be one that is predicted to comply with one or more of the concepts set forth in sections 6.1.1 to 6.1.5 below. The selected doses should take into account observations made in previous studies (e.g., repeat ed-dose, TK, DRF , etc.). There can be instances where fewer than three dose levels are sufficient to provide the necessary information for risk assessment. Justification for high dose selection using endpoints other than those discussed below can be made on a case -by-case basis. 6.1.1. Toxicity -based Endpoint This endpoint is based on inducing a minimal level of toxicity in the parental animals at the high dose. Factors limiting the high dose determined from previously conducted studies could include, but are not limited to: Alterations in body weight (gain or absolute; either reductions or increases). Minor, transient changes in body weight gain or body weight are not appropriate for dose selection . When assessing weight change effects, the entire dosing duration of the study should be considered. Exaggerated pharmacological responses (e.g., excessive sedation or hypoglycemia) Toxicological responses (e.g., convulsions, excessive embryo -fetal lethality , clinical pathology perturbations ). Specific target organ toxicity that would interfere with the study endpoi nts within the duration of the planned DART study. 6.1.2. Saturation of Systemic Exposure Endpoint High dose selection based on saturation of systemic exposure measured by systemic availability of pharmaceutical -related substances can be appropriate. There is li ttle value in increasing the administered dose if it does not result in increased plasma concentration of parent or metabolites . ICH S5(R3) Guideline 17 6.1.3. Exposure Margin Based Endpoint It can be appropriate to select doses based on predicted exposure margins relative to the exposure at the MRHD. For small molecules, a systemic exposure representing a large multiple of the human AUC or C max at the MRHD can be an appropriate endpoint for high dose selection. Doses providing an exposure in pregnant animals > 25fold the exposure at the MRHD are generally considered appropriate as the maximum dose for DART studies (Note 2 ). The 25 -fold exposure margin should be established in a GLP -compliant dose range finding/pEFD or definitive study. Usually this multiple should be determined ba sed on parent drug levels; however, consideration should also be given to ensuring an adequate exposure margin to major human metabolites (see ICH M3 and ICH M3 Q&A ). In the case of prodrugs, it can be more appropriate to establish the exposure multiple on the basis of the active metabolite, particularly if the test species has a lower ratio of active metabolite to prodrug, compared to humans. The basis for the moiety used for comparison (parent drug or metabolite) should be justified. For pharmaceuticals that have demonstrated pharmacodynamic activity in the test species only at exposures > 25- fold that projected at the MRHD, higher doses can be warranted to assess adverse effects of exaggerated pharmacology. However, irrelevant off -target effects are more likely to be observed. When exposure -based endpoints are used as the basis for selection of the dose levels for EFD studies, TK data from pregnant animals in a GLP -compliant study is expected. The choice for the use of total vs. fraction unbound pharmaceutical exposures should be justified and consistent with the entire nonclinical development program as outlined in ICH S3A. 6.1.3.1. Exposure -based Approach for Biopharmaceuticals Exposure -based margins can be appropriate to select doses for biopharmaceutic als as per ICH S6. Generally, the dose should provide the maximum intended pharmacological effect in the preclinical species or provide an approximately 10- fold exposure multiple over the maximum exposure to be achieved in the clinic, whichever is higher. ICH S6 should be consulted with regard to dose adjustment for differences in target binding affinity and other relevant factors. 6.1.4. Maximum Feasible Dose (MFD) Endpoint The MFD can be used for high dose selection when the physico- chemical properties of the pharmaceutical (or formulation) associated with the route/frequency of administration and the anatomical/physiological attributes of the test species limit the amount of the pharmaceutical that can be administered. Use of the MFD should maximize exposure i n the test species, rather than maximize the administered dose, as per ICH M3 Q&A (1). Note that changes to the frequency of dose administration can be considered to increa se the total feasible daily exposure (see Section 6.3) . 6.1.5. Limit Dose Endpoint A limit dose of 1 g/kg/day can generally be applied when other dose selection factors have not been attained with lower dose levels (see also ICH M3 for other considerations). ICH S5(R3) Guideline 18 6.1.6. Selection of Lower Dose Levels It is generally desirable to establish a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for DART. The selection of lower dose levels should take into account exposure, pharmacology, and toxicity, such that the dose -response of findings can be established when appropriate. The low dose should generally provide a low multiple (e.g., 1 to 5- fold) of the human exposure at the MRHD. Dose levels that yield exposures that are sub -therapeutic in humans should be justified. Route In general, the route of administration should be the clinical route. If, however, sufficient exposure cannot be achieved using the clinical route or the clinical route is not feasible, a different route should be considered. When multiple routes of administration are being evaluated in humans, a single route in the test species can be adequate provided that sufficient systemic exposure is achieved compared to that of all clinical routes and that there is adequate coverage for the metabolites. Schedule Dosing schedules used in the toxicity studies determine the exposure profile, which can be importan t in the risk assessment. Although mimicking the clinical schedule is often sufficient, a more or a less frequent schedule can be appropriate. For example, twice daily dosing can be warranted with compounds that are quickly metabolized in the test species , although pragmatic factors (e.g., study logistics, stress on animals) should be considered when a more frequent schedule is contemplated. It can also be important to alter the dosing schedule to ensure that adequate exposure is obtained at all critical st ages of reproduction and/or development being evaluated in a given study . Dose Selection and Study Designs for Vaccine s This guideline covers vaccines (adjuvanted or not) used in both preventative and therapeutic indications against infectious diseases. While not within the scope of this guideline, the principles outlined can be applicable to the nonclinical testing of vaccines for other indications as well (e.g., cancer). The types of reproductive and/or developmental toxicity studies used for preventative and therapeutic vaccines depend on the target population for the vaccine and the relevant reproductive risk. Generally, DART studies are not warranted for vaccin es being developed for neonates, pre -pubertal children, or geriatric populations. For reproductive toxicity studies of vaccines, it is typically sufficient to assess a single dose level capable of eliciting an immune response in the animal model (Section 5.1.2), using the clinical route of administration . This single dose level should be the maximum human dose without correcting for body weight (i.e., 1 human dose = 1 animal dose). If it is not feasible to administer the maximum human dose to the animal because of a limitation in total volume that can be administered, or because of dose -limiting toxicity, whether local or systemic, a dose that exceeds the human dose on a mg/kg basis can be used. To use a reduced dose, justification as to why a full human dose cannot be used in an animal model should be provided. ICH S5(R3) Guideline 19 The vaccination r egimen should maximize maternal antibody titers and/or immune response throughout the embryonic, fetal, and early postnatal periods. Timing and number of doses will depend on the onset and duration of the immune response of the particular vaccine. When dev eloping vaccines to be given during pregnancy, a justification should be provided for the specific study design, based upon its intended use (e.g., protecting the mother during pregnancy or protecting the child early postnatally). Daily dosing regimens ca n lead to overexposure to the vaccine constituents. Episodic dosing of pregnant animals rather than daily dosing is recommended. Also, episodic dosing better approximates the proposed clinical immunization schedule for most preventive and therapeutic vacci nes. Considering the short gestational period of routine animal species, it is generally recommended to administer a priming dose(s) to the animals several days or weeks prior to mating in order to elicit peak immune response during the critical phases of pregnancy (i.e., the period of organogenesis). The dosing regimen can be modified according to the intended vaccination schedule in humans. At least one dose should be administered during early organogenesis to evaluate potential direct embryotoxic effects of the components of the vaccine formulation and to maintain a high antibody response throughout the remainder of gestation. If embryo- fetal toxicity is observed, this can be further assessed using subgroups of animals that are dosed at certain time points. In cases where a vaccine includes a novel active constitutive ingredient (including novel adjuvants) , consideration of additional testing strategies similar to those for non -vaccine products can be appropriate. 7. POSSIBLE COMBINATION STUDY DESIGNS IN RO DENTS Although three separate study designs, i.e., FEED (stages A and B), EFD (stage s C through D) and PPND (stages C t hrough F) have been employed to develop the majority of pharmaceuticals, various c ombinations of these study designs can be conducted to reduce animal use. The main advantage of combination designs is that all relevant stages of the reproductive process can be assessed using fewer animals . Combination studies can also better mimic the exposure duration in the clinic, especially for drugs wi th long half -lives. A common combination study design is a combined Fertility and EFD study (stages A through D) with a separate PPND study (stages C through F) . Designs and study details for FEED, EFD, and PPND studies, and combinations thereof, can be found in Annex 1. In cases w here no effects on male or female fertility are anticipated, or where extending the dosing period is appropriate due to observation of reproductive organ toxicity in a repeat ed- dose toxicity study, a combination design of repeat ed-dose and fertility studies can be considered. After a defined dosing period within the repeat ed-dose toxicity study , males can be paired with sexually mature females (whether untreated, or dosed for at least two weeks prior to mating). This combination study can reduce the number of animals used, but the number of mating pairs per group should be at least 16. Further, if treat ed, dosing of females can be extended until the end of organogenesis, thereby allowing evaluation of EFD endpoints ( Annex 1 ). ICH S5(R3) Guideline 20 8. DATA REPORTING AND S TATISTICS Data Reporting Individual values should be tabulated in a clear concise manner to account for all animals in the study. The data tables should allow ready tracking of individual animals and their conceptuses, from study initiation through study conclusion. Fetal morphologic abnormalities should be described using industry -harmonized terminology. All findings for each litter should be clearly listed by conceptus. Summary listings should be prepared by type of abnormality. The inclusion or exclusion of data from non-pregnant animals in summary tables should be clearly indicated. Interpretation of study d ata relies primarily on comparison with the concurrent control group. Historical control/reference data can be used to assist data interpretation. Recent historical control data from the performing laboratory is preferable. Contemporary data typically from a five -year period is desirable and permits identification of genetic drift. Statistics Statistical testing to assess the significance of differences between the treated and control groups is expected in definitive studies. Many of the datasets from DART studies do not follow a normal distribution, necessitating the use of non- parametric statistical methods. Cesarean, fetal and postnatal data summary statistics should be calculated using the litter as the unit of analysis . Statistical significance need no t convey a positive signal, nor lack of statistical significance impute absence of effect. Determination of biological plausibility, based on all available pharmacologic and toxicologic data, is often useful. 9. PRINCIPLES OF RISK ASSESSMENT As described in the preceding sections of this guideline, all available data garnered from the pharmaceutical, related compounds, human genetics, and knowledge of the role of target biology in human reproduction should be used to address potential reproductive risks in humans under the conditions of use, both during clinical trials and after marketing authorization. Any limitations (e.g., test system relevance, achieved exposure), uncertainties and data gaps in the available nonclinical DART data package should be addressed and their impact assessed. Generally, the results from definitive in vivo studies in an appropriate species with adequate exposures carry more weight than those from alternative assays or preliminary studies. Risk assessment is a continuous process throu gh product development as more information becomes available. Not all findings reported in DART studies are adverse. When a finding is deemed adverse, several factors should be considered in a weight -of-evidence evaluation for risk assessment. These can i nclude exposure margins, biological plausibility , evidence of a dose -response relationship, potential for reversibility, the potential for confounding parental toxicity, and evidence for cross -species concordance. For rare malformations, the absence of increased frequency with dose does not always alleviate concern. Comparison of pharmaceutical exposure at the NOAEL in the test species to the exposure at the MRHD is an important component of the risk assessment . This comparison should be based on the most relevant metric (e.g., AUC, C max, C min, body surface area- adjusted ICH S5(R3) Guideline 21 dose). In general, there is increased concern when the NOAEL occurs at exposures less than 10- fold the human exposure at the MRHD; above this thre shold, concern is reduced. Effects that are limited to occurrence at more than 25 -fold the human exposure at the MRHD are usually of minor concern for the clinical use of the pharmaceutical. The most relevant margin is generally the exposure metric in the most sensitive species, unless appropriately justified otherwise . Biological plausibility is assessed by comparison of pharmacologic mechanism of action with the known role of the target in reproduction or development. A finding that can be interpreted as a consequence of pharmacology suggests that it will be of concern for humans. This relationship is further strengthened by evidence that the finding is dose -related, whether characterized as increasing incidence or severity. Absence of biological plausibil ity does not preclude off -target toxicity, particularly if this is characterized by a dose- response relationship. Understanding the potential for reversibility will alter the risk assessment. Effects on male and female fertility that are reversible after c essation of treatment are of less concern . Conversely, critical irreversible developmental endpoints , such as death or malformation , are of increased concern. Other forms of developmental toxicity (e.g. , growth retardation, functional deficits), may or may not be reversible. Generally, transient findings (e.g., skeletal variations, such as wavy ribs in rodents) are of less concern when they occur in isolation. Similarly, variations that are indicative of growth retardation in the presence of reduced fetal w eight are of less concern. However, an overall increase in the incidence of variations (qualitatively similar or not) can suggest increas ed concern for dysmorphogenesis in the presence of an equivocal increase in malformations . The role of parental toxici ty should be considered in determination of the relevance of findings. Embryo- fetal toxicity observed in the presence of maternal toxicity should be considered carefully to determine the likelihood that the finding is relevant for humans. Specifically, evaluation of the concordance between individual litter findings and the severity of maternal toxicity in the dam could be helpful in this assessment. It should not be assumed that developmental toxicity is s econdary to maternal toxicity, unless such a relati onship is demonstrated de novo, or relevant published literature can be cited. Also, consistency of findings reported among studie s, or between species can strengthen the concern for an adverse effect. Increased fetal lethality seen in a rodent EFD study that is consistent with decreased live litter sizes in the PPND study is an example of cross -study concordance. Observations of increased post implantation loss in rats and rabbits is an example of cross -species concordance. Further knowledge of the mechanism of reproductive or developmental effects identified in animal studies can help to explain differences in responses between species and provide inform ation on the human relevance of the effect (e.g., corticosteroid -induced cleft palate in mice). A specific risk assessment conducted for breastfeeding would be predicated on hazards identified by the in vivo littering study (PPND or ePPND). These hazards can include adverse effects on offspring growth and development that are attributed to excretion of the pharmaceutical in the milk. Systemic exposure data in the pups from the littering study, if available, can also be compared with projected lactational exposures in the human infant. While interspecies differences in milk composition preclude a direct quantitative correlation of animal milk levels to human milk levels of a pharmaceutical, the presence of pharmaceutical in animal milk generally indicates th e presence of pharmaceutical in human milk. ICH S5(R3) Guideline 22 Lastly, a vailable human data can influence the overall assessment of human reproductive risk. 10. ENDNOTES Note 1: In particular, the testes and epididymides should be sampled and processed using methods which preserve the tissue architecture of the seminiferous epithelium. A detailed qualitative microscopic evaluation with awareness of the spermatogenic cycle is a sen sitive means to detect effects on spermatogenesis. While generally not warranted, additional experimental endpoints (e.g., immunohistochemistry, homogenization resistant spermatid counts, flow cytometry, quantitative analysis of staging) can be incorporate d into the study design to further characterize any identified effects. In females, a detailed qualitative microscopic examination of the ovary (including follicles, corpora lutea, stroma, interstitium, and vasculature), uterus and vagina should be conduct ed with awareness of the reproductive cycle and the presence of primordial and primary follicles. Note 2: An analysis of 22 known human or presumed human teratogens showed that if MEFL was observed, exposure at the lowest observed adverse effect level ( LOAEL ) in at least one species was < 6 -fold the exposure at the MRHD (Andrews et al. (6)). This indicates that using a > 25 -fold exposure ratio for high- dose selection in the EFD toxicity studies would have been sufficient to detect the teratogenic hazard f or all these pharmaceuticals. The analysis also showed that for human teratogens that were detected in animal species , the exposure at the NOAEL in at least one species was < 4- fold the exposure at the MRHD. In addition, a survey was conducted on EFD toxic ity studies by the IQ DruSafe Leadership Group (Andrews et al. (7) ). This survey identified 153 and 128 definitive rat and rabbit EFD studies, respectively, that achieved 15- fold animal to human parent drug exposure ratios (using human exposure at the intended therapeutic dose) in the absence of confounding (i.e., dose -limiting) maternal toxicity. These data show that dosing animals to achieve exposures 25- fold human exposures when there is no maternal toxicity (that would otherwise limit the high dose) , only infrequently detects MEFL. In all these cases, MEFL findings were not observed until exposures exceeded 50 -fold and findings at such high exposures are not believed to be relevant to human risk assessment. In the absence of confounding maternal toxi city, the selection of a high dose for EFD and PPND studies that represents a > 25 -fold exposure ratio to human plasma exposure of total parent compound at the intended maximal therapeutic dose is therefore considered pragmatic and reasonably sufficient fo r detecting outcomes relevant for human risk assessment. 11.

ICH S5(R3) Guideline 25 ANNEX 1 IN VIVO STUDY DESIGNS Outlined below are advantages and disadvantages to the use of various species utilized in DART studies. Table 1 : Principle Advantages and Disadvantages of Various Species for Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity Testing Routine Species Species Advantages Disadvantages Rat Well -understood biology Widely used for pharmacodynamics and drug discovery Robust reproductive capacity with short gestation Large group sizes and litter size Data available from repeat ed- dose toxicity study Suitable for all stages of testing Widespread laboratory experience and availability Extensive historical data Different placentation to human (e.g., timing, inverted yolk sac) Dependence on prolactin as the primary hormone for establishment and maintenance of early pregnancy, which makes them sensitive to some pharmaceuticals (e.g., dopamine agonists) Highly sensitive to pharmaceuticals that disrupt parturition (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in late pregnancy) Less sensitive than humans to fertility perturbations Limited application for foreign proteins o Limited or no pharmacologic activity o Potential impact of immunogenicity ICH S5(R3) Guideline 26 Rabbit Similar advantages to rats Non-rodent model Suitable for serial semen sampling and mating studies Placental transfer of antibodies more closely approximates primates than rodents, an advantage for DART testing of vaccines Limitations similar to rat for foreign proteins Limited historical data for fertility and pre -/postnatal studies Sensitive to gastr ointestinal disturbances; (e.g., some antibiotics) Prone to spontaneous abortion General physical condition difficult to monitor using clinical signs Should generate PD , toxicity , and TK data as not generally used for toxicology programs (except for vacci nes) Mouse Similar advantages to rats Genetically modified models available or can be generated Surrogate molecules are often available Uses small amounts of test material Similar limitations to rats Small fetus size and tissue volumes Stress sensitivity Malformation clusters are known to occur Non-routine Species Species Advantages Disadvantages Cynomolgus Monkey (NHP) Generally more phylogenetically and physiologically similar to humans than other species More likely than rodents to show similar pharmacology to humans Placentation similar to human Data available from repeat ed- dose toxicity study Transfer of antibodies across the placenta similar to humans Small group size, hence low statistical power and wide variability across groups Low fecundity o Single offspring High background pregnancy lossLimited availability of breeding animals Long menstrual cycle (30 days) and gestation (165 days) Impractical for fertility (mating) studies F1 reproduction function not practical to evaluate due to late sexual maturity (around 3 to 6 years of age) Sexual maturity cannot be determined by age and body weight ICH S5(R3) Guideline 27 Limited Use Species (primarily used for investigative purposes) Species Advantages Disadvantages Hamster Alternate rodent model that can be pharmacologically relevant High postnatal loss due to cannibalization Limited historical control data and laboratory experience Limited availability of postnatal behavioral and functional tests IV route difficult Aggressive Sensitive to GI disturbances Should generate PD , toxicity , and TK data as not generally used for toxicology programs Blood sampling is difficult Ethical considerations Less historical control data and laboratory experience/capability Highly variable age, weight and pregnancy history at the start Mini -pig Alternate non -rodent for general toxicity testing Short period of organogenesis (GD 11 -35) Defined genetic background and specific- pathogen- free animals Sexual maturity by 7 months Larger litter size compared to NHP Suitable for serial semen sampling and mating studies Sufficient historical background data on reproductive endpoints Limited number of experienced laboratories Long gestation (114 days) Uses a large amount of test material Minimal to no prenatal trans fer of antibodies ICH S5(R3) Guideline 28 Dog Usually have repeat ed-dose toxicity data Readily amenable to semen collection Long gestation (63 days) Limited historical control data and laboratory experience Limited availability of postnatal behavioral and functional tests Uses a large amount of test material Other mammalian species not listed here can also be used to evaluate the effects of pharmaceuticals on DART endpoints. 1.1 In Vivo Study Design Considerations Generally, within and between reproductive studies animals should be of comparable age, weight and parity at the start. The easiest way to fulfil these factors is to use animals that are young, sexually mature adults at the time of the start of dosing. The number of animals per group specified in individual studies is a balance based on scientific judgment from many years of experience with these study designs, and ethical considerations on the appropriate use of animals. Smaller group sizes can be suffici ent to demonstrate anticipated adverse effects on reproduction or development at clinically relevant exposures of the pharmaceutical. Evaluation of 16 to 20 litters for rodents and rabbits provides a degree of consistency among studies. Below 16 litters inter -study results become inconsistent, and above 20 to 24 litters per group, consistency and precision is not greatly enhanced. These numbers refer to litters available for evaluation. If groups are subdivided for different evaluations the number of anima ls starting the study should be adjusted accordingly. The suggested study designs below can be modified, particularly with respect to parameters, timings, and assessments and still meet the study objectives. Expert judgment should be used for adapting these framework designs for individual laboratories and purposes. 1.1.1 Fertility and Early Embryonic Development (FEED) Study The FEED study is designed to assess the maturation of gametes, mating behavior, fertility, preimplantation development of the em bryo, and implantation. For females, this includes effects on the estrous cycle and tubal transport. For males, it includes detection of functional effects (e.g., epididymal sperm maturation) that cannot be detected by histological examinations of the male reproductive organs. A combined male/female FEED study , in which both sexes are administered test article , is commonly used (See Table 2). However separate male only or female only studies can be conducted by substituting the appropriate number of untrea ted females or males in the study designs. ICH S5(R3) Guideline 29 Table 2: FEED Study Design: Rodents, combined male and female study a: Available data from repeated -dose toxicity studies and genotoxicity studies should be used to justify dosing duration, especially for detecting effects on spermatogenesis. A premating treatment interval of 2 weeks for females and 2 weeks for males can be used provided no effects have been found in repeated- dose toxicity studies of at least 2 weeks duration that preclude this. Treatment of males should continue throughout confirmation of mating, although termination following confirmation of female fertility can be valuable. Treatment of females should continue through at least implantation. This will Parameter Group size at least 16 of each sex Number of dose groups 4 (including 1 control) Administration perioda M: 2 weeks prior to cohabitation through at least confirmation of mating F: 2 weeks prior to cohabitation through implantation (GD6) Mating ratio 1 male:1 female Mating periodb 2 weeks Estrous cycle evaluation Daily, commencing 2 weeks before cohabitation and until confirmation of mating Clinical observations/mortality At least once daily Body weight At least twice weekly Food consumption At least once weekly (except during mating) Male necropsyc Preserve testes and epididymides for possible histological examination ; and evaluate on a case by case basis. Perform macroscopic examination and preserve organs with findings for possible histological evaluation; keep corresponding organs of sufficient controls for comparison. Sperm analysisd Optional Female necropsye On a case by case basis, p reserve ovaries and uteri for possible histological examination and evaluation. Perform macroscopic examination and preserve organs with findings for possible histological evaluation; keep corresponding organs of sufficient controls for comparison. Scheduled cesarean section Uterine implantation data Cesarean sections typically performed mid - gestation; corpora lutea counts, number of implantation sites, live and dead embryos ICH S5(R3) Guideline 30 permit evaluation of functional effects on fertility that cannot be detected by histopathological examination in repeated -dose toxicity studies and effects on mating behavior. b: Most rats or mice will mate within the first 5 days of cohabitation (i.e., at the first available estrus), but in some cases females can become pseudopregnant. Leaving the female with the male for longer than 2 weeks can allow these females to restart estrous cycles an d become pregnant. c: It can be of value to delay euthanasia of the males until the outcome of mating is known. In the event of an effect on fertility, males could be mated with untreated females to ascertain any potential male- mediation of the effect. A m ore complete evaluation of toxicity to the male reproductive system can be achieved if dosing is continued beyond mating and euthanasia delayed so that the males are exposed for the total duration of a spermatogenic cycle (e.g. , 10 weeks). d: Sperm analys is (e.g., sperm counts, motility, and/or morphology) sometimes can be useful if issues arise to support risk assessment. e: Termination of females around days 13 -15 of pregnancy in general is adequate to assess effects on fertility and reproductive function (e.g., to differentiate between live implantations and resorption sites). There is an option to terminate females near the end of gestation. 1.1.2 Embryo -Fetal Developmental (EFD) Toxicity Study The EFD toxicity study is designed to assess matern al toxicity relative to that in non - pregnant females, and to evaluate potential effects on embryo -fetal survival, intrauterine growth, and morphological development. Suggested study designs for rodents, rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys are described below. 1.1.2.1. Dose Range Finding Embryo- Fetal Developmental (EFD) Toxicity Study Dose range finding studies in mated females are most often used to select appropriate dose levels, or dose schedules, for the definitive rodent and rabbit EFD studies. Tolerability and TK data from existing repeated -dose toxicity studies can, however, be sufficient for this purpose. 1.1.2.2 Preliminary Embryo -Fetal Developmental (pEFD) Toxicity Study The pEFD toxicity study (Table 3) is similar in design to the definitive EFD toxicity study. A typ ical pEFD toxicity study design includes dosing over the period of organogenesis, has adequate dose levels, evaluates a minimum of 6 pregnant females per group, and includes assessments of fetal survival , fetal weight, external fetal abnormalities and soft tissue abnormalities (see ICH M3). 1.1.2.3 Definitive Embryo -Fetal Developmental (EFD) Toxicity Study The females are submitted to cesarean section near term. Assessments of fetal survival , fetal weight, external fetal abnormalities , soft tissue abnormalities and skeletal examinations are performed (Table 3). The timing given in Table 3 is for rodent, rabbit and cynomolgus monkeys; for other species appropriate timing should be used.ICH S5(R3) Guideline 31 Table 3: EFD Toxicity Study Rodent, Rabbit and Optionalc Yes Yes Yes Minimum number of pregnant females 6 16 16 16b Number of dose groups 4 (including 1 control) 4 (including 1 control) 4 (including 1 control) At least 2 (including 1 control) Administration periodd Species appropriate GD6/7 -17 (6/7- 15) GD6/7 -19 Approximately 20 at least GD 50 Antemortem endpoints Clinical observations/mortality At least once daily At least once daily At least once daily At least once daily Body weight At least twice weekly At least twice weeklye At least twice weeklye At least once weekly Food consumption At least once weekly At least once weekly At least once weekly Optional Toxicokinetics Optionalc Yes Yes Yes Postmortem endpoints Cesarean section f Species appropriate GD20/21 (17/18) GD28/29 GD100 Macroscopic examination Yes Yes Yes Optional Gravid u terine weight Optional Optional Optional NA Corpora lutea Yes Yes Yes NA Implant sites Yes Yes Yes NA Live and dead conceptuses Yes Yes Yes Yes Early and late resorptions Yes Yes Yes NA Gross evaluation of placenta Yes Yes Yes Yes Weight of placenta Optional Optional Optional Optional Fetal body weight Yes Yes Yes Yes Fetal sex Yes Yes Yes Yes Fetal external evaluationsg Yes Yes Yes Yes ICH S5(R3) Guideline 32 Fetal soft tissue evaluationsg Yes Yesg Yes Yes Fetal skeletal evaluationsh Optionalc Yesg Yes Yes ICH S5(R3) Guideline 33 a: If a NHP other than the Cynomolgus monkey is used, the study design should be adapted. b: Group sizes in EFD studies should yield a sufficient number of fetuses in order to assess potential adverse effects on morphological development. c: If the pEFD is used to defer a definitive EFD study, then the pEFD should be done in accordance with GLP regulations, TK data in pregnant animals should be collected, and skeletal evaluations should be performed. d: For rodents and rabbits, females are dosed with the test substance from implantation to closure of the hard palate (i.e., stage C of the reproductive process, see Section 1.1). For NHP, females are dosed from confirmation of pregnancy (approximately GD 20) to at least Day 50 (end of major organogenesis) e: Daily weighing of pregnant females during treatment can provide useful information. f: For rodents and rabbits, cesarean sections should be conducted approximately one day prior to expected parturition. Preserve organs with macroscopic findings for possible histological evaluation; keep corresponding organs of sufficient controls for comparison. For NHP, cesarean sections should be conducted on approximately GD 100. g: All fetuses should be examined for viability and abnormal ities. To permit subsequent assessment of the relationship between observations made by different techniques fetuses should be individually identified. h: Although it is preferable to examine all rodent fetuses for both soft tissue and skeletal alterations (if methods allow), it is acceptable to submit 50% of fetuses in each litter to separate examinations. 1.1.3 Pre- and Postnatal Developmental (PPND) T oxicity Study The PPND toxicity study is designed to assess enhanced toxicity relative to tha t in non- pregnant females, pre - and postnatal viability of offspring, altered growth and development, and functional deficits in offspring, including sexual maturation, reproductive capacity at maturity, sensory functions, motor activity, and learning and memory. The females are permitted to deliver and rear their offspring to weaning at which time at least one male and one female offspring per litter are selected for rearing to adulthood and mating to assess reproductive competence (see Table 4). ICH S5(R3) Guideline 34 Table 4: PPND Toxicity Study Design: Rats Parameter Group size At least 16 litters Number of dose groups 4 (including 1 control) Administration period From implantation (GD 6/7) through weaning Females Clinical observations/mortality At least once daily Body weight At least twice weekly Food consumption At least once weekly until mid-lactation Parturition observations GD 21 until complete Necropsy PND 21 At necropsy, preserve and retain tissues with macroscopic findings and corresponding control tissues for possible histological evaluation , count uterine implantation sites F1 Pre -weaning Clinical observations/mortality Daily from PND 0 Pre-and postweaning survival Daily from PND 0 Body weight and sex PND 0/1 and then at least twice per week Optional Standardization of litter size PND 4, to 4 or 5 pups per sex Physical developmenta Preweaning landmarks of development and reflex ontogeny (e.g. eye opening, pinna unfolding, surface righting, auditory startle, air righting, and response to light) F1 Post -weaning Selection for post -weaning evaluation and group sizeb PND 21, at least 1 male and 1 female/litter where possible to achieve 16 animals per group/sex Clinical observations/mortality Daily Body weight Weekly Optional Food consumption Weekly Sexual maturationc Females: vaginal opening Males: preputial separation Other functional testsd Assess sensory functions, motor activity, and learning and memory.

There can be circumstances where more animals per litter can be retained for independent functional assessments. c: Body weight should be recorded at the time of attainment to determine whether any differences from control are specific or related to general growth. d: Learning and memory should be evaluated in a complex learning task. Assessments of locomotor activity and startle reflex with prepulse inhibition (if conducted) should be evaluated over a sufficient period of time to demonstra te habituation. 1.1.3.1 Enhanced Pre - and Postnatal Developmental (ePPND) Toxicity Study in Non -Human Primate (NHP) The ePPND toxicity study (Table 5) is a study in NHP that combines the endpoints from both the EFD and PPND studies. In this study dosing is exte nded throughout the gestation period to parturition (e.g., GD20 to parturition). See ICH S6 for information on timing and additional parameters to be evaluated.

Most ePPND studies accrue pregnant animals over several months. 1.1.4 Combination Studies The possibility also exists to combine study types to m eet the goals of the development program. This is accomplished by incorporating appropriate endpoints measured in the separate studies summarized above into a single study. Concepts for various combination studies are provided below. 1.1.4.1 FEED and EFD The aim of the combined FEED/EFD study is to test for toxic effects resulting from treatment from before mating (males/females) through mating, implantation and until the end of organogenesis. This comprises evaluation of stages A t hrough D of the reproductive pr ocess (see Section 1 .1). This study design is most often used with rodents, although it could be used with non- rodents. A combined male/female F EED/ EFD can be used, but a separate female only option is possible where male fertility is assessed in a separate study such as a repeat ed dose study of suitable duration. The study would then use untreated males for mating purposes only. For specific study design and observational parameters see Sections 1.1.1. and 1.1.2 of this Annex . 1.1.4.2 Male Fertility and R epeated -Dose Toxicology Study It is also possible to evaluate male fertility during a rodent repeated -dose toxicity study. In this combination study, males that have been dosed for a defined number of weeks are paired with untreated females. Following co habitation, the males continue to be dosed until the scheduled termination of the repeated -dose toxicity study. The untreated females are subjected to cesarean section approximately two weeks after evidence of mating. The study endpoints collected are identical to those outlined in Section 1.1.1 of this Annex. To adequately assess ICH S5(R3) Guideline 37 effects, at least 16 males per group should be included in the study. Female fertility and other FEED endpoints will need to be evaluated in a separate study. ICH S5(R3) Guideline 38 ANNEX 2 ALTERNA TIVE ASSAYS Data generated from qualified alternative assays (see glossary) conducted alone or in conjunction with one or more in vivo studies can be utilized to support hazard identification and risk assessment under limited circumstances. Potential uses can include: circumstances where there is evidence suggesting an adverse effect on EFD (e.g., a mechanism of action affecting fundamental pathways in developmental biology, phenotypic data from genetically modified animals, class effects) ( see Section 1.2.2 and Figure 1 of this Annex ) toxicity in animal species precludes attaining systemic exposures relevant to the human exposures under conditions of use as support for a weight of evidence assessment when there are equivocal findings in anim al studies as partial support for clinical trials including up to 150 WOCBP for up to 3 months duration (see Section 4.2.3 of Guidance ) pharmaceuticals being developed for certain severely debilitating or life -threatening diseases or late- life onset diseas es (see Sections 1.2.3, 1.2.4 and Figure 2 of this Annex ). When alternative assays are used to support risk assessment, incorporation of these assays into an integrated testing strategy should be justified. A ssay(s) used for risk assessment should be conducted in accordance with GLP and qualified for context of use ( i.e. applicability domain and regulatory conditions under which assay results are reliable ). Strategies incorporating alternative assays should also assess the effects of drug metabolites when warranted (ICH M3). This annex does not recommend specific assays ; instead, basic scientific principles are included to assist in assay qualification for regulatory use. Alternative assays used to explore mechanism of action, or otherwise not intended to substitute for in vivo -derived EFD endpoints, are not expected to be qualified in this rigorous manner. 1.1 Qualification of Alternative Assays for Prediction of MEFL Test methods must be appropriate in order for test results to be of value. Accordingly, the endpoints measured should be scientifically justified with respect to assay objectives and predictions. The relationships among the assay 's predictions , endpoint(s) assessed, and the applicability domain, should be supported empirically. To qualify1 an alternative assay or a combination of assays for use in risk assessment for regulatory purpose s, a comprehensive 1 Qualified alternative assays within the context of this guideline have not been subject to formal validation as those can only be applied under certain specific circumstances. ICH S5(R3) Guideline 39 description of the methodology and findings should be provided, including the following: A thorough description and justification of the predictive model, including which species (e.g., rat, rabbit and/or human) and endpoint(s) it is pr edicting. The currently available in vitro alternative assays used for evaluating potential hazards to development are designed to detect MEFL. An evaluation of the biological plausibility of the model including a description of the mechanisms of embryo -fetal development (e.g., cell migration, differentiation, vasculogenesis, neurulation, gastrulation) and subsequent developmental adverse effects studied with the model. In addition, any limitations of each of the individual assays should be discussed. The description should include a discussion and supporting data to show that the duration and timing of exposure supports the predict ion of MEFL in vivo . An assessment of the accuracy and ability for the alternative assay to detect MEFL. The performance of the assay is compared to the dat a generated from in vivo studies with compounds that induce MEFL in the absence of confounding maternal toxicity. If the compound is not a marketed pharmaceutical, then in vivo data should be provided. A discussion determining whether an effect is negative or positive in the assay. Definition and justification of the threshold for molecular and metabolic markers predicting MEFL. The details of the algorithm employed for determining positive and negative outcomes in vivo . The predictive model should correlate concentrations tested in the alternative assay(s) to the in vivo exposure, preferably in pregnant animals, that results in an adverse outcome in the species being predicted. The list of compounds in each of the trai ning sets (data used to discover potentially predictive relationships) and test sets (data used to assess the strength and utility of a predictive relationship) for qualification of the assay and the basis for selection of these compounds. Data sources (e .g., literature, study reports, regulatory reviews) for all in vivo exposure and MEFL data used for compounds in the qualification data set, if not obtained from the Reference Compound List (Section 1.3 of Annex 2). Data demonstrating the test method's p erformance covering an appropriate range of biological and chemical domains that are justified for the intended use of the alternative assay (context of use). Data demonstrating the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and r eproducibility of an assay or battery of assays to predict in vivo developmental outcomes. The performance of the training and test sets can be evaluated separately and/or together , provided the selected approach is justified. In cases when more than one assay is conducted, a separate description of the performance of each assay, in addition to the integrated assessment used for the predictive model. A clear description of how the results of individual assays are integrated into the final prediction. Historical data for assay development and use (e.g., viability, numbers and types of ICH S5(R3) Guideline 40 malformations), including positive controls. The sponsor should state to which health auth orities (if any) the assay qualification has been previously been submitted . Note that acceptance of an assay by one regulatory authority does not bind other health authorities to accept the assay. Last, evaluation of human teratogens not detected in vivo by rat and/or rabbit is encouraged since some alternative assay(s) might predict MEFL that are not detectable by in vivo studies. 1.2 Examples of EFD Testing Strategies Utilizing Alternative Assays This section provides illustrative examples of integrated testing strategies into which alternative assays are incorporated to test for adverse effects on EFD. 1.2.1 Potential Approach to Defer In Vivo Testing as Part of an Integrated Testing Strategy See Section 4.2.3 of the G uidance . 1.2.2 Pharmaceuticals Expected to Be Embryo -fetal Toxicants For pharmaceuticals that are expected to adversely affect embryo -fetal development based on mechanism of action, pharmacologic class or target biology, it can be appropriate to confirm this activity in a qualified alternative assay(s) ( see Figure 1 of this Annex ). When a qualified alternative assay clearly predicts MEFL at clinically relevant extrapolated exposures, this can be sufficient to identify the compound as an EFD risk, and further testing would generally not be warranted. If the alternative assay does not predict MEFL, this should be confirmed in definitive in vivo EFD studies in two species. Conducting the studies in series, as shown in Annex 2 Figure 1, can allow for reduction in animal use, as the second in vivo assay would not be warranted if the first one is positive. Under this scenario, since the pharmaceutical is expected to adversely affect embryo -fetal development, there is no merit in using in vivo EFD studies to attempt to negate a positive alternative assay response. ICH S5(R3) Guideline 41 Figure 1 : Use of Alternative Assays for Pharmaceuticals Expected to be EFD Toxicants 1) No additional assessment is warranted if unequivocal MEFL signal is observed at clinically relevant extrapolated exposures. 2) Alternatively, pEFD studies can be used; however, negative results should be confirmed by a definitive study in the relevant species 3) Conducting in vivo EFD studies in series, as shown, can permit reduction in animal use, as 2nd in vivo assay is not warranted if the first study is positive. 1.2.3 Pharmaceutical s Intended to Treat Severely Debilitating or Life -Threatening Diseases Considering the risk/benefit for pharmaceuticals intended to treat severely debilitating or life - threatening conditions (compared to less severe chronic diseases ) where the likelihood of pregnancy is low, the use of qualified alternative assay(s) can be considered an appropriate component of the EFD risk assessment (see Annex 2 Fig ure 2). ICH S5(R3) Guideline 42 When a qualified alternative assay clearly predicts MEFL in the first species (e.g., rat) at clinically relevant extrapolated exposures, this can be considered, on a case -by-case basis, to sufficiently characterize the EFD risk. However, if the results are equivocal or thought to represent a false positive, definitive in vivo studies in one or two species should be conducted to assist human risk assessment. If no EFD signal is observed in the two definitive in vivo studies at appropriate exposure margins the results of the alternative assay could be considered of minimal concern for human risk. However, for alternative assays that have been qualified to predict human MEFL (i.e., not predicting only animal MEFL), additional data (e.g., mechanistic or genetic) should be provided to support a conclusion that the alternative assay results represent a false positive finding. If one or both of the in vivo studies are positive for EFD toxicity, the compound is considered to be positive for EFD risk. Conducting the studies in series, as shown in Annex 2 Fig ure 2, can allow for reduction in animal use, as the second in vivo assay would not be warranted if the first one is positive. If the alternative assay for the first species predicts a negative outcome (i.e., no MEFL), a definitive in vivo EFD study in the second species should be conducted to confirm the assessment. If positive, the compound is considered positive for EFD risk. If negative, the compound is considered negative for EFD risk, and no further testing is generally warranted, unless it is judged that additional studies would significantly alter the risk assessment. 1.2.4 Pharmaceuticals Intended to Treat Late -life Onset Diseases Some diseases are typically only diagnosed at a later age, but may nonetheless be diagnosed in reproductively capable women at a low incidence (e.g., bullous pemphigoid, which is typically diagnosed after age 60). Given the generally low rate of fertility in the female population with such late -life onset diseases, there is a dimin ished likelihood that a pharmaceutical used exclusively in this population will lead to an increase in the incidence of birth defects. Whether an EFD assessment is warr anted under this scenario should be determined on a case -by-case basis . This scenario is not intended for situations where the treatment population is presumptively infertile (e.g., post -menopausal osteoporosis) , for which no EFD assessment would typically be warr anted. The testing strategy under this scenario is similar to that depicted for severely debilitating or life-threatening diseases, with the exception that the first in vivo assessment in the second species can be conducted as a pEFD study . ICH S5(R3) Guideline 43 Figure 2: Use of Alternative Assays for Severely Debilitating or Life- threatening or Late Life Onset Diseases 1) A clearly positive MEFL signal at clinically relevant extrapolated exposures can be sufficient to consider a pharmaceutical positive for EFD toxicity, without further assessment, on a case- by-case basis. 2) While pEFD studies can be used, negative result s from definitive in vivo EFD studies in two species are warranted to establish that alternative assay results represent a false positive. 3) For late -life onset diseases, given low likelihood of pregnancy in this patient population a pEFD study in the 2nd species can generally be sufficient. 4) Conducting in vivo EFD studies in series, as shown, can permit reduction in animal use, as 2nd in vivo assay is not to be conducted if the first is positive. 5) Same species as the alternative assay is intended t o predict. 1.3 Reference Compound List The Reference Compound List contains 29 compounds that have been shown to induce MEFL in nonclinical studies (in the absence of overt maternal toxicity) and/or humans (Table 1 of this Annex). ICH S5(R3) Guideline 44 Only findings of MEFL were recognized for NOAEL and LOAEL determinations. Doses associated with the induction of reversible or minor manifestations of developmental toxicity (e.g., changes in fetal weight, growth suppression, and skeletal variations) were not used for this assessment. (see S ection 9, of the Guidance ). The general robustness of the studies (e.g., compliance with GLP regulations, the number of animals in the study, number of dose levels) was considered when determining which NOAEL and LOAEL values to use. When multiple sources were available, the data from a study designed in a manner consistent with the design recommended in the ICH S5(R2) guideline was accepted as the definitive data. When there were multiple robust sources of data that did not closely align, the highest NOAEL (to avoid bias towards claiming a low margin) and lowest LOAEL (as is routinely done in regulatory assessments) were generally used, even if the data were from different studies. The compounds in this list as well as others can be used to support qualification of an alternative assay or battery of assays. Compounds not causing MEFL (negative compounds) should also be used to assess assay specificity. Such compounds would lack MEFL regardless of additional effects on embryo/fetus such as fetal body weight changes, structural variations or delayed/reduced ossification. These compounds can be negative at all in vivo doses tested, or can be positive (MEFL observed) at higher doses/exposures provided the alternative assay wi thin its context of use predicts the transition from negative to positive. That is, the alternative assay should predict a negative result at some extrapolated level under the conditions for which the in vivo study yielded a negative result (no MEFL). In the Reference Compound List, t hree compounds are provided as an example for negative controls (Cetirizine , Saxagliptin , Vildagliptin ). These compounds did not induce MEFL in rat and rabbit at an exposure multiple (AUC and Cmax) of >25 fold at the MRHD.

The C max after a single dose likely represents the C max at steady state since the half life is short (approximately 0.5 hours) and no accumulation is expected using the equation: accumulation = 1/(1 - e-ktau), where k = 0.693/t\u00bd with t\u00bd = 0.5 hours and tau = 4 hours. For AUC (0-24h), the single dose AUC at 1000 mg was extrapolated to 650 mg and multiplied by 6 (the maximum recommended doses in 24 hours). Data are also available following administration of 500 mg (Nagelschmitz). i: Extrapolated to 6 daily doses every 4 hours from reported values after a single 1000 mg dose (Schurer): C max = 53.5 \u00b5g/mL, AUC = 371.32 \u00b5gh/mL. For C max, an accumulation factor of 1.3 was applied that was estimated from the equation: accumulation = 1/(1 - e-ktau), where k = 0.693/t\u00bd with t\u00bd = 2.0 hours and tau = 4 hours (i.e., 1/(1 - e-1.386) = 1/(1 - 0.25) = 1/0.75 = 1.3). For AUC (0-24h), the single dose AUC at 1000 mg was extrapolated to 650 mg and multiplied by 6 (the maximum recommended doses in 24 hours). Data are also available following administration of 500 mg (Nagelschmitz). j: In the absence of PK dat a, C max ratio was based on mg/kg dose ratio and AUC was based on mg/m2 dose ratio.

Thus, 30 mg/kg is accepted as the LOAEL, but the findings are listed from publications with rabbits with SC doses of 650 and 750 mg/kg. b: Actual values after 100 and 137 mg/kg hydroxyurea IP doses in pregnant Wistar rats (Wilson): C max = 47.3 at 100 mg/kg and 80.6 \u00b5g/mL at 137 mg/kg. c: Extrapolated from reported value after 1000 mg (16.7 mg/kg) hydroxyurea oral single dose (MHRA): C max = 24.6 \u00b5g/mL, AUC (0-inf) = 87.79 \u00b5g\u00b7h/mL. The dose for margin calculations was chosen to be 35 mg/kg/day. Although higher intermittent doses are used for oncology indications, the dose for sickle cell anemia is believed to be more relevant for assessing risk of developmental toxicity. As summarized in the table below, other human PK data are also available. d: Although rat C max data are available, this was after IP administration whereas the human data is after oral administration. Thus, in the absence of more direct PK comparisons, the estimated ratio based on mg/kg dose is also provided. e: In the absence of rat AUC data, AUC ratio was based on mg/m2 dose ratio. f: In the absence of r abbit PK data, C max ratio was based on mg/kg dose ratio and AUC was based on mg/m2 dose ratio.

Note that different data (5- to 7- fold lower values) are available from the same laboratory at 25 mg/kg where the only difference appears to be that ibuprofen was administered in hard gelatin capsules versus a suspension (Newa): C max = 5.32 \u00b5g/mL, AUC = 12.41 \u00b5g\u00b7h/mL. b: To enhance detection of VS D and midline defects (seen in humans and with other NSAIDS), exposure was limited to the sensitive period of cardiovascular development and midline closure (i.e., GD9- 10 in rats and GD9- 11 in rabbits). By limiting the exposure period, maternal GI toxicity was reduced, allowing for the administration of higher doses. c: Two values are included for the rabbit NOAEL since neither study design was ideal for assessing the risk of developmental toxicity according to current conventions. The study by Ad ams dosed rabbits on GD1- 29 instead of the conventional GD7- 19, whereas the study by Cappon dosed rabbits only on GD9 -11 to enhance detection of VSD and midline defects. d: Extrapolated from reported value after 56 mg/kg ibuprofen single oral dose in male New Zealand White rabbits (Kondal): C max = 24.85 \u00b5g/mL, AUC (0-inf) = after 14.8 mg/kg (mean) ibuprofen single oral dose (Konstan): (233 C max was multiplied by 0.9 (13.3/14.8) to give the extrapolated C max. The C max after a single dose likely represents the C max at steady state since the half life is short (approximately 1.8 to 2 hours [US label]) and little accumulation is expected us ing the equation: accumulation = 1/(1 - e-ktau), where k = 0.693/t\u00bd with t\u00bd = 2 hours and tau = 6 hours (yielding an accumulation fatcor of 1.1). The AUC was multiplied by 4 to get the daily AUC for QID dosing (at 59.2 mg/kg/day), and then by 0.9 to give the extrapolated AUC for 53 mg/kg/day.

It is also deribosylated to triazole carboxamide (Lin).

Many of these older studies do not meet today's standards for design. A lthough malformations cannot be reproducibly induced, embryolethality appears to be a common effect at doses 100 mg/kg (Newman). b: Based on literature reviews by Newman and Schardein, a dose of 50 mg/kg was chosen as the LOAEL. Based on review by Janer, 10 mg/kg appeared to be the highest dose with no evidence of developmental toxicity. c: Extrapolated or actual value after 50 mg/kg thalidomide oral dose for 8 days in female Fischer rats ( FDA, United States p. 86): C max = 4.87 \u00b5g/mL, AUC (0-24h) = 53. 75 \u00b5gh/mL.
