As new graduates, you will make decisions and take actions of an increasingly sophisticated nature. Y ou will encoun - ter problems you have never seen or heard about during your classroom and clinical experiences. Y ou are going to have to make complex decisions with little or no guidance and limited resources. We want you to be exposed to as much as possible during your student days, but more impor - tantly, we want you to learn to think . Y ou cannot memorize your way out of any situation, but you can think your way out of any situation. We know that students often learn more and faster when they have the freedom to make mistakes. This book is designed to allow you to experiment with finding answers without the pressure of someone's life hanging in the balance. We want you to do well. We want you to be the best. It is our wish for you to grow into confident, competent profes - sionals. After all, someday we will be one of those people you care for, and when that day comes, we want you to be very, very good at what you do! What Is Critical Thinking? Critical thinking is not memorizing lists of facts or the steps of procedures. Instead, critical think - ing is an analytical process that can help you think through a problem in an organized and efficient manner. Five steps are involved in critical thinking. Thinking about these steps may help you when you work through the questions in your cases. Here are the five steps with an explanation of what they mean. 1. Recognize and define the problem by asking the right questions: Exactly what is it you need to know? What is the question asking? 2. Select the information or data necessary to solve the problem or answer the question: First you have to ask whether all the necessary information is there. If not, how and where can you get the additional information? What other resources are available? This is one of the most difficult steps. In real clinical experiences, you rarely have all of the information, so you have to learn where you can get necessary data. For instance, patient and family interviews, nursing charting, the patient medical chart, laboratory data on your computer, your observations, and your own physical assessment can help you identify important clues. Of course, information can rapidly become outdated. To make sure you are accessing the most current and accurate information, you will occasionally need to use the Internet to answer a question. 3. Recognize stated and unstated assumptions; that is, what do you think is or is not true? Sometimes answers or solutions seem obvious; just because something seems obvious doesn't mean it is correct. Y ou may need to consider several possible answers or solutions. Consider all clues carefully and do not dismiss a possibility too quickly . Remember, \" You never find an answer you don't think of .\"viii INTRODUCTION Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc. Copyright \u00a9 2009, 2005, 2001, 1996, by Mosby, Inc. an affiliate of Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 4. Formulate and select relevant and/or potential decisions. Try to think of as many possibilities as you can. Consider the pros and cons of the consequences of making each decision. What is the best answer/solution? What could go wrong? This requires considering many different angles. In today's health care settings, decision-making often requires balancing the well- being needs of the patient, the preferences and concerns of the patient and caregiver, and financial limitations imposed by the reimbursement system. In making decisions, you need to take into account all relevant factors. Remember, you may need to explain why you rejected other options. 5. Draw a valid, informed conclusion: Consider all data; then determine what is relevant and what makes the most sense. Only then should you draw your conclusion. It may look as if this kind of thinking comes naturally to instructors and experienced nurses. Y ou can be certain that even experienced professionals were once where you are now. The rapid and sound decision-making that is essential to good nursing requires years of practice. The practice of good clinical thinking leads to good thinking in clinical practice. This book will help you practice the important steps in making sound clinical judgments until the process starts to come naturally. The practice of good clinical thinking leads to good thinking in clinical practice. The \"How to\" of Case Studies When you begin each case, read through the whole story once, from start to finish, getting a general idea of what it is about. Write down things you have to look up. This will help you move through the case smoothly and get more out of it. How much you have to look up will depend on where you are in your program, what you know, and how much experience you already have. Preparing cases will become easier as you advance in your program.ix Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.

He has long-standing coronary artery disease (CAD) with occasional episodes of heart failure (HF). One year ago, he had an anterior wall myocardial infarction (MI). In addition, he has chronic anemia, hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and a recently diagnosed 4-cm suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Because of his severe CAD, he had to retire from his job as a railroad engineer about 6 months ago. This morning, he is being admitted to your telemetry unit for a same-day cardiac catheterization. As you take his health history, you note that his wife died a year ago (about the same time that he had his MI) and that he does not have any children. He is a current cigarette smoker with a 50-pack-year smoking history. His vital signs (VS) are 158/94, 88, 20, and 97.2\u00b0 F (36.2\u00b0 C). As you talk with him, you realize that he has only minimal understanding of the catheterization procedure. 1. Before he leaves for the catheterization laboratory, you briefly teach him the important things he needs to know before having the procedure. List five priority topics you will address. 2. Look at his past history. What other factors are present that could contribute to his risk for cardiac ischemia? CAsE sTudY PR oGRE ss Several hours later, K.Z. returns from his catheterization. The catheterization report shows 90% occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, 90% occlusion of the distal LAD, 70% to 80% occlusion of the distal right coronary artery (RCA), an old apical infarct, and an ejection fraction (EF) of 37%. About an hour after the procedure was finished, you perform a brief physical assessment and note a grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur at the cardiac apex, crackles bilaterally in the lung bases, and trace pitting edema of his feet and ankles. Except for the soft systolic murmur, these findings were not present before the catheterization.Case Study 13 Name Class/Group Date Group Members INSTRUCTIONS All questions apply to this case study.

She told the ED triage nurse that he had had dysentery for the past 3 days, and, last night, he had a lot of \"dark red\" diarrhea. When he became very dizzy, disoriented, and weak this morning, she decided to bring him to the hospital. C.W.'s vital signs (VS) were 70/- (systolic blood pressure [BP] 70 mm Hg, diastolic BP inaudible), 110, 20, 99.1\u00b0 F (37.3\u00b0 C). A 16-gauge IV catheter was inserted, and a lactated Ringer's (LR) infusion was started. The triage nurse obtained the following history from the patient and his wife. C.W. has had idiopathic dilated car - diomyopathy for several years. The onset was insidious, but the cardiomyopathy is now severe, as evidenced by an ejection fraction (EF) of 13% found during a recent cardiac catheterization. He experiences frequent problems with heart failure (HF) because of the cardiomyopathy. Two years ago, he had a cardiac arrest that was attributed to hypokalemia. He also has a long history of hypertension (HTN) and arthritis. He has also had atrial fibrillation in the past but it has been under control recently. Fifteen years ago he had a peptic ulcer. An endoscopy showed a 25 \u00d7 15 mm duodenal ulcer with adheren t clot. The ulcer was cauterized, and C.W. was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for treatment of his volume deficit. You are his admitting nurse. As you are making him comfortable, Mrs. W. gives you a paper sack filled with the bottles of medications he has been taking: enalapril (Vasotec) 5 mg PO bid, and diclof enac sodium (Voltaren) 50 mg PO tid. As you connect him to the cardiac monitor, you note that he is in sinus tachycardia. Doing a quick assess - ment, you find a pale man who is sleepy but arousable and oriented. He is still dizzy, hypotensive, and tachy-cardic. You hear S3 and S4 heart sounds and a grade II/VI systolic murmur. Peripheral pulses are all 2+, and trace pedal edema is present. Lungs are clear. Bowel sounds are present, midepigastric tenderness is noted, and the liver margin is 4 cm below the costal mar gin. A Swan-Ganz catheter and an arterial line are inserted. 1.

XX scenario You are in the middle of your shift in the coronary care unit (CCU) of a large urban medical center. Your new admission, C.B., a 47-year-old woman, was just flown to your institution from a small rural community more than 100 miles away. She had an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction (MI) last evening. Her current vital signs (VS) are 100/60, 86, 14. After you make C.B. comfortable, you receive this report from the flight nurse: \"C.B. is a full-time homemaker with four children. She has had episodes of 'chest tightness' with exertion for the past year, but this is her first known MI. She has a history of hyperlipidemia and has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for more than 30 years. Surgical history consists of total abdominal hysterectomy 10 years ago after the birth of her last child. She has no other known medical problems. Yesterday at 8 pm, she began to have severe substernal chest pain that referred into her neck and down both arms. She rated the pain as 9 or 10 on a 0-to-10 scale. She thought it was severe indigestion and began taking Maalox with no relief. Her husband then took her to the local emergency department (ED), where a 12-lead ECG showed hyperacute ST elevation in the inferior leads II, III, and aVF and V5 to V6. Before tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) could be given, she went into ventricular fibrillation (V-fib) and was successfully defibrillated after two shocks. She then was given TPA and started on nitroglyc erin (NTG), heparin, and lidocaine drips. She also was given IV metoprolol and aspirin 325 mg to chew and swallow. This morning, her systolic pressure dropped into the 80s, and she was placed on a dopamine drip and urgently flown to your institution for coronary angiography and possible percutaneous coronar y angioplasty mg/min, at 1200 units/hr , and dopamine at 5 mcg/kg/min. The NTG has been stopped because of low blood pressure. Lab work that was done yesterday showed Na 145 mEq/L, K 3.6 mEq/L, HC \" 1. Because the 12-lead ECG can tell you the location of the infarction, evaluate the leads that showed ST elevation. What areas of C.B.'s heart have been damaged? 2. Given the diagnosis of acute MI, what other lab results are you going to look at? Case Study 17 Name Class/Group Date Group Members INSTRUCTIONS All questions apply to this case study.

When you question C.E. about the use of Vicks, he tells you that he started to apply it in and around his nose to prevent his nose from becoming dry and sore. How would you counsel C.E. and his wife regarding safety issues with oxygen use? CASE STUDY PROGRESS At your next visit 3 weeks later, C.E. tells you that the previous evening he walked to the kitchen for a snack and became increasingly short of breath. As per your instructions, C.E. removed the nasal cannula, tested the flow against his check, and felt no O 2 flowing from the catheter. He lacked the force and volume required to yell for help and was too short of breath to return to the living room to check his O2 tank. He bent forward with his elbows on the countertop and struggled to breathe. He became more frightened with each passing second, and his breathing became increasingly more difficult. A minute later, C.E.'s wife found him and reconnected his O 2 tubing. C.E. sat at the table for 20 minutes before he could walk back to the living room. 11. Why did C.E. assume the peculiar position at the countertop? 12. A week later you receive a call from C.E.'s wife.

Because M.C. had not answered her phone since noon yesterday, her daughter went to her home to check on her. She found M.C. lying on the kitchen floor, incontinent of urine and stool, with complaints of pain in her right hip. Her daughter reports a past medical history of hypertension, angina, and osteoporo - sis. M.C. estrogen (Premarin) daily. The daughter reports that her mother is normally very alert and lives independently. On examination, you see an elderly woman, approximately 100 pounds, holding her right thigh. You note shortening of the right leg with external rotation and a large amount of swelling at the proximal thigh and right hip. M.C. is oriented to person only and is confused about place and time, but she is able to say that her \"leg hurts so bad. \" M.C.'s vital signs (VS) are 90/65, 120, 24, 97.5 \u00b0 F (36.4 \u00b0 C); her Sp o2 is 89%. She is profoundly dehydrated. Preliminary diagnosis is a fracture of the right hip. 1. Considering her medical history and that she has been without her medications for at least 24 hours, explain her current VS. 2. Based on her history and your initial assessment, what three priority interventions would you expect to be initiated? 3. M.C.'s daughter states, \"Mother is always so clear and alert. I have never seen her act so confused. What's wrong with her?\" What are three possible causes for M.C.'s disorientation that should be considered and evaluated?Case Study 39 Name Class/Group Date Group Members INSTRUCTIONS All questions apply to this case study.

The right foot and lower leg are cool and with - out pulses (absent by Doppler). Arteriogram demonstrates severe atherosclerosis of the right popliteal artery with complete obstruction of blood flow. Despite attempts at endarterectomy and administration of intravascular alteplase (tissue plasminogen activator [TPA]) over several days, the foot and lower leg become necrotic. Finally, the decision is made to perform an above-the-knee amputation (AKA) on E.B.'s right leg. E.B. is recently widowed and has a son and daughter who live nearby. In preparation for E.B.'s surgery, the surgeons wish to spare as much viable tissue as possible. Hence, an order is written for E.B. to undergo 5 days of hyperbaric therapy for 20 minutes bid. 1. What is the purpose of hyperbaric therapy? CASE STUDY PROGRESS As you prepare E.B. for surgery, he is quiet and withdrawn. He follows instructions quietly and slowly without asking questions. His son and daughter are at his bedside, and they also are very quiet. Finally, E.B. tells his family, \"I don't want to go like your mother did. She lingered on and had so much pain. I don't want them to bring me back. \" 2. Y ou look at his chart and find no advance directives. What is your responsibility? 3.

CASE STUDY PROGRESS E.B. returns from surgery with the right stump dressed with gauze and an elastic wrap. The dressing is dry and intact, without drainage. He is drowsy with the following vital signs (VS): 142/80, 96, 14, 97.9 \u00b0 F (36.6 \u00b0 C), Spo2 92%. He has a maintenance IV of D5NS infusing at 125 mL/hr in his right f orearm. 5. The surgeon has written to keep E.B.'s stump elevated on pillows for 48 hours; after that, have him lie in a prone position for 15 minutes, four times a day. In teaching E.B. about his care, how will you explain the rationale for these orders? 6. In reviewing E.B.'s medical history, what factors do you notice that might affect the condition of his stump and ultimate rehabilitation potential? CASE STUDY PROGRESS You have just returned from a 2-day workshop on guidelines for the care of surgical patients with type 1 DM. You notice that E.B.'s daily fasting blood glucose has been running between 130 and 180 mg/dL. The sliding-scale insulin intervention does not begin until blood glucose values equal to or greater than 200 mg/dL are repor ted. You recognize that patients with blood glucose values even slightly above nor - mal suffer from impaired wound healing. 7.

On arrival, you note that he is trembling and nearly doubled over with severe abdominal pain. T.B. indicates that he has severe pain in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) of his abdomen that radiates through to his mid-back as a deep, sharp, boring pain. He is more comfortable walking or sitting bent forward rather than lying flat in bed. He admits to having had several similar bouts of abdominal pain in the last month, but \"none as bad as this. \" He feels nauseated but has not vomited, although he did vomit a week ago with a similar episode. T.B. experienced an acute onset of pain after eating fish and chips at a fast-food restaurant earlier today. He is not happy to be in the hospital and is grumpy that his daughter insisted on taking him to the ED for evaluation. After orienting him to the room, you perform your physical assessment. The findings are as follows: He is awake, alert, and oriented \u00d7 3, and he moves all extremities well. He is restless, is constantly shifting his position, and complains of fatigue. Breath sounds are clear to auscultation. Heart sounds are clear and crisp, with no murmur or rub noted and with a regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen is flat, slightly rigid, and very tender to palpation throughout, especially in the RUQ; bowel sounds are present. He reports having light-colored stools for 1 week. The patient voids dark amber urine but denies dysuria. Skin and sclera are jaundiced. Admission vital signs are BP 164/100, pulse of 132 beats/min, respiration 26 F (37.8\u00b0 C), 96% on 2 L of oxygen by nasal cannula. 1. What structures are located in the RUQ of the abdomen? 2. Which of the previously mentioned organs are typically palpable in the RUQ? 3. As you palpate T.B.'s abdomen, you deeply palpate the costal margin in the RUQ, and ask him to take a deep breath. This causes T.B. to stop inspiration abruptly, midway, and exclaim, \"Oh, that hurts!\" What does this finding indicate?a. Rebound tendernessb. Hepatomegalyc. Splenomegalyd. Murphy's sign CASE STUDY PROGRESS T.B.'s abdominal ultrasound demonstrates several retained stones in the common bile duct and a stone- filled gallbladder. T.B. is admitted to your floor, NPO status, and is scheduled to undergo an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP) that after noon. During an ERCP , the patient is sedated, and an ERCP scope is inserted through the mouth, past the stomach, to the outlet of the common bile duct, 4 Gastrointestinal194PART 1 MEDICALSURGICAL CASES Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.

Typically, this muscle will be cut to widen the opening and outflow of the common bile duct, a procedure called a papillotomy. This allows the bile and stones to flow out into the small intes- tine. You review T.B.'s other laboratory results: 4. Which results are abnormal, and what do they reflect? CASE STUDY PROGRESS The patient undergoes the ERCP , and stones and bile are released, but imaging reveals that a stone is still retained within the cystic duct, and multiple stones remain within the gallbladder itself. A surgical consult is obtained, and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (\"lap choley\") is planned. 5. Identify at least four preoperative orders that will likely need to be completed before T.B. goes to surgery. 6. T.B. is medicated with morphine sulfate 2 mg IV push (IVP) q2h as needed. After the first dose, he reports that on a scale of 1 to 10, his pain has decreased from a 10 to a 4 within 30 minutes. What other methods could be used to help T.B.'s pain?

His Sp O2 on 2 L oxygen per nasal cannula is now 90%, so you immediately increase the flow rate to raise his O2 saturation. You inform the on-call surgeon, and she orders a STAT chest x-ray and a broad-spectrum antibiotic\u2014imipenem and cilastatin (Primaxin) 500 mg IV now, then q6h. 8. Before you give the antibiotic, what will you assess? 9. As you review the orders, you note that the Primaxin contains cilastatin. What is the purpose of the cilastatin?a. It enhances the action of the imipenem.b. It reduces the chance of an allergic reaction.c. It promotes the renal secretion of the imipenem.d. It causes the bacterial cell wall to become unstable. CASE STUDY PROGRESS T.B. undergoes a successful laparoscopic cholecystectom y the next morning. An intraoperative cholan- giogram shows that the ducts are finally cleared of stones at the conclusion of the surgery. When he returns to the nursing unit, his stomach is soft but quite distended. His wife asks you whether anything is wrong. 10. How will you respond to her question? 11. When you remove the tape the next day to change the dressing, you note that the skin is red and blistered underneath. Otherwise, he is doing well; his vital signs are 128/72, 80, 16, 99.8\u00b0 F (37.7\u00b0 C), and Spo 2 of 95% on room air. He even tolerated a light breakfast. To protect the blistered area from further damage, you appl y a hydrocolloid dressing to the damaged skin. What has T.B. experienced, and what are the benefits of this type of dressing?

All rights reserved.\u0003X Scenario M.R. is a 56-year-old general contractor who is admitted to your telemetry unit directly from his internist's office with a diagnosis of chest pain. On report, you are informed that he has an intermittent 2-month history of chest tightness with substernal burning that r adiates through to the mid-back intermittently, in a stabbing fashion. Symptoms occur after a large meal; with heavy lifting at the construction site; and in the middle of the night when he awakens from sleep with coughing, shortness of breath, and a foul, bitter taste in his mouth. Recently, he has developed nausea, without emesis, that is worse in the morn-ing or after skipping meals. He complains of \"heartburn\" three or four times a day. When this happens, he takes a couple of Rolaids or Tums. He keeps a bottle at home, at the office, and in his truck. Vital signs (VS) at his physician's office were 130/80 lying, 120/72 standing, 100, 20, 98.6\u00b0 F (37\u00b0 C), Sp O2 92% on room air. A 12-lead ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with a rare premature ventricular contraction (PVC). 1. What are some common causes of chest pain? 2. What mnemonic can you use to help you better evaluate his pain? 3. What other history is important? CASE STUDY PROGRESS M.R. indicates that usually the chest pain is relieved with his antacids, but this time they had no effect. A \"GI cocktail\" consisting of Mylanta and viscous lidocaine given at his physician's office briefly helped decrease symptoms. 4 Gastrointestinal198PART 1 MEDICALSURGICAL CASES Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.

CASE STUDY PROGRESS M.R. has smoked one pack of cigarettes a day for the past 35 years, drinks two or three beers on most nights, and has noticed a 20-pound weight gain over the past 10 years. He feels \"so tired and old now. \" M.R. has dark circles under his eyes and complains of constant daytime fatigue. His wife is even sleep-ing in another bedroom because he is snoring so loudly. He also reinjured his lower back a month ago at work, lifting a pile of boards, so his physician prescribed ibuprofen (Motrin) 800 mg bid or tid for 4 weeks. 5. Which factors in M.R.'s life are likely contributing to his chest pain and nausea? Explain how. CASE STUDY PROGRESS M.R. explains that 6 months ago his physician prescribed famotidine (Pepcid) 20 mg PO at bedtime for heartburn, and that it helped a little, but that it never really \"did the job. \" Now he keeps a bottle of Tums or Rolaids in his truck and at his bedside, in addition to the ranitidine, \"because I always seem to need them. \" 6. Why do you think the famotidine did not help M.R.? CASE STUDY PROGRESS M.R.'s 12-lead ECG was normal, and the first set of cardiac enzymes was normal. CBC 140 mEq/L, K 3.7 mEq/L, 20 sec, INR 1.0. The H. pylori antibody test came back as 20 units/mL.

Suddenly, M.R. begins to complain of nausea; as you hand him the emesis basin, he promptly vomits coffee-ground emesis with specks of bright red blood. VS remain stable. 7. What concerns do you have about the coffee-ground emesis? 8. What is the significance of the H. pylori antibody test result? CASE STUDY PROGRESS You ask the charge nurse to contact the gastrointestinal (GI) consulting doctor to explain the recent events while you stay with M.R. The gastroenterologist gives several orders and states he will be there in 45 minutes. The orders are as follows: 9. List the previous orders in order of priority. 10. Explain the rationale for each of the preceding orders.

All rights reserved.CASE STUDY PROGRESS The gastroenterologist finds erosive esophagitis LA Class B, a moderately sized hiatal hernia, diffuse ero- sive gastritis, and an ulcer in the antrum of the stomach that is oozing blood. The duodenal bulb yielded a normal endoscopic appearance. During the EGD, the bleeding was stopped with cautery. Biopsies were obtained of the gastric mucosa, and the biopsies are negative for H. pylori bacteria; his bleeding ulcer is attributed to the NSAIDs (i.e., ibuprofen). He is kept NPO until the next morning to allow good hemosta-sis of the cauterized site. Clear liquids are allowed at breakfast. His hematocrit (Hct) dropped to 32%, but he remained asymptomatic from the mild anemia; the drop was believed, in part, to reflect that he was dehydrated on admission, and the decrease reflected the dilution of the blood from the IV fluids added. Thus, he did not receive a transfusion of blood. M.R. tolerated the liquid diet without any nausea and vomiting and is discharged to home the next day with the following instructions: t\u0001 \"EWBODF\u0001EJFU\u0001TMPXMZ \u0001BT\u0001UPMFSBUFE \u0001UP\u0001NFDIBOJDBM\u0001TPGU\u000f t\u0001 5BLF\u0001QBOUPQSB[PMF\u0001\u0015\u0011\u0001NH\u000110\u0001R\u0001 AM on an the patient need to take the pantoprazole first thing in the morning? 12.

She gives you the following information: A.G. is an 87-year-old woman with a 3-day history of intermittent abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, and nausea and vomiting (N/V). A.G. moved from Italy to join her grandson and his family only 2 months ago, and she speaks very little English. All infor-mation was obtained through her grandson. Past medical history includes colectomy for colon cancer 6 years ago and ventral hernia repair 2 years ago. She has no history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, or pulmonary disease. She takes only ibuprofen (Motrin) occasionally for mild arthritis. Allergies include sulfa drugs and meperidine. A.G.'s tentative diagnosis is small bowel obstruction (SBO) second-ary to adhesions. A.G. is being admitted to your floor for diagnostic workup. Her vital signs (VS) are stable, she has an IV of D5\u00bdNS with 20 mEq KCl infusing at 100 mL/hr, and 3 L oxygen by nasal cannula (O 2/NC). 1. Based on the nurse's report, what signs of bowel obstruction does A.G. manifest? 2. Are there other signs and symptoms that you should observe for while A.G. is in your care? 3. While A.G. is on the way, you have secured the hospital's interpreter service on the telephone. A.G. arrives on your unit with her grandson. Y ou admit A.G. to her room and introduce yourself as her nurse. As her grandson introduces her, she pats your hand. Y ou know that you need to complete a physical examination and take a history. What will you do first? 4. Before you begin your examination, you ask the grandson to excuse himself, explaining the hospital's confidentiality policies. The grandson, an attorney, tells you that elderly Italian women are extremely modest and might not answer questions completely. How might you gather information, in this case? 4 Gastrointestinal202PART 1 MEDICALSURGICAL CASES Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.

What can you do to facilitate drainage? 13. The NGT suddenly drains 575 mL; then it slows down to about 250 mL over 2 hours. Is this an expected amount? 14. Y ou enter A.G.'s room to initiate your shift assessment. A.G. has been hospitalized for 3 days, and her abdomen seems to be more distended than yesterday. How would you determine whether A.G.'s abdominal distention has changed? CASE STUDY PROGRESS After 3 days of NGT suction, A.G.'s symptoms are unrelieved. She reports continued nausea, cramps, and sometimes strong abdominal pain; her hand grips are weaker; and she seems to be increasingly lethargic. You look up her latest laboratory values and compare them with the admission data. 4 Gastrointestinal204PART 1 MEDICALSURGICAL CASES Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.

The surgeon released an 18-inch section of proximal ileum that had been con-stricted by adhesions. Several areas looked ischemic, so these were excised, and an end-to-end anasto-mosis was done. A.G. tolerated the procedure well. Her recovery was slow but steady. A.G. went home in the care of her grandson and his wife on the seventh postop day. Discharge plans included a home health nurse, home health aide, in-home physical therapy, and dietitian consult.

All rights reserved.CASE STUDY PROGRESS C.W.'s condition deteriorates on the third day after admission; she experiences intractable abdominal pain and unrelenting nausea and vomiting. C.W. is taken to the operating room for probable SBO and is readmitted to your unit from the postanesthesia care unit. During surgery, 38 inches of her small bowel were found to be severely stenosed with two areas of visible perforation. Much of the remaining bowel is severely inflamed and friable. A total of 5 feet of distal ileum and 2 feet of colon have been removed, and a temporary ileostomy was established. She has a Jackson-Pratt (JP) drain to bulb suction in her right lower quadrant (RLQ), and her wound was packed and left open. She has two peripheral IVs, a Salem Sump nasogastric tube (NGT), and a Foley catheter. Her vital signs (VS) are 112/72, 86, 24, 100.8\u00b0 F (38.2\u00b0 C) (tym-panic). You attach her NGT to low-continuous wall suction per the postoperative orders. 3. Y ou begin a thorough postoperative assessment of C.W .'s abdomen. What does your assessment include? List these steps in the order in which the assessment should be completed. 4. A nursing student enters C.W .'s room and auscultates her abdomen. She looks at you and excitedly announces that she hears good bowel sounds. Y ou take the opportunity to teach her the proper method of auscultating bowel sounds on a patient who has NGT to continuous low wall suction. How would you correct her error? 5. Four hours later, you measure the drainage from the JP tube. Look at the following figure and state how much drainage you obtained. 2 tbsp\u20141 oz 1 tbsp\u201412 oz 12 tsp\u201416 oz30 mL 25 mL 20 mL 15 mL 10 mL 5 mL2 tsp 1tsp4 Gastrointestinal219CHAPTER 4 GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS CASE STUDY 48 Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.

During the routine dressing change, you note a small pool of yellow-green drain- age in the deepest part of the wound. You realize the physician will want a wound culture. 9. How will you culture C.W .'s wound? 10. What information do you need to send to the lab with the wound culture specimen? 11. Y ou obtain a wound culture, complete the dressing change, obtain a full set of VS, note a temperature of 100.4\u00b0 F (38\u00b0 C), and assess increased tenderness in C.W .'s abdomen. What orders do you anticipate receiving once you notify the physician of C.W .'s condition? 12. The physician calls back and asks you to describe C.W .'s wound. What key aspects of the wound should be included? 4 Gastrointestinal220PART 1 MEDICALSURGICAL CASES Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.

(Select all that apply.)a. The stoma will be in the shape of a donut.b. The stoma will be level with the skin.c. The stoma will be a uniform medium cherry red in color.d. The stoma will be light pink, and an occasional dark spot might appear.e. The skin around the stoma should be intact.f. The drainage will be thick and dark brown in color. 14. Will any aspect of C.W .'s history significantly affect the wound healing process? If so, how? 15. With a fairly significant wound infection developing, why is C.W .'s temperature relatively low? 16. The physician tells you that she will be over to examine C.W . As you tell C.W . that her doctor is coming to talk to her, C.W . says that she feels something wet running down her side. Y ou find some leakage of intestinal drainage onto the skin. What should you do? CASE STUDY OUTCOME You change the ileostomy appliance before the physician arrives. C.W. is evaluated, and it is determined that she needs to return to surgery for exploratory laparotomy.4 GastrointestinalCase Study 49 Name Class/Group Date Group Members INSTRUCTIONS All questions apply to this case study.

All rights reserved.\u0003X Scenario (Continuation of Case Study 48) C.W. is a 36-year-old woman admitted 7 days ago for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with small bowel obstruction (SBO). She underwent surgery 3 days after admission for a colectomy and ileostomy. She developed peritonitis and, 4 days later, returned to the operating room (OR) for an exploratory laparot-omy, which revealed another area of perforated bowel, generalized peritonitis, and a fistula tract to the abdominal surface. Another 12 inches of ileum were resected (total of 7 feet of ileum and 2 feet of colon). The peritoneal cavity was irrigated with normal saline (NS), and three drainage tubes were placed: a Jackson-Pratt (JP) drain to bulb suction, a rubber catheter to irrigate the wound bed with NS, and a sump drain to remove the irrigation. The initial JP drain remains in place. A right subclavian triple-lumen cath- eter was inserted. 1. C.W . returns from the post-anesthesia recovery unit (PACU) on your shift. What do you do when she is in the bed in her room? 2. Y ou pull the covers back to inspect the abdominal dressing and find that the original surgical dressing is saturated with fresh bloody drainage. What do you do? 3. C.W . has a total of four tubes in her abdomen, as well as a nasogastric tube (NGT). What information do you want to know about each tube? 4. The sump irrigation fluid bag is nearly empty. Y ou close the roller clamp, thread the IV tubing through the infusion pump, check the i rrigation catheter connection site to make certain it is snug, and then discover that the nearly empty liter bag infusing into C.W .'s abdomen is D5W , not NS. Does this require any action? If so, give rationale for actions, and explain the overall situation. 4 Gastrointestinal222PART 1 MEDICALSURGICAL CASES Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.

There is a small \"bleeder\" at the edge of the incision, so the surgeon calls for a suture and ties off the bleeder. You take the opportunity to ask her about a morphine patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump for C.W., and the surgeon says she will write the orders. 5. Postoperative pain will be a problem for C.W . after the anesthesia wears off. How do you plan to address this? 6. Pharmacy delivers C.W .'s first bag of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The physician has instructed you to start the TPN at a rate of 60 mL/hr and decrease the maintenance IV rate by the same amount. What is the purpose of this order? 7. The physician did not specifically order glucose monitoring, but you know that it should be initiated. Y ou plan to conduct a fingerstick blood test every 6 hours unless she is symptomatic, then more frequently. What is your rationale? 8. C.W .'s blood glucose increased temporarily, but, by the next day, it dropped to an average of 70 to 80 mg/dL and has remained there for 2 days. Her VS are stable, but her abdominal wound shows no signs of healing. She has lost 1 kg over the past 3 days. What do these data mean? 9. During the night shift, the TPN solution ba g becomes nearly empty, and the night nurse discovers that the next bag of TPN has not been prepared. The hospital pharmacy does not prepare TPN during the night shift. What does the nurse need to do next?a. Convert the line to a saline lock until the TPN solution is ready. b. Slow the TPN rate to 10 mL/hr until the next TPN bag can be prepared.c. Hang a bag of D5W when the TPN is finished.d. Hang a bag of D10W when the TPN is finished.4 Gastrointestinal223CHAPTER 4 GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS CASE STUDY 49 Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.

All rights reserved.CASE STUDY PROGRESS You discuss your concerns with C.W.'s physician, and she agrees to request a consult from a registered dietitian (RD). After gathering data and making several calculations, the RD makes recommendations to the attending physician. The TPN orders are adjusted, C.W. begins to gain weight slowly, and her wound shows signs of healing. Nutritional problems in clinical populations can be complex and often require special attention. 10. Y ou and a co-worker read the following in C.W .'s progress notes: \"Wound healing by secondary closure. Formation of granular tiss ue with epithelialization noted around edges. Have requested dietitian consult on ongoing basis. Will continue to follow. \" Y our co-worker turns to you and asks whether you know what that means. How would you explain? 11. Both of you start to discuss what specific digestive difficulties C.W . is likely to face in the future. What problems might C.W . be prone to develop after having so much of her bowel removed? 12. The RD consults with C.W . about dietary needs. Y ou attend the session so that you will be able to reinforce the information. What basic information is the RD likely to discuss with C.W .? 13. After 3 days of dressing changes, C.W .'s skin is irritated, and a small skin tear has appeared where tape was removed. How can you minimize this type of skin breakdown and help this area heal? 4 Gastrointestinal224PART 1 MEDICALSURGICAL CASES Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.

CASE STUDY PROGRESS C.W. successfully battled peritonitis. Gradually, tubes were removed as she grew stronger with TPN and time. C.W. learned how to change her ostomy appliance and was discharged to home.4 GastrointestinalCase Study 50 Name Class/Group Date Group Members INSTRUCTIONS All questions apply to this case study.

Dr. N., the gastrointestinal specialist is on his way in to see the patient. D.S. is a 78-year-old obese man with complaints of sudden onset of severe abdominal cramping, distention, and nausea and vomiting; he denies passing of flatus or stool within the past 12 hours. Past medical history includes heart failure, hypertension, colon cancer, and ulcerative colitis. He underwent a total colectomy 16 years ago and had an enterocutaneous fistula 12 years ago. Lab samples have been drawn, and the results will be sent to your floor. We started an IV and placed a Salem Sump nasogastric tube (NGT). His vital signs are 143/76, 82, respirations 26 and slightly labored, and 101.1\u00b0 F (38.4\u00b0 C). He is on his way up. \" 1. Given that D.S. had had a total colectomy, would he have a colostomy or an ileostomy? Explain your answer. 2. What would you expect to see if D.S.'s ostomy had normal function? CASE STUDY PROGRESS After D.S. is settled into his room, the NGT and IV are functioning well, and he receives pain medication, you begin your admission assessment. His abdomen is extremely large, firm to touch, with multiple scars and an ileostomy pouching system in his RLQ. 3. What are the more common complications of an ileostomy? 4 Gastrointestinal226PART 1 MEDICALSURGICAL CASES Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.

D.S.'s past medical history of fistula, combined with the probability of blockage or obstruction, places him at an increased risk for which problems? 5. As you assess the stoma, you look for signs that it is healthy. Which of these assessment findings are the characteristics of a healthy stoma? (Select all that apply.)a. The stoma is cherry-red, dark pink in color.b. The stoma is pale pink in color.c. The stoma is moist.d. The stoma is dry.e. The stoma is flat against the skin. 6. What stoma changes would you report immediately to the physician? 7. Why are transparent ostomy pouches recommended postoperatively or when patients are hospitalized? 8. Will the stoma present visual clues of D.S.'s bowel blockage or obstruction? CASE STUDY PROGRESS D.S. continues to complain of abdominal pain and cramping and becomes increasingly restless. You notice that the abdomen behind and around his stoma and pouch appears larger when compared with the other side of his abdomen. 9. How would you assess for a possible peristomal hernia? 10. Why is a peristomal hernia a problem?4 Gastrointestinal227CHAPTER 4 GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS CASE STUDY 50 Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.

You check to see that the pouch is properly attached to the wafer and discover that stool is indeed leaking from under the barrier. D.S. apologizes for not bringing any supplies with him, stating, \"My ostomy nurse told me to always carry extra supplies for times like this. \" D.S. does not remember what size he needs, but you note he is wearing a 2-piece system with a plas- tic ring-flange that attaches to the pouch with a matching ring. 11. How will you determine the correct pouching size and system? CASE STUDY PROGRESS You have finished with your general head-to-toe assessment and order the appropriate pouching prod- ucts for D.S. You have already taken clean towels, washcloths, and underpads into his room, along with a hamper to receive dirty, used laundry. You gather scissors, skin-prep, and adhesive remover to assist with the pouching change. 12. As you return to his room, you review the steps for changing an ostomy pouch. What are the steps you will need to follow? CASE STUDY PROGRESS You have gathered all needed supplies, and D.S. is as comfortable as possible. You begin the pouching change. Using the adhesive remover, with the push-pull method, you gently remove the wafer. As you lift the wafer, you note that the peristomal skin has severe erythema directly encircling the stoma. There is denudation (partial-thickness breakdown) at the medial stoma-skin edge. 13. How should the skin around the stoma look? 4 Gastrointestinal228PART 1 MEDICALSURGICAL CASES Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.

Identify two. 15. After you discover the reddened skin, how will you proceed with the ostomy care? CASE STUDY PROGRESS The next day, D.S.'s vital signs return to normal, and his abdomen is less distended. The ileostomy is steadily draining greenish-brown liquid stool. The NGT is removed, and D.S. is started on sips of clear liq-uids. When you go to check his ileostomy pouch, D.S. tells you, \"I know I've had this a long time, but I still can't stand to look at this thing. My wife usually helps me with it, and I hate that. \" 16.

The pain started 24 hours ago and awoke her in the middle of the night. B.K. is a divorced, retired sales manager who smokes a half-pack of cigarettes daily. The ED nurse reports that B.K. is anxious and demanding. B.K. denies using alcohol. Her vital signs (VS) are as follows: 100/70, 97, 30, 100.2\u00b0 F (37.9\u00b0 C) (tympanic), Sp O2 88% on room air and 92% on 2 L of oxygen by nasal cannula (NC). She is in normal sinus rhythm.

CASE STUDY PROGRESS The physician orders a STAT CXR which shows a significant pleural effusion developing in the LLL, with extension into the RLL. 13. Based on the evolving pleural effusion with evidence of decompensation (hypoxia) by the patient, what treatment would the physician likely pursue, and what preparations would you be responsible for? CASE STUDY PROGRESS The physician removed 200 mL of slightly cloudy serous fluid. Antibiotics were adjusted to provide broad- spectrum coverage for an upper respiratory tract infection until culture and sensitivity results return. B.K. is resting quietly with oxygen at 3 L per nasal cannula, and her respirations are unlabored and regular. Her Sp O2 reads 96%. It is now 72 hours after B.K.'s admission, and her labs show improvement. An abdominal CT scan is completed and shows \"a moderately severe pancreatitis, but no local fluid collection or pseudocysts. No ileus or evidence of neoplasia was noted. \" BUN is 9.0 mg/dL, and creatinine is 1.0 mg/dL. She has ade-quate urinary output. Her IV fluids are decreased to 75 mL/hr. Her amylase and lipase levels are decreasing toward normal levels. The physician writes an order to advance B.K.'s diet to full liquids. 14. How would you know whether B.K. was no t able to tolerate the advancement in diet? 15. If B.K. does not tolerate the advancement in diet, what physiologic need should be addressed at 72 hours?4 Gastrointestinal233CHAPTER 4 GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS CASE STUDY 51 Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.

Her pulse and blood pressure (BP) are elevated, although her pain has not increased, and the pain medication schedule has not changed. B.K. has had no visitors since being admitted. 16. What is B.K. most likely experiencing, and what actions will you take? CASE STUDY OUTCOME You contact the physician with your observations, and he orders scheduled chlordiazepoxide (Librium) and a social services consult to evaluate and treat for possible alcohol abuse. Three days later, B.K. is lucid, tolerating clear liquids, and her pain is controlled with oral pain medications. As she becomes oriented and calmer, B.K. eventually admits to drinking \"3 or 4 scotch-on-the-rocks\" daily. You also discover that B.K. is estranged from her family because of her drinking. The physician advances her diet to \"low-fat/low-cholesterol\" and writes orders to discharge that evening if she tolerates the advancement in diet, which she does. 17.

She retur ns to the urology clinic in 6 months for a follow-up visit. She has lost 24 pounds and is seen with a smaller stoma surrounded by a half-inch ring of wartlike skin. The nurse explains to A.T. that her stoma has shrunk, and the bag no longer fits properly; alkaline urine washing over unprotected skin from too large an appliance opening causes a skin reaction that can either appear smooth or wartlike. The wartlike skin buildup is referred hyperplastic, epitheliomatous hyperplasia, metaplasia, or done once a hyperkeratotic lesion forms around a stoma?

Since that time, she has experienced three tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures. She was diagnosed as having a basal ganglion hematoma with infarct and was started on phenytoin (Dilantin). Post-delivery, J.G. demonstrated dyskinesia, resulting in frequent falls during ambulation. Once the seizure disorder appeared to be under control, she was transferred to a rehabilitation facility for evaluation and 2 weeks of intensive physical therapy (PT). She is now home; she still has occasional falls but has had no seizures. She is receiving PT three times a week in her home.

The rash became generalized, spreading to her head, abdomen, and arms and was accom- panied by polyarticular joint pain and back pain. She experienced three episodes of epistaxis in 1 day about 2 weeks ago. Over the past week, her gums have become swollen and tender. Because of the pro- gression of symptoms and increasing fatigue, she sought medical attention. Lab work was performed, and C.O. was directly admitted to the referred hematology/oncology unit of a teaching hospital under the care of a hematologist for diagnostic evaluation. Her chest x-ray (CXR) showed normal lung expansion, heart size normal, and no lymphadenopathy. Skin biopsy showed cutaneous leukemic infiltrates, and a bone marrow biopsy showed moderately hypercellular marrow and collections of monoblasts. Her lum- bar puncture was free of blast cells. The final diagnosis was acute myeloblastic leukemia. C.O. is to begin remission induction therapy with cytarabine (Ara-C) 100 mg/m 2 /day as continuous infusion for 7 days and idarubicin (Idamycin) 12 mg/m 2 /day IV push for 3 days. She is scheduled in angiog- raphy for placement of a triple-lumen subclavian Hickman catheter before beginning her therapy. 1. Interpret C.O.'s CBC results.

You know that the mother will still be at the local medical center recov-ering from her cesarean delivery. 1. What is the rationale for doing a cesarean delivery for babies with myelomeningocele? CASE STUDY PROGRESS The infant arrives accompanied by her aunt and fa ther. While you are getting vital signs (VS), the father tells you that he has been trying to research myelomeningocele on the Internet, but he is still confused, especially about the difference between myelomeningocele and meningocele. 2. Using lay terms, what would you tell the father about the pathophysiology of myelomeningocele? What is the difference between myelomeningocele and meningocele? 3. Following your discussion with the family, w hich of these statements by the father would indicate a need for more teaching? (Select all that apply.)a. \"My baby's malformation can also be referred to as spina bifida (SB) cystica. \"b. \"My baby will probably not require surgery until she is a year old. \"c. \"My baby will need to lie on her stomach in her incubator. \"d. \"I need to wash my hands carefully to prevent spread of germs. \" 10 Pediatric484PART 2 PEDIATRIC, MATERNITY , AND PSYCHIATRIC CASES Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.

Y ou add 10 mL of sterile water to the 1 g vial for concentration of 100 mg/1 mL. Calculate how many milliliters you will draw up for this dose. Note on the syringe how much you will draw up to send with the patient. CASE STUDY PROGRESS The next day in report, you hear that Baby Girl R. did well overnight. She goes to surgery at 0815. Later, the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) nurse tells you that Baby Girl R. is ready to return to your unit. When she arrives, you and the NAP start putting on the monitors. Mr. R. is present, and he asks you to give the baby some pain medication. The open warmer starts alarming because the patient's skin tem- perature is reading 35\u00b0 C. You look down at her to see whether the temperature probe has fallen off. You see that it is still on, but you also notice that the suture from surgery is no longer intact. Then the oxygen (O2) monitor reads 71% saturated with an accurate waveform, and the pulse oximeter probe is correctly placed on the patient. The patient's respirat ory rate is 25 breaths/min and the heart rate is 102 beats/min. 7. Which of the issues should yo u address first? Give rationale. CASE STUDY PROGRESS Baby Girl R. stabilizes. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0 C (98.1\u00b0 F) per skin probe. Respiratory rate and heart rate improve and her Sa O2 is 98% on \u00bc LPM oxygen per nasal cannula. The surgeon is at the bedside and patient returns to the OR for revision of incision. Two days later, you are caring for Baby Girl R. at night. In report, you hear that the parents really want to hold their baby, but they have not yet because they are afraid of causing the suture to open again. They are currently at the bedside, and the infant is due for a feeding. 8. How can you help the parents become comfortable with holding their baby? 10 Pediatric486PART 2 PEDIATRIC, MATERNITY , AND PSYCHIATRIC CASES Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.

When you take the bottle in to the patient's room, you notice a growth chart next to the bed tracking the patient's frontal occ ipital circumference (FOC) that is measured at least once per shift. Baby Girl R.'s FOC has increased to 38.5 cm. Using the appropriate CDC growth chart ( http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/data/set2/chart%2010.pdf ), is the following statement true or false? The FOC is close to the 95% and can be monitored less frequently because this is a normal finding. CASE STUDY OUTCOME Baby Girl R. is followed closely in the Level 2 nursery. She stabilizes and is able to be discharged to home in 2 weeks with close multidisciplinary follow-up.10 PediatricCase Study 109 Name Class/Group Date Group Members INSTRUCTIONS All questions apply to this case study.

R.O. has four siblings who have recently been ill with stomach pains, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. They were seen by their primary care provider (PCP) and diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis. A week later, R.O. woke up at 0200 crying and telling her mother that her stomach \"hurts really bad!\" She had an elevated temperature of 37.9\u00b0 C (100.2\u00b0 F). R.O. began to vomit over the next few hours, so her parents took her to the local emergency department (ED). R.O.'s vital signs (VS), complete blood count (CBC), and complete metabolic panel were normal, so she was hydrated with IV fluids and discharged to home with instructions to call their PCP or to return to the ED if she did not improve or worsened. Over the next 2 days, R.O.'s abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), she refused to eat, and she had slight diarrhea. On the third day, she began to have more severe abdominal pain, increased vomiting, and fever that did not respond to acetaminophen. R.O. returns to the ED. Her VS are 128/78, 130, 28, 39.5\u00b0 C (103.1\u00b0 F). R.O. is guarding her lower abdomen, prefers to lie on her side with her legs flexed, and is crying. IV access is established, and morphine sulfate 2 mg IV is administered for pain. An abdominal CT (computed tomography) confirms a diagnosis of appendicitis. R.O.'s white blood count (WBC) is 12,000 mm 3. 1. Identify the clinical manifesta tions exhibited by R.O. that most clearly reflect the classic presentation of appendicitis. 2.

The peritoneum is inflamed, and abscesses are seen near the colon and small intestine. R.O. is admitted to the surgical unit; she is NPO, has a nasogas-tric tube (NGT), Foley catheter, IV, abdominal dressing, and a Penrose drain. 7. Identify five priority nursing considerations. CASE STUDY PROGRESS Postop Day 2: R.O. continues to improve and is tolerating ice chips. Breath sounds are clear, and she is performing her pulmonary hygiene. NGT has minimal drainage. Foley catheter has been removed, and the patient has adequate urine output. The Penrose drain has been removed. The incision is well approxi-mated with no drainage or redness. Her pain is 4-6 out of 10 with pain medication every 4 hours. Postop Day 3: Assessment shows that R.O. is pale and listless; bowel sounds are absent; abdomen is distended and tender to the touch; the NGT is draining an increased amount of dark, greenish black fluid. Her lung sounds are moist bilaterally, and her tempera ture has spiked to 40.2\u00b0 C (104.4\u00b0 F). She rates her pain at 10 out of 10 and is having difficulty taking deep breaths because of the pain, which she says \"hurts over my whole stomach. \" 8.

Postoperatively, she experienced an intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and her hematocrit (Hct) dropped from 40.5% to 21%. She was transfused with 3 units of packed RBCs. After discharge, she continued to have abdominal pain, chills, and fever and was subsequently readmitted twice: once for treatment of postoperative infection and the second time for evacuation of a pelvic hematoma. Despite treatment, T.C. continued to have abdominal pain, chills, fever, and nausea and vomiting. T.C. has now been admitted to your unit from the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) after an explor - atory laparotomy. Vital signs (VS) are 130/70, 94, 16, 99.7\u00b0 F (37.6\u00b0 C) (tympanic). She is easily aroused and oriented to place and person. She dozes between verbal requests. She has a low-midline abdominal dressing that is dry and intact and a Jackson-Pratt (JP) drain that is fully compressed and contains a scant amount of bright red blood. Her Foley to down drain has clear yellow urine. She has an IV of 1000 mL D5.45NS infusing at 100 mL/hr in her lef t forearm, with no swelling or redness. T.C. is receiving IV mor - phine sulfate for pain control through a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. The settings are dose 2 mg , lock-out interval 15 minutes, 4-hour maximum dose of 30 mg . When aroused, she states that her pain is an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. She also has 2 L oxygen by nasal cannula (O2/NC); her Sa o2 by pulse oxim - eter is 93%. 1.

F ormulate a plan of care for T.C. related to this issue. 4. W hich of T.C.'s vital sign values would be most important for the NAP to report to you immediately? a. T emperature of 100\u00b0 F (37.8\u00b0 C) b. B lood pressure of 160/80 mm H g c. H eart rate of 100 beats/min d. Res piratory rate of 8 breaths/min 5. P ain control using the PCA can be tricky. Throughout the first postoperative day, it has been difficult to balance T.C.'s need for pain medication and depression of her respiratory status. Discuss the concept of controlling pain with a PCA using opioids and factors that can be adjusted to better control her pain.12 W omen's Health557CHAPTER 12 WO m E n'S H EA lTH Di SORDERS C ASE STUDY 125 Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.

When you ask J.O. the date of his last tetanus shot, you find out that he was born and raised in Colombia and immigrated to the United States 5 years ago. He does not know whether he has ever had a tetanus shot. You inform the physician, and he orders diphtheria/tetanus toxoid 0.5 mL IM and tetanus immune globulin (HyperTET) 250 units deep IM. 6. Why is J.O. getting two injections? 7. When you give J.O. the tetanus injections, you find J.O. in the position illustrated below. Are any of these findings of concern to you? If so, how would you fix it?15 Multiple Disorders611CHAPTER 15 PATIENTS WITH MUL TIPLE DISORDERS CASE STUDY 138 Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.

You receive a call from the paramedics that they are en route to your facility with the victim of gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen. The paramedics have started two large-bore IV lines with lactated Ringer's and oxygen by mask at 15 L/min. The patient has a sucking chest wound on the left and a wound in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) of the abdomen. Vital signs in the field are 80/36, 140, and 42. The patient is diaphoretic, very pale, and confused. The estimated time of arrival is 4 minutes. 1. List at least six things you will do to prepare for this patient's arrival. CASE STUDY PROGRESS On arrival, your patient, B.W., is cyanotic and in sever e respiratory distress. When he is transferred to the trauma stretcher, you notice that there is an occlusive dressing over the sucking chest wound. It is taped down on all sides. 2. Is taping the occlusive dressing on all sides appropriate? Explain. 3. Who usually responds to a trauma code, and what are the functions of the people from the various departments? 16 Emergency660PART 3 OTHER/ADVANCED CASES Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.

Based on B.W .'s vital signs and condition, what are the priority interventions at this time? CASE STUDY PROGRESS Treatments aimed toward stabilizing B.W.'s respiratory and volume status are started. You begin the sec- ondary survey. 6. Describe the actions that you will perform as part of the secondary survey. 7. During your assessment, you note the following ecchymotic area on B.W .'s abdomen. What might this signify?16 Emergency661CHAPTER 16 EMERGENCY SITUATIONS CASE STUDY 150 Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.

What are the possible reasons for the abdominal distention and rigidity? 9. Y ou report your findings to the physician, who orders a focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST). Why would this procedure be appropriate for B.W .? CASE STUDY PROGRESS The FAST is positive, and B.W. is sent for a CT of the abdomen, which shows a large liver laceration. The surgeon needs to take B.W. to the operating room (OR) for an exploratory laparotomy with repair of liver laceration. 10. Because B.W . is not currently able to give consent for surgery, how will consent be obtained? 11. When you return from transporting the patient to the OR, B.W .'s wife is in the ED, upset and frightened. The social worker has been called to another emergency. What information do you need to obtain from B.W .'s wife? 12. How would you support her? 16 EmergencyIntentionally left as blank663 Copyright \u00a9 2013 by Mosby, an affiliate of Elsevier Inc.
