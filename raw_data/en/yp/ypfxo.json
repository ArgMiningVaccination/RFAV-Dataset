Candida Various infections can have negative effects on your body. Viruses and bacteria are common sources of infections. Candida, yeast, and mold infections are common, but they are caused by fungus. Fungal overgrowth causes imbalances in your body, specifically affecting your intestines, producing many symptoms. When your body's immune system can't manage candida or yeast, symptoms can develop. Candida, yeast, and mold infections can be eradicated naturally with nutritional supplementation and dietary modification. Candida remedies can be started and eradicated from the body within three to four weeks, if a strict protocol is followed, and the proper nutritional supplementation is administered. Yeast Infections Yeast infections like candida or thrush can be very mild or they can be life threatening if untreated. When they affect the skin and are superficial they cause discomfort and inflammation. The specific symptoms depend upon the area that is infected. People typically combat these infections using anti-fungal medications, but it is more effective to turn to natural remedies for a yeast infection. Natural remedies work alongside your immune system. They strengthen your body's natural defenses and work to quickly fend off infections more safely than drug treatments. Mold Infections Mold infections in a living space can result from flooding, high humidity levels, poor ventilation, leaky pipes and anything that causes moisture and warmth. These two factors create the perfect environment for mold to grow. Exposure to mold can cause severe headaches, respiration issues and respiratory infections, sinus infections, irritability, loss of appetite and even memory loss. "}
