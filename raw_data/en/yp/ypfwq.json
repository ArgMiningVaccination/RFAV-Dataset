Male reproduction is controlled and coordinated by endocrine factors and therefore, even minute changes can able to interfere with the male fertility. Accumulation of data have shown that the humans are exposed to chemicals that can able to interfere with endocrine factors. Interestingly, published reports have shown that the continuous exposure to such chemicals occurs mainly due to their wide us... R. Pavani, P. Prathima, K. Venkaiah and S. B. Sainath Thrombosis is one of the major causes of death and disability worldwide. Cancer patients are commonly thrombophilia or prothrombotic since they have abnormalities in all three factors of Virchow's triad, which lead to thromboembolism. Venous thrombosis (VT) is a chronic disorder that has the potential to be fatal and cause considerable complications. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) may potentially their well-known lack of side effects in comparison to pharmaceuticals, natural materials with medical potential are rising in prominence in clinical research. Since the dawn of civilization, humans have relied on plants as a vital resource for healing. Medicines, health aids, pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, cosmetics and other similar items derived from plants are becoming more popula...
