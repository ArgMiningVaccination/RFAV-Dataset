I am also grateful to therespondents who took the time to pen their thoughtfulcomments and re flections. My responses to their respective comments will follow, but rst a little backstory about the article may be instructive. Work on the manuscript was begun about 25 years ago, after which I kept returning to it in ts and starts, before shelving it for many years, but never giving up on thepossibility of nishing the paper. Finally, last summer, I decided to revisit my research on the subject, update thereferences, and complete the article. The original impetus for the paper \u2014and one that has not changed in the intervening years \u2014was that I kept seeing this word, \"healing, \"used over and over in both academic and lay writing on health, healthcare, and medicine. I noted withsome concern that the word was used inconsistently and inmultiple contexts, yet I had the sense that many of the peopleusing the term were not clear about what it meant, or evenabout what they intended it to mean. I came to observe that,at least in the complementary and alternative medicine(CAM) world, the word seems to have been ascribed almostmagical properties and has come to mean whatever respectivewriters want it to mean. This is not conducive to use as aconstruct for empirical research. Moreover, I noted that itsvaried uses within CAM contexts con flict with its more consistent and narrow usage in biomedicine. The article wasan effort, simply, to document this state of affairs. My primary concern about the conceptualization of heal- ing, however, relates much less to con flicts between biomed- ical and CAM de nitions of healing. I chose this dichotomy in part as a tool to compare and contrast the various ways thathealing has been used. The deeper and more serious issue, Ibelieve, is that research ndings regarding healing used in one respective context are used as evidence for healing in anothercontext that may not relate in any way to \"healing \"according to any de nition. Or the flipside of this: research ndings that do not pertain to healing at all, such as studies ofprimary-preventive effects of speci c exposure variables in population samples being touted as evidence of the healing orcuring of disease. The example that comes immediately tomind, in light of my own research of the past 35 years,involves the hundreds of recent studies of population-healtheffects of religious behaviors on rates of morbidity or mortal-ity that are misconstrued as \"proof \"of\"spiritual healing. \"No matter what anyone reading this journal may believe or wishto be so, this happens all the time and causes much lamentingand frustration among the top line of academic researcherson religion and spirituality within epidemiology, medicine,and the social sciences. Articles have appeared elsewherecritiquing such work as disheveled and shoddy, literally, and my colleagues in these elds, almost to a person, dismiss most research on \"healing \"or\"spiritual healing \"as defective and consider the topic not worth the time or effort. Privately,some of them wonder why I even have chosen to write on thetopic for so many years. Naturally, I do not share these views,at all, but mention this here as an indication of how theconceptual imprecision pervasive in uses of \"healing \"have hindered the growth of a mature scienti celd around the subject, and have discouraged some of the best scientists fromdipping their toes in the water. Surveying the literature on healing in its CAM context for the past few decades, one can observe terms like \"healing, \" \"spiritual healing, \"\"mental healing, \"and\"energy healing, \"for example, used almost interchangeably. One can also observe,as noted, evidence from prevalence or prospective populationstudies of religious behavior and respective health or well-being outcomes used as evidence of a healing effect ofspirituality, even though the study population did not samplesick people and no intervention was investigated; thus healing(in any context) was not even the subject of the study. Thatthis occurs, continually, is scarcely debatable. At the sametime, there exist a minority of truly outstanding CAM-oriented studies of healing and spiritual healing, as reviewedby serious and careful scholars such as Dan Benor and LarryDossey, but they tend to get lost in the cacophony. Theconceptual inconsistencies identi ed in the article thus create multiple unfortunate problems: they create confusion as towhat is meant by healing and thus inhibit the evolvement of a eld of study focused on salutogenesis and they discourage mainstream academic scientists from engaging this topic at all,but they also steer attention away from the really ne work on healing conducted for many years by important gures in the CAM world, including some of the respondents to this paper,and including papers published in this journal. Now a few words about each of the thoughtful commen- taries offered about the article. Margaret Chesney lucidly af rmed many of the points that I tried to make. Speci cally, she noted that I had identi ed\"a chasm between those investigating healing in the biomedicalworld and those in the CAM world interested in healing. \" Indeed! But she may be more hopeful than me, and I applaudher for this: \"While a challenge, bridging this chasm may be possible. \"I hope that this is true, and I am anxious to help, but at present I remain semidoubtful. Conceptual challengesare among the most resistant to change, as they are so tied toparadigmatic positions and worldviews. By contrast, in myobservation, methodological and theoretical challenges aremore amenable to evolution. I suspect that collaborativeresearch ventures, bringing together investigators from across 1 &2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

If there areany creative philanthropists reading these comments, I urgethem to get in touch with the editors of this journal; maybean invited symposium is in order. Bill Manahan offered some very personal and provocative thoughts that get right to the theme of the article, namely\"what is healing? \"I am glad that he emphasized that if a study is done of healing, \"there needs to be clarity as to whether that means 'repair of wounds, 'or if it means some sort of intervention, outcome, and/or process. \"This is pretty much my main point. To clarify, in my opinion it is not that any ofthese usages is \"wrong \"or that the research conducted under any of these contexts is invalid. It is simply that by all of suchwork being referred to as about \"healing, \"the lack of precision inhibits a deeper understanding of these subjects, whichlessens the impact of the research. Manahan goes on tosuggest that \"researchers need to de ne what they mean by 'healing, 'while at the same time, I believe having multiple meanings for the word is not unusual and quite acceptable. \"I do not disagree with his second point here, and believe thathisrst point is a key: before invoking a substantive term (e.g., healing) in a research study, investigators ought to carefullydene their terms; and when reviewing literature and discussing their ndings, they ought to ensure that their comparisons are between apples and apples, not apples and oranges. Eben Alexander compellingly spoke of his own near-death experience (NDE) and those of others documented in thegrowing literature on the subject. I love these sorts of storiesand, like many of my friends and colleagues, cannot getenough of them. My own mother had an NDE many decadesago that caused her to change her life path from that of an artist to that of an energy healer and transformational therapist. As Alexander notes, such experiences demand thatwe rethink concepts such as \"healing, \"\"spiritual, \"and the \"miraculous. \"In his case, his NDE caused him to \"[relin- quish] my entire prior worldview of scienti c materialism, as well as its cornerstone that the brain creates consciousness. \"I came to a similar conclusion as a result of a series ofmeditation-induced out-of-body experiences (OBEs) duringmy postgraduate training. Such experiences tell us thathealing \u2014as understood in the default vernacular sense(s) \u2014 is about far more than the granulation of dermal wounds. Thechallenge for us is to develop a language that enables us tocarefully study and document these phenomena with thecritical attention that they merit. Janet Quinn, a dear friend, has been writing on healing dating back decades, and her work is among the mostthoughtful and careful and clearly understood that has everbeen offered on this topic. I nd it compelling that much of the early writing on healing in a non-biomedical context \u2014as well as on holistic medicine in general \u2014came from the nursing eld, among those who were conducting rst-rate studies of various touch healing modalities and offeringdetailed theoretical expositions on the subject. This work,for the most part, was begun years before there was an NIHofce devoted to integrative medicine, before there weretextbooks on the subject, and before folks like Benor and Dossey began reviewing studies of healing. I wonder some- times if the marginality of CAM writing on healing andspiritual healing, from the perspective of the mainstream, is inpart a function of ongoing turf con flicts between medicine and nursing and whether there may be a substantial genderedcomponent here, as well. The underlying worldviews of theseperspectives on \"healing \"are so distinct that they may re flect deeper and more longstanding biocultural divides. Anotherpoint: if I read it correctly, Quinn suggests that I wasadvocating limiting use of healing to physical or physiologicalcontexts. Actually, I tried to make clear that I saw a helpfulapplication of this concept to both physical andpsycholog- ical wounds, a position considerably outside the defaultbiomedical de nition. The challenge for all of us who are involved in empirical research is to make explicit what wemean by the terms that we are using. With that in mind, I amin agreement with Quinn when she stated, \"In the end, healing may be, like pain, what the patient says it is. \"But just as pain researchers make clear what they are measuringand treating and studying, so too should we when we arereferencing a term that has suffered from decades of impre-cise, jargon-laden application. Perhaps a good project wouldbe to catalogue emic understandings of \"healing, \"and let the concept de ne itself from the ground up, if you will, without imposition of boundaries de ned by scientists and clinicians who, anyway, are not the ones having these experiences. Mary Jo Kreitzer goes into considerable detail on the very contributions of nursing researchers to the study of healingthat I reference above. I am familiar with this work, includingthe writings of Barbara Dossey, Jean Watson, Janet Quinn(noted above), and other contemporary researchers such asJoan Engebretson and Janet Mentgen, each of whom I know or have met and corresponded with and have cited through- out my writing. I agree enthusiastically that, on the whole,these pioneering holistic nursing researchers have done abetter and more consistent job of describing healing andengaging it in a scholarly way than either biomedical scientistsor non-nursing CAM authors. Indeed the best writing on thesubject from within nursing seems to come closest to bridgingboth perspectives in as careful a way as has been done to date.In at least one instance, however, I feel that Kreitzer has \u2014as have some of the other commentators \u2014misconstrued what my position is. She states that I nd the CAM perspective on healing to be \"disturbing and unfortunate, in part because it lacks precision. \"She then reiterates that she is sympathetic that a scientist, such as me, would nd it \"hard to deal with concepts that are mushy. \"Au contraire! I have spent decades of my career as an epidemiologist applying population-healthmethods to the mushiest possible constructs, far mushier thanhealing: religion, spirituality, mystical experience, psi, prayer,love, transcendence, bioenergy healing \u2014I even published what, to the best of my knowledge, was the rst study of New-Age healing ever conducted and was the rst use of the phrase \"New Age \"to appear in that context in the entire medical literature ...over 30 years ago. So mushy does not bother me, and I hardly nd the CAM perspective on healing to be \"disturbing and unfortunate. \"I share much of that 2 EXPLORE ]2017, Vol. ], No. ] Response Downloaded for Anonymous User (n/a) at Duke University from ClinicalKey.com/nursing by Elsevier on June 07, 2017.

My concern is simply this: that without suf cient conceptual precision, empirical research on healing \u2014and on the other constructs that I have spent my career investigating \u2014is doomed. Dean Radin very rightly notes that \"many words have multiple meanings, \"and, thus, \"Beyond context, it may be that healing is just one of those things that de es precise denition. \"That is surely the case here, and I agree also with his paraphrase of Justice Stewart 's famous remark that \"I know it when I see it. \"This would seem to apply especially to healing, at least as much as to pornography! I have littleexpectation that my article is going to make any changes inpopular usage of such a ubiquitous word as healing, nor do I wish it to . The article was not written to advocate for a language police. The intent, simply, was to urge greater care \u2014 and dream of some future day of greater uniformity \u2014in its medical usage, speci cally in its uses in medical and health- related research. As Radin notes, words are importantlydened for purposes of the legal profession; this precision is required to justly and consistently adjudicate disputes.Likewise, in the medical and therapeutic professions, wordsought to be used in ways that are transparent to the audiencesof those words and that are carefully delimited by the users.The health status of people and populations, and indeed the\"healing \"of cases of disease and distress, depend upon it. David Hufford has written for many years on a variety of topics in CAM, including insightful essays on spiritualhealing, and notably a classic paper coauthored with LarryDossey published in the rst volume of this journal. I have cited his work more times than I can recall, and have includedhis writing in the syllabus for an undergraduate class that Ihave taught on the history of religious healing across culturessince the time of Christ. As a folklorist and medical humanist, he brings a perspective that is otherwise lacking among prominent scholars in CAM and related elds, to their detriment. I appreciate that he took the time to offerreflections on my article. I agree with quite a bit of what he had to say, but dispute other parts of his critique, especiallythe following two points: (a) that the status quo that I identifyas conceptual confusion is not a problem, or is not reallyconceptual confusion; and (b) that I am advocating forthe biomedical approach to healing, and to a \"reductive biomedical framework. \"The second point is just not so \u2014Ia m not sure how he read that into my comments. I am sym-pathetic with a broader treatment of healing than simply therepair of physical wounds. Moreover, I am supportiveof healing used in all three of the CAM contexts thatI identify \u2014as an intervention, process, or outcome \u2014and indeed have published separate papers on healing used in eachof those contexts in this very journal! As for the rst point, Hufford seems to have taken my description of the problem-atic fallout for research of multiple competing usages of \"healing \"as a statement of conceptual preference. Again, not so. The closest thing to a thesis statement or recommendationhere is that uses of \"healing \"in medical and clinical research and writing try be more consistent with the term as understoodwithin the context of the natural history of disease \u2014a heuristic conceptual framework that does not imply obeisance tobiomedicine or reductionism \u2014 so as to help to coalesce a scienti celd around the study of salutogenesis, which would benet us all. Also: I am not certain how Hufford construed my remarks seeking clari cation of \"healing \"as support for the lamentable practice of of cial committees of physicians offer- ing spurious de nitions of spirituality. This is something that I have been explicitly critical of, in print, for many years, at therisk of alienating those among my colleagues who have takenpart in such committees. Anyway, I am not sure that I see howany of this applies my documentation of existing conceptualimprecision regarding healing that I believe has inhibited thegrowth of healing research. In sum, I greatly appreciate that Explore has sought com- ments from such distinguished and insightful experts. It is aprivilege for any academic scientist, including a biomedicalscientist, to have his or her work taking seriously enough for a journal to solicit re flections by noted scholars. To close, just so that there is no additional cause for confusion, my mostsuccinct and clearest possible statement on the topic of myarticle is this: in my opinion, the issue of healing is tooimportant, clinically and scienti cally, to be left to sketchy and emotion-driven conceptual engagement (or non-engagement),which inhibits the rigorous empirical research that this subjectvery, very richly deserves and requires.
