The earliest recorded use of electricity for healing purposes dates from 2750BC, when sick people were exposed to the shocks of electric eels. Magnetite or loadstone was used for healing by the ancient Egyptians, Chinese and later by the Greeks. The Bible and other spiritual texts describe healing such as the laying on of hands (which is still practised today in some churches). Therapeutic touch, Quantum touch and Reiki are some of the modern versions of this technique. Mesmer began using magnets for healing in 1773, but then progressed to using the laying on of hands. Medical electricity had its golden era between the late 1700's and early 1900's. During that period a wide variety of healing devices were developed for treating a range of ailments. In 1867 Duchenne published his classical studies of muscle points, which gave rise to the modern field of medical electromyography. By the turn of the 20th century a wide variety of electromagnetic devices for healing were available, providing therapies for every disease and problem. Modern medicine has been using a form of energy medicine since the discovery of Xrays by Roentgen. Electrocardiographs (ECG's), Electroencephalograms (EEG's), Xrays, Computerised tomography (CT) and MRI scans are now in common use for diagnostic purposes. Over the last few decades scientists have developed methods to measure the subtle but important energy fields within and around the human body. These fields were once considered non-existent by mainstream medicine. Bio-energetic/energy medicine has the potential to improve the treatment of diseases which do not respond to conventional clinical treatment. Integrative medical practitioners are currently using one or more of the following energy medicine modalities (each of which will have a detailed explanation of its own): - Acupuncture (AP) - Homeopathy - Anthroposophical medicine - Homotoxicology (which utilises homeopathic principles) - Biopuncture (injecting homeopathics into AP points) - Flower essences - Rife resonator therapy - Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEFT) - Bemer - QX/Scio/Indigo biofeedback - EAV devices - Vegatest - Low energy laser treatment - Cranio-electrical stimulation - Polarised light therapy - Bioptron - Neurofeedback (also known as "}
