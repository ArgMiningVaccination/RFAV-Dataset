In a healthy person, balance is usually quickly restored, but when the healing capacity of a person is compromised, help in healing is needed. Naturopathic physicians use natural, effective, and non-toxic therapies to support the body's natural healing process, stimulate the body's vital force, and prevent further disease from occurring. Each person is unique and requires catered services and individualized care. In developing a treatment plan, the cause of any condition is taken into consideration - not only the physical symptoms that the patient may be experiencing, but also spiritual, emotional, and psychological symptoms of the person. Disease affects people on more than just the physical level. This being the case, Naturopathic medicine takes a holistic approach by incorporating the evaluation of the person's thoughts, feelings, lifestyle, family history, environmental stresses, and nutritional status. Health is more than just the absence of disease. Optimum health entails daily functioning on the highest possible levels, and is characterized by positive emotions, thoughts, and actions. Naturopathic physicians teach patients how to restore and maintain their own health through living in harmony with themselves and their environment. Naturopathic Principles First Do No Harm Core to all medical practice is the desire to help the human form and condition. NDs typically approach care by utilizing the most natural, least invasive and least toxic therapies. NDs will refer when the patient's presentation is outside their scope or level of skill. The Healing Power of Nature NDs recognize the value of our natural world in assisting the healing process. Not only do NDs utilize substances that originate in nature, but they also incorporate a healthy natural environment as foundational to human health. Naturopathic doctors recognize and harness the body's inherent wisdom to heal itself in order to guide patients to wellness and total health. Identify and Treat the Causes There is a time and place for symptom suppression, however most naturopathic patients will benefit from identifying the underlying causes of illness and removing obstacles to cure. Doctor as Teacher Naturopathic doctors elevate patient health literacy. That means that NDs are part of the team helping patients have a better understanding of what it takes to be and stay well. Through education and a trust-based relationship, patients better understand the steps they need to take to achieve and maintain health. Treat the Whole Person Naturopathic doctors understand the interconnectedness of our body, our environment and our lifestyle on total health. It is only through this whole-person-based approach that NDs seek to restore balance and health. Prevention Naturopathic medicine affirms that it is better to prevent illness and suffering whenever possible. Through their comprehensive practice, NDs combine all six principles in order to identify potential areas of imbalance and teach patients how to get well and stay well. Naturopathic Physician Education A Naturopathic Physician is a primary Health Care Professional, who is trained as a specialist in Natural Medicine. The field of Natural Medicine is strongly rooted with an emphasis on prevention. Naturopathic Medicine is effective in treating most health problems, whether acute or chronic. In practice, Naturopathic Physicians perform laboratory testing, physical examinations, gynecological exams, pediatrics, geriatrics, men's health, allergy testing, and hormone testing, counseling, nutritional and dietary analysis. Naturopathic Physicians refer patients to other practitioners from all other branches of medical science for diagnosis and treatment as appropriate. A Naturopathic Physician has a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (N.D.) degree from a four year graduate level federally accredited Naturopathic Medical College, which includes two years of supervised clinical internship. N.D.'s study the same basic medical curriculum and clinical sciences as orthodox allopathic medical students (M.D.'s) along with the full spectrum of natural medicines and therapies. Naturopathic Doctors are licensed in several states in the USA and provinces in Canada. To obtain licensure, the candidate must successfully graduate from a Naturopathic Medical College and receive a passing mark on the National Standardized examination or that of a particular state's Naturopathic Board examination. States that license Naturopathic Doctor's include: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, Washington, plus the District of Columbia and United States Territories, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
