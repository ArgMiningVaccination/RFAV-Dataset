InABR published by the Indonesian Consortium of Biomedical Sciences or [Konsorsium Ilmu Biomedik Indonesia (KIBI)](https://biomedicalsciences.or.id/) with a focus and journal scope covering biomedicine, molecular biology, stem cell, and herbal medicine, anti-aging, reproduction, and genetics. After over 30 years of operating separately all over Indonesia, we decide that it is the right moment, then, to assemble and form a new entity. The new entity, we reckoned, will be an organization that benefits researchers from universities and affiliated centers throughout Indonesia by facilitating the process of mutual exchange of minds. In the year 2009, the heads of the school of biomedical science gathered for the first time. After the first meeting, agreements concerning the standardization of curriculums, qualifications for teachers, and the projected quality of graduates were reached. On July 4-5, 2015, all twelve faculty of medicine in operation in Indonesia were invited for a National Biomedical Workshop at Brawijaya University. The workshop itself was intended for the finalization of the establishment of the Indonesian Consortium of Biomedical Sciences (KIBI). The consortium then proceeded to schedule the next meeting, the first KIBI National Congress, which was going to be held on August 26-27, 2015 at Universitas Indonesia. It was during this Congress that KIBI was inaugurated by the Director-General of The Ministry of Research, Technology, and the Higher Education Republic of Indonesia. Until now, KIBI holds the responsibility to endorse the importance of biomedical science in educating health workers and in making health policy. Additionally, KIBI will continue to recommend the use of biomedical science as a blueprint for designing research and development policy.
