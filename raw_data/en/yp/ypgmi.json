But one thing that struck me is that once someone told me Ayurveda is a scam mostly but there is some part of Ayurveda that is legit. So this got me thinking about whether big companies like Dabur and Patanjali sell fake products in the name of Ayurveda and not only get their reputation ruined but also the reputation of Ayurveda as well because there are many herbs in Ayurveda that really have medicinal properties, but again, I am biased.
