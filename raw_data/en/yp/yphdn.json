Pure, natural and superior food supplements Pure Origin Supplements should be based on nothing but pure and natural ingredients It all began in 2009 with the frustration of not being able to find an Omega-3 fish oil that didn't give fishy burps. Being the strivers that they are, founders Julius and Oliver said: \"We'll have to make it ourselves!\" They learned that product quality and potency truly matters, and so does third party testing. Since then we've added a range of supplements, but they all have one thing in common: only pure and natural ingredients are used.
