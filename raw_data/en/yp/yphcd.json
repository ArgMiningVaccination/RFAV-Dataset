Like its cousin onion, garlic is versatile and plays many different wide-ranging roles in protecting human health. To be honest, garlic has so many health benefits that it deserves a book dedicated only to itself. Garlic is an antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal (including mold), and antiparasitic agent that is also rich in allicin, a sulfur-containing active ingredient that prevents diseases. Although black garlic contains less allicin than fresh raw garlic cloves, it still stands out for its high concentration of many nutrients, [antioxidants], and other beneficial compounds. These higher concentrations may be responsible, at least in part, for many of the healing effects of garlic. Here, in this article we discuss thoroughly about all the nutrients contained in black garlic, the health benefits of black garlic, in which conditions this miracle herbal remedy may support your health, and why it is useful to combine [black garlic](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JCBMRTB?maas=maas_adg_F2820D697FA703941C569CBC38C53C29_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas) with [chaga mushroom](https://ecosh.com/chaga-mushroom-inonotus-obliquus-9-incredible-evidence-based-potential-health-benefits-of-chaga-that-may-extend-your-life/). Black Garlic is Extremely Rich in Nutrients Some people call garlic a \"Natural Antibiotic\". And not in vain - garlic contains more than 200 chemical compounds with a variety of beneficial health properties. Although black garlic has the lowest moisture content than raw garlic, it has the highest total amount of sugars and energetic value. For example, among many other substances, black garlic also contains sodium, potassium, selenium, calcium, [ magnesium](https://ecosh.com/magnesium-a-vital-mineral/), silicon, [ zinc](https://ecosh.com/zinc-deficiency-symptoms-causes-risk-factors-and-natural-treatment/), [ iron](https://ecosh.com/iron-deficiency-anemia-causes-and-12-main-symptoms-that-signal-iron-deficiency/), B9,), [ vitamin C](https://ecosh.com/vitamin-c-12-health-benefits-symptoms-of-vitamin-c-deficiency-scurvy-and-24-vitamin-c-rich-foods/) and [ D](https://ecosh.com/vitamin-d3-16-health-benefits-and-15-vitamin-d-rich-foods/). Though, black garlic contains less of allicin (this compound gives raw garlic some of its health benefits) than regular garlic, it's still rich in antioxidants (almost double the amount than in regular garlic), amino acids, and phytonutrients. However, the fermentation process may change the concentrations. Black garlic also contains more of S-Allylcysteine (SAC), which helps your body to absorb allicin. Therefore, black garlic may be more efficient at helping your body get the benefits that allicin offers ( [32](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-black-garlic#1), [42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6600231/)). Black garlic supplements are available [here.] The Full List of Vitamins, Minerals and Other Active Compounds in Black Garlic - Vitamins in black black garlic: - Antioxidants in black garlic. Black garlic packs at least double the [antioxidants](https://ecosh.com/antioxidants-benefits-deficiency-causes-symptoms-and-antioxidant-rich-foods/)compared to fresh garlic. - Polyphenols (allixin). These micronutrients are loaded with antioxidants and the polyphenol level in black garlic is at least twice that of the level contained in raw garlic. Polyphenols are associated with diabetes management, weight loss, and so much more ( [36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6014790/), [37](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0009279710005818)). micronutrients are loaded with antioxidants and the polyphenol level in black garlic is at least twice that of the level contained in raw garlic. Polyphenols are associated with diabetes management, weight loss, and so much more ( - Organosulfur compounds in black garlic (water soluble). These two compounds have been demonstrated to be the most significant active components in black garlic that possess major health benefits. The more SAC black garlic contains the better, but the minimum concentration 1 mg has been shown to have the above benefits in lab animals. In addition, Allyl-cysteine contained in black garlic has been studied as a possible cholesterol lowering agent, and as an cancer preventive agent compounds in black garlic (lipid soluble): Natural [black garlic supplements with the second nature's miracle remedy chaga mushroom](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JCBMRTB?maas=maas_adg_F2820D697FA703941C569CBC38C53C29_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas) are available to purchase [ online](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JCBMRTB?maas=maas_adg_F2820D697FA703941C569CBC38C53C29_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas). 13 Therapeutic Effects and Health Benefits of Black Garlic Although black garlic contains less of the active compound allicin than raw garlic, it does pack higher amounts of numerous other nutrients, antioxidants, and other beneficial substances. Therefore, this miracle herb has plenty of benefits on your health. 1. Antioxidants in Black Garlic - Black Garlic Contains More Antioxidants Than Raw Garlic [Antioxidants](https://ecosh.com/antioxidants-benefits-deficiency-causes-symptoms-and-antioxidant-rich-foods/) are beneficial substances that neutralize, suppress and control the development of [ free radicals](https://ecosh.com/free-radical-damage-22-diseases-caused-by-free-radicals/). In your body, there has to be a balance between antioxidants and free radicals. When the balance is ruined, free radicals become dangerous and start to damage your cells ( [oxidative stress](https://ecosh.com/oxidative-stress-causes-symptoms-and-natural-home-remedies/)). But antioxidants disrupt these harmful chain reactions initiated by free radicals. The most important antioxidants are vitamins [ C](https://ecosh.com/vitamin-c-12-health-benefits-symptoms-of-vitamin-c-deficiency-scurvy-and-24-vitamin-c-rich-foods/), A, E, carotenoids, flavonoids, ubiquinones, manganese and [ zinc](https://ecosh.com/zinc-deficiency-symptoms-causes-risk-factors-and-natural-treatment/). Where Do You Get Antioxidants? - From food. Noteworthy is that antioxidants mutually strengthen each other, so it is important that your body gets the whole set of antioxidants at the same time. See the full list of top antioxidant rich foods [here](https://ecosh.com/antioxidants-benefits-deficiency-causes-symptoms-and-antioxidant-rich-foods/). - Your body produces some of the antioxidants itself (for example, coenzyme Q10, melatonin, lipoic acid). Our body has developed three antioxidant enzymes that protect us 24 hours a day throughout our lifetime. However, these do not offer sufficient protection from free radicals in case you have an unhealthy lifestyle and unbalanced diet. Antioxidants, for example, may slow down the [aging process], lower [cholesterol levels], reduce the risk of atherosclerosis, reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, slow down Alzheimer's disease, lessen the risk of tumors, decrease the harm caused by cigarette smoke, and so on. And as said before, black garlic and chaga contain a massive amount of [antioxidants]. 2. Black Garlic Supports Respiratory Health Like fresh garlic, black garlic also contains allicin (though in smaller amounts) which possess antioxidant effects that help in fighting throat infections and lessening the severity of upper respiratory tract infections ( [34](https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/eat-garlic-to-keep-respiratory-diseases-at-bay-175125/)). 3. Black Garlic May Have Anti-obesity Effect Animal studies have shown that black garlic extract could increase the anti-obesity and cholesterol-lowering effect of exercise, as the combination of exercise and black garlic demonstrated a considerable effect on decreasing epididymal fat, [visceral fat](https://ecosh.com/visceral-fat-why-is-visceral-fat-dangerous-to-you-and-12-tips-to-get-rid-of-it-naturally/), and liver weight ( [35](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332235936_Black_Garlic_and_Its_Therapeutic_Benefits)). 4. Black Garlic and Blood Sugar - Black Garlic May Help Manage Blood Sugar Levels Similarly, to raw garlic, due to the high number of polyphenols - black garlic may also help to manage [blood sugar](https://ecosh.com/blood-sugar-diabetes-hypoglycemia/) levels and therefore prevent complications related to [diabetes](https://ecosh.com/blood-sugar-diabetes-hypoglycemia/) ( [36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6014790/)). Lessening your blood sugar levels may help prevent severe health conditions, such as symptoms of diabetes, kidney problems, and many more. 5. Black Garlic and Liver Health - Black Garlic Supports Liver Function (Hepato-protective Effect) Your liver is an extremely vital organ which exerts protein biosynthesis, detoxicate and digestive biochemical production. However, your liver is at risk with alcohol, solvents, medications, chemicals, infection, and nutritional supplement. Luckily, black garlic may help better your liver health, as it has shown to protect the liver from harmful side effects including apoptosis and hepatotoxicity of anticancer medicines (cyclophosphamide). Studies indicate that black garlic supplement at the dose 200mg/kg body weight recovers the DNA damage, histological change, biochemical parameter alteration (aspartate the hepatic antioxidant enzyme levels. Therefore, black garlic can aid to lessen markers of liver injury following liver damage, rebalance liver cell size, and lower fatty deposits in the liver ( [32], [35]). 6. Black Garlic and Dyslipidemia - Black Garlic Lowers Your Cholesterol Levels Similarly, to fresh garlic, black garlic can also help lower your [cholesterol](https://ecosh.com/cholesterol-hdl-and-ldl-how-to-lower-your-bad-cholesterol-naturally/) levels and [triglyceride](https://ecosh.com/cholesterol-hdl-and-ldl-how-to-lower-your-bad-cholesterol-naturally/) levels ( [35](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332235936_Black_Garlic_and_Its_Therapeutic_Benefits), [ 38](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4317477/), [ 39](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11238803/)). 7. Black Garlic and Heart Health - Black Garlic Helps Keep Your Heart Healthy It is a known fact that fresh raw garlic has the ability to help improve heart health. But now we know that black garlic may possess the same protective and beneficial actions due to the positive effect on your cholesterol levels. Numerous studies support the long-term belief that garlic can improve circulatory and heart health by lowering blood [ cholesterol levels](https://ecosh.com/cholesterol-hdl-and-ldl-how-to-lower-your-bad-cholesterol-naturally/) (lowering low-density lipoprotein or bad cholesterol ( [LDL](https://ecosh.com/cholesterol-hdl-and-ldl-how-to-lower-your-bad-cholesterol-naturally/)) levels in the blood, thereby increasing circulating good cholesterol ( [HDL](https://ecosh.com/cholesterol-hdl-and-ldl-how-to-lower-your-bad-cholesterol-naturally/))), and acting as an [ antioxidant](https://ecosh.com/antioxidants-benefits-deficiency-causes-symptoms-and-antioxidant-rich-foods/) to protect blood vessels from [ free radical](https://ecosh.com/free-radical-damage-22-diseases-caused-by-free-radicals/) attacks. As cholesterol in the blood vessels decreases, the blood flow to the capillaries increases, and this in turn reduces the [blood pressure]and excessive blood clotting. Garlic also has the ability to remove toxic heavy metals from the colon. In addition, black garlic acts as a blood thinner, and thereby reduces the risk of stroke and heart attack ( [1]). 8. Black garlic and Cancer - Black Garlic May Fight Some Cancers Several studies demonstrate that the [antioxidant](https://ecosh.com/antioxidants-benefits-deficiency-causes-symptoms-and-antioxidant-rich-foods/) effects of black garlic block free radicals in your body and may therefore help to combat against cancer. It's because blocking [free radicals](https://ecosh.com/free-radical-damage-22-diseases-caused-by-free-radicals/) reduces [cell damage](https://ecosh.com/oxidative-stress-causes-symptoms-and-natural-home-remedies/) and may help to restrict the growth and possible spread of harmful cancer cells in the body ( [33](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24325061/), [ 35](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332235936_Black_Garlic_and_Its_Therapeutic_Benefits), [ 40](http://www.eurekaselect.com/60579/article)). 9. Black Garlic and Inflammation - Black Garlic Has Anti Inflammatory Effect Like its cousin fresh raw garlic, also black garlic can reduce inflammation. Moreover, the results of a study suggest that black garlic extract is an even more promising medicinal agent to prevent or cure inflammation-related diseases than raw garlic extract ( [35](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332235936_Black_Garlic_and_Its_Therapeutic_Benefits), [ 41](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25238199/)). 10. Black Garlic and Its Neuroprotective Effects Through its anti-amnesic effect, improvement of cognitive impairment, and prevention from neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation, black garlic may also have beneficial effects to your nerve system ( [35](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332235936_Black_Garlic_and_Its_Therapeutic_Benefits)). 11. Black Garlic and Brain Health Again, due to the high number of antioxidants, and inflammation reducing properties, black garlic may improve memory, and help prevent cognitive conditions such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease ( [32](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-black-garlic#1), [ 35](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332235936_Black_Garlic_and_Its_Therapeutic_Benefits)). 12. Black Garlic and Immune System - Black Garlic is Antiviral and Strengthens Your Immune System The antioxidants in black garlic also help improve your immune system and support your body in fighting infections and bacteria more effectively ( [1](https://www.abebooks.com/9780792236665/Desk-Reference-Natures-Medicine-Steven-0792236661/plp), [ 32](https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-black-garlic#1), [ 35](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332235936_Black_Garlic_and_Its_Therapeutic_Benefits)). 13. Black Garlic Has Antimicrobial Effects and it Helps Protect Your Body from Harmful Microorganisms, Microbiological Imbalance and Fungi Although black garlic has the lowest moisture content than raw garlic, it has the highest total amount of sugars, and energetic value as well as antioxidant and antimicrobial (particularly against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) activities. Therefore, active ingredients present in this miracle herb not only act against microbes, bacteria and fungi, but also protect against various parasites, yeast and viral infections. In addition, black garlic helps maintain the [ microbiological balance](https://ecosh.com/probiotics-40-health-benefits-of-probiotics-and-20-top-probiotic-foods/) in the gut, and supports your body during stress ( [1](https://www.abebooks.com/9780792236665/Desk-Reference-Natures-Medicine-Steven-0792236661/plp), [ 42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6600231/)). When Should You Eat More Black Garlic and in What Health Conditions Black Garlic May Help? If you have any of the following symptoms, try to eat more garlic to support your health: - Swelling of the lymphatic system - Inflammation - Facial nerve palsy - Ear pain - Postnasal drip syndrome - Headaches - Indigestion - Mouth ulcers - Enlarged spleen - All neurological symptoms, including nerve pain, itching, numbness, spasms, twitching, and tightness in the chest - Appendix infection - Difficulty breathing - Back pain - Bad breath - Cough - Chest pain - Hyperaemia - Floating in the eyes - Excessive mucus secretion - Fever - Tiredness - Liver stagnation - Neck pain - Nasal pain - In addition, [Candida](https://ecosh.com/vaginal-yeast-infection-in-women-causes-symptoms-and-treatment/)proliferation Natural [black garlic supplements with the second nature's miracle remedy chaga mushroom](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JCBMRTB?maas=maas_adg_F2820D697FA703941C569CBC38C53C29_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas) are available to purchase [ online](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JCBMRTB?maas=maas_adg_F2820D697FA703941C569CBC38C53C29_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas). Let's Also Talk About the Second Nature's Powerful Herbal Remedy - Chaga Mushroom [Chaga mushroom](https://ecosh.com/chaga-mushroom-inonotus-obliquus-9-incredible-evidence-based-potential-health-benefits-of-chaga-that-may-extend-your-life/) (Inonotus polypore, sterile conk trunk rot (of birch) is a medicinal fungus in the family Hymenochaetaceae. Medicinal funguses (mushrooms) are mainly used as dietary supplements in the form of powder or extracts to prevent, alleviate, or to heal diseases and/or for nutritional reasons. Chaga mushroom grows as a parasitic plant mainly on the bark of birch trees. Besides birch, chaga also likes to grow on alder, beech, common oak and other deciduous trees in Russia, Finland, North America, Eastern Europe and Japan at latitudes of 45 \u00b0 N-50 \u00b0 N. The Chaga mushroom, also called \"Mushroom of Immortality\" is the most nutritious wild mushroom that has been used in folk medicine to treat several disorders. [ Chaga](https://ecosh.com/chaga-mushroom-inonotus-obliquus-9-incredible-evidence-based-potential-health-benefits-of-chaga-that-may-extend-your-life/) is another extraordinarily powerful antioxidant that provides you with an impressive dose of [ antioxidants](https://ecosh.com/antioxidants-benefits-deficiency-causes-symptoms-and-antioxidant-rich-foods/), SOD enzymes, essential amino acids, [ minerals](https://ecosh.com/minerals-deficiency-signs-causes-risk-groups-and-natural-treatment/) and other vital substances. The cocktail of these extraordinary substances is claimed to boost your immune system, remove free radicals from your body, protect cells, enhance resistance, fight pathogens, lessen inflammation, have antitumor properties, prolong cellular proliferation and extend lifespan. For instance, in Estonian traditional texts, chaga is known as an anti-cancer herb, and it has been used to improve health for thousands of years. Research on the effects of chaga began a few hundred years ago, but it has been more intensely studied only for the past few decades. Natural [black garlic supplements with the second nature's miracle remedy chaga mushroom](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JCBMRTB?maas=maas_adg_F2820D697FA703941C569CBC38C53C29_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas) are available to purchase [ online](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JCBMRTB?maas=maas_adg_F2820D697FA703941C569CBC38C53C29_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas). Chaga Mushroom is Extremely Rich in Nutrients - The Full List of Vitamins, Minerals and Other Nutrients Contained in Chaga Mushroom One of the most important roles of chaga mushroom is to build your immune system (immune system builders are also called adaptogens) - and this is something we all need. Moreover, chaga contains extraordinary amounts of powerful [ antioxidants](https://ecosh.com/antioxidants-benefits-deficiency-causes-symptoms-and-antioxidant-rich-foods/), vitamins, as well as proteins, and may increase the activity of cancer killer cells by up to 300%. Chaga mushroom has also been shown to inhibit bacteria and viruses and have anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, chaga contains various natural adaptogenic substances, beta-glucans, betulinic acid, and 19 of the 20 amino acids humans need. Chaga mushrooms are rich in a variety of vitamins and minerals, such as [ B-complex vitamins](https://ecosh.com/b-vitamins-necessary-for-the-function-of-the-nervous-system-brain-and-cardiovascular-system/), [ vitamin D](https://ecosh.com/vitamin-d3-16-health-benefits-and-15-vitamin-d-rich-foods/), potassium, [ iron](https://ecosh.com/iron-deficiency-anemia-causes-and-12-main-symptoms-that-signal-iron-deficiency/), amino acids, and [ fiber](https://ecosh.com/fibres-11-health-benefits-of-eating-more-high-fibre-food/). Phytochemicals in chaga are excellent cancer fighters, blood glucose regulators, adrenal stimulants, [ bad cholesterol (LDL)](https://ecosh.com/cholesterol-hdl-and-ldl-how-to-lower-your-bad-cholesterol-naturally/) lowerers, and [ good cholesterol (HDL)](https://ecosh.com/cholesterol-hdl-and-ldl-how-to-lower-your-bad-cholesterol-naturally/) elevators, while regulating the whole endocrine system, breaking down and dissolving the film (a gel - like substance that is a by-product of certain viral and fungal activities), and destroying harmful fungi in the gut. Furthermore, chaga mushrooms also contain large amounts of a highly pure [antioxidant]called superoxide dismutase (SOD), which is important for liver cleansing. According to research, compounds from chaga do not attack pathogens directly, but instead stimulate your body to fight the available to purchase [ online](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JCBMRTB?maas=maas_adg_F2820D697FA703941C569CBC38C53C29_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas). Here is The Full List of The Nutrients and Active Ingredients in Chaga Mushroom: Vitamins contained in chaga: - B-complex vitamins such as: - Thiamine (Vitamin B1) - Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) - Niacin (Vitamin B3) - Vitamin D2 (Ergosterol) - B-complex vitamins such as: Minerals contained in chaga: - Iron - Calcium - Chloride - Sodium - Phosphorus - Magnesium - Manganese - Selenium - Zinc - Copper - Potassium - Rubidium - Cesium - Germanium Amino acids contained in chaga: - Arginine - Aspartic acid - Serine - 215 phytonutrients) and glyconutrients in chaga strengthen the immune system, serve as antioxidants, elevate cell-to-cell communication, enhance metabolism, repair DNA damage, detoxify and convert vitamin A (beta-carotene is metabolized to vitamin A). These phytonutrients and glyconutrients include nutrients such as for example: - Betulinic Acid (phytosterol) - Polysaccharides Lanosterol-type Triterpenes and Sterols. Triterpenes cardiovascular and immune system strengthening properties improve the ability to lower cholesterol levels, fight diseases and boost the elimination of foreign abnormal cells. - Saponins. These substances have been shown to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. - Inotodiol - Trametenolic Acid - Melanin. Melanin possesses high antioxidant and gene protective effects, so it improves the appearance of hair, skin and eyes, and brings back a more youthful look. - Flavonoids - Phenols - Enzymes - Potent antioxidants - Fiber - \u00df-glucan polysaccharides (beta-glucans). These substances increase the production of natural killer cells. These cells in your body are in charge of cellular mediated attack against infections and diseases. Beta-glucans also help your body identify cancer cells as foreign. - Polysaccharides. Polysaccharides deliver other nutrients to where they are needed most in your body to improve bioavailability and sustain optimum health and wellness. - Superoxide dismutase (SOD). Chaga mushrooms contain the highest amount of SOD found in any natural food. Some other foods like broccoli, wheatgrass, and certain cabbages also contain superoxide dismutase, but lower levels [7](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318527#Nine-potential-benefits), [26](https://immune-d.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/chagamushrooms.pdf)). What are Adaptogens? Adaptogens are natural stimulants that help your body adjust to chemical, biological or physical stress. Although scientists have not fully understood how adaptogens work, they are known to be effective - especially in balancing the hormonal system. Adaptogenic plants restore your body's balance, for instance in both cases of [ thyroid diseases](https://ecosh.com/thyroid-disease-symptoms-causes-risk-groups-and-treatment/) such as [ hyperthyroidism](https://ecosh.com/overactive-thyroid-hyperthyroidism-symptoms-causes-risk-groups-and-treatment/) or [ hypothyroidism](https://ecosh.com/underactive-thyroid-hypothyroidism-symptoms-causes-risk-groups-and-treatment/). They also help protect your body from the harmful effects of the environment, improve organ function and keep the body from abnormalities. In addition, adaptogens stimulate metabolism and allow your body to work in a sustainable and balanced mode (called homeostasis) that helps fight disease. 9 Health Benefits of Chaga Mushrooms - For Which Health Conditions Chaga May Help? Animal and test-tube studies have found that chaga mushrooms may have several health benefits for you. For instance, it may help to [ boost your immunity](https://ecosh.com/13-helpful-ways-and-16-top-healthy-foods-to-boost-your-immune-system-and-fight-off-disease/), lessen [ bad cholesterol](https://ecosh.com/cholesterol-hdl-and-ldl-how-to-lower-your-bad-cholesterol-naturally/), prevent long-term inflammation, fight cancer, lower [ blood sugar](https://ecosh.com/blood-sugar-diabetes-hypoglycemia/) levels and have an anti-aging effect. Nevertheless, more human studies are still required to confirm all these statements. 1. Chaga and Immune System - Chaga Mushrooms Improve Your Immunity and Fight Infections According to some animal and test-tube studies chaga extract can positively influence immunity by promoting the production of beneficial cytokines. These are the immune system's chemical messengers (proteins that help cells communicate with one another) that play an essential role in stimulating white blood cells. White blood cells are indispensable for fighting off damaging viruses and bacteria ( [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3774877/), [ 10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21820502)). Thereby chaga mushroom could be a great help in combating viruses and infections such as minor colds or severe illnesses. 2. Chaga and Inflammation - Chaga Mushroom Combats Chronic Inflammation Inflammation is not always a bad thing, as it is a natural response of your immune system that helps fight off infections, promote wound healing and protect against diseases. However, sometimes beneficial short-term inflammation can transit to long-term inflammation - a chronic health problem that is associated with severe conditions (particularly rheumatoid arthritis and heart disease). Some researchers suggest that inflammation may partly also contribute to depression. Moreover, inflammation is involved in at least 8 of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States today ( [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4361086/), [ 14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3285451/)). Luckily, according to some animal and test-tube studies, chaga's role in regulating cytokine formation may also help control inflammation ( [12](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2010/943516/), [ 13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22819687)). This suggests that chaga may have a vital part in healing inflammation caused conditions, [autoimmune disorders]and possibly also some other diseases. 3. Chaga Mushrooms May Relieve Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) In one animal study researchers concluded that chaga might be a useful supplement in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease, as it reduced inflammation and gut damage by inhibiting inflammatory cytokines ( [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22819687)). 4. Chaga and Cancer - Chaga Mushrooms May Help Prevent and Treat Cancer Due to the results of several animal and test-tube studies we have strong reason to believe that chaga may prevent and slow cancer growth. For example, in one study done in mice with cancer, supplementing chaga extract resulted in a 60% reduction in tumor size ( [15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19367670), [ 16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4946216/)). Moreover, similar results have been seen with cancer cells of the liver (hepatoma), breast, prostate, lung and colon also in humans ( [17], [18], [19], [20], [27]). What's noteworthy, is that in contrast to other conventional cancer treatments, chaga mushroom does not seem to damage healthy cells ( [23]). The anticancer effect of chaga may be partly due to its high amount of [ antioxidants](https://ecosh.com/antioxidants-benefits-deficiency-causes-symptoms-and-antioxidant-rich-foods/), which guard cells from [ oxidative stress](https://ecosh.com/oxidative-stress-causes-symptoms-and-natural-home-remedies/) which is one of the leading causes of cancer as well as other serious health problems ( [21](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27180084/)). Guided by these findings the researchers have concluded that continuous intake of the chaga extract may suppress tumor progression and could be used as a natural remedy for cancer suppression and general health care. However, although researchers are taking seriously the possibility that chaga may have anticancer potential, more human studies are still needed in order to make strong statements ( [22]). 5. Chaga and Blood Sugar - Chaga Mushrooms May Have a Positive Effect on Diabetes Chaga has been linked also to [ lower blood sugar](https://ecosh.com/blood-sugar-diabetes-hypoglycemia/) levels, so it may therefore help control [ diabetes](https://ecosh.com/blood-sugar-diabetes-hypoglycemia/). For example, in several animal studies done on diabetic mice or rats - the chaga extract reduced blood sugar levels and insulin resistance compared to those who did not receive the supplement. In one study chaga led to as much as 31% drop in blood sugar levels over 3 weeks. Moreover, chaga also protected the pancreas from the diabetes induced injuries or restored the damage of pancreas tissue ( [28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28087233), [ 29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18434051), [ 30](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28954386/), [ 31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4100277/), [ 32](https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=KR2007000481)).

Black Garlic and Chaga by Ecosh: - Is made from strong and clean plants grown in the wild forests of Estonia - one of the purest natures in the world. Chaga mushroom has been harvested from the mighty forests of Estonia, including the birches of the forests in Saaremaa. Mushrooms - which have grown naturally on trees strengthened by winds and storms for decades, or even centuries - are many times stronger than the chaga cultivated and grown by humans themselves. - Processing chaga or high temperatures destroy most of the medicinal benefits in this mushroom and render many enzymes like superoxide dismutase. However, in Ecosh Chaga and Black Garlic supplement the chaga is not processed in high temperatures and contains therefore all the healing effects. - Black garlic added to the product is pure garlic ecologically grown in Estonia. Garlic is cooked for 3 weeks at low temperature and high humidity. In this cooking method the garlic cloves turn black - hence the name black garlic.
