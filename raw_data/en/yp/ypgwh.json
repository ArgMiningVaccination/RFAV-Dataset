When I walked on stage for this year's Commencement, I felt tremen - dous pride for our graduates, the first to receive diplomas carrying the Einstein seal (page 4). This milestone fittingly occurred on the 60th anniversary of our initial graduating class (page 69). Our newest graduates are the best of the best, taught by a faculty doing outstanding work. A prime example is given in our cover story, \"The Search for Autism Therapies,\" which begins on page 16. It describes the research of Eric Hollander, M.D., a national leader in seeking new treatments for autism spectrum disorders, which affect 6,000 children in the Bronx and another 12 million nationwide. There are shock - ingly few treatments for autism symp - toms, which include an impaired ability to communicate and form social relationships. Dr. Hollander directs the Autism and Obsessive Compulsive Spectrum Program at Einstein and Montefiore, and he and his team are evaluating promising therapies. Another example of our outstand - ing research is a decade-long partner - ship to develop better treatments for bone-marrow and blood diseases that currently have low survival rates. The article \"Collaborating to Cure Cancers\" (page 32) describes the efforts of Amit Verma, M.B.B.S., and Ulrich Steidl, M.D., Ph.D., to cure syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia by finding their root causes. Our students are doing some great things as well. This year the student-run GORDON F . TOMASELLI, M.D. The Marilyn and Stanley M.

Dr. Cuervo is a leader in the field of autophagy, t he cellular-waste manage - ment process that is critical to human health. Among her early major discoveries, Dr. Cuervo found that autophagy is highly selective, not random as was previously thought. In addition, she and her collaborators discovered that specialized proteins guide old and damaged proteins to lysosomes for digestion, a process they dubbed \"chaperone-mediated autophagy.\" Dr. Cuervo also made the major finding that autophagy slows with age. Her current research focuses on developing therapies to restore autophagy, thereby preventing the accumulation of toxic protein by-products that can lead to age-related conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes. \"I'm very happy for the people in my lab. The team really deserved it\u2014 they are the ones who are driving the research,\" Dr. Cuervo says of her election, which was announced on April 30. Dr. Cuervo is a professor of developmental and molecular biology, of anatomy and structural biology and of medicine, and is the co-director of the Institute for Aging Research. She holds the Robert and Ren\u00e9e Belfer Chair for the Study of Neurodegenerative Diseases at Einstein. Michael deCastro Cabana, M.D., M.P.H. , has been named a p rofessor and the Michael I. Cohen, M.D., University Chair of Pediatrics at Einstein and physician-in-chief at Children's Hospital at Montefiore. Dr. Cabana was most recently a professor of pediatrics and of epidemiol - ogy and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), where he also served as the chief of the division of general pediatrics. He assumed his new role at Montefiore and Einstein in September. His research focuses on understanding New Chair of Pediatrics at Einstein and Montefiore and improving the diagnosis, preven - tion, and manage - ment of common childhood con - ditions such as pediatric asthma. He has conducted clinical trials on the effect of probiotics and prebiotics on asthma, infant colic, and growth. Dr. Cabana received his bachelor of arts degree magna cum laude in gov - ernment at Cornell University and his M.D. and M.A. at the combined- degree program at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and the Wharton School. He completed his residency at Johns Hopkins, where he received his master's degree in public health. Dr. Cabana completed his fellowship as a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar in 1999 before mov - ing to the University of Michigan and, later, UCSF . He is a member of the editorial board of The Journal of Pediatrics and edited the popular pediatric textbook The Five-Minute Pediatric Consult . He is currently serving a four-year term on the United States Preventive Services Task Force.NEWSCAMPUS 2 EINSTEIN : SUMMER/FALL 2019Leonard H.

Currently an associate professor of obstetrics & gyne - cology and women's health at Einstein and director of family planning and the fellowship in family planning at Montefiore, Dr. Benfield will report directly to Gordon Tomaselli, M.D., the Stanley and Marilyn Katz Dean at Einstein, in her new role. The creation of this position was the top recommendation of Einstein's Strategic Plan for Diversity and Inclusion, which reflected the input of more than 90 participants. The plan was First Diversity and Inclusion Chief Named CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta at Einstein's Commencement Sanjay Gupta, M.D ., CNN's chief medical correspondent and a practicing neurosurgeon, delivered the commencement address at Einstein's graduation ceremony on May 23, held at David Geffen Hall in Lincoln Center. Einstein conferred 156 M.D. and 31 Ph.D. degrees as it celebrated its 61st commencement. In addition, 16 graduates of Einstein's Medical Scientist T raining Program received both an M.D. and a Ph.D. degree. This year's ceremony was the first in which graduates received diplomas with the Einstein seal, after the College of Medicine was awarded independent degree-granting authority earlier this year. Dr. Gupta reported on the successful 27-hour surgical separation of conjoined twins Jadon and Anias McDonald at WATCH THE VIDEO See Dr. Gupta's commencement address: magazine.einstein.yu.edu/Gupta19Children's Hospital at Montefiore in 2016. His in-depth account of the boys' life before, during, and after their opera - tion won the News & Documentary Emmy Award for Outstanding Science, Medical, and Environmental Reporting in 2018. Einstein conferred an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters on him. Dr. Gupta told the graduates that \"there can be tremendous value in embracing fear\" and to challenge those who doubt their abilities: \"I'm talking about savoring it when someone tells you no, that it can't be done.

Dr. Benfield will work closely with them, as well as with Dorcas Lind, assistant vice president of diversity and inclusion at Montefiore. She received a bachelor's degree from Harvard College, an M.D. from the University of California, San Francisco, and a master's degree in public health from the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Benfield arrived at Einstein and Montefiore in 2011 following her fellowship. \"I was drawn to the diver - sity of the staff, faculty, and patients,\" she says. She started a diversity and inclusion group in her department and has focused on recruiting at the resident, fellow, and faculty level. Nationally, she co-chairs the diversity, equity, and inclusion group for the Society of Family Planning. 4 EINSTEIN : SUMMER/FALL 2019Forbes Ranks Einstein Among the Nation's Best Midsize Employers Einstein has been recognized by Forbes magazine as one of the country's best midsize employers in 2019. Forbes ranked Einstein in the top 200 overall nationally among midsize employers, and 3rd within the education category in New York State, 9th within the education category nationally, and 16th among all midsize employers with New York State headquarters. Forbes selected America's Best Employers based on an anony - mous, independent online survey of a diverse group of more than 50,000 full- and part-time employ - ees of midsize and large com - panies employing at least 1,000 people in their U.S. operations. Overall scores were based on a combination of two elements: employees' willingness, on a rating scale of 0 to 10, to recommend their employers to friends or fam - ily members, and their willingness to recommend other employers in their respective industries to acquaintances.When it comes to educa - tion, Einstein M.D./Ph.D. student Peter John knows what motivates students to learn. \"The most-effective lessons are intellectually engaging and entertaining. Electronic games are a good strategy for achieving both goals,\" he says. He wrote an essay about just that\u2014 \"Making It All Fun and Games in the Biomedical Sciences\"\u2014and submitted it earlier this year for consideration in the 2019 Lasker Foundation Essay Contest. He found out in July that his nearly 800-word essay had earned the top prize of $10,000, to be used for educational expenses. The rising sixth-year student, who studies cancer immunology in the lab of Xingxing Zang, Ph.D., proposed the creation of video games that would immerse young players in biomedical research, providing an instructive yet rewarding experience. Einstein M.D./Ph.D. Student Wins Lasker Essay Contest \"Video games have been effective for teaching other subjects, such as his - tory,\" Mr. John says. \"Thanks to new technologies, they have great potential for teaching science as well.\" He gives an example of teaching immunology by using a strategy-game format where players coordinate different types of immune cells to fight off pathogens. One of three co-winners of the essay contest, Mr. John also met the winners of the 2019 Lasker Award at a luncheon in New York City in September. The Lasker Awards have been given annu - ally since 1945 to recognize people who have made major contributions to bio - logical discoveries that improve human health; they are sometimes referred to as \"America's Nobels\" and have often iden - tified future winners of the Nobel Prize.

Katz Dean at Einstein from 1984 to 2004, died on May 16, 2019, at the age of 92. Dr. Purpura joined Einstein in 1967 as a professor and the chair of anatomy. In 1969, he was appointed the scientific director of Einstein's Rose F . Kennedy Center, which focuses on research into the causes of intellectual and develop - mental disabilities; he was named the center's director in 1972. T wo years later, he founded the department of neuroscience, which was named in his honor in 2006. PIONEERING NEUROSCIENTIST In presenting Dr. Purpura with the 1996 Presidential Award from the Society for Neuroscience, Dr. Pasko Rakic noted that Dr. Purpura \"was a neuroscientist before the word 'neuroscience' was invented to denote our multidisciplinary field.\" Dr. Purpura's exceptional contribu - tions span the field and had a significant impact on a range of conditions, includ - ing epilepsy and developmental disabili - ties. Dr. Purpura served for 30 years as editor-in-chief of Brain Research , and held leadership roles in numerous pro - fessional organizations, including presi - dent of the American Epilepsy Society and of the Society for Neuroscience. He also was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and was one of just two scientists in the nation to receive an inaugural National Medical Research Award, bestowed at a White House ceremony in September 1988. DEANSHIP AT EINSTEIN After Dr. Purpura served as dean at Stanford's School of Medicine for two years, Einstein recruited him to come back to the Bronx as dean in 1984. His vision and leadership positioned the College of Medicine as the educational hub of a network of major hospitals. During his tenure, Einstein became the first private medical school in New York City to establish a department of family medicine. He also established an academic department of emergency medicine to complement Montefiore's. \"Dr. Purpura revolutionized the way medical education was taught,\" says Edward R. Burns, M.D., executive dean at Einstein. \"He recognized that students could more successfully retrieve long-term memories of the science they learned when it was taught by great teachers who informed them broadly, rather than by research experts who focused more narrowly on their own particular lab work, as was the tradition at medical schools at the time.\" This new approach was adopted by medical schools across the nation. In the commencement address he gave upon his retirement, Dr. Purpura said, \"It is no secret that Einstein graduates are among the most effective and skilled interns and residents in any program. ... I predict you will be a joy to your attend - ings and a savior to your patients.\" \"Dr. Purpura revolutionized the way medical education was taught. \" \u2014 DR. EDWARD R.

She is a gynecologic oncologist and translational researcher who has published and lectured widely on cancer therapeutics. Dr. Makhija joined Montefiore- Einstein in 2015, after holding leadership positions at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Emory University, and the University of Louisville. 8 EINSTEIN : SUMMER/FALL 2019You have a Southern accent. Where is it from? My parents are from India and completed graduate school in the United States. My dad accepted a teaching position in Alabama, where I was born and raised. Did your parents influence your career? My dad was a college chemistry pro - fessor, my mom a high school biology teacher. At dinnertime, we would talk about the day's events and how we could make things better for others. I try to bring the same approach to department meetings. You can get a bit removed from day-to-day clinical practice as you move along the administrative path, so I feel it's important to communicate and connect often with others. Tell us about your work in India. I worked with Tata Hospital and its oncologists to improve cervical cancer care. Though it is a preventable disease and the early stages are treatable, barriers to accessing care in rural India often lead to diagnoses at incurable, late stages. Most women can't afford to spend days traveling to a clinic, and a cancer diag - nosis carries a social stigma for women that can lead to abandonment. For social survival, women often ignore both cancer symptoms and attending to basic healthcare needs. It was a valuable lesson on the importance of taking culture into account in healthcare delivery. Does that experience inform your work here in the Bronx? Yes. Patients often can't keep appoint - ments for social and financial reasons. Having a diverse faculty helps bring awareness of cultural issues to the fore - front of how we deliver care.What was your role in the HPV vaccine trials? Our research team collaborated with Merck & Co. to enroll patients into trials at UAB. We noted flaws in the trial design and helped Merck revise the trials to better enroll patients and address the vaccine's clinical impact. As the top recruiter, I was the lead author. We also helped educate physicians and patients about the vaccine. Why did you get an executive M.B.A. degree? In 2008, when I was recruited as divi - sion chief of gynecologic oncology at Emory University, all budgets were cut by a third because of the financial crisis. While trying to convince the finance team that we needed more resources for clinical research programs, I realized we weren't speaking the same language. I visited Emory's Goizueta Business School and enrolled in the executive M.B.A. program to learn accounting and finance. But most important was what I learned about organizational behavior and the complexities of human behavior. What attracted you to Einstein and Montefiore? I knew about Einstein's reputation for research, which has always been an important part of my career. As I learned more about Montefiore, I was drawn to its dedication to the social aspects of care. I haven't seen this level of commit - ment at any other place I've worked. What has been your biggest challenge in your department? Changing the culture in delivering care. It is easy to say, \"We have always done it this way, and we are pretty good at it.\" What matters is whether we're making an impact. If not, we should be asking, \"How can we do better?\" We initiated monthly meetings with the leadership quality and safety team to address prob - lems\u2014not to assign blame, but rather to observe patterns and find solutions. What has been the reaction? Changing culture is disruptive. We reminded ourselves of our mission to improve the care we deliver and recruited faculty who align with this mission. Our relationship with Every Mother Counts, a nonprofit focused on respectful maternal care, has broadened our knowledge of patients' needs. We will always strive to improve\u2014and this year, for the first time, our department was nationally ranked in U.S. News and World Report , a testament to our dedi - cated and caring faculty and associates. Are you taking advantage of the recent affiliation between Einstein and Montefiore? We encourage our faculty to become more involved in research at Einstein. We have an established collaboration with colleagues in molecular pharmacol - ogy and, most recently, in genetics. I see a direct benefit in learning from one another to improve the health of our patients. How did you become a movie producer? A neighbor asked me about a Bollywood actress for a movie she was producing. It's based on the true and fascinating story of undercover female spies for the British during World War II. I created a produc - tion company, and the movie, Libert\u00e9: A Call to Spy , is my first project. It pre - miered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in June 2019.

The study included adults of both sexes and revealed substantial differences between them. The findings mark a major milestone in the field of \"connectomics\"\u2014the effort to map the myriad neural connections in a brain, brain region, or nervous system to find the specific nerve connections responsible for particular behaviors. \"Structure is always central in biology,\" says study leader Scott Emmons, Ph.D., professor of genetics and in the Dominick P . Purpura Department of Neuroscience and the Siegfried Ullmann Chair in Molecular Genetics at Einstein. \"The structure of DNA revealed how genes work, and the structure of proteins revealed how enzymes function. Now the structure of the nervous system is revealing how animals behave and how neural connections go wrong to cause disease,\" Dr. Emmons says. Researchers have hypothesized that some neurological and psychiatric disor - ders, such as schizophrenia and autism, (302 in the hermaphrodite/ female sex, 385 in the male) makes it one of the best animal models for understanding the billions-times-more-complex human brain. It was also the first multi-cellular organism to have its entire genome sequenced. Dr. Emmons' study builds on the groundbreaking work of the late South African-born biolo - gist Sydney Brenner, who in 2002 shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his C. elegans research. Dr. Brenner's laboratory published the first map of the C. elegans nervous system in 1986, after painstak - ingly analyzing neural structures visible on thousands of serial electron micrographs. That tour de force effort, 20 years in the making, launched the field of connectomics and established the roundworm as an essential animal model for studying biol - ogy and human disease. \"Since the roundworm nervous sys - tem contains many of the same mol - ecules as the human nervous system, what we learn about the former can help us understand the latter,\" says Dr. Emmons, who is currently studying how the roundworm connectome is encoded by its genome.

The drug, rimegepant, may offer advan - tages over currently available migraine medications. The study's first author was Richard B. Lipton, M.D., the Edwin S. Lowe Chair and vice chair of the Saul R. Korey Department of Neurology at Einstein and director of the Montefiore Headache Center. Currently, many people with migraine take triptan drugs (such as sumatriptan, eletriptan, and rizatriptan), New Acute-Migraine Therapy Shows Promise which wer e introduced in the 1990s. People not helped by triptans, or who can't take them, may benefit from the new class of drugs called gepants, which includes rimegepant. Gepants work by targeting the receptors for a small protein, called CGRP , long implicated in migraine. During migraine attacks, CGRP is released, resulting in pain. Gepants relieve the pain and other symptoms of migraine by blocking the CGRP pathway. Rimegepant was assessed in a ran - domized, double-blind trial involving more than 1,000 men and women with migraine at 49 centers in the United States. Each participant took a tablet of rimegepant or a matching placebo How Lupus Occurs in the Braintablet during a migraine attack. T wo hours after taking their tablets, 19.6% of patients in the rimegepant group were free from pain, compared with 12% in the placebo group\u2014a statistically sig - nificant difference. Freedom from their most bothersome symptoms occurred in 37.6% of patients in the rimegepant group and 25.2% in the placebo group. Patients with the autoimmune dis - ease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have poor outcomes despite aggressive treatment with immunosup - pressive drugs. In a study published this past June in JCI Insight , Chaim Putterman, M.D., and colleagues identi - fied how SLE develops in the central nervous system (CNS) independent of its occurrence elsewhere in the body. The scientists found that the immune system forms a tertiary lymphoid struc - ture\u2014which functions like a lymph node\u2014deep within the brain. The newly discovered structure may be the route through which the immune sys - tem promotes CNS lupus. The find - ings may lead to new therapies for CNS lupus, which is extremely difficult to treat. Dr. Putterman is a professor of medicine and of microbiology & immu - nology at Einstein and chief of rheuma - tology at Einstein and Montefiore. MAGAZINE.EINSTEIN.YU.EDU 11Lab Chat Helena M. Blumen, Ph.D. , is a cognitive neuroscientist who studies the brain networks we use to walk, reason, make decisions, and form memories. An assistant professor in the department of medicine and in the Saul R. Korey Department of Neu - rology, Dr. Blumen was born in Sweden, came to the United States to attend college, and landed at Einstein in 2013, after completing a postdoctoral fellowship at Columbia University Medical Center. What is your research focus? I'm interested in optimizing gait and cognition in older people. My colleagues and I view cognition and mobility\u2014 particularly in the elderly\u2014as being closely related. For older people, walk - ing is not so automatic as it was when they were young, and they have to think about the steps they're taking. So walk - ing becomes a cognitive task that relies on the same or similar brain networks as cognitive processes such as memory and attention. Our studies will inves - tigate whether training older people to improve their gait can also improve their cognitive processes, and vice versa. If you had to focus on improving just one\u2014gait or cognition\u2014which would you choose? I'd say improving gait. It would improve cognition as well. Plus, when brain function declines in the elderly, gait problems usually precede cognitive decline and dementia. So improving someone's gait could conceivably help delay cognitive difficulties. What do you especially like about working with older people? The people who participate in our stud - ies are very happy to be here and excited about being involved in research. And from our perspective, we really value the research data they provide. What's your opinion of brain- training programs, such as Lumosity or CogniFit? I think some of them have potential, but we don't know yet if they work. I'm now involved in two trials that are assessing whether behavioral interventions can help. One is an imagery study in which we teach older people to imagine themselves walking. The idea is that imagin - ing walking will stimulate the brain regions involved in actual walking and improve walk - ing ability\u2014and, by extension, cognitive processes as well. This might especially help people who are frail and not able to get outside. The other trial is comparing social dancing with treadmill exercising with respect to gait and cognitive outcomes. Where in Sweden are you from? I was born in the town of Lule\u00e5, a couple of hours by car from the Arctic Circle. Did you ski there?

The viruses are the tick-borne Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and three hantaviruses, which are spread by rodents: Andes virus, Sin Nombre virus, and Puumala virus. The NIAID has designated all except the Puumala virus as category A agents\u2014emerging infectious diseases or pathogens that pose the highest risk to national security and public health. Other participating institutions are the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Mapp Biopharmaceutical, the University of Texas at Austin, and Adimab, a biotech company. Dr. Chandran is a professor of microbiology & immunology and the Harold and Muriel Block Faculty Scholar in Virology at Einstein.Focusing on Post-HIV Problems The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has awarded Kathryn Anastos, M.D., and Anjali Sharma, M.D., a seven-year, $23 million grant to study HIV and the chronic illnesses that often accompany HIV infection, including cardiovascular and lung disease, diabe - tes, and cancer. The multicenter trial merges two existing studies that for decades have followed women and men who are HIV positive or at risk for HIV infection. The team will enroll 2,500 new participants as well. Researchers will also study disease-related outcomes such as heart attacks and strokes, con - duct neuropsychiatric testing to assess cognition, and administer detailed psychiatric evaluations. Dr. Anastos is a professor of medicine, of epidemiology & population health, and of obstet - rics & gynecology and women's health at Einstein and a general internist at Montefiore. Dr. Sharma is an associate professor of medicine at Einstein and an internist and infectious-disease physi - cian at Montefiore. Obesity and Hypertension Dongsheng Cai, M.D., Ph.D., received two NIH grants totaling $4.5 million to study the role of the hypothalamus in obesity and hypertension. Dr. Cai has found that sustained activation of astrocytes (cells that surround and sup - port neurons) may contribute to the metabolic dysregulation and subsequent weight gain caused by pro-inflammatory signaling in the hypothalamus. He was awarded a four-year, $2 million grant to study how hypothalamic astrocytes are altered in inflammation and how those altered astrocytes influence hypothalamic neurons to dysregulate metabolism. Evi- dence also indicates that inflammation- induced activation of hypothalamic astrocytes plays a role in obesity-related hypertension (OHT), which accounts for 75% of hypertension cases and is dif - ficult to control. The second grant, for $2.5 million over four years, sponsors Dr. Cai's research into how the astrocyte- neuron relationship in obesity contrib - utes to OHT. Dr. Cai is a professor of molecular pharmacology at Einstein. MAGAZINE.EINSTEIN.YU.EDU 13 RESEARCH NOTES RESEARCH NOTES MAJOR NIH RESEARCH AWARDS A Potential Path to an HIV Cure Curing HIV-infected individuals has not been possible because neither the human immune system nor antiretroviral therapy can eliminate cells that are latently infected with HIV. These cells become reactivated and reintroduce systemic infection when treatment is halted. The NIAID awarded Harris Goldstein, M.D., and Steven Almo, Ph.D., a five-year, $4.2 million grant to develop novel immu - nomodulatory biologics to precisely and markedly expand HIV-specific CD8+ (\"killer\") T cells to target and elimi - nate latent HIV-infected CD4+ T cells intentionally reactivated to make them \"visible\" to the CD8+ cells. The novel treatment strategy could lead to long- lasting HIV remission or even a func - tional cure for HIV infection.

Antiretroviral therapies don't completely relieve the inflammation or reduce brain dam - age\u2014and opioid abuse makes things worse. The National Institute on Drug Abuse has awarded Joan W. Berman, Ph.D., and Harris Goldstein, M.D., a five-year, $4.2 million grant to investi - gate molecular mechanisms that worsen HIV-related inflammation in people who abuse opioids. By analyzing HIV and opioid-induced gene-expression changes, they hope to identify new drugs to quell HIV-caused brain inflammation.

Karpas Chair in Medicine, and the senior academic adviser to the Sue Golding Graduate Division of Biomedical Sciences. Dr. Goldstein is a professor of pediatrics and of microbi - ology & immunology and the Charles Michael Chair in Autoimmune Diseases.Targeting Signals in Alzheimer's Diminished somatotropic signaling (i.e., signaling that stimulates body growth) leads to delayed aging and longer life spans in both model organisms and peo - ple. Centenarians, in fact, have several mutations that weaken somatotropic signaling. Sofiya Milman, M.D., has received a five-year, $4 million grant from the National Institute on Aging to identify genes and gene functions that inhibit growth-related signaling. She and her colleagues will study participants in Einstein's LonGenity study\u2014a cohort of 1,400 older adults, half of them the offspring of centenarians. The researchers will investigate the role that somatotropic signaling plays in the brains of aging humans. They hope to identify mecha - nisms that confer cognitive resilience by delaying aging\u2014findings that could lead to therapies to help protect against Alzheimer's and other aging-associated diseases. Dr. Milman is an associate professor of medicine and of genetics at Einstein and an attending physician in medicine at Montefiore. 14 EINSTEIN : SUMMER/FALL 2019 Unraveling the B-Cell Response Against TB The bacterial species Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) caused 1.6 mil - lion tuberculosis-related deaths in 2017, according to the World Health Organization. Infection triggers a well- studied T-cell response against Mtb, but the B-cell immune response that leads to antibody production is not clearly understood. John Chan, M.D., received a five-year, $3.5 million grant from the NIAID to investigate IgM antibod - ies\u2014the first antibodies that respond to infection\u2014and their role in the host immune response to Mtb. Dr. Chan and colleagues will use mouse and ex vivo macaque tuberculosis (TB) models to better understand the role and impor - tance of IgM in immune regulation during the early and chronic stages of TB. Findings from this study may lead to novel therapies against TB infection. Dr. Chan is a professor of medicine and of microbiology & immunology at Einstein and an attending physician in infectious diseases at Montefiore. MS Patients, Mobility, and Falls Impaired mobility is the most obvious symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS), and falls are common. The life expec - tancy of MS patients has increased, but studies on mobility and falls among older MS patients are scarce. Research by Roee Holtzer, Ph.D., suggests that the integrity and proper functioning of the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex, are critical for cognitive control of mobility. He has received a five-year, $3.5 million grant from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke to identify brain systems governing mobility in older adults (120 MS patients and 120 controls) to determine whether brain function during active walking can predict falls. Neuroimaging techniques will measure prefrontal cortex activity and assess the brain's structural integrity. The findings may identify biomarkers that can be modified to prevent falls. Dr. Holtzer is a professor in the Saul R. Korey Department of Neurology at Einstein. Sleep and Cognitive Decline Disturbed sleep is common among older adults and may lead to cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. Carol A. Derby, Ph.D., has received a four-year, $4 mil - lion grant from the National Institute on Aging to partner with the ongoing Einstein Aging Study (EAS) to examine the association between sleep patterns and cognition in 500 older Bronx adults. The research will be a collaboration with Pennsylvania State University profes - sor Orfeu Buxton, Ph.D. In Dr. Derby's project, EAS participants will wear special watches to collect daily informa - tion on sleep and will wear devices to measure their oxygen levels overnight. The data may reveal sleep's impact on cognition and suggest strategies for pre - venting cognitive decline. Dr. Derby is a research professor in the Saul R. Korey Department of Neurology and in the department of epidemiology & popula - tion health and is the Louis and Gertrude Feil Faculty Scholar in Neurology at Einstein. MAGAZINE.EINSTEIN.YU.EDU 1516 EINSTEIN : SUMMER/FALL 2019Carlos Rodriguez of the Bronx seemed like a healthy, happy baby. But as his first birthday approached, he began to scream and cry at the slightest provocation. His \"twos\" were particularly terrible. While his peers were learning to talk, Carlos communicated only by grunting and pointing. Even worse, he would throw tantrums, banging his head against anything and everything. The family's pediatrician suspected a serious developmental problem and referred Carlos to Children's Hospital at Montefiore. There he was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and received the latest behavioral, educational, and medical therapies. The interventions got him talking, if sparingly, and enabled him to attend a mainstream school with special services. Carlos has a loving home, a supportive school, and top-notch specialty care\u2014yet these are not enough. Now 14, he avoids eye contact, can't tolerate busy or noisy environments, doesn't take part in sports, and abhors the slightest deviation from his daily routine. At home he prefers being alone in his room, watching YouT ube videos and playing with T ransformers, his favorite toys. Six thousand children who live in the Bronx and another 12 million nationwide fall some - where on the autism spectrum. Only a small per - centage will successfully outgrow their diagnoses (see related article on page 26). From cannabis to whipworms, scientifically promising treatments are being tested at Einstein and Montefiore BY GARY GOLDENBERGThe Search for Autism Therapies At left, Carlos and his mom, Maribel, enjoy a day at a playground in the Bronx. MAGAZINE.EINSTEIN.YU.EDU 17The U.S. Food and Drug Admin - istration (FDA) has approved only two drugs for ASD: the drugs risperidone and aripripazole, both for treating ASD-related irritability. But no treatments exist for the core symp - toms of ASD: deficits in social interac - tion and communication, repetitive behaviors, restricted interests, and diffi - culty with new situations. That absence of therapies has created desperation. \"We know that parents are trying all kinds of alternative therapies on their children who have ASD,\" says Eric Hollander, M.D., professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Einstein and director of the Autism and Obsessive Compulsive Spectrum Program at Einstein and Montefiore. \"One of our goals is to subject potential therapies to the rigor of solid scientific research so we can inform parents and clinicians about the therapies' usefulness.\" For the past two decades, Dr. Hollander has been a national leader in the search for new ASD treatments. In research published in 2005, he and his colleagues were the first to assess fluoxetine (Prozac) for relief of ASD symptoms. Their placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, involving 45 chil - dren and adolescents with ASD, found that low-dose liquid Prozac was more effective than a placebo in reducing Filling the Treatment VoidTHE SEARCH FOR AUTISM THERAPIES repetitive behaviors in particular and ASD-symptom severity in general. In a 2012 study, they found similar results in adults. Prozac is now one of the most commonly used treatments for ASD. \"Prozac seemed worth investigat - ing,\" Dr. Hollander says. \"The drug influences brain levels of serotonin, and serotonin dysregulation appears to be common in people with ASD. Plus, Prozac and other SSRIs [selective sero - tonin reuptake front - line treatments for disorders that\u2014like ASD\u2014can involve repetitive behaviors. But not all patients with ASD respond to Prozac, and not everyone tolerates it, so we decided to test other treatments.\"\"One of our goals is to subject potential therapies to the rigor of solid scientific research so we can inform parents and clinicians about the therapies' usefulness.\" \u2014 DR. ERIC HOLLANDER 18 EINSTEIN : SUMMER/FALL 2019People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have trouble communicating and forming social relationships, and they may also have restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. These symptoms impair their ability to function well in school, work, and other areas of life. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that ASD affects 1 in 59 children in the United States, primarily boys, with the initial signs and symptoms usually appearing in the first two years of life. ASD is called a \"spectrum\" disorder because of the wide variation in the type and severity of its symptoms. Roughly 40% of in - dividuals with ASD have intellectual disability (defined as an IQ of less than 70), but many have normal to above-average intelligence, and some have exceptional abilities. There's no single cause of ASD. Research suggests that the disorder often develops from a combination of genetic and environ - mental influences that affect critical aspects of early brain development\u2014particularly how neurons or entire brain regions communicate with one another. Becoming a parent at an older age increases the risk of having a child with ASD. Complications related to preg - nancy, such as extreme prematurity, low birth weight, and closely spaced pregnancies, can also increase the risk. Vaccines do not affect the risk of developing ASD. ASD is usually treated with early- intervention services, which include a mix of speech and occupational therapies and applied behavior analysis (the main evidence-based treatment for ASD).

Considerable evidence, from animal and human studies, suggests that ASD is accompanied by overexcitation of the brain's neural circuits, due to either an increase in excitatory neuron signaling or a decrease in inhibitory signaling. \"This E/I imbalance alters the way the brain processes information and regulates behavior,\" Dr. Hollander says. \"The imbalance triggers seizures, and we believe it's also responsible for the core ASD symptoms that we can't treat effectively yet. So we look for interven - tions that show promise for correcting the E/I imbalance and, hopefully, easing the symptoms of people with ASD.\" As his colleague Bonnie P . Taylor, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Einstein, puts it: \"We're open to testing therapies that look promising. New therapies for kids who have ASD are urgently needed. So if there's a rationale for a treatment and we're confident that it's safe, we'll figure out a way to develop a trial.\"Righting an Imbalance THE SEARCH FOR AUTISM THERAPIES EASING IRRITABILITY Risperidone and aripripazole have been approved by the FDA for treating irritability related to ASD. Both were originally approved as antipsychotic medications and can have serious side effects, including significant weight gain. Dr. Hollander realized that valproate, a drug approved for treating seizures in epilepsy, might be a better alternative. For one thing, valproate may normal - ize the E/I balance, since it appears to work by raising levels of gamma amin - obutyric acid, a neurotransmitter that inhibits neuron signaling in the brain. And in studies involving other condi - tions, the drug relieved symptoms also found in ASD\u2014reducing aggression in people with borderline personality disorder, for example. Similar drugs have proved to be useful in treating disorders with repetitive and impulsive features, such as compulsive gambling and binge eating. Dr. Hollander and his colleagues have conducted two randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials assess - ing valproate's effectiveness in treat - ing ASD patients, primarily children and adolescents. Both trials found that valproate was significantly more effec - tive than a placebo in relieving repetitive behaviors and irritability and agitation in people with ASD. Valproate, however, is no panacea for those symptoms. It can have significant side effects of its own, including weight gain, liver inflamma - tion, and tremor. At right, a child who has autism works on an IQ test at the Einstein campus under the supervision of Dr. Bonnie P . Taylor. 20 EINSTEIN : SUMMER/FALL 2019MAGAZINE.EINSTEIN.YU.EDU 21Oxytocin is a pitui - tary gland. It floods the bloodstreams of mothers giving birth, facilitating uterine contractions and stimulating milk letdown for breast- feeding. Oxytocin also plays a crucial role in so-called affiliative behaviors: It helps initiate the emotional bond between mother and infant, for exam - ple, and enhances the social attachments connecting friends and lovers. In the 1990s, several researchers pro - posed that abnormalities in the oxytocin system might play a role in ASD, which typically involves poor social skills. Dr. Hollander was the first to study that possibility, in a double-blind, placebo- controlled trial whose results were published in 2003. His oxytocin-related research led directly to a phase 2 clini - cal trial now evaluating the first drug designed specifically to treat ASD. \"Studying oxytocin made sense to us,\" Dr. Hollander says. \"It had poten - tial for improving the social deficits that are a core symptom of ASD. And it might help correct the E/I imbalance in ASD, since one of its modes of action involves strengthening signals sent by inhibitory neurons.\" Dr. Hollander's clinical trials have found that oxytocin significantly reduced repetitive behaviors in people \"Oxytocin had potential for improving the social deficits that are a core symptom of ASD.\" A Drug Tailor-Made for ASD THE SEARCH FOR AUTISM THERAPIES \u2014 DR. ERIC HOLLANDER 22 EINSTEIN : SUMMER/FALL 2019with ASD and made them better aware of social cues in conversation. But administering oxytocin is difficult: The protein must usually be given intrave - nously or intranasally, since it's broken down in the gut when swallowed. To get around that problem, the Swiss phar - maceutical company Roche designed an oral ASD drug that boosts oxytocin's effectiveness by blocking a chemical competitor called vasopressin. Oxytocin and vasopressin have a lot in common. The structurally similar peptide hormones are both released by the pituitary gland, and both strengthen social bonds by binding to the same receptors in the brain\u2014but oxytocin is considered more helpful. Balovaptan, the drug developed by Roche chemists, prevents vasopressin from binding to a type of vasopres - sin receptor called V1a. By blocking vasopressin, balovaptan allows oxytocin molecules to bind to those receptors unchallenged\u2014and, it is hoped, will help people with ASD become more socially engaged. Balovaptan has already been shown to improve social behavior and reduce cognitive impairment in an animal model of ASD and in adult ASD patients. In 2018, the FDA granted bal - ovaptan \"breakthrough therapy\" status, a process in which the agency speeds its review of drugs that \"demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy\" for treating serious conditions. Dr. Hollander is now leading Einstein's participation in a nationwide clinical trial of balovaptan. This phase 2 (safety and efficacy) trial, called the aV1ation Study, will include 300 high- functioning children and teens with ASD at 30 sites around the country. Participants will take either of two doses of the drug or a placebo for 24 weeks. Over the past several decades, parents and physicians have observed that some children with ASD improve when they have a fever, only to regress afterward. Those anecdotes suggest that an inter - vention that duplicates a fever might also calm ASD symptoms\u2014 and perhaps provide insight into ASD's underlying causes as well. Hence an experimental therapeu - tic trial using the pig whipworm Trichuris suis made sense. \"Fevers are typically a re - sponse to inflammation and immune-system arousal,\" says Eric Hollander, M.D., who leads the Einstein-Montefiore effort to find new ASD therapies. \"Previous trials had suggested that T. suis infections in people can tamp down those processes, both of which are overactive in ASD. T. suis seems to reduce inflamma - tion by normalizing the excitatory/ inhibitory balance in nerve signal - ing, which we consider essential for effective ASD therapies.\"FEVERS, WHIPWORMS, AND THE ROOT CAUSES OF AUTISM Dr. Hollander and his col - leagues carried out a double- blind, 12-week crossover trial involving 10 young adults with ASD. Half the participants first swallowed 2,500 whipworm eggs every two weeks for 12 weeks and then took a matching placebo for the next 12 weeks. The other five participants were treated in re - verse order\u2014first the placebo and then the whipworm eggs. (When people swallow whipworm eggs, the worms that develop can't penetrate the human intestine and don't cause illness.) During the study, clinicians and parents as - sessed the participants for inflex - ibility, social withdrawal, and other behaviors associated with ASD. Results were reported in 2018 in The World Journal of Biological Psychiatry . Overall, differences between the two groups were not statistically significant, but par - ticipants treated with whipworm eggs did show large reductions of repetitive behavior and irritability. MAGAZINE.EINSTEIN.YU.EDU 23A Marijuana Extract for Autism THE SEARCH FOR AUTISM THERAPIES 24 EINSTEIN : SUMMER/FALL 2019More than 100 chemicals known as cannabinoids are found in cannabis plants, including marijuana and hemp. In 1964, researchers identified terrahydro - cannabinol (THC) as the cannabinoid responsible for marijuana's \"high.\" This finding revealed an important signaling system in the brain\u2014one that regulates such physiological and cogni - tive processes as appetite, stress, mood, memory, social behavior, and pain sensation. THC activates this signaling system by binding directly to receptors in the brain. The human body was later found to produce its own cannabinoids, dubbed \"endocannabinoids,\" which are involved in what is called the \"endocan - nabinoid signaling system.\" Recent studies involving animal models suggest that disrupted endocan - nabinoid signaling may play a role in ASD. For example, in a study published earlier this year, Stanford researchers found that the blood plasma of chil - dren with ASD contained significantly lower levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide compared with levels in neurotypical children. In keep - ing with its outside-the-box approach, Dr. Hollander's team is investigating whether cannabinoids might relieve chil - dren's ASD symptoms by normalizing endocannabinoid signaling. The Einstein team has focused on a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid called cannabidivarin (CBDV), whose molecular structure that of cannabidiol (CBD)\u2014the popular nonpsychoactive cannabinoid now being sold online and over the counter in tinctures, oils, and lotions for conditions ranging from anger to Alzheimer's. Unlike THC, CBD and CBDV don't seem to bind directly to endocannabinoid receptors, but they nevertheless produce important effects. In two of the few trials that have evaluated CBD in people, New York University (NYU) scientists found that the compound significantly reduced seizure frequency in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, two rare forms of epilepsy with similarities to ASD. In 2018 the FDA approved Epiodolex, the liquid CBD formulation used in the epilepsy trials, for treating those conditions. CBD's antiseizure properties suggest that CBD and CBDV may both help to correct the E/I imbalance observed in people with ASD. Preliminary studies have found that CBDV is effective in treating pediatric epilepsy, and animal studies suggest it could be valuable for treating ASD. \"The research shows that CBDV has anti-inflammatory, immune- modulating, anticon - vulsant Dr. Hollander says. \"And in one recent study, CBDV improved social behavior in an animal model of Rett syndrome, an autism- related condition. So CBDV appears to be a promising ASD treatment that we need to explore further.\" Last year, the Department of Defense (DoD) awarded researchers at Einstein, Montefiore, and the NYU School of Medicine a $1.3 million grant to study the safety and efficacy of CBDV in chil - dren with ASD. Dr. Hollander is leading the study along with NYU's Orrin Devinsky, M.D., who conducted the CBD epi - lepsy trials. The hope is that CBDV can help with \"protest behavior\"\u2014the sud - den temper tantrums that often plague people with ASD, particularly those with severe symptoms.\"This research shows that CBDV has anti-inflammatory, immune-modulating, properties.\" \u2014 DR. ERIC HOLLANDER MAGAZINE.EINSTEIN.YU.EDU 25According to a new study from researchers at Einstein and Montefiore\u2014the largest of its kind, with the most rigorous diagnostic follow-up\u2014the answer is a qualified \"yes.\" A small minority of children with an initial diagnosis of ASD no longer qualify for it later on, yet most of them still have difficulties that require therapeutic and educational support. \"It's certainly encouraging to confirm that a subset of children with early ASD diagnosis can in essence recover from the disorder and go on to have typical social and cognitive functioning,\" says lead author Lisa Shulman, M.D., pictured above, who is a profes - sor of pediatrics at Einstein and interim director of the Rose F. Kennedy Children's Evaluation and Rehabilitation Center at Montefiore. \"But by and large, these children continue to struggle with daily life. Almost all of them still contend with language and learning disabilities and a vari - ety of emotional and behavioral problems.\" In the study, Dr. Shulman and her colleagues reviewed the clinical records of 569 young children who were diagnosed with ASD. Most had received early-intervention services. When followed up an average of four years after their initial diagnoses, 38 children\u20147% of the group\u2014no longer met the diagnostic criteria for ASD. Of those 38, two-thirds still ex - hibited language or learning disabilities; half had externalizing behavior problems, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and a quarter had internalizing behavior problems, such as anxiety disorder. Only three of the 38 children who recovered from ASD had no other problems, the authors reported earlier this year in the Journal of Child Neurology . What is going on with these children who no longer have an ASD diagnosis? \"Our sense is that some children with ASD respond to inter - vention and others have unique developmental trajectories that lead to improvement. Those children who evolve in a positive direction gener - ally have the mildest symptoms to begin with,\" Dr. Shulman says. \"The message from our study,\" she adds, \"is that some of our kids do amaz - ingly well, but most of them have persistent difficulties requiring ongo - ing monitoring and therapeutic support.\"CAN KIDS AGE OUT OF ASD?\"These tantrums make it hard for families to go to a restaurant, travel on public transportation, or do much of anything outside the home,\" Dr. Hollander says. \"It's a huge burden, one that causes many couples to separate or divorce.\" Military families who have children with ASD face the same issues, which is why the DoD is supporting the study. \"Those families need access to a lot of services, which limits where they can live, which in turn affects military readiness,\" Dr. Hollander adds. The Einstein-Montefiore-NYU trial\u2014the first to study CBDV\u2014will enroll 100 children with above-average levels of irritability. Patients will take an oral CBDV solution or a placebo twice a day for 12 weeks, and results are expected in three years. The researchers will use the new Montefiore-Einstein Rigidity Scale\u2014Revised (MERS-R) to assess the participants' social and cognitive functioning before and after treatment. \"We previously had to rely on parents' observations about the children's behav - ior on scales that were either too specific or not specific enough,\" Dr. Taylor says. \"When we realized we weren't captur - ing all of their behaviors, we decided we needed a better scale.\" MERS-R looks at three domains of behavior: behavioral rigidity (difficulty adjusting to or managing behavior in new, unfamiliar, or unexpected situa - tions); cognitive rigidity (lack of flexible thinking); and protest (behavioral reac - tion in response to an interruption to the subject's rigidity). \"It takes just 20 minutes to administer the MERS-R, which assesses the level, the length, and the severity of each domain and puts a number on it,\" Dr. Taylor says. The findings from the CBDV study 26 EINSTEIN : SUMMER/FALL 2019could have applications beyond ASD. \"The repetitive features of ASD are also common in a variety of other compulsive disorders,\" Dr. Hollander says. \"The goal of our work is to discover ways to target the causes of these conditions, ease the associated symptoms, and improve the quality of life for many, many people.\" Recruiting children for the balovap - tan and CBDV trials shouldn't be dif - ficult. \"Many parents are willing to try anything that might help their chil - dren,\" says Casara Jean Ferretti, M.S., a doctoral student at the Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology, who helped write the CBDV grant application. It's an attitude that certainly char - acterizes Carlos Rodriguez's parents. Carlos didn't benefit from a previous Einstein-Montefiore trial, but that didn't deter his parents from enrolling him in the balovaptan trial. They realize the urgency of finding therapies that will help Carlos and other kids with ASD. \"I'll be his advocate to the end of the day,\" says his mom, Maribel. \"I don't want him to feel that he cannot have a life like everyone else. But I do worry about his future. When I try to talk to him about what he's going to do when he gets older, he says, 'I'm not leaving. I'm staying with you.'\" Military families who have children with ASD face the same issues, which is why the Department of Defense is supporting the study.

S tep inside the building at the corner of Walton Avenue and East 177th Street in the Bronx on a Saturday morning and you might think you were at any other busy medi - cal clinic in New York City. About two dozen men and women patiently wait in a reception area with bright-green walls to see one of two doctors as a few more people check in at the front desk. \"How can I help you today?\" one of the receptionists asks a young woman, who says she is there for a medical clear - ance before starting a new job. She's handed a clipboard as a nurse announces the next patient to be seen. Some people have come for blood tests or vaccinations. Others need help with a respiratory condition or a skin problem. Still others are following up after surgery. Each of these services might cost $400 or more out of pocket. But at this clinic, the receptionists are Einstein students and the doctors vol - unteer their time. And the patients are charged nothing for their visits. A NATIONAL MODEL The free health clinic exists because two decades ago a group of Einstein students had an idea. They wanted to serve Bronx residents who had no health insurance\u2014 including both members of the working poor and those who were not eligible because of their immigration status. Partnering with the nonprofit Institute for Family Health, the students launched the Einstein Community Health Outreach clinic, or ECHO for short. When ECHO opened at the Walton Family Health Center on Sept. 25, 1999, it was the first student-run, physician-supervised free clinic in New York City. It soon became a model for similar clinics across the nation. Today ECHO serves some 25 to 35 adults each Saturday. \"We're meet - ing the needs of community members who may be afraid or unable to access healthcare because of the cost,\" says Amarilys Cortijo, M.D., ECHO's medical director. To be seen, patients cannot have health insurance and must be over age 18. Each ECHO patient qualifies for two free well-care visits, or four visits if he or she has a chronic condition such as diabetes. After that, the patients are encouraged to use one of the full-time health centers operated by the Institute for Family Health or another clinic of their choice. At the institute, they pay for care on a sliding-fee scale based on income. Counselors will also help eligible patients apply for Medicaid and other insurance programs and provide them with a pharmacy card to ensure that they can get the medications that are prescribed to them. \"The idea is to tran - sition them into the healthcare system,\" Dr. Cortijo says. \"We see ourselves as the gateway.\" TAKING CARE OF PATIENTS Just as ECHO has established itself as a vital community resource, it has also become a key component of an Einstein medical education. More than two- thirds of the first-year students, 110 to 120 in all, volunteer at the clinic an average of one Saturday a month. Sharan Shah, a fourth-year medical stu - dent at Einstein who recently served as executive clinical chair at ECHO, esti - mates that 2,700 Einstein students have contributed their time and skills to the Photos by Bernardo Restrepo MAGAZINE.EINSTEIN.YU.EDU 29 MAGAZINE.EINSTEIN.YU.EDU 29\"They improve their interpersonal skills; they learn how to listen and how to speak to patients.

Dr. Cortijo arrived at ECHO in early 2001 and has worked with most of those students, who call her the \"heart and soul\" of the clinic. Staffing a medical facility largely with student volunteers presents some chal - lenges. One is the need to train a fresh batch of recruits every year. \"They're very bright and have a lot of energy, but they're often totally inexperienced,\" Dr. Cortijo says. On any given Saturday, there are likely to be about 40 Einstein students on hand, along with two attending physicians to supervise them. In the summer, undergraduate students from other area colleges who are interested in medical careers can volunteer as inter - preters or receptionists through ECHO's Pre-Health Summer Program. \"Our students learn how to take care of patients, under close supervision,\" Dr. Cortijo says. \"They improve their interpersonal skills; they learn how to listen and how to speak to patients. Medical students rarely get this opportu - nity anywhere else.\" That opportunity has, in fact, become a selling point for many students choos - ing a medical school. One of them was Sarah Nosal, M.D., Class of 2004, who knew from an early age that she wanted to be a physician and work with an underserved population. The year she was applying to medical schools was the very year ECHO was established. \"When I found out I got into Einstein, I dropped my other applications,\" she recalls. \"I said, 'I have to go there.'\" Dr. Nosal went to Einstein and joined ECHO; she has maintained the connection ever since. She now plays an integral role in the running of the clinic, as well as serving as vice president for innovation and optimization at the Institute for Family Health.

Two years before he graduated, Dr. Kelly cofounded a medical clinic for the poor in Sierra Leone, Africa, with a local doctor there. The clinic, which has since been integrated into Partners in Health-Sierra Leone, currently sees 250 to 300 patients a day, Dr. Kelly says. \"Without ECHO I don't think I'd have been able to start a clinic from scratch,\" he says. \"In medical school you're taught how to take care of patients, but you don't learn about the operational and administrative details that are needed to create the physician experience\u2014how to set up the environment, how to organize patient records, all of those differ - ent pieces.\" Today Dr. Kelly is an infectious-disease specialist and epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco. His work focuses on ways to improve Ebola prevention and care, primarily in Sierra Leone and Liberia but also the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \"ECHO was a great experience for me\u2014and not just for the practical skills I picked up,\" he says. \"I think it's important for medical students to get a broader view of their potential role in the world, what social justice is, why healthcare should be a human right.\" from ECHO they're unlikely to get else - where. \"Doing some of the administra - tive tasks around the clinic, like working the front desk, helps them appreciate those roles and how important they are,\" she says. \"There's just no place to teach that in the typical medical school curriculum.\" OUTSIDE THE CLINIC Lisa Kremen, Class of 2021, recently finished a stint as ECHO's community education coordinator. \"ECHO has been eye-opening for me, and it reinforced my desire to work in an underserved community,\" says Ms. Kremen, who hopes to pursue a career in psychiatry. \"You learn about people's frustrations. For example, you see how hard it is for them to talk about mental health issues like depression, especially among people from different cultures.\" Mr. Shah, the fourth-year student, hopes to become an ear, nose, and throat specialist. Like many first-years, he started at ECHO's front desk and rose through the ranks to his position on the clinical board, which recruits, trains, and schedules volunteers. \"I've spent hundreds of hours at ECHO,\" he says. \"I've learned a tremendous amount, and it's one of the things I'm proudest of. We get to see the very direct impact we have on the lives of our patients.\" Dr. Cortijo agrees. \"Sometimes I get up on a Saturday after working all week, and I don't feel like going in,\" she says. \"But then I get there and am so happy, so energized. It's a rejuvenating experi - ence, a joyful experience. I think many of my colleagues feel the same way.\" Dr. Dan Kelly, during his final year in medical school, with three patients who had amputations and were living at the Wardu resettlement community in Kono District, Sierra Leone, Africa.

(For more about these conditions, see page 37.) Drs. Verma and Steidl were among the first researchers to demonstrate that MDS, a common precursor of AML, arises from wayward bone-marrow stem cells; the pair's findings have raised hopes for treating or preventing both diseases. COMPLEMENTARY SKILL SETS The researchers began their journeys to Einstein from vastly different parts of the world. Dr. Verma studied medicine at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi and then relocated to the United States for postgraduate training at the University of Illinois at Chicago Medical School, ultimately focusing his research and clinical practice on MDS. Around the same time, Dr. Steidl studied medicine at the University of Heidelberg in Germany and then cell and tumor biology at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg before pursuing postdoctoral studies at Harvard Medical School, with a focus on AML. Dr. Verma arrived at Einstein in 2007, followed by Dr. Steidl the next year. \"We met right after I joined the faculty and discovered very quickly that we had complementary skills,\" says Dr. Steidl, who is now a professor of cell biology and of medicine, the Diane and Arthur B. Belfer Faculty Scholar in Cancer Research at Einstein, and the associate chair for translational research in oncology at Montefiore. \"My work is more lab-based; his is more translational, with a clinical component. I was looking for a partner who could help bring my laboratory findings to the clinic.\" In Dr. Steidl, Dr. Verma found someone with expertise in cell sorting, cell identification, and animal models of myeloid diseases (i.e., those pertain - ing to bone marrow). \"He provided a perfect counterpart to my lab's expertise in deciphering cell-signaling and epi - genetic pathways and studies of clini - cal samples,\" says Dr. Verma, professor of medicine and of developmental and molecular biology at Einstein and direc - tor of hemato-oncology at Montefiore. The pair soon began to collaborate on MDS and AML research. CANCERS THAT CAN OVERLAP MDS, a cancer of the bone marrow, occurs when blood-forming cells called \"blasts\" become dysplastic (that is, they develop abnormally) and multiply rap - idly. Abnormal blasts churn out defec - tive blood cells and leave people with too few normal ones. Different types of MDS can decrease different blood cells\u2014most commonly red cells, result - ing in anemia. The incidence of MDS in the United States is unclear, with estimates ranging from 10,000 to 40,000 new cases annually. The only cure is a bone- marrow transplant\u2014a therapy not easily tolerated and therefore reserved for the youngest, most resilient patients. Most people diagnosed with MDS, however, are elderly. Deaths result from bleed - ing, infection due to low blood-cell counts\u2014and from MDS progressing to AML, which occurs in about one-third of MDS patients. (This is why MDS was once described as a \"premalignant\" condition but is now generally regarded as a form of cancer.) AML is an aggressive and usually fatal blood cancer that begins in the bone marrow. It afflicts about 21,000 Americans each year and is diagnosed when massive numbers of defective blast cells are detected in the bone marrow and blood. As is true for MDS, AML usually can be cured only with a bone- marrow transplant and mainly affects older people. Just 28% of AML patients survive for five or more years after diagnosis. At left, an abnormal blast cell (shown in purple) produces defective blood cells (shown in blue), leading to myelodysplastic syndromes.The names \"Verma and Steidl\" don't roll off the tongue the way \"Brady and Belichick\" and \"Bert and Ernie\" do. But it would be hard to imagine a more productive research duo. MAGAZINE.EINSTEIN.YU.EDU 33success if it significantly reduced the blast count,\" Dr. Verma says. \"This approach was effective at improving symptoms in many patients, even put - ting some into remission. But invariably, the disease would come back.\" Targeting the blasts, says Dr. Steidl, \"is like mow - ing dandelions in your lawn. That will get rid of them, but they'll always regrow unless you get to the root of the weed.\" So what is the actual cause of MDS? Relying on animal evidence, Drs. Verma and Steidl, along with a few other scien - tists, suspected that MDS\u2014like AML\u2014 originated from defective hematopoietic stem cells. \"It was hard to get our MDS research COLLABORATING TO CURE CANCERS SEEKING THE CAUSE OF MDS By 2008, when Drs. Verma and Steidl began collaborating, studies had shown that AML arises from defective hemat - opoietic (blood-forming) stem cells, the bone-marrow cells that develop into blasts and, ultimately, all the blood's cell types. By contrast, cases of MDS were thought to begin later in blood-cell development, when blood-progenitor cells became dysplastic and could no longer produce fully mature red cells, white cells, and platelets, instead pro - ducing an excess of malignant blast cells. These defective blasts were the target of MDS treatments. \"An MDS therapy was viewed as a Research collaborators Dr. Amit Verma, left, and Dr. Ulrich Steidl at work in the lab. Targeting the blasts \"is like mowing dandelions in your lawn. They'll always regrow unless you get to the root of the weed.\" \u2014 DR. ULRICH STEIDL 34 EINSTEIN : SUMMER/FALL 2019funded,\" Steidl adds. review - ers would comment: 'The problem in MDS is clearly the blasts and dysplastic cells. Why waste your time studying these tiny, barely detectable populations of hematopoietic stem cells?'\" But the Einstein researchers persisted. In a seminal study published in 2012 in the journal Blood , they analyzed bone- marrow stem cells and their slightly more differentiated progeny (progeni - tor cells) from 17 patients with various types of MDS and 16 healthy controls. Genome-wide analysis revealed wide - spread genetic and epigenetic alterations in stem cells from MDS patients, but not in stem cells taken from healthy controls. Those same gene alterations were also found in patients' blasts, which evolve from stem cells. \"Equally important,\" Dr. Verma says, \"we found that abnormal stem cells persist in the bone marrow even after standard chemotherapy for MDS. So although the patient may be in remis - sion, those stem cells resist chemo - therapy and the disease will inevitably return. Our findings made it clear that we needed to wipe out the abnormal stem cells to improve cure rates.\" A NEW GENERATION OF THERAPIES Since publishing their initial paper, Drs. Verma and Steidl have sought ways to disable abnormal stem cells in patients with MDS and AML. Thus far they've found a half-dozen vulnerabilities in such stem cells, and experimental drugs targeting them are now in clinical trials. A key recent contribution involves ALRN-6924, the first of a novel class of drugs called stapled peptides (small chains of amino acids with helical structures that are stabilized using hydrocarbon \"staples\"). Aileron Therapeutics developed ALRN-6924 to reactivate the p53 tumor-suppressor gene, which prevents impaired or can - cerous cells from multiplying. The p53 gene is inactivated in virtu - ally all cancers and in the mutated stem cells that develop into AML, so reacti - vating p53 might be expected to stop tumor cells in their tracks. But so far, no stapled-peptide drug has advanced to clinical trials\u2014until now. In a novel approach, Aileron scien - tists designed ALRN-6924 to reacti - vate p53 indirectly by simultaneously inhibiting two proteins, MDMX and MDM2, that are overexpressed in cancer and act together to suppress key p53 functions. The company then turned to Drs. Verma and Steidl to test the drug's effectiveness in preclinical models of AML and to learn more about its mechanism of action. The Einstein researchers found that ALRN-6924 had a profound impact on AML, tripling the median survival time in an animal model of human AML (mice transplanted with human leuke - mia cells) from 50 to about 150 days. \"This is a very striking response,\" Dr. Steidl says. \"Most experimental drugs for leukemia achieve an increase in survival of only a few days in these preclinical models. More important, ALRN-6924 effectively cured about 40% of the treated mice, meaning they were disease-free more than one year after treatment\u2014essentially a lifetime for a mouse.\" The researchers confirmed that ALRN-6924 targets both MDMX and MDM2, blocking their interaction with p53 in AML cells. That effect was seen in both immature and mature AML cells. Furthermore, those same molecular \"Our findings made it clear that we needed to wipe out the abnormal stem cells to improve cure rates.\" \u2014 DR. were observed in blood cells of an AML patient who was given the drug on a compassionate-use basis. \"This test was not designed to assess the efficacy of the drug in humans\u2014 that has to be done in a proper clinical trial,\" Dr. Steidl says. \"Our goal was to determine whether it can hit the desired target in human cells in a clinical set - ting, which it did in this individual.\" The ALRN-6924 findings, reported in Science T ranslational Medicine in 2018, have led to a phase 1/phase 2 clinical trial for patients with advanced AML or MDS, now underway at Montefiore and three other centers. Dr. Verma is lead - ing Montefiore's portion of the trial. He directs Montefiore's MDS Center, which offers a variety of treatments and clinical trials for patients with the disease and is recognized as a national \"center of excel - lence\" by the MDS Foundation. Earlier this year, Drs. Verma and Steidl tackled another vexing question: COLLABORATING TO CURE CANCERS Why do one-third of MDS patients eventually develop AML? The standard linear model (at top) proposes that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) accumulate additional mutations that ultimately cause MDS to evolve into AML. But after conducting single-cell genomic sequencing of stem cells (SCs) from seven patients with MDS who later developed AML, Drs. Verma and Steidl created a model (above) positing that MDS and AML are actually separate diseases that evolve from different aberrant stem-cell subclones, i.e., cell groups that descend from a single mutated cell very early in disease development. MDS (which, for unknown reasons, often precedes AML) evolves from aberrant stem- cell subclones that differ from those that led to MDS and that may have been present for many years before MDS or AML develops. Dotted lines indicate uncertainty regarding exactly when one stem-cell type progressed to another in some patients. What causes one-third of MDS cases to progress to the usually fatal AML? In research published in Nature Medicine in 2019, they and their col - leagues carried out single-cell genomic sequencing of stem cells and blast cells from seven patients with MDS that progressed to AML. \"The old linear model\u2014MDS blast cells accumulate increasing numbers of mutations, which ultimately lead to AML\u2014didn't hold up,\" Dr. Steidl says. Illustration by Tatyana Starikova Harris. Adapted from Nature Medicine . 36 EINSTEIN : SUMMER/FALL 2019\"Instead, we found that the progres - sion from MDS to AML begins earlier, with a diverse spectrum of mutations in hematopoietic stem cells. A defec - tive stem cell will evolve into MDS, but it is not those MDS cells that develop into AML. Rather, other aberrant stem cells\u2014ones that arise from different defective stem-cell 'subclones'\u2014acquire additional mutations that ultimately lead to AML. So to prevent MDS from evolving into AML, we need to focus our efforts on detecting and targeting those early aberrant stem cells.\" (See illustration on page 36.) ONCE AND FUTURE COLLEAGUES For the first time in their careers, Drs. Verma and Steidl are optimistic that bet - ter therapies for MDS and AML\u2014ones that target stem cells\u2014are close at hand. \"The survival rates for MDS and AML have not improved for the last half- century, and nobody understood why,\" Dr. Steidl says. \"Now we know it's because we weren't focusing on the right cells. It makes me very hopeful.\" They expect to continue their part - nership. \"We're very good friends,\" says Dr. Verma about his colleague. \"Uli's a great guy, very sharp, with the abil - ity to solve complex problems logically. Beyond that, we have built the research infrastructure for our work. Science is so much more complex these days. It's tough for one lab to have mastery of every possible technique.\" Adds Dr. Steidl: \"I don't think we've ever had an argument about our research. We try to take our egos out of the equations as much as we can. I feel very fortunate to have such a great col - laborator. It was luck that we connected and clicked.\" The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a diverse group of disorders in which mutated hematopoietic stem cells result in the formation of vast quantities of defective red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. In most cases, the cause of these mutations is not known. People at elevated risk for developing MDS are smokers or have been exposed to cancer therapies (such as chemotherapy and radiation), toxic chemicals, or heavy metals\u2014all of which can damage DNA. Patients with MDS are typically treated with specialized chemo - therapies to reduce the number of blood-forming cells called \"blasts,\" plus symptom management and supportive care, such as blood transfusions. Treatment puts some patients into remission, sometimes for years, but the disease almost always returns. Survival varies widely depending on the disease type; it ranges from nine months for those with very high-risk MDS to 8.8 years for those with very low-risk disease. Although one-third of MDS patients eventually develop acute my - eloid leukemia (AML), the majority of AML cases arise without being preceded by MDS. AML shares many symptoms with MDS, including fatigue, shortness of breath, pale skin, susceptibility to infections, and frequent nosebleeds. Treatment for AML depends on the stage and subtype of the disease, but usually includes chemotherapy, symptom management, and palliative care. Survival is heavily age dependent: For people diagnosed before age 20, the five-year survival rate is 67%; for those 20 and older, it's only 24%.THE ABCS OF MDS AND AML AML AT A GLANCE SOURCE: NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE 28.3%Percent Surviving 5 Years 68 yearsMedian Age at Diagnosis21,450 estimated new cases in 2019 1.2% of all new cancer cases 10,920 estimated deaths in 2019 1.8% of all cancer deaths MAGAZINE.EINSTEIN.YU.EDU 37 MAGAZINE.EINSTEIN.YU.EDU 37BY MANDY WALKER AN OUT-OF-THIS- WORLD CLERKSHIP NASA program gives an Einstein student a glimpse of space medicine 38 EINSTEIN : SUMMER/FALL 2019Deciding on a patient's treatment can be challenging.

These special - ists care for NASA astronauts before, during, and after their time in space. They oversee the astronauts' fitness train - ing and manage their various physiologi - cal responses to their flights. Jennifer Ma, M.D., who graduated from Einstein in May, was part of a select group that experienced the life of a flight surgeon during her month in NASA's Aerospace Medicine Clerkship program at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, last fall. Dr. Ma had worked in the radiation biology lab of Simon Powell, M.D., Ph.D., at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City for two years while at Einstein. She became interested in the clerkship when she learned that one of NASA's research priorities is the study of radiation risk for astronauts. \"I realized the program might give me a new perspective on radiation,\" she says. Dr. Ma was one of only 18 people accepted into the four-week program. Like the other participants, she was assigned a group research project. But she was one of just a few clerks given two mentors: Johnny Conkin, Ph.D., an environmental physiologist, and Joseph Dervay, M.D., a flight surgeon and the leader of the medical operations group. FIRST AID FOR SPACE TRAVEL Her group's challenge: To create an augmented first-aid kit for an upcoming flight-simulation experiment in which eight people\u2014two medical staff mem - bers and six volunteers\u2014will live inside a three-story, 20-foot-tall chamber at the Opposite page: Dr. Jennifer Ma stands outside a flight simulation chamber at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.

The first-aid kit must address any conditions that the crew members might face dur - ing their space mission, which is set for the first quarter of 2020. \"We wanted to include medications for many common ailments, such as infections or allergic reactions, in order to ensure that the experiment wouldn't end prematurely because of a minor medical issue that worsened during the study,\" Dr. Ma says. Other necessities included medications for insomnia and an upset stomach as well as supplies such as gauze, tourniquets, and band - ages to treat minor trauma. \"They won't be doing anything considered dangerous, but there is a nar - row metal staircase that someone could trip on, and low ceilings where they might hit their head,\" Dr. Ma says.

JENNIFER MA AN OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD CLERKSHIP also had to factor that in when consider - ing which medications to bring on board. \"We were concerned that anything in blister packs might burst after frequent pressure changes, so we put those medica - tions in bottles,\" she says. \"And we had to check with a pharmacist about whether the liquid medications would still be sta - ble after repeated pressure changes.\" SPACE EDUCATION Not all of her time at the Johnson Space Center was spent working on her project. \"Most days we heard lectures or toured different parts of the facility, which was a ton of fun,\" she says. Lecture top - ics included space physiology, envi - ronmental health, exercise physiology, space nutrition, an in-depth look at the International Space Station, and Mars mission scenarios. \"We also learned about spaceflight- associated neuro-ocular syndrome, or SANS,\" Dr. Ma explains. While fluids in the body are pulled downward by gravity here on Earth, they can shift in a person's skull during space travel and affect an astronaut's vision. SANS is thought to be caused by this increased pressure in the head and especially in the eye area during and after long flights in space. Radiation exposure is also a major concern. \"Astronauts are exposed to a chronic low level of radiation while in space, which NASA can attempt to offset with shielding,\" Dr. Ma says. But there are also unpredictable solar storms, which can expose astronauts to high radiation levels. \"T raveling to Mars takes 40 EINSTEIN : SUMMER/FALL 2019HANGING OUT WITH ASTRONAUTS A NASA clerkship has its perks: The 18 students in the fall session were invited onboard a life-size version of the International Space Station on site at the Johnson Space Center called the Space Vehicle Mockup Facility (SVMF). They were also invited to visit the Sonny Carter Training Facility, which houses the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, where they watched astronauts (above) conduct underwater maneuvers. During their visit to the SVMF, \"we got lucky and bumped into an Italian astronaut and engineer, Luca Parmitano. He lived on the space station and was giving a tour to two of his friends,\" says Jennifer Ma, M.D., '19. \"He invited us to join his tour, too, so instead of having a guide who said, 'This is this module and what it does,' he shared more- personal details, like 'This is where I would hang out,' and 'I don't like this area because sometimes it gets smelly.'\" Dr. Ma's tour group was again in luck during its visit to the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, which prepares astronauts for space walks. \"It's basically a giant indoor pool that's large enough to house a version of the International Space Station surrounded by 6.2 million gallons of water,\" Dr. Ma says. They arrived just as an astronaut training session was starting, so they witnessed two astronauts don their space suits, get hooked up to oxygen, and be lowered into the pool. Then they watched the astronauts on video screens carrying out simulations of extravehicular activities, which are excursions performed outside a spacecraft.a long time, so you have a higher risk of radiation exposure overall,\" she says. Because of her keen interest in the topic, Dr. Ma asked for a closer look at the radiation biology lab at the Johnson Space Center. She not only was granted a tour, but also got to talk to the head of the lab, Honglu Wu, Ph.D., about the lab team's current research and the clini - cal data it collects. \"They obtain blood samples from astronauts before, during, and after space flights, and they analyze those samples, looking for changes.\" NEXT STEPS At the end of the four weeks, each clerk - ship group created a scientific poster that summarized its results. \"I presented them to everyone at the space center who was interested, and we got to meet everyone's mentors plus many of the other NASA staff in a wide spectrum of departments,\" Dr. Ma says. She had the chance to reunite with many of her NASA clerkship colleagues last May when her abstract had been accepted for poster presentation at the 2019 annual meeting of the Aerospace Medical Association in Las Vegas. There she was awarded the Stanley R. Mohler, M.D., Aerospace Medicine Endowed Scholarship, worth $750 and intended to fund research activities. Dr. Ma matched at her top residency choice, Memorial Sloan Kettering, for radiation oncology. She is completing her transitional year now at Presence Saint Francis in the Chicago area. Dr. Ma calls the NASA clerkship one of the highlights of her time in medical school. \"I never thought I'd have the opportu - nity to do half of the things I did,\" she says. \"I've made great friends and hope to continue collaborating on research projects.\" WATCH THE VIDEO See an astronaut train for a space walk in NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory: magazine.einstein.yu.edu/NASA19 MAGAZINE.EINSTEIN.YU.EDU 41A cyclist with a prosthetic leg checks out a race in Harlem's Marcus Garvey Park.

It's where Wouter (VOW-ter) Hoogenboom grew up, riding his bicycle everywhere, as is the local custom. He and his friends would create their own flower-laden Tour de France courses, pretending viaducts were French Alps and traffic signs were finish lines, each of them dreaming of cycling glory. \"In the Netherlands, everybody has a bike,\" he says. \"You go to school with a bike. You go grocery shopping with a bike. It's a way of life.\" Here in the United States, Mr. Hoogenboom, age 38, is a competitive cyclist who powers through four-hour training rides. He is also an award- winning photographer, a medical researcher specializing in sports-related concussions, a husband and the father of two boys, and\u2014since 2013\u2014a Ph.D. candidate at Einstein, working in the lab of Michael Lipton, M.D., Ph.D., professor of radiology and of psychia - try and behavioral sciences at Einstein and medical director of MRI Services at Montefiore. \"Wouter has a thoughtful, quiet, powerful way about him, and is very assiduous in figuring out what needs Snapshots From the Bike Lane PURSUITS BY WAYNE COFFEYPASSIONATE 42 EINSTEIN : SUMMER/FALL 2019\u2014 WOUTER HOOGENBOOM to be done and how to get it done,\" Dr. Lipton says. COMMITTED TO CYCLING After getting his undergraduate degree in psychology in Holland, Mr. Hoogenboom pursued his master's in neuropsychology, finishing up with an internship at Harvard Medical School. He brought his bike with him to the United States and began to race com - petitively, up to 200 miles a week. The racing continued when he relocated to Einstein to study under Dr. Lipton. On his long training rides, he typically bikes across the George Washington Bridge into New Jersey and heads north along the west bank of the Hudson River, covering up to 70 miles round trip. The rides are grueling physical tests, and Mr. Hoogenboom savors them. \"The best parts about cycling are being outdoors, exploring new roads, and escaping busy city life,\" Mr. Hoogenboom says. \"There is a great feeling of camaraderie when you are on a long ride with others. It's also a great feeling when you've completed the ride. Frankly, it's a true addiction\u2014a healthy one.\" Mr. Hoogenboom's bike rides, alas, have also been accompanied by injuries. A nasty fall triggered persistent back pain, forcing him to take a break from competitive cycling. Eager to stay con - nected to his team during his recupera - tion, Mr. Hoogenboom began to take photos. He wound up winning several awards in a competition that honors the best cycling photography around the world. These pages include some of his more-recent photos.

Dementia has, over the ages, been hard to pin down. From the Latin demens , \"out of one's mind,\" the word dementia was histori - cally used loosely, lumped in with a broad range of mental illnesses. Losing the ability to feed and dress oneself was often chalked up to madness, possibly caused by demonic possession and often treated with punishment. Author Tia Powell, M.D., writes in Dementia Reimagined that when she was a medical student in the 1980s, demen - tia was finally recognized as a neurocognitive disorder, but still wasn't a priority in the healthcare community. Dementia mainly happened to very old people, and no treatments existed. Why devote resources to a relatively rare condition that affected those who had just a few years left to live? While a cure still eludes us, that dismissive attitude toward dementia has changed in recent decades, Dr. Powell notes. Americans are now living longer\u2014and when they reach age 85, their chance of having dementia approaches 40%, accord - ing to a 2019 report from the Alzheimer's Association. The condition now affects more than 5 million Americans, and that number will rise as baby boomers grow older. Dr. Powell notes in her book that dementia is hard for both the person with the illness and his or her caregivers, as patients lose their ability to walk, talk, and even swallow. Dementia is expensive, too, and consumes an impressive share of the Medicare budget. Nonetheless, the main message of the book is that dementia can and should be less frightening to people than it is today. With better understanding, planning, care, and policies, we can ease the aspects of dementia that are scary for everyone involved, she explains. Dr. Powell was motivated in part to write Dementia Reimagined because of the experiences of her grandmother and mother, and she explores the disease in depth. Chapters are devoted to the politics and economics of dementia and to sci - entific research on the disorder. For families who are touched by this fatal disease, the book offers guidance on caregiving, whether the patient remains at home or goes to an assisted- living facility. Dr. Powell emphasizes the necessity of planning and of making the patient's wishes known, to limit the finan - cial and emotional burdens in the final few years of the disease. Dementia Reimagined concludes by helping readers plan for a good death, with the author outlining just what she'd like for hers. She notes that shifting the balance from curative care to palliative care can make all the difference. \"Keep me comfort - able,\" she asks. \"And don't stand between me and the exit.\" PUBLISHED BY: Avery, an imprint of Penguin Random House, 2019 Courtesy of Penguin Random HouseEDITIONS 44 EINSTEIN : SUMMER/FALL 2019The African American Experience Arnold Birenbaum, Ph.D. Professor emeritus in the department of pediatrics at Einstein, co-author of Norms and Human Behavior, and co-editor of Social Problems: Private T roubles and Public Issues and People in Places: The Sociology of the Familiar. Race relations in America have never been an easy topic to discuss. By carefully examining histori - cal evidence going back to the 18th century, author Arnold Birenbaum, Ph.D., sheds light on the lives of African Americans in the 21st century and their continuing struggle for social justice. Dr. Birenbaum uses that historical evidence to help answer key questions now confronting the country: Why are African Americans disproportionately impoverished in the United States? Are government policies to blame? And what about healthcare, housing, and the justice system? Why are resources distributed so unequally in those areas? And can all of this be reversed? Different aspects of the African American experience have converged to create today's racial divides, Dr. Birenbaum notes. A chief culprit is geographically segregated communi - ties, which he likens to the relationship that exists between a colony and its mother country, where the institutions of soci - ety are rigged against the colonists\u2014except the \"colonists\" live right in the American homeland. A Nation Apart also discusses the systematic undoing of civil rights and federal support for African Americans after the Civil War, tracing these injustices from Reconstruction to Jim Crow laws to separate-but-equal policies. Northern states after the war also encouraged racial divi - sion. Immigrants just off the boat were told to avoid intimate contact with people of color, implying that interracial rela - tionships were dangerous. European immigrants were taught to treat African Americans in a way that established distance and reaffirmed Europeans' feelings of privilege. Moving into the 20th century, the book delves into the rise of white nationalism as the United States evolved from a largely agrarian society to an industrial one\u2014and addresses the accompanying civil rights movement, which threatened the white power structure. Dr. Birenbaum offers solutions to what's standing in the way of social justice for African Americans, including closing the gap in health services, increasing income and reducing wealth inequality, challenging educational disparities, mak - ing housing more affordable and stable, enhancing the urban environment, reforming criminal justice, protecting voter rights by ending voter suppression, and reconsidering the case for reparations for the descendants of slaves. Filled with annotated research and well-crafted arguments, Dr. Birenbaum's study of America's racial injustices promises to inform and inspire. But, as he notes, there's a great deal of work that remains to be done.

Their founding vision of integrating comprehensive health services into every public school setting in the Bronx was well underway\u2014but they were outgrowing their infrastructure. MSHP found a partner in the Jeffrey H. and Shari L. Aronson Family Foundation. The Aronson Family Foundation provided funding for initiatives such as hiring qualified staff, expanding our school- based health clinic network, propelling enrollment rates, and guiding long-term sustainability. Today, Rosy Chhabra, Psy.D., is leading MSHP to become a model for school health nationwide (page 52). Identifying and solving problems is a trend across Montefiore and Einstein. Harvey Karp, M.D. '75, came up with an ingenious solution to reduce the rate of sudden infant death syndrome, fueled by the compassionate learning he experienced while at Einstein (page 49). My fellow trustee David B. Keidan partnered with Emad Eskandar, M.D., to support innovations in neurological surgery across Montefiore and Einstein (page 60). When you walk across our campuses, read our publications, and speak with our students, faculty, and clinicians, you will see such problems\u2014and solutions!\u2014at every corner. As chair of the development committee within the Montefiore Medicine Board of Trustees, I hope to inspire problem-solving through philanthropy. From giving Einstein students opportunity through scholarships to fueling life-changing research to combating social issues in our community and around the world, every contribution\u2014of dollars, of mentorship, of research, of clinical commitment\u2014supports a solution. Montefiore and Einstein model what it means to be thoughtful stewards of such investment. While we've accomplished a lot, there's still so much we can do. I support Montefiore and Einstein through my time and philanthropy. What's your solution? With gratitude, Melissa Ceriale 48 EINSTEIN : SUMMER/FALL 2019Trusted pediatrician and author helps parents calm fussy babies Harvey Karp, M.D. '75Inventors often point to a moment of inspiration when the solution to a problem suddenly appears. Einstein alumnus Harvey Karp, M.D., experi - enced that flash of insight after giving a talk on sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, in 2011. SIDS is the leading cause of death for infants 1 month to 1 year old, and a parent's worst fear: Seemingly healthy babies unexpectedly stop breathing in their sleep. It's also known as \"crib death\" because many victims are found lifeless in their cribs. After the lecture, Dr. Karp remem - bers, he expressed his frustration to a friend. \"Why hasn't someone come up with a way to help prevent this?\" he asked. His friend replied: \"Well, why don't YOU?\" It was a fair question. Dr. Karp is one of America's most trusted pediatricians and child-development experts\u2014a repu - tation he earned by researching infant behavior and developing science-based techniques to soothe fussy infants and help them sleep. Millions of bleary-eyed parents around the world have sought advice from his best-selling books and videos: The Happiest Baby on the Block , The Happiest Toddler on the Block , and The Happiest Baby Guide to Great Sleep . Infants are most vulnerable to SIDS in the first few months of life, which Dr. Karp terms \"the fourth trimester.\" \"Humans are really born three months too early; they are incredibly immature compared to other animal species,\" he DR. HARVEY KARP CLASS OF '75MOTIVATIONS | CONTINUED CONNECTION says. \"Unlike a colt or a calf, we don't hit the ground running. In the early months, babies need us to mimic the womb's sensations through cuddling, rocking, and shushing for hours a day.\" Their underdevelopment also means that infants may fail to awaken or to move their heads when not receiving enough oxygen. Studies have shown that putting infants to sleep on their backs on a firm, flat surface away from loose bedding\u2014hence the \"back to sleep\" public health campaign\u2014has significantly reduced the rate of SIDS in the United States and other countries. In addition, Dr. Karp knew from his own research that imitating the womb often calms babies\u2014even mid-cry. BABY ROCKER RECALL For the past decade, manufacturers have claimed that the rocker-like infant-sleep products they've marketed to parents will soothe their fussy babies. But those rockers (also called \"nappers\") keep BY TERESA CARR A Message From the Chair of the Development Committee Montefiore Medicine Board of Trustees MELISSA CERIALE Courtesy of Happiest Baby, Inc. MAGAZINE.EINSTEIN.YU.EDU 49the baby semiupright\u2014increasing the likelihood of airway compression and suffocation and prompting the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) to warn that the rockers put babies' lives at risk. In April 2019, under pressure from the AAP , Fisher-Price recalled 4.7 million Rock 'n Play infant sleepers following reports that 32 infants had died in Rock 'n Plays since 2011. Some of the infants rolled over while unrestrained, and some were unable to breathe because of their position. Other companies have since recalled their inclined sleepers\u2014now linked to more than 50 deaths, accord - ing to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)\u2014but some manu - facturers are still selling the products. \"Many babies have died because their sleep-deprived parents trusted those products,\" Dr. Karp says. \"Parents trying to comply with the back-to-sleep advice have yielded to the dangers of rockers because their babies don't sleep well on their backs.\" The AAP has called on the CPSC to take action against the remain - ing products on store shelves to prevent further tragedies. Dr. Karp says he thought that an automatically rocking crib with a flat surface could create a safe environment for sleep. He and his wife, Nina Monte\u00e9 Karp, cofounder of their company, Happiest Baby, decided to invent one. That led to a collaboration with indus - trial designer Yves B\u00e9har and Deb Roy, Ph.D., director of the Laboratory for Social Machines at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 2016, after \"many, many prototypes,\" Dr. Karp says, the SNOO smart bassinet was born. The robotic crib has since found its way to homes across the United States, Canada, and Australia. To date, babies have safely slept in the SNOO for more than 40 million hours, Dr. Karp says. \"There are people in this world who are always looking for better ways to do things,\" says Gordon F . Tomaselli, M.D., the Marilyn and Stanley M. Katz Dean at Einstein. \"That's Harvey Karp. He has taken his expertise in pediatrics and applied innovation to it.\" THE HUMAN FACE OF MEDICINE Dr. Karp set his sights on becom - ing a doctor at a young age. \"I was always socially conscious and wanting to understand how things work,\" he MOTIVATIONS | CONTINUED CONNECTION says. Medicine seemed like a natural fit\u2014and Einstein, with its high level of academics and what Dr. Karp calls \"attention to the social environment,\" was the perfect place for him to study. While at Einstein he learned not only about the science of medicine, but also about what it takes to assume the mantle of physician and healer. \"I was taught that providing healthcare was a privilege,\" he says. \"People who are ill are in a vulnerable position, and it's our responsibility to treat them with respect. As students we were given opportunities to get into the commu - nity and meet with patients, to see the human face of medicine,\" he adds. Because they saw so many Spanish- speaking patients, Dr. Karp joined with other students to hire a tutor and learn the language. \"We had class every week and ate lunch together to improve our Spanish-speaking skills,\" he says. \"That way we could talk directly to our patients without having an interpreter in the middle.\" Perhaps the most formative aspect of his medical training, he says, was \"realizing the joy of discovery.\" He still vividly recalls learning neuroanatomy as a first-year student from Dominick Purpura, M.D., who would later go on to serve as dean of Einstein for 22 years (page 6). Throughout the semester, Dr. Karp says, \"Dr. Purpura periodically displayed a picture of a smiling boy and asked: 'What's wrong with Grant?'\" At the end of the semester, Dr. Purpura shared Grant's diagnosis: He had severe hydrocephalus. Fluid filled the space where his brain should be; his brain tissue was limited to a narrow band around the inside of his skull. \"And yet, Grant appeared smiling before us, looking entirely normal,\" \"To this day, pediatric books say that colic is a mysterious condition. But I believe the chief cause is clear: too little rhythmic stimulation.\" \u2014 DR. HARVEY KARP Courtesy of HarperCollins Publishers 50 EINSTEIN : SUMMER/FALL 2019Dr. Karp says. \"It is a medical mystery. How could this boy lack so much of the brain yet act almost normally? Dr. Purpura's message was clear: We know so much yet have so much to learn.\" THE COLIC CONUNDRUM By his second year of medical school, Dr. Karp had decided to go into pediat - rics. He would later do groundbreaking research on what his youngest patients were trying to communicate with their cries. \"I've always been attracted to unsolved problems,\" he says. \"To this day, pediatric books say that colic is a mysterious condition. But I believe the chief cause is clear: too little rhythmic stimulation.\" Daphne Hsu, M.D., chief of the division of pediatric cardiology at Montefiore and professor of pediatrics at Einstein, agrees with Dr. Karp that colic can be treated. \"Sometimes babies cry excessively because they are unable to soothe themselves as they adjust to life outside the womb,\" she says. \"In utero they are used to falling asleep with movement and noise around them. They respond to maneuvers that mimic that environment to help them go to sleep peacefully.\" Dr. Karp's study of colic revealed that infants are born with a \"calming reflex,\" an irresistible response to stimuli that mimics the womb: swaddling that cre - ates a snug feeling, shushing that sounds like blood flow, and gentle jiggling like what the baby experienced when Mom moved through her day. Dr. Karp's books and videos offer techniques that parents can use to recreate that comfort - ing environment. \"Harvey's innovation is that it's baby- focused,\" Dr. Hsu says. \"The idea is to make the baby more comfortable and, if Dr. Harvey Karp places an infant in the SNOO, a flat-surfaced robotic bassinet he invented that gently rocks a baby to sleep. you can do that, parents become more comfortable, too.\" LIFE'S WORK HONORED Ultimately, Dr. Karp says he thinks that the SNOO robotic bassinet will do more than just give harried par - ents a break. He says that studies now underway and others set to start soon will explore potential SNOO benefits, including preventing SIDS and postpar - tum depression and improving care for premature infants. But even without that evidence, improving sleep has clear benefits\u2014 and not just for babies. \"When babies sleep better, parents sleep better,\" Dr. Tomaselli says. \"That's so important for mental and physical health.\" Impressed by Dr. Karp's lifetime of work, Einstein's Board of Governors honored him as a finalist for Einstein's Distinguished Alumnus award this year. \"It's a prestigious award, given our his - tory of graduates who have gone on to have a profound impact in the medical sciences,\" Dr. Tomaselli says. \"Dr. Karp continues in that tradition by applying advancements in science to improving people's lives.\" Courtesy of Happiest Baby, Inc.

Once clinics are up and running, costs are covered by Medicaid or other insurance; city, state, and federal funds; and grants.

In my experience, the reason that programs are successful is that the community takes ownership.\" This approach has resulted in more- effective\u2014and more-efficient\u2014health - care for children. Emergency room visits and hospitalizations for children with asthma dropped by half after students started receiving treatment through the MSHP . Hospital costs for children with diabetes were cut by nearly one-third. Dr. Chhabra is especially proud of the MSHP's mental health outreach for issues such as anxiety and depres - sion. \"Students are better prepared to ask for help when they need it\u2014and to actually receive care before problems become more severe,\" she says. Nearly all students referred for mental-health help follow up with counselors in their schools. Before that was available, only about one in 10 of those referred actu - ally sought help in the community.

MOTIVATIONS | SPOTLIGHT 58 EINSTEIN : SUMMER/FALL 2019A MODEL FOR THE NATION While the MSHP's record in the Bronx is impressive, Dr. Chhabra plans to standardize programs so that they can easily be adopted by other cities. \"We have the opportunity to be a model for the nation,\" she says. Achieving those ambitious goals requires investment from both public and private partners. \"School health can be transformative,\" Dr. Chhabra says. \"It becomes the heart of health for the community. If we can secure the funding to make that happen, the payoff is huge.\" Mrs. Aronson, who has spent time at MSHP centers in the Bronx, says that she could easily see the model replicated in other cities. \"I have worked in other high-need cities, and I can say with certainty that a model like this could change the trajectory of children's health outcomes and contribute to family sta - bility at remarkable scale,\" she says. \"We have something that can really move the needle\u2014and, with the right partners and supporters in place, trans - form entire communities,\" she adds. But for her, the real measure of success is students such as Ms. Lye, who, Mrs. Aronson says, \"go on to college and career and pay it forward.\" Ms. Lye, who is now in college, says that her experience with the program cemented her plans to pursue a career in nursing. \"It opened my eyes. When you give students the resources to take care of their health, they're better equipped to create healthy communities.\" Advocacy Work at City, State, and Federal Levels Key to the success of Montefiore's School Health Program (MSHP) has been the advocacy and public policy work at the city, state, and federal levels. MSHP is a lead member of the New York School-Based Health Alliance (SBHA), which has been instrumental in advancing these efforts. The New York SBHA is part of the national SBHA, founded in 1995, which serves as a voice for school-based healthcare programs across the country. By providing resources, training, and advocacy for health and education partnerships, with a particular focus on the school-based health clinic model, the New York SBHA is a strong voice in supporting common standards, encourag - ing experiential learning, and inspiring young people to take responsibility for their own health. MSHP partnered with the Primary Care Development Corporation to develop the first national standards for school-based health centers, adopted nationwide in November 2017.

Keidan and Emad Eskandar, M.D., would ever cross paths. The former is a septuagenarian Jew from India who runs an investment manage - ment firm in Manhattan. The latter is a 50-something Coptic Christian from Egypt who practices neurosurgery in the Bronx. And yet these two men, from different countries, cultures, generations, and professions, share an interest in rais - ing neurological surgery at Einstein and Montefiore to new heights. INVESTOR AND PHILANTHROPIST Mr. Keidan was born into the small community of Baghdadi Jews of Bombay (now Mumbai) who migrated from Iraq to India in the late 1700s. Mr. Keidan left home for the United States in 1962 to study at Harvard College and then at Harvard Business School. Degrees in hand, he landed a job at Wertheim & Co., a Manhattan investment bank. A little over a dec - ade later, he launched his own com - pany, now called Buckingham Capital Management, which he runs to this day. As Mr. Keidan prospered, he made a point of supporting Jewish organi - zations, mostly those affiliated with Harvard\u2014taking up the mantle of his ancestors, the affluent and philanthropic Sassoon family of India, often called the \"Rothschilds of the East.\" In the early 2000s, Mr. Keidan began search - ing for a worthy cause closer to home. John Gutfreund, a longtime member of the Montefiore Board of T rustees, suggested he look at Montefiore. \"The more I looked into it, the more I liked it\u2014a hospital started by Jewish phi - lanthropists, for Jewish doctors that other hospitals would not hire, to serve patients other institutions could not, or would not, help,\" Mr. Keidan says. \"Its mission was, and is, a perfect example of 'tikkun olam,' or 'repair of the world.'\" His first visit to Montefiore was to the Center for Abused Women and Children. \"That went right to my heart,\" says Mr. Keidan, who joined the Board of T rustees in 2004. Later, he decided to support the pediatric critical- care unit, now named after him and his wife, Georgia. In recent days, Mr. Keidan has turned his philanthropic attention to neurological diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, stroke, and depression. \"These are growing problems for our aging population, with a devastating impact on families as well as patients,\" he says. \"We have a first-rate, interdis - ciplinary team at Montefiore to address these issues, and I want to do what I can \u2014 DAVID B.

Keidan, above left, attend an event benefiting the Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care at Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, New York. MAGAZINE.EINSTEIN.YU.EDU 61to help this institution develop cutting- edge treatments.\" Mr. Keidan's latest gift to Montefiore is an endowment to establish the David B. Keidan Chair in Neurological Surgery, which Dr. Eskandar now holds. At Einstein, Dr. Eskandar is also the Jeffrey P . Bergstein Chair in Neurological Surgery in the Leo M. Davidoff Department of Neurological Surgery. \"I'm proud of what this institution has done,\" Mr. Keidan says. \"Not only has our great leadership team created a unique model for community care, which has attracted the attention of Albany and Washington, D.C., but it also had the foresight to invest very early in electronic health records, which has put us at the forefront of leverag - ing health data for better care and better management. \"I admire the goals and the effective - ness of our community programs, which have done things like reduce unwanted pregnancies in schools, improve access to fresh, healthy foods, and reach into homes to take care of patients who are too sick to come to us,\" he says. \"This is unconventional medicine, outside the usual hospital mandate. But then, we are not a 'usual' hospital. The Bronx is a melting pot par excellence\u2014much like Montefiore and Einstein. Different perspectives, cultures, and ideas allow for synergies that can and do repair the world.\" A CLASSIC IMMIGRANT TALE The first physician to hold the David B. Keidan Chair in Neurological Surgery is, like Mr. Keidan himself, an immigrant who has risen to the highest ranks of his chosen profession. Emad Eskandar was just 9 years old when his family left Egypt for Nebraska, seeking religious freedom and economic opportunity. A lover of all things scientific, Dr. Eskandar found that a career in neuro - surgery was ideally suited to his talents. After completing his training, he joined the faculty at Harvard Medical School and over the next 18 years developed a reputation as one of the world's top neurosurgeons, specializing in the treat - ment of epilepsy, trigeminal neuralgia, Parkinson's disease, and brain tumors, employing and refining such advanced techniques as deep-brain stimulation, keyhole surgery, and stereotactic electro - encephalography. He also ran a basic- science laboratory, studying the basal ganglia, a cluster of brain neurons that plays a role in learning, motivation, depression, and drug addiction. In 2018, Dr. Eskandar joined Einstein and Montefiore. \"I enjoyed my time at Harvard, but I felt there was a tremendous opportunity here in the Bronx to develop new clinical programs, promote new research, and reach out to a much broader group of patients,\" he says. \"Neurological surgery is quite strong at Einstein and Montefiore,\" Dr. Eskandar adds. \"However, there's a huge mismatch between the scope of the department and the size of the popula - tion we serve, especially with the expan - sion of Montefiore's health system.\" Under Dr. Eskandar's leadership, Montefiore has opened a comprehen - sive stroke center (the only one between the Bronx and Albany, New York) and a comprehensive spine center (a joint effort with the departments of orthope - dics and rehabilitation medicine). There are also plans for a center for surgical optimization within the spine center, a neurovascular center, and a skull-based- tumor center. \"I enjoyed my time at Harvard, but I felt there was a tremendous opportunity here in the Bronx to develop new clinical programs, promote new research, and reach out to a much broader group of patients.\"MOTIVATIONS | YOUR IMPACT \u2014 DR.

Emad Eskandar, left, and Patrick LaSala, vice chair of neurosurgery, prepare the first implant of a responsive neurostim - ulator to treat epilepsy at Montefiore. In addition, Dr. Eskandar intends to invest heavily in research. \"I'm a sci - entist at heart, injecting research into everything I do,\" he says. \"This is where the resources of the Keidan chair are invaluable,\" he adds. \"Many people don't realize that the National Institutes of Health, the largest funder of biomedical research, tends to support fairly well estab - lished ideas\u2014but not the edge-of-the- envelope studies that can transform healthcare. With the Keidan family's generous support, we'll be able to study new paradigms, such as neuro - modulation [the application of electri - cal currents to modify parts of the brain], for the treatment of addiction, Alzheimer's, and other devastating diseases.\"Unconventional thinking is nothing new for Dr. Eskandar. In 2014, he earned a master's degree in business administration from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, seeking to apply the principles of busi - ness management to healthcare. \"There's a whole body of knowl - edge about optimizing systems in dif - ferent industries. We can learn lessons from this work and use it to better manage everything from emergency rooms to operating rooms to imaging suites,\" he says. \"Healthcare is notori - ously complicated and inefficient. We need new fixes.\" \"With the Keidan family's generous support, we'll be able to study new paradigms, such as neuromodulation, for the treatment of addiction, Alzheimer's, and other devastating diseases.\" \u2014 DR.

EXAMINING THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF SPACE TRAVEL The two identical-twin NASA astronauts made for the perfect case-control study: Mark Kelly stayed on Earth while Scott spent a year on the International Space Station. Francine Garrett-Bakelman, M.D./ Ph.D. '05 , was a first coauthor on a Science paper published in April that compared how they fared. Before, during, and after Scott's flight, Dr. Garrett-Bakelman, assistant professor of medicine and of bio - chemistry and molecular genetics at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, and her team evaluated both brothers, assessing the molecular and physiological traits that space travel may affect. One focus was on possible changes in the length of telomeres, the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes that get smaller with each cell division and with age. During Scott's space flight, his telomeres became significantly longer than Mark's but shortened rapidly to near preflight length upon his return to earth. Adverse effects from space travel included DNA damage and reduced cognitive function. \"Still, most things we looked at did not change during space travel,\" Dr. Garrett-Bakelman says. \"Or if they did change, they later returned to their preflight state, suggesting that human health can mostly be sustained over a longer spaceflight, which is reassuring.\" Dr. Garrett-Bakelman, a physician-scientist who runs a cancer research lab concentrating on acute myeloid leukemia, says she hopes the NASA study forms the basis \"for many more to come.\" Mark Kelly, left, a NASA astronaut, served as the control for Dr. Garrett- Bakelman's study while his twin brother, Scott, spent a year in space.Francine Garrett-Bakelman, M.D./Ph.D. '05 Courtesy of NASACourtesy 671990s Marcy Goldstein, M.D. '90 , has for the past seven years been chosen as the \"Best Dermatologist\" in Bergen County, New Jersey, in a reader poll for the Jewish Standard .

Study partici - pants had as good, if not better, results with the diet. Dr. Zalvan was again lead author in a study published in January 2019 in Laryngoscope showing that the use of nasal irrigation, topical nasal anti - histamines/steroids, and a plant-based Mediterranean-style diet with alkaline water was effective in stopping chronic neurogenic coughing without the use of systemic medication. Dr. Zalvan, from ENT and Allergy Associates, serves as the medical director for the Institute for Voice and Swallowing Disorders at Phelps Hospital in Sleepy Hollow, New York, and professor of otolaryngology at New York Medical College, Valhalla. 2000s Philip Green, M.D. '06 , recently opened an interventional cardiology practice in Elmwood Park, New Jersey, expand - ing Columbia University Irving Medical Center's presence.

In this image, the drug rapamycin has eliminated differentiated tumor cells from the small intestine of a Lynch syndrome mouse model, but two types of cancer stem cells have resisted rapamycin: Lgr5+ (green) and Bmil+ (purple) stem cells. (Also visible are Lgr5+ stem cell-associated Paneth cells, in red.) Tumors return when rapamycin therapy is stopped\u2014and Lgr5+ cells, in particular, are suspected of regenerating tumors. Winfried Edelmann, Ph.D., and colleagues are studying a drug that makes Lgr5+ cells sensitive to rapamycin by inhibiting the membrane pro - tein MDR1 (multi-drug resistance 1), which pumps out rapamycin and other anticancer drugs.
