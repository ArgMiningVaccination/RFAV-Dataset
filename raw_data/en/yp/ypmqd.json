The team used the CRISPR/Cas 9 method to culture and screen millions of human cells and then identified doz -ens of previously undiscovered genes that promote cellular aging from more than20,000humangenes. Through repeated screening, KAT 7 was finally identified to promote aging. Its testing experiment confirmed that when the gene was partially inactivated in the livers of elderly mice, 81percent of them could live for more than 130 weeks,whichcomparestoabout 80hu- manyears. Liu explained that KAT 7is an epi- geneticenzyme.Whenthegeneisinhib - ited or turned off its molecular switch, human stem cells age at a slower rate, even reversing some effects of aging to someextent.Inactivated KAT 7Gene Could DelayAgingChinese mainland has nearly dou - bleditsshareofhighlycitedresearchers in four years, according to Clarivate Plc, a global leader in providing solutions to acceleratethelifecycleofinnovation.

The contest gathers stories from foreigners living across China and reveal compre - hensive and real life scenarios from across the country to the public at large. Despite the different nationalities and backgrounds of the writers, they have made China their second homeand become motivated by the innova - tion and entrepreneurial opportunities in the country. A total of 55foreigners from25countries contributed to the contest. The articles were published on social media platforms in China and in - ternationally receiving a positive re - sponse. Based on the number of social me - dia likes, views and website votes the contest received, five winners were se - lected:SmitaandRoshanfromIndia,Sz - abolcs from Hungary, Bong from the Philippines and Karla from the UnitedStates; five other contestants from South Africa, France, Spain, the Philip - pines and the Czech Republic won the additionalSpecialAward. With their personal experiences, the essays convey life in China from a perspective of an expat's eyes, making the country more understandable to a foreign audience.

My eyes were opened, not to how different we were, but how similar we were to the Chinese people. I recog - nized the same personalities in my Chinese students as American students. They had the same humor, fears, dreams, talents and interests as we do. I learned that even though our politics may be different, our people are the same. I learned to love the Chinese peo - ple, and even their food. I met so many wonderful, kind and helpful peo - ple. I still remember my students by name. I remember the kind lady we bought fruit from on the street. I re - member the gentleman who cooked such delicious noodles for us in one of the narrow alleys near our home.
