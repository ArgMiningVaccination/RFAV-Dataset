The decision comes as COVID-19 cases across North Carolina have risen rapidly in recent weeks. The University had previously announced the lifting of mask mandates heading into the fall semester, but the rise of Delta variant cases and low percentage of vaccinated individuals in the area has presented cause for concern, according to Dr. Dennis Bazemore, vice president for student life and head of the safety committee. \"It's unfortunate that we're having to make this decision, but regardless of how we feel about these restrictions, the safety and well-being of our campus community is always a top priority,\" Bazemore said. The announcement comes on the heels of tighter safety recommendations made by the CDC on Wednesday and the North Carolina governor's latest executive order, which fell short of a statewide mask mandate but did put vaccination mandates on state employees. Campbell will not require students, faculty or staff to be vaccinated, but University officials continue to strongly encourage vaccination. Upon their return in the fall, students will be required to show proof of vaccination using the [University Self-Report form](https://www.campbell.edu/coronavirus/campus-health/report-your-covid-19-vaccination/) or proof to have tested negative for COVID-19 within 48 hours of returning to campus. Students who have not been fully vaccinated or have not submitted a negative COVID-19 test within 48 hours of their arrival on campus will have an opportunity on campus to receive a [rapid-result COVID test](https://campbell.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_862X7Q0o2GI1W0l). The campus mask mandate is the only change the University announced on Friday. Currently, capacity limits have been lifted in all classrooms, meeting areas and events, until further notice. "}
