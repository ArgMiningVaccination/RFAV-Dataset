We monitor the situation closely and update these policies as conditions evolve. UPDATED January 17, 2023 OVERALL GUIDELINES - Central synagogue encourages but does not require mask-wearing as masks are a proven method to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We maintain a separate mask only section for those who prefer this option. - Central Synagogue continues to require full vaccination for entry into our facilities. Vaccination status is determined by the number of doses and boosters recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) based on age group and health status. We require at least three shots for all people over five years of age. We do not conduct vaccination checks at the entry to worship services and rely on the honor system. - We have resumed hosting events with food service, including our Shabbat Oneg. - LCLJ and Nursery School Programs: No changes to our protocols are currently planned, but schools will reach out directly with any changes.
