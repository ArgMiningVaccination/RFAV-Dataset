I can't say enough, how her tenacity and passion for children with eating disorders is her true mission. She has and will continue to save our Daughter's life. She's only 11 and needed a Dr. to tell her about Anorexia in a way she understood. She tells us what our daughter needs to be healthy, is a support for us as parents, and also has the warm heart to make her patients feel heard and supported. We were stuck in neutral for months, with our Daughter's eating disorder, before Dr. Breuner came into our lives. She is simply THE BEST!! - I saw Dr. Breuner for the first time in 2012. I was 14 years old and had just told my mom that I felt unable to eat food without hating myself. She promptly brought me to Seattle Children's, where Cora met me with more empathy than I ever could have imagined. I cannot stress this enough: Dr. Breuner saved my life. I am 7 years free of relapse due to her diligence, which is EXTREMELY rare for anorexia survivors. I am forever indebted to her. She even inspired my college thesis. Love her. - My favorite doctor by far. Has worked with me my whole life. She is very supportive. - I cannot express how much I love Cora. I had multiple issues which brought me to children's, and Cora was head of my care team, always pointing us in the right direction of what to do next. She is so fun, caring, spunky and compassionate. I've never felt like a doctor has actually cared about me on a deeper level than just being a patient... until I met Dr. Cora Breuner. Love her to death. - Dr. Breuner is amazing! Best doctor I have had ever! She is so kind and so caring. She actually listens to you and makes you feel like the best patient. Has helped me so much in the Biofeedback program at Seattle Childrens! Highly, highly recommend her! - Dr. Breuner was completely wonderful with my son. - Dr. Breuner is amazing! She was so welcoming, positive, proactive, and has a wonderful personality. Very kind and understanding of both myself and my teenager. Both my daughter and I felt very hopefully of the program and with Cora - - Award Name Award Description Awarded By Award Date SEATTLE TOP DOCTOR - 2022 Seattle Magazine 2022 Seattle Top Doctor - 2019 Seattle Magazine 2019 SEATTLE TOP DOCTOR - 2018 Seattle Magazine 2018 SEATTLE TOP DOCTOR - 2017 Seattle Magazine 2017 SEATTLE TOP DOCTOR - 2016 Seattle Magazine 2016 Seattle Top Doctor 2016 Seattle Met Magazine 2016 SEATTLE TOP DOCTOR - 2015 Seattle Met Magazine 2015 SEATTLE MAGAZINE TOP DOCTOR - 2015 Seattle Magazine 2015 SEATTLE MAGAZINE TOP DOCTOR - 2014 Seattle Magazine 2014 Seattle Magazine Top Doctor - 2013 Seattle Magazine 2013 Seattle Magazine Top Doctor - 2012 Seattle Magazine Top Doctor - 2012 Seattle Magazine 2012 U.S. News Top Doctor U.S. News and World Report 2012 Top Doctor - Seattle Magazine Seattle Magazine Jan 1, 2009 - Other Publications - McCarty RL, Weber WJ, CComplementary and alternative medicine use and quality of life in pediatric diabetes. 20180689 Journal of alternative and complementary medicine (New York, N.Y.), 2010 Feb. : 165-73 - Kemper KJ, Breuner CCComplementary, holistic, and integrative medicine: headaches. 20124273 Pediatrics in review / American Academy of Pediatrics, 2010 Feb. : e17-23 - Rosen LD, Breuner CCPrimary care from infancy to adolescence. 18061779 Pediatric clinics of North America, 2007 Dec. : 837-58; ix - Breuner CCAlternative and complementary therapies. 17030278 Adolescent medicine clinics, 2006 Oct. : 521-46; abstract ix - Breuner CCNatural contraception. 16183542 Adolescent medicine clinics, 2005 Oct. : 603-16 - Breuner CC, Smith MS, Womack WMFactors related to school absenteeism in adolescents with recurrent headache. 15012658 Headache, 2004 March : 217-22 - Breuner CCThe adolescent traveler. 12687903 Primary care, 2002 Dec. : 983-1006 - Breuner CCComplementary medicine in pediatrics: a review of acupuncture, homeopathy, massage, and chiropractic therapies. 12486401 Current problems in pediatric and adolescent health care, 2002 Nov. : 353-84 - - Presentations Title Event Location Date Complementary Medicine, Nutritional Supplements and Eating Disorders University of Wisconsin Madison, WI Sep 1, 2009 Adolescent Updates University of Washington School of Medicine Family Practice Review Seattle, WA Jun 1, 2009 Strategies for Managing the Difficult Adolescent Patient PAS workshop Baltimore, MD May 1, 2009 Predictor and Patterns of Complementary and Alternative Medicine utilization among Washington state SEARCH for Diabetes in youth participants North American Research Conference on Complementary and Integrative Medicine Minneapolis, Minnesota May 1, 2009 Nutrition Supplements in teens Nursing conference unkonwn Mar 1, 2009 Sport Performance and Nutritional Supplements Lynn Staheli Annual Orthopedic Meeting Seattle, WA Jan 1, 2009 - Grant Title Grantor Amount Award Date 5T32 DK63687 NIH Jul 1, 2007 Biofeedback and headache research with Heidi Blume 1.
