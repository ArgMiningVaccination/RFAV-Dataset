It is extremely important to use these data to increase our knowledge on the safety of adjuvanted vaccines during pregnancy. It will provide valuable information needed to estimate the risk of the use of such adjuvanted vaccines during pregnancy. This will aid the benefit-risk evaluation and may change the recommendations on the use of these vaccines during pregnancy. In addition to these clinical data, it is also important to perform animal studies on the safety of the adjuvanted vaccines, with special attention to the effects of primary vaccination and early pregnancy. We hope that the discussion on the safety of the use of adjuvanted vaccines may change the design of nonclinical reproductive toxicity testing of vaccines. We anticipate that more knowledge on the mechanisms of action of adjuvants, and of their effects on the Th1/Th2 balance in particular, will become available. This might also increase the confidence in the estimation of the risk of the use of adjuvanted vaccines during pregnancy. Moreover, more fundamental research on the function of the immune system in establishing and maintaining a successful pregnancy is ongoing, which will lead to a better understanding of the immunological paradox of pregnancy.
