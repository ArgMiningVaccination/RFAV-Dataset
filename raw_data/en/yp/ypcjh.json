SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Actof 1986 (Pub. L. 99 -660), as amended by section 708 of Public Law 103 -183, added section 2126 to the Public HealthService Act. Section 2126, codified at 42U.S.C. 300aa-26, requires the Secretaryof Health and Human Services todevelop and disseminate vaccineinformation materials for distribution byall health care providers in the UnitedStates to any patient (or to the parent orlegal representative in the case of achild) receiving vaccines covered underthe National Vaccine InjuryCompensation Program. Development and revision of the vaccine information materials have beendelegated by the Secretary to the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention(CDC). Section 2126 requires that thematerials be developed, or revised, afternotice to the public, with a 60-daycomment period, and in consultationwith the Advisory Commission onChildhood Vaccines, appropriate healthcare provider and parent organizations,and the Food and Drug Administration.The law also requires that theinformation contained in the materialsbe based on available data andinformation, be presented inunderstandable terms, and include: (1) A concise description of the benefits of the vaccine, (2) A concise description of the risks associated with the vaccine, (3) A statement of the availability of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and (4) Such other relevant information as may be determined by the Secretary. The vaccines initially covered under the National Vaccine InjuryCompensation Program were diphtheria,tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps,rubella, and poliomyelitis vaccines.Since April 15, 1992, any health careprovider in the United States whointends to administer one of thesecovered vaccines is required to providecopies of the relevant vaccineinformation materials prior toadministration of any of these vaccines.Since June 1, 1999, health careproviders are also required to providecopies of vaccine information materialsfor the following vaccines that wereadded to the National Vaccine use of the vaccineinformation materials and copies of thematerials can be found on the CDCwebsite at: http://www.cdc.gov/nip/publications/VIS/. In addition, singlecamera-ready copies are available fromState health departments. A list of Statehealth department contacts for obtainingcopies of these materials is included ina December 17, 1999 Federal Register notice (64 FR 70914). Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Information Materials With the December 18, 1999, addition of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine tothe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, CDC, asrequired under 42 U.S.C. 300aa-26, isproposing vaccine information materialscovering that vaccine, which areincluded in this notice. Revised Vaccine Information Materials for Diphtheria, Tetanus, AcellularPertussis (DTaP/DT) Vaccines andHepatitis B Vaccine This notice also includes proposed revised vaccine information materialsfor diphtheria, tetanus and acellularpertussis vaccines (other than Tdvaccine) and hepatitis B vaccine. The DTaP/DT materials are being revised to remove references to DTP(whole cell pertussis-containingvaccine) because this vaccine is nolonger used in the United States. Inaddition, these proposed revisedmaterials reflect a new adverse eventprofile for DTaP, including updatedadverse event information on acellularpertussis vaccine. The hepatitis B materials are being revised to note a recently approved twodose schedule for administration toadolescents 11 to 15 years of age as analternative to the three dose schedule.Interim revised hepatitis B vaccineinformation materials were published ina September 1, 2000 Federal Register notice (65 FR 53316) for use pendingcompletion of the formal revisionprocess. Development of New/Revised Vaccine Information Materials The proposed vaccine information materials included in this notice weredrafted in consultation with theAdvisory Commission on ChildhoodVaccines, the Food and DrugAdministration, the American Academyof Pediatrics, American PharmaceuticalAssociation, Association of AmericanIndian Physicians, Every Child by Two,Immunization Action Coalition,Immunization, Education and ActionCommittee, Infectious Disease Society ofAmerica, National Association forPediatric Nurse Associates andPractitioners and the National VaccineAdvisory Committee. Also, CDCprovided copies of the draft materials toother organizations and sought theirconsultation; however, thoseorganizations did not providecomments. Comments provided by theconsultants were considered drafting VerDate / Vol. 66, No. 44 / Tuesday, March 6, 2001 / Notices the proposed vaccine information materials included in this notice. We invite written comment on the proposed vaccine information materialsthat follow, entitled ''Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine: What You Need toKnow, '' ''Diphtheria, Tetanus & Pertussis Vaccines: What You Need toKnow, '' and ''Hepatitis B Vaccine: What You Need to Know. '' Comments submitted will be considered infinalizing these materials. When thefinal materials are published in theFederal Register , the notice will include an effective date for their use. We also propose to revise the December 17, 1999, Instructions for Useof Vaccine Information Materials(Vaccine Information Statements), andinterim instructions dated September 6,2000, to add the requirement for use ofthe pneumococcal conjugate vaccineinformation materials and to note thenew edition dates for the revisedvaccine information materials coveringdiphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTaP/DT)vaccines and hepatitis B vaccine. Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine: What You Need to Know 1. Why Get Vaccinated? Pneumococcal disease is a serious disease that causes sickness and death.In fact, it is the leading cause ofbacterial meningitis in the UnitedStates. (Meningitis is a serious infectionof the covering of the brain). Each year pneumococcal disease causes in children under five: 17,000 cases of invasive disease, including 700 cases of meningitis About 5 million ear infections About 200 deaths It can also lead to other health problems, including: Pneumonia Deafness Brain damage Children under 2 years old are at highest risk for serious disease. Pneumococcus bacteria are spread from person to person through closecontact. Pneumococcal infections can be hard to treat because some bacteria havebecome resistant to drugs that have beenused to treat them. This makesprevention of the disease even moreimportant. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine can prevent serious pneumococcal disease,such as meningitis and blood infections.It also prevents some ear infections. Butear infections have many causes, andpneumococcal vaccine is effectiveagainst only some of them.2. Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is approved for infants and toddlers.Protection lasts at least 3 years, sochildren who are vaccinated as infantswill be protected when they are atgreatest risk for serious disease. Some older children and adults may get a different vaccine calledpneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.There is a separate Vaccine InformationStatement for people getting thepneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. 3. Who Should Get the Vaccine and When? Children under 2 years of age: 2 months 4 months 6 months 12-15 months Children who weren 't vaccinated at these ages can still get the vaccine. Thenumber of doses needed depends on thechild 's age. Ask your health care provider for details. Children between 2 and 5 years of age: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is also recommended for children between2 and 5 years old who have not alreadygotten the vaccine and are at high riskof serious pneumococcal disease. Thisincludes children who: Have sickle cell disease, Have a damaged spleen or no spleen, Have HIV/AIDS, Have other diseases that affect the immune system, such as diabetes,cancer, or liver disease, or Take medications that affect the immune system, such aschemotherapy or steroids. Other children who are at increased risk of serious pneumococcal diseaseinclude those who: Are under 3 years of age, Are of Alaska Native, American Indian or African American descent,or Attend group day care. The number of doses needed depends on the child 's age. Ask your health care provider for more details. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine may be given at the same time as otherroutine childhood vaccines. 4. Some Children Should Not Get Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine orShould Wait Children should not get pneumococcal conjugate vaccine if theyhad a severe (life-threatening) allergicreaction to a previous dose of thisvaccine, or have a severe allergy to avaccine component. Tell your health-care provider if your child has ever hada severe reaction to any vaccine, or has any severe allergies. Children with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. But childrenwho are moderately or severely illshould usually wait until they recoverbefore getting the vaccine. 5. What Are the Risks From Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine? In clinical trials (nearly 60,000 doses), pneumococcal conjugate vaccine wasassociated with only mild reactions: Up to about 1 infant out of 4 had redness, tenderness, or swelling wherethe shot was given. About 1 out of 3 had a fever of over 100.4 \u00b0F, and up to about 1 in 50 had a higher fever (over 102.2 \u00b0F). Some children also became fussy or drowsy, or had a loss of appetite. So far, no moderate or severe reactions have been associated with thisvaccine. However, a vaccine, like anymedicine, could cause serious problems,such as a severe allergic reaction. Therisk of this vaccine causing seriousharm, or death, is extremely small. 6. What If There Is a Moderate or Severe Reaction? What Should I Look For? Look for any unusual condition, such as a serious allergic reaction, high fever,or unusual behavior. Serious allergic reactions are extremely rare with any vaccine. If onewere to occur, it would be within a fewminutes to a few hours after the shot.Signs can include difficulty breathing,hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness,weakness, a fast heart beat, dizziness,and swelling of the throat. What Should I Do? Call a doctor or get the person to a doctor right away. Tell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, andwhen the vaccination was given. Ask your health care provider to file a Vaccine Adverse Event ReportingSystem (VAERS) form, or call VAERSyourself at 1 -800-822-7967. 7. The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program In the rare event that you or your child has a serious reaction to a vaccine,a federal program has been created tohelp pay for the care of those who havebeen harmed. For details about the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, call 1 - 800-338-2382 or visit their website at http://www.hrsa.gov/bhpr/vicp VerDate / Vol. 66, No. 44 / Tuesday, March 6, 2001 / Notices 8. How Can I Learn More? Ask your doctor or nurse. They can give you the vaccine package insertor suggest other sources ofinformation. Call your local or state health department 's immunization program. Contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): \u2014Call 1 -800-232-2522 (English) or 1-800-232-0233 (Espan ol) \u2014Visit the National Immunization Program 's website at http:// www.cdc.gov/nip U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Centers for Disease Control andPrevention, National ImmunizationProgram Diphtheria, Tetanus & Pertussis Vaccines: What You Need To Know 1. Why Get Vaccinated? Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis are serious diseases caused by bacteria.Diphtheria and pertussis are spreadfrom person to person. Tetanus entersthe body through cuts or wounds. Diphtheria causes a thick covering in the back of the throat. It can lead to breathing problems, paralysis, heart failure, and even death. Tetanus (Lockjaw) causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually allover the body. It can lead to ''locking '' of the jaw so the victim cannot open his mouth orswallow. Tetanus leads to death inabout 3 out of 10 cases. Pertussis (Whooping Cough) causes coughing spells so bad that it is hard forinfants to eat, drink, or breathe. Thesespells can last for weeks. It can lead to pneumonia, seizures (jerking and staring spells), braindamage, and death. Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine (DTaP) can prevent thesediseases. Most children who arevaccinated with DTaP will be protectedthroughout childhood. Many morechildren would get these diseases if westopped vaccinating. DTaP is a safer version of an older vaccine called DTP. DTP is no longerused in the United States. 2. Who Should Get DTaP Vaccine and When? Children should get 5 doses of DTaP vaccine, one dose at each of thefollowing ages: months \u20146 months \u201415-18 months \u20144-6 years DTaP may be given at the same time as other vaccines. 3. Some Children Should Not Get DTaP Vaccine or Should Wait Any child who has had a life- threatening allergic reaction after a doseof DTaP should not get any more doses. Any child who suffered a brain or nervous system disease within 7 daysafter a dose of DTaP should not get anymore doses. Talk with your doctor if your child: \u2014Had a seizure or collapsed after a previous dose of DTaP, \u2014Cried non-stop for 3 hours or more after a previous dose of DTaP, \u2014Had a high fever (over 105 \u00b0F) after a previous dose of DTaP. Children who are moderately or severely ill at the time the shot isscheduled should usually wait untilthey recover before getting DTaPvaccine. Ask your health care provider for more information. Children who shouldnot get the pertussis part of the vaccinecan get a vaccine called DT, whichdoesn 't contain pertussis. 4. Older Children and Adults DTaP should not be given to anyone 7 years of age or older. Pertussis can stillstrike older children, adolescents, andadults, but the pertussis vaccine iscurrently licensed only for childrenunder 7. Adolescents and adults still need protection from tetanus and diphtheria.A booster shot called Td isrecommended at 11 -12 years of age. It should be repeated every 10 years.There is a separate Vaccine InformationStatement for Td vaccine. 5. What Are the Risks From DTaP Vaccine? Getting diphtheria, tetanus, or pertussis disease is much riskier thangetting DTaP vaccine. However, avaccine, like any medicine, is capable ofcausing serious problems, such assevere allergic reactions. The risk ofDTaP vaccine causing serious harm, ordeath, is extremely small. Mild Problems (Common) Fever (up to about 1 child in 4) Redness or swelling where the shot was given (up to about 1 child in 4) Soreness or tenderness where the shot was given (up to about 1 child in 4) These problems occur more often after the 4th and 5th doses of the DTaP seriesthan after earlier doses.Another mild problem is swelling of the arm or leg in which the shot wasgiven, after the 4th or 5th dose (up toabout 1 child in 30). Other mild problems include: Fussiness (up to about 1 child in 3) Tiredness or poor appetite (up to about 1 child in 10) Vomiting (up to about 1 child in 50) These problems generally occur 1 -3 days after the shot. Moderate Problems (Uncommon) Seizure (jerking or staring) (about 1 child out of 14,000) Non-stop crying, for 3 hours or more (up to about 1 child out of 1,000) High fever, over 105 \u00b0F (about 1 child out of 16,000) Severe Problems (Very Rare) Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses) Several other severe problems have been reported after DTaP vaccine.These include: \u2014Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness \u2014Permanent brain damage. These are so rare it is hard to tell if they are caused by the vaccine. Controlling fever is especially important for children who have hadseizures, for any reason. It is alsoimportant if another family member hashad seizures. You can reduce fever and pain by giving your child an aspirin-free painreliever when the shot is given, and forthe next 24 hours, following the packageinstructions. 6. What If There Is a Moderate or Severe Reaction? What Should I Look For? Any unusual conditions, such as a serious allergic reaction, high fever orbehavior changes. Signs of a seriousallergic reaction include difficultybreathing, hoarseness or wheezing,hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heartbeat or dizziness within a few minutesto a few hours after the shot. If a highfever or seizure occurs, it is usuallywithin 2 weeks after the shot. What Should I Do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. Tell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, andwhen the vaccination was given. Ask your doctor, nurse, or health department to file a Vaccine AdverseEvent Reporting System (VAERS) form,or call VAERS yourself at / Vol. 66, No. 44 / Tuesday, March 6, 2001 / Notices 7.

Why Get Vaccinated?Hepatitis B Is a Serious Disease The hepatitis B virus can cause short- term (acute) illness that leads to: Loss of appetite Diarrhea and vomiting Tiredness Jaundice (yellow skin or eyes) Pain in muscles, joints, and stomach It can also cause long-term (chronic) illness that leads to: Liver damage (cirrhosis) Liver cancer Death About 1.25 million people in the U.S. have chronic hepatitis B virus infection.If you are infected as a young child, youare much more likely to develop chronicillness. Each year it is estimated that: 200,000 people, mostly young adults, get infected with hepatitis B virus More than 11,000 people have to stay in the hospital because of hepatitis B 4,000 to 5,000 people die from chronic hepatitis B Hepatitis B vaccine can prevent hepatitis B. It is the first anti-cancervaccine because it can prevent a form ofliver cancer. 2. How Is Hepatitis B Virus Spread? Hepatitis B virus is spread through contact with the blood and body fluidsof an infected person.A person can get infected in several ways, such as: During birth when the virus passes from an infected mother to her baby By having sex with an infected person By injecting illegal drugs By being stuck with a used needle on the job By sharing personal items, such as a razor or toothbrush with an infectedperson People can get hepatitis B infection without knowing how they got it. About 13of hepatitis B cases in the United States have an unknown source. 3. Who Should Get Hepatitis B Vaccine and When? (1) Everyone 18 years of age and younger (2) Adults over 18 who are at risk Adults at risk for hepatitis B infection include people who have more than onesex partner, men who have sex withother men, injection drug users, healthcare workers, and others who might beexposed to infected blood or bodyfluids. If you are not sure whether you are at risk, ask your doctor or nurse. People should get 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine according to the followingschedule. If you miss a dose or get behind schedule, get the next dose assoon as you can. There is no need tostart over. HEPATITISB VACCINATION SCHEDULE When?Who?

Adolescents 11 to 15 years of age may need only two doses of hepatitis Bvaccine, separated by 4 -6 months. Ask your health care provider for details. Hepatitis B vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. 4. Some People Should Not Get Hepatitis B Vaccine or Should Wait People should not get hepatitis B vaccine if they have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to baker 's yeast (the kind used for making bread)or to a previous dose of hepatitis Bvaccine.People who are moderately or severely ill at the time the shot isscheduled should usually wait untilthey recover before getting hepatitis Bvaccine. Ask your doctor or nurse for more information. 5. What Are the Risks From Hepatitis B Vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems,such as severe allergic reactions. Therisk of a vaccine causing serious harm,or death, is extremely small.Getting hepatitis B vaccine is much safer than getting hepatitis B disease. Most people who get hepatitis B vaccine do not have any problems withit.
