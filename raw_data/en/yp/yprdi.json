However, we may carry out the necessary verifications to verify this fact, adopting the corresponding due diligence measures, in accordance with the data protection regulations. Sensitive Data Unless specifically requested, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, on or through the Services or otherwise to us, any Sensitive Personal Data (e.g., social security numbers, national identification number, data related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion, ideological or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background, trade union membership, or administrative or criminal proceedings and sanctions).

The criteria used to determine our retention periods include: \u00b7 The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the Services or if you have a booking that has not yet been fulfilled) \u00b7 Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them) \u00b7 Whether retention is advisable considering our legal position (such as, for statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations) Legitimate interest for processing your data The data processing required in fulfilment of the aforementioned purposes that require the User's consent cannot be undertaken without said consent.
