NDs can perform minor surgery and are trained to utilize prescription drugs, though the emphasis in naturopathic medicine is on natural healing. NDs must adhere to a specific scope of practice as defined by the law in their state. In Oregon, licensed NDs can prescribe drugs when necessary if they have a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Registration; only approved substances that are listed on the formulary compendium can be prescribed. For more information on naturopathic medicine in Oregon, see the [Oregon Board of Naturopathic Medicine website](https://www.oregon.gov/obnm/), or for information on licensure in other states, see the [AANMC site](https://aanmc.org/resources/licensure/). Naturopathic schools of medicine require that applicants successfully complete a specific set of prerequisite courses prior to enrollment. Many also require a baccalaureate degree. Portland State offers a pre-naturopathic program whereby students complete their prerequisite coursework, earn a baccalaureate degree, and obtain assistance with the preparation and application process. Portland State University Pre-Naturopathic Medicine Course List Below is an outline of prerequisite courses which is subject to change. Check directly with schools for current requirements. Students should research the admissions requirements of additional naturopathic medical schools. Most naturopathic schools require an A, B, or C in all prerequisite courses. |Pre-requisite Course(s) ||National University of Naturopathic Medicine (NUNM) |Mathematics and Statistics || | MTH111Z Intro to College Math I or higher math (4 credits) OR STAT243Z Introduction to Probability & Statistics (4 credits) | | MTH111Z Intro to College Math I or higher math (4 credits) |General (inorganic) chemistry with CH223/229 (15credits) Note: Students wishing to enroll in General Chemistry I (CH 221) or Honors General Chemistry I (CH 221H) are required to take the [chemistry placement assessment ](https://www.pdx.edu/chemistry/chemistry-placement-assessment)and must score 90% or higher.
