Toni has created such a safe and inviting space to do such meaningful, impactful, and transformative work towards healing and ridding yourself of negativity or toxicity. Before visiting with Toni, I had taken anti-anxiety/anti-depressants everyday for 10 years. I did not know an adult life without these medications. After my first four sessions working with Toni, I was able to come off of all medications and I am THRIVING. I spent years in talk-therapy and that modality never really scratched the surface in my healing process. I feel so grateful to the dear friend who recommended Toni to me during a dark phase of my life. It has truly changed the trajectory of my life in the best way possible. My journey to healing isn't over and I am so thankful that Toni continues to walk through this with me. Thank you for your wisdom, expertise and compassion in helping me address a wide range of issues related to depression, family relationships, business challenges, and physical illnesses. In so doing, you help me accomplish my work and enjoy my life, for which I am most grateful. "}
