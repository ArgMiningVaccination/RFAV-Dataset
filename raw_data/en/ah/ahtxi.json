REIKI Alesha Godino is a certified Usui reiki master practitioner. Reiki is a form of energy healing which originated in Japan. Reiki is used to help promote physical and emotional healing, and is a relaxing process for both the client and the practitioner. Reiki focuses on the seven chakras, to ensure energy is flowing at each chakra. When you come in for a reiki healing, you will relax, and lay down fully clothed, on a massage table. Alesha will place hands over each of the 7 chakras, starting with the crown chakra (head) and ending at the feet, concentrating on each chakra for roughly 3-10 minutes, depending on how much attention is needed at each chakra. You will simply lay with your eyes closed and relax during the process. After your session, you can discuss with Alesha how many more sessions you may want or need, as well as discuss any observations which occurred during your attunement. Reiki is ideal for those looking to enhance relaxation and self care. *disclaimer: reiki is not a substitute for medical treatment.
