Dr. Yoon is proud to be a naturopathic and acupuncture doctor at Bay Natural Medicine, providing natural health services to the greater San Francisco, California area. Having suffered from her own share of bothersome health complaints, including allergies, frequent headaches, and eczema, Dr. Yoon is familiar with the limitations of modern pharmaceuticals. She realized that, while medications were able to provide temporary relief from an ailment, they were severely lacking in their ability to offer a long-term solution that not only alleviates symptoms but also reversed them. Through her own journey to health, she has come to understand how natural medicine\u2014 working alone or when combined with pharmaceuticals \u2014 can accomplish just that. New Patients We strive to give our patients the very best care available. We also work hard to make sure to offer the most up-to-date services so that you are able to walk out of each appointment feeling even better than you did after the last one. It is always our goal to improve your life. We want you to enjoy your time seeing us. [Our Services](/services/) \"I left my visit with Minna feeling like she really listened to me and cared about what I was going through. She took the time to talk to me. I never felt rushed. I felt super hopeful after our visit.\" Doris H. \"I had an initial visit with Dr. Yoon last week. In the time that I sat with her she was able to do something other doctors have not for my whole life; listen and care. Her knowledge on all the symptoms I came in for was shocking, and her treatment and diagnostic techniques made me feel comfortable and hopeful. I look forward to the journey of healing with her. Truly grateful I found Dr. Yoon!\" Lauren H. \"Both my mother and I have been going to Dr. Yoon for our naturalistic health needs for the past two years. She creates plans to work with existing insurance and traditional medical doctors. Her focus is on improving lifestyle and long term health. That said it's a team effort. Her service wouldn't be successful if I did not do my part. She's worth the cost and time. I've recommended her with other peers, who have been seen by her too with positive feedback.\" Herlindros About Dr. Minna Yoon Dr. Yoon's interest in natural medicine was born during her pre-med studies at Washington University in St. Louis. From there, she earned a Doctorate of Naturopathic Medicine from Bastyr University, and also earned a Master of Science of Traditional Oriental Medicine from Pacific College of Oriental Medicine in San Diego. In addition to her foundational education in natural medicine, Dr. Yoon continues to expand her knowledge and application in the field by obtaining certifications for Traditional Chinese Medicine in Dermatology and Restorative Medicine.
