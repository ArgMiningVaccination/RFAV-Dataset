We met with Color Director Christine Thompson for L.A.'s [Spoke & Weal]( http://www.spokeandweal.com), a natural salon we love here in town by top stylist Jon Reyman, to learn the key facts about going green when going blonde...so to speak. Five lucky readers will win a full non-toxic haircolor makeover from [Spoke & Weal]( http://www.spokeandweal.com) through today's Instagram contest (#TCMblondedetox). Tell us why you're the girl who needs it most and get all the details below. For every single reader, the salon is also offering a complimentary Color Balance Gloss Treatment with any other color service booked including new growth, dimensional color or balayage. Readers should mention The Chalkboard Mag when booking to receive the complimentary color! Why Non-Toxic Color Matters: One: Do it for your stylist. You may only encounter the color solutions used for that wicked blonde or brunette shade for two hours every month or so, but think of the stylist handling the chemicals every day. One of the most harmful effects, both for you and for anyone who works in a salon, is the effect of inhalation during color processing. Two: Products that absorb through the skin. When it comes to detoxing your beauty regimen, some products matter more than others. Products like color, which sit on your scalp for a length of time, are included in that category of products that matter. Body lotion, shampoo, foundation and hair color are all applied to and absorbed by large areas of skin - and usually massaged in. These are the products you want to be sure are safe and clean! Two other hair products that should always be non-toxic? Aerosol hairspray (inhalation) and leave-in conditioner (absorption). Three: Beauty with benefits. Not only is natural color safer, Christine argues that natural color, especially from the Aveda line which they rely on produces a longer-lasting, more realistic color. Aveda's hair colors are infused with oils that cause less damage (hence the longer wear) and the natural chemistry relied on for these new natural solutions results in, surprise, more natural hair tones. We can't wait to see who wins these color makeovers! We hope this contest inspires many of you to make the switch for good. Other fun notes from Christine and team include trends they noticed while backstage at NYFW this year. They include moves toward a more progressive, less harsh sombre, a more natural texture than the recent matte trend, lots of braids, and an obsession with all things California - we love that!
