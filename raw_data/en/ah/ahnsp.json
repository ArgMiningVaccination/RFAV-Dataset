This review provides an up-to-date overview of the potential effectiveness and importance of nootropics. Based on their nature and their effects, this heterogeneous group of drugs has been divided into four subgroups: classical nootropic compounds, substances increasing brain metabolism, cholinergic, and plants and their extracts with nootropic effects. Each subgroup of nootropics contains several main representatives, and for each one, its uses, indications, experimental treatments, dosage, and possible side effects and contraindications are discussed. For the nootropic plant extracts, there is also a brief description of each plant representative, its occurrence, history, and chemical composition of the medicinal part. Lastly, specific recommendations regarding the use of nootropics by both ill and healthy individuals are summarized.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-08-17", "cleaned_text": "and Side Effects of Smart Drugs [https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14163367](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14163367) [Nutrition, Brain and Cognition]( /journal/nutrients/special_issues/nutrition_brain_cognition )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-nutrients-14-03367)]. Although these substances are more effective in cases where cognitive functions are obviously impaired, they are of interest to healthy individuals because of their ability to increase intelligence and improve memory [ [2](#B2-nutrients-14-03367)]. The vast majority of these substances are of natural origin [ [3](#B3-nutrients-14-03367)], not subject to prescription, and can usually be easily obtained in the form of food supplements or herbal extracts. Their availability in synthetic form is somewhat limited and some preparations do require a valid prescription to obtain them. Nootropics tend to be well tolerated in patients with cognitive impairments; the incidence of side effects is low, and those that do occur are usually mild [ [4](#B4-nutrients-14-03367), [5](#B5-nutrients-14-03367), [6](#B6-nutrients-14-03367)]. Most nootropics do not have an immediate effect after a single dose, and therefore long-term use is necessary to achieve the desired results [ [7](#B7-nutrients-14-03367)]. However, their long-term effects on healthy individuals are still unknown [ [8](#B8-nutrients-14-03367)]. 2. What Are Nootropics? [2](#B2-nutrients-14-03367)], are a heterogeneous group of compounds [ [9](#B9-nutrients-14-03367)]. The term \"nootropic\" was first used by Cornelius E. Giurgea in 1972/1973 [ [10](#B10-nutrients-14-03367), [11](#B11-nutrients-14-03367)] to describe substances that primarily activate cognitive functions, such as memory and learning, especially in situations where these functions are impaired [ [1](#B1-nutrients-14-03367)]. In a sense, they interfere with the metabolism of neuronal cells of the central nervous system (CNS) [ [12](#B12-nutrients-14-03367), [13](#B13-nutrients-14-03367), [14](#B14-nutrients-14-03367)]. The name consists of two Greek words: n\u00f6os, which means thinking, and tropein, which means to guide [ [10](#B10-nutrients-14-03367), [11](#B11-nutrients-14-03367)]. There is no uniform approach to categorizing these compounds. Some authors distinguish between classical nootropics and substances that enhance brain metabolism, while others combine these two groups, or use the term cognitive effect rather than nootropic [ [15](#B15-nutrients-14-03367)]. 2.1. Mechanisms of Action [16](#B16-nutrients-14-03367)], but improve the brain's supply of glucose and oxygen, have antihypoxic effects, and protect brain tissue from neurotoxicity [ [9](#B9-nutrients-14-03367), [17](#B17-nutrients-14-03367)]. They also positively affect neuronal protein and nucleic acid synthesis and stimulate phospholipid metabolism in neurohormonal membranes [ [18](#B18-nutrients-14-03367), [19](#B19-nutrients-14-03367)]. Some nootropics have been found to affect the elimination of oxygen free radicals, possess an anti-aggregation effect, and improve erythrocyte plasticity. This improves the rheological properties of the blood and improves blood flow to the brain [ [3](#B3-nutrients-14-03367), [20](#B20-nutrients-14-03367), [21](#B21-nutrients-14-03367)]. These substances are metabolically active, but most nootropics show no immediate effects after a single dose, requiring an extended period of use to produce results. They need to be able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier to improve brain metabolism and long-term use is necessary to achieve stable changes [ [7](#B7-nutrients-14-03367)]. 2.2. Indications [22](#B22-nutrients-14-03367)]. They are recommended for incipient brain damage, which manifests with memory loss, mental retardation, and qualitative changes in consciousness. This condition is referred to as acute psychoorganic syndrome (POS). It is usually reversible, but it can progress to dementia in some cases. Acute POS can be caused by brain trauma, infection, stroke, or intoxication (alcohol, drugs with central anticholinergic effect, or carbon monoxide). Delirium tremens also belong to the POS group [ [23](#B23-nutrients-14-03367)]. [22](#B22-nutrients-14-03367)]. Nootropics are given relatively often in these cases, but their benefit, especially in more severe dementia, is questionable. They seem to be more effective in patients with mild cognitive disorders or the so-called benign senescent forgetting when there is only a slowing down of brain function without the development of dementia [ [24](#B24-nutrients-14-03367), [25](#B25-nutrients-14-03367)]. Nootropics are sometimes used for attention and memory disorders due to fatigue and exhaustion [ [26](#B26-nutrients-14-03367), [27](#B27-nutrients-14-03367)]. They are also used by children with minimal brain dysfunction syndrome [ [28](#B28-nutrients-14-03367), [29](#B29-nutrients-14-03367)] and patients with encephalopathy [ [30](#B30-nutrients-14-03367)], and their effect on myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome) has also been tested [ [31](#B31-nutrients-14-03367)]. As cognitive enhancers, nootropics are administered to patients who have Alzheimer's disease [ [3](#B3-nutrients-14-03367), [32](#B32-nutrients-14-03367)], schizophrenia [ [33](#B33-nutrients-14-03367)], hyperkinetic [24](#B24-nutrients-14-03367), [25](#B25-nutrients-14-03367)]. 2.3. Nootropic Treatment [10](#B10-nutrients-14-03367)]. A clinical scale has been developed to assess the depth and duration of impaired consciousness. Three aspects of behavior, such as motor response, verbal performance, and eye-opening, are measured independently. These are recorded and consistently evaluated according to the chart [ [36](#B36-nutrients-14-03367)]. Side effects of nootropics are uncommon and are rarely serious. In addition to individual intolerance, an increase in activity in the undesired direction, a sleep disorder, or an increase in libido may occasionally occur [ [1](#B1-nutrients-14-03367), [4](#B4-nutrients-14-03367), 2.4. Use by Students [8](#B8-nutrients-14-03367), [37](#B37-nutrients-14-03367)]. Because most nootropics are of natural origin, students can obtain them as food supplements or as drugs that do not require a prescription [ [3](#B3-nutrients-14-03367)], and, like many other substances and drugs, nootropics are increasingly available on the Internet. However, the use of nootropics by healthy individuals is of great concern due to the lack of clinical evidence regarding their efficacy, safety, and social consequences, especially in long-term use [ [2](#B2-nutrients-14-03367), [8](#B8-nutrients-14-03367)]. 2.5. Advantages and Disadvantages of Natural vs. Synthetic Nootropics [38](#B38-nutrients-14-03367)]. Natural nootropics also usually have lower toxicity, which reduces the possibility of harm from an overdose. However, some compounds can reduce the pharmaceutical activity of other compounds [ [39](#B39-nutrients-14-03367)]. Higher doses of such a herbal drug are needed to achieve the desired effect, which is why plant extracts are often used. There is also a problem in the case of storage or possible falsification and verification of the authenticity [ [40](#B40-nutrients-14-03367), [41](#B41-nutrients-14-03367)]. The advantages of synthetic compounds are their pharmaceutical purity, specificity of action, and a possible increase in their effect by modification of the chemical structure [ [42](#B42-nutrients-14-03367)]. They usually are active at lower dosages, but this entails a greater risk of overdose [ [43](#B43-nutrients-14-03367)]. 3. Classical Nootropic Compounds 1](#nutrients-14-03367-f001)[ [44](#B44-nutrients-14-03367)]. The compound is physiologically present in the human brain. Deanol is commonly marketed as a natural dietary supplement. Many nutritional supplements contain DMAE in the form of the salt of tartaric acid (bitartrate salt). Small amounts can also be obtained from eating fish, especially salmon and shellfish. Deanol is a choline precursor that allows the brain to optimize the production of acetylcholine, the primary neurotransmitter involved in learning and memory [ [45](#B45-nutrients-14-03367)]. [46](#B46-nutrients-14-03367)]. Dimethylaminoethanol cyclohexyl carboxylate fumarate significantly enhanced working memory performance in rats in the radial arm maze [ [47](#B47-nutrients-14-03367)]. [48](#B48-nutrients-14-03367)]. DMAE also improved sleep quality and was able to induce lucid dreams [ [49](#B49-nutrients-14-03367)]. Its administration has been tested in child hyperkinetic syndrome [ [50](#B50-nutrients-14-03367)] and minimal brain dysfunction syndrome [ [51](#B51-nutrients-14-03367)]. [52](#B52-nutrients-14-03367), [53](#B53-nutrients-14-03367)]. It is contraindicated during pregnancy, lactation, and patients with schizophrenia [ [50](#B50-nutrients-14-03367)]. 3.2. Meclofenoxate [Figure 2](#nutrients-14-03367-f002)). The first part is a synthetic auxin, a 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid similar to the natural auxin indoleacetic acid found in plant cells and which acts to exchange carbohydrates. The second part of the molecule consists of the already mentioned 2-(dimethylamino)ethan-1-ol or deanol [ [44](#B44-nutrients-14-03367)]. [54](#B54-nutrients-14-03367)]. Oral administration of meclofenoxate to rats (100 mg/kg, daily for 37 days) significantly improved memory impairment, and reduced neuronal damage, proinflammatory mediator levels, and oxidative stress to normal levels. The ability to alleviate memory deficits and neuronal damage may benefit cerebrovascular dementia [ [55](#B55-nutrients-14-03367)]. The RNA-Seq study of brain tissues of Nothobranchius guentheri, which received meclofenoxate for almost a lifetime, concluded that while meclofenoxate compensated for age-dependent downregulation of neuronal activity genes, its effect on the aging brain transcriptome still could not be considered unequivocally positive [ [56](#B56-nutrients-14-03367)]. [57](#B57-nutrients-14-03367)]. It may be a useful therapeutic tool for potentiating depressed cholinergic neurons and treating neuroleptic-induced dyskinesias [ [58](#B58-nutrients-14-03367)]. Meclofenoxate improves the status of qualitatively altered consciousness, has an antihypoxic effect, and is used to mitigate the overall slowdown in speech, thinking, and mental activity caused by CNS intoxication and injury. It has also been tested for treating Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia [ [59](#B59-nutrients-14-03367)]. [58](#B58-nutrients-14-03367)]. Meclofenoxate is deemed to be safe and tolerable. Possible side effects are often caused by overdose, including dizziness, restlessness, nausea, and headache [ [58](#B58-nutrients-14-03367), [60](#B60-nutrients-14-03367)]. 3.3. Nicergoline [Figure 3](#nutrients-14-03367-f003)) that has been clinically used since 1970. Nicergoline was initially developed as a vasodilator prescribed for cerebrovascular disorders. It is currently used clinically to treat syndromes of vascular or degenerative origin characterized by cognitive impairment with decreased intellect, and affective, behavioral, and somatic disorders. Specifically, it is used for memory loss, reduced alertness, concentration ability, mood swings, dizziness, fatigue, and vestibular and cochlear disorders [ [61](#B61-nutrients-14-03367), [62](#B62-nutrients-14-03367)]. [63](#B63-nutrients-14-03367)]. Nicergoline has been shown to be an effective drug for preventing neuronal vulnerability due to experimentally induced nerve growth factor deprivation and improved the function of cholinergic and catecholaminergic neurotransmitters in rats in vivo [ [64](#B64-nutrients-14-03367)]. It acted as an antagonist of 1-adrenoceptors [ [65](#B65-nutrients-14-03367)], increased arterial blood circulation [ [66](#B66-nutrients-14-03367)], inhibited platelet aggregation, supported metabolic activity (resulting in increased oxygen and glucose utilization), and had neurotrophic and antioxidant properties in rats in vivo [ [67](#B67-nutrients-14-03367)]. Nicergoline also showed an improving effect on cognitive function in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease [ [68](#B68-nutrients-14-03367)]. [69](#B69-nutrients-14-03367)]. Its efficacy has also been demonstrated in patients with vascular dementia [ [70](#B70-nutrients-14-03367)]. Nicergoline showed a comprehensive positive effect on different levels of cerebral, systemic, and cardiac hemodynamics in ischemic stroke patients [ [71](#B71-nutrients-14-03367)]. According to an electroencephalogram/event-related potential (EEG/ERP) mapping study, in patients with multi-infarct dementia and Alzheimer's disease, nicergoline improved alertness and information processing at the neurophysiological level, which led to clinical improvement at the behavioral level in both degenerative and vascular dementia [ [72](#B72-nutrients-14-03367)]. [62](#B62-nutrients-14-03367)]. Side effects are rare and usually include nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, fainting, and headache [ [73](#B73-nutrients-14-03367), [74](#B74-nutrients-14-03367)]. Due to the lack of experience with nicergoline in pregnant women, it is not recommended during pregnancy and lactation [ [74](#B74-nutrients-14-03367)]. 3.4. Piracetam [Figure 4](#nutrients-14-03367-f004)). It gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and acetamide. Piracetam is thought to act on brain neurotransmission through modulation of ion channels (Ca2+ and neuronal excitability [ [75](#B75-nutrients-14-03367)]. [76](#B76-nutrients-14-03367)], and affected N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in rat models in vivo, increasing cell membrane permeability [ [77](#B77-nutrients-14-03367)]. Piracetam has also been found to increase oxygen consumption in the brain and, in connection with adenosine triphosphate metabolism, it increased adenylate kinase activity in vivo in the rat brain [ [78](#B78-nutrients-14-03367)]. It appears to increase the synthesis of cytochrome b5 [ [79](#B79-nutrients-14-03367)], which is involved in the mechanism of electron transport in mitochondria, where it also increases permeability. It alleviated the intensity of hypoxia-induced nerve cell damage, improved interhemispheric transmission, and increased glucose metabolism in the rat brain [ [80](#B80-nutrients-14-03367)]. Piracetam has been tested for stroke, unconsciousness, treatment of withdrawal symptoms from alcoholism, and prevention of alcohol-induced hypoxia [ [81](#B81-nutrients-14-03367), [82](#B82-nutrients-14-03367)]. It also improved brain function in rat models affected by xenobiotics [ [83](#B83-nutrients-14-03367)]. [84](#B84-nutrients-14-03367)]. It was used clinically for the prevention and treatment of post-traumatic cognitive and mental dysfunction, and to improve learning and memory functions in developmental dyslexia in children patients [ [85](#B85-nutrients-14-03367)]. Piracetam has also been tested for treating Alzheimer's disease [ [86](#B86-nutrients-14-03367)] and combined with lecithin [ [87](#B87-nutrients-14-03367)], but unfortunately without significant benefit in patients. The structural analogues of piracetam are oxiracetam, pramiracetam, etiracetam, nefiracetam, and aniracetam. These compounds act similarly to piracetam, but with varying efficacy [ [42](#B42-nutrients-14-03367), [75](#B75-nutrients-14-03367)]. According to the assessment of the effectiveness of nefiracetam on higher brain functions in terms of time and space using electric field distribution of the scalp map and low-resolution electromagnetic tomography for evoked potentials and spontaneous EEG with eyes closed, the Gottfries-Brane-Steen scale showed significant improvement. However, the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Hasegawa Dementia Scale, and the Kohs block test showed no improvement. These results suggest that nefiracetam has some benefits in patients with vascular dementia [ [88](#B88-nutrients-14-03367)]. [75](#B75-nutrients-14-03367), [83](#B83-nutrients-14-03367)]. There is insufficient clinical experience with piracetam in pregnancy. Animal studies have not shown teratogenic or other embryotoxic effects, but piracetam should still be used during pregnancy only after carefully weighing the expected benefits against the potential risks. It should not be used during lactation [ [89](#B89-nutrients-14-03367)]. 3.5. Pyritinol [Figure 5](#nutrients-14-03367-f005)), pyritinol was synthesized in 1961 by combining two molecules of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) via a disulfide bridge. Like pyridoxine, it has different effects on different organ systems; however, the CNS is the primary system in which pyritinol exhibits observable pharmacological effects. Pyritinol crosses the blood-brain barrier and accumulates in gray matter, especially in the hippocampus, cerebral nuclei, cerebellum, and cortex [ [90](#B90-nutrients-14-03367)]. assays revealed choline acetyltransferase activity, leading to choline accumulation in cholinergic neurons [ [92](#B92-nutrients-14-03367)]. Pyritinol plays a supporting role in the recovery of age-related brain deficits. For example, in elderly rats, pyritinol metabolites increased cortical acetylcholine concentration and release, and nucleic acid metabolism in the brain [ [93](#B93-nutrients-14-03367)]. Acute or prolonged oral administration of pyritinol reduced formaldehyde-induced nociceptive behavior and tactile allodynia in old diabetic rats. Pyritinol was also able to scavenge oxygen free radicals, thus acting as an antioxidant and improving cerebral circulation [ [94](#B94-nutrients-14-03367)]. It also restored the decreased concentration of the primary excitatory neurotransmitter N-methyl-D-aspartate when administered to older mice [ [95](#B95-nutrients-14-03367)]. Results of the experiment on rats showed that pyritinol may be helpful in learning and memory disorders caused by malnutrition and deprivation [ [96](#B96-nutrients-14-03367)]. [97](#B97-nutrients-14-03367)]. Intramuscular injections of nandrolone decanoate and pyritinol have dramatically affected motor development and learning ability in children with cerebral palsy, without side effects. The combined effects of vinpocetine and pyritinol also improved blood and plasma viscosity in human patients with cerebrovascular disorders [ [98](#B98-nutrients-14-03367)]. Due to the status of pyritinol as a dietary supplement in some countries, it can be safely used as an adjunct to any standard treatment of CNS diseases, such as developmental dysphasia and other cognitive disorders, for which current therapeutic options are limited [ [90](#B90-nutrients-14-03367)]. [90](#B90-nutrients-14-03367), [97](#B97-nutrients-14-03367)]. The common side effects are non-specific rashes, headache, inflammation of the oral mucosa, acute pancreatitis, diarrhea, nausea, and loss of appetite [ [99](#B99-nutrients-14-03367), [100](#B100-nutrients-14-03367), [101](#B101-nutrients-14-03367)]. Pyritinol crosses the placenta, but systemic testing in mice and rats did not show teratogenic or embryotoxic effects. Only minimal amounts of pyritinol are excreted in human milk but a careful evaluation should still be made before dosing during pregnancy and lactation [ [90](#B90-nutrients-14-03367), [101](#B101-nutrients-14-03367)]. vincamine alkaloid that occurs in the lesser periwinkle, Vinca minor [ [107](#B107-nutrients-14-03367)]. [21](#B21-nutrients-14-03367), [108](#B108-nutrients-14-03367)], a potent sodium [110](#B110-nutrients-14-03367)], inhibits platelet aggregation, reduces blood viscosity, vasodilates cerebral arteries, and increases cerebral blood flow [ [111](#B111-nutrients-14-03367)]. Ex vivo, vinpocetine increased glucose and oxygen consumption through brain tissue and improved brain cell tolerance to hypoxia [ [112](#B112-nutrients-14-03367)]. [113](#B113-nutrients-14-03367)], shifted glucose metabolism to more energy-efficient aerobic processes, and increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in the brain [ [114](#B114-nutrients-14-03367)]. Thus, vinpocetine offers significant and direct neuroprotection in vitro and in vivo [ [104](#B104-nutrients-14-03367)]. This vasoactive alkaloid has been marketed for several years as an adjunct to vasodilators and nootropics to improve memory [ [115](#B115-nutrients-14-03367)]. It is also considered an active substance in treating stroke and other diseases, including circulatory disorders in the brain [ [116](#B116-nutrients-14-03367), [117](#B117-nutrients-14-03367)]. [118](#B118-nutrients-14-03367), [119](#B119-nutrients-14-03367)], a dose that can cause some side effects, although very rarely, including nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, headache, and heartburn [ [120](#B120-nutrients-14-03367)]. The use of vinpocetine is contraindicated Naftidrofuryl is a vasodilator with beneficial rheological effects on the blood and has long been used to treat intermittent claudication to improve walking and provide symptomatic relief [ [103](#B103-nutrients-14-03367)]. [122](#B122-nutrients-14-03367)] and glucose utilization [ [123](#B123-nutrients-14-03367)], and it inhibited the hypoxia-induced decrease in ATP levels in fibroblasts and endothelial cells in vitro [ [124](#B124-nutrients-14-03367)]. It inhibited serotonin- and epinephrine-induced platelet 5-HT2 receptors are endogenous neurotransmitter to atherosclerosis [ [128](#B128-nutrients-14-03367)]. Naftidrofuryl was then shown to have antiatherosclerotic effects in various animal models [ [129](#B129-nutrients-14-03367), [130](#B130-nutrients-14-03367)]. In rats, it also increased the storage of spatial information and showed nootropic effects [ [131](#B131-nutrients-14-03367)]. [132](#B132-nutrients-14-03367)]. The induced reduction in the lactate/pyruvate ratio in healthy human volunteers during exercise suggests that naftidrofuryl increases the efficiency of aerobic metabolism in oxygen-deprived tissues [ [133](#B133-nutrients-14-03367)]. It also has a positive effect on the energy metabolism of the neuron. Naftidrofuryl is used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases [ [134](#B134-nutrients-14-03367)], senile dementia [ [135](#B135-nutrients-14-03367)], and Alzheimer's disease [ [136](#B136-nutrients-14-03367)]. [102](#B102-nutrients-14-03367), [103](#B103-nutrients-14-03367)]. Naftidrofuryl is well tolerated, and side effects occur only rarely. These are usually gastrointestinal problems, but there was a single known case of liver damage [ [137](#B137-nutrients-14-03367)]. 4.3. Dihydroergotoxine [Figure 8](#nutrients-14-03367-f008)) is also known as hydergine or ergoloid mesylate, and is a developed in the 1940s by Albert Hofmann [ [138](#B138-nutrients-14-03367)], and thus, is one of the oldest nootropic drugs still in use. It was initially used against hypertension [ [139](#B139-nutrients-14-03367)], but later was found, by chance, to improve mental health when patients with Alzheimer's disease were treated for hypertension [ [140](#B140-nutrients-14-03367), [141](#B141-nutrients-14-03367)]. [142](#B142-nutrients-14-03367)]. A similar effect has been observed in patients aged 74 to 79 years with multi-infarct dementia [ [143](#B143-nutrients-14-03367)]. Dihydroergotoxine modulated synaptic neurotransmission in the brains of elderly rats by reducing levels of monoamine oxidase enzymes, which are commonly elevated in aging. Monoamine oxidases degrade neurotransmitters and are essential for normal brain metabolism, but an age-related increase in their activity can deplete catecholamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, and adrenaline), which impairs mental function [ [144](#B144-nutrients-14-03367), [145](#B145-nutrients-14-03367)]. In a rat experiment, hydergine regulated the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from the hippocampus [ [146](#B146-nutrients-14-03367)] and increased the number of cholinergic receptors [ [147](#B147-nutrients-14-03367)]. Furthermore, dihydroergotoxine slowed the release of lipofuscin, which has been associated with the aging process of neurons in old rats [ [148](#B148-nutrients-14-03367)]. Hydergine acts as a peripheral and cerebral vasodilator. In monkeys, it increased blood flow and oxygen consumption through the brain [ [149](#B149-nutrients-14-03367)]. [150](#B150-nutrients-14-03367)]. It is used mainly in Alzheimer's disease and vascular and post-traumatic dementias in old age [151](#B151-nutrients-14-03367), [152](#B152-nutrients-14-03367)]. [153](#B153-nutrients-14-03367)]. The combination with piracetam and xanthine derivatives, which have a bronchodilator and vasodilatory effect, increases the effect [154](#B154-nutrients-14-03367), [155](#B155-nutrients-14-03367)]. 5. Cholinergics [156](#B156-nutrients-14-03367), [157](#B157-nutrients-14-03367)]. These substances are classified as cognitive substances that primarily affect cholinergic transmission in the brain rather than nootropics [ [158](#B158-nutrients-14-03367)], so only their well-known representative, phosphatidylcholine described in more detail. Phosphatidylcholine (Lecithin) [Figure 9](#nutrients-14-03367-f009)) belongs to a group of compounds called phospholipids, which are the main lipid components of cell membranes. A mixture of these phospholipids in oil is referred to as commercial lecithin. The abundant component of lecithin-containing supplements is phosphatidylcholine, palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids [ [159](#B159-nutrients-14-03367)]. The primary source of commercial lecithin today is soybean and sunflower oil. Lecithin is also present in egg yolk, liver, whole grain products, and nut kernels [ [160](#B160-nutrients-14-03367), [161](#B161-nutrients-14-03367)]. [162](#B162-nutrients-14-03367)]. [163](#B163-nutrients-14-03367)]. The data suggest that a lack of control over the subject's learning levels may contribute to inconsistent findings. Phosphatidylcholine supplements may not uniformly improve memory, suggesting that the dose and time parameters required to achieve a therapeutic effect may depend on variables intrinsic to individual subjects. Students that have subnormal endogenous choline levels, may see a greater increase from phosphatidylcholine supplements, resulting in a measurable improvement in explicit memory, compared to healthy subjects with normal endogenous choline levels [ [164](#B164-nutrients-14-03367)]. [160](#B160-nutrients-14-03367)]. 6. Plants and Nootropic Effects [Table 1](#nutrients-14-03367-t001)) [ [3](#B3-nutrients-14-03367), [165](#B165-nutrients-14-03367), [166](#B166-nutrients-14-03367)]. 6.1. Herbal Drug Plant Collection [40](#B40-nutrients-14-03367), [41](#B41-nutrients-14-03367)]. Nowadays, the collector often encounters difficulties that were not present before, such as chemical damage or contamination of the growing plants [ [167](#B167-nutrients-14-03367)]. The composition and total content of complex active constituents are variable during plant development and vegetative growth. Choosing a suitable period for harvesting or collecting is essential. Plants should not be harvested in humid or rainy weather, but only when dry. During harvesting, the plants must not be damaged because breaking the leaves sometimes affects the active compounds in an undesirable manner. Many compounds, such as vitamin C or tannins, can also react with metals. Therefore, if possible, the plants or parts are collected in their entirety. The leaves and stems are usually harvested just before flowering or during flowering. The flowers are harvested shortly before full development, but some may still be in the bud stage. The fruits and seeds are harvested at the time of full ripeness. For roots and rhizomes, the suitable period is the developmental dormancy of the plant, which is usually autumn or spring. The bark is harvested in the temperate zone at the beginning of vegetative growth in early spring, or, in the tropics, throughout the year [ [168](#B168-nutrients-14-03367), [169](#B169-nutrients-14-03367)]. 6.2. Plant Material Processing [170](#B170-nutrients-14-03367), [171](#B171-nutrients-14-03367)]. Most plants should be dried in the shade, and the temperature should not exceed a specific limit. For plants containing volatile essential oils, this limit is 40 \u00b0C [ [172](#B172-nutrients-14-03367), [173](#B173-nutrients-14-03367)]. Freeze-drying or lyophilization is also frequently used. For this method, fresh plant material is rapidly frozen at a temperature of 20 \u00b0C to 50 \u00b0C and then dried under a high vacuum. However, in some cases, freeze-drying imperfectly preserves important classes of medicinal compounds such as phenolics and volatile substances, reducing the effectiveness of some plant drugs. Additionally, the material dried in this way is very hygroscopic [ [174](#B174-nutrients-14-03367), [175](#B175-nutrients-14-03367)]. Freeze-dried drugs have to be stored away from moisture, as well as dust, insects, and light [ [172](#B172-nutrients-14-03367), [173](#B173-nutrients-14-03367)]. The drug is usually processed or cut after drying. Active compounds are used either directly in the form of medicinal products or indirectly as raw materials to obtain active compounds, which become part of medicinal products. Medicinal products produced directly from drugs can be in the form of tea for water infusion, granules, tablets, extracts, and divided or undivided powders. Active compounds are obtained from herbal materials often by extraction (alkaloids, glycosides), distillation (essential oils), or pressing (oils, fats) [ [176](#B176-nutrients-14-03367), [177](#B177-nutrients-14-03367)]. |Ref.||Phytochemical ginseng) [215](#B215-nutrients-14-03367)]. [182](#B182-nutrients-14-03367)]. [178](#B178-nutrients-14-03367)]. Experimental data from tests on male chicks suggest that Rb1 may improve memory for the task of visual discrimination and that the nootropic effect may be associated with changes in anxiety [ [179](#B179-nutrients-14-03367)]. Ginsenoside Rb1 also reduced simulated Alzheimer's disease in a rat model. Thus, it could be used in the future as a therapeutic agent for patients with memory impairment [ [180](#B180-nutrients-14-03367)]. Ginsenoside Rg1 supplementation improved the performance of old mice in the behavioral test, significantly increasing the expression of proteins associated with synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, including synaptophysin and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 1 [ [181](#B181-nutrients-14-03367)]. Oral administration of a combination of Ginkgo biloba and Panax ginseng extracts improved memory in rats. Data on test drug effects suggested the involvement of a serotonergic transporter as an important neurochemical correlate of rat behavior and memory effects of study drugs [ [216](#B216-nutrients-14-03367)]. [217](#B217-nutrients-14-03367)]. It is recommended to use a standardized ginseng extract at a dose of 200 mg per day ginseng for an extended period of time. Standardization refers to the content of ginsenosides, which usually ranges from 1.5 to 7 percent. Alternatively, 0.5 to 2 g of dry root per day is recommended, with ginseng taken in tea or chewed [ [218](#B218-nutrients-14-03367)]. Ginseng is contraindicated in patients with acute asthma and hypertension. In large doses, it can cause excessive body stimulation, restlessness, insomnia, increased blood pressure, nervousness, inability to concentrate, headaches, [ [221](#B221-nutrients-14-03367)]. Mechanisms of action of Ginkgo biloba compounds include free radical scavenging for antioxidant activity, antagonistic effects on platelet-activating factor, vasodilation, and an overall reduction in [183](#B183-nutrients-14-03367), [187](#B187-nutrients-14-03367)]. [184](#B184-nutrients-14-03367)]. The triterpene biloba extract have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. In addition, in an experiment on mice, the extract had an antagonistic effect on glycine and GABA type A receptors [ [185](#B185-nutrients-14-03367)]. [186](#B186-nutrients-14-03367)]. In contrast, a critical review of the evidence from several randomized clinical trials did not provide convincing evidence that Ginkgo biloba extracts taken either in a single dose or over a long time had a positive effect on any aspect of cognitive performance in healthy human subjects under sixty years of age [ [222](#B222-nutrients-14-03367)]. [183](#B183-nutrients-14-03367), [223](#B223-nutrients-14-03367), [224](#B224-nutrients-14-03367)]. No side effects have been reported at regular doses, but mild stomach irritation and headaches occasionally occur with excessive consumption. It causes blood thinning, so people taking some anticoagulants should not take the drug before surgery study in mice revealed that a NO modulating mechanism may be involved in the protective effect of Centella asiatica against anxiety caused by sleep deprivation, oxidative damage, and neuroinflammation [ [188](#B188-nutrients-14-03367)]. A study in juvenile and young adult mice demonstrated the nootropic effect of an aqueous extract of C. asiatica. Treatment resulted in increased hippocampal acetylcholinesterase activity and dendritic arborization of hippocampal CA3 neurons. Thus, treatment with C. asiatica during the postnatal developmental stage can affect neuronal morphology were used as a model of tardive dyskinesia, a disorder characterized by involuntary neurological triggering that leads to spontaneous, repetitive body movements, such as grimacing, sticking out the tongue, or lip movements that were simulated by injection of reserpine. Oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation products are involved in the pathophysiology of this disease. Long-term administration of Withania somnifera root extract to the rats significantly reduced lipid peroxidation, restored reduced glutathione levels, and reversed the decrease in brain superoxide dismutase and catalase levels induced by reserpine treatment. Thus, Withania somnifera root extract could be a helpful drug for treating drug-induced tardive dyskinesia [ [192](#B192-nutrients-14-03367)]. Several tests in animal models have confirmed the nootropic effect of ashwagandha and its potential as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease [ [191](#B191-nutrients-14-03367), [193](#B193-nutrients-14-03367)]. In another study, the steroidal lactone withaferin, a bioactive compound from the group of withanolides showed significant anticancer properties both in vitro and in vivo [ [232](#B232-nutrients-14-03367)]. [233](#B233-nutrients-14-03367)]. Ashwagandha is not recommended in cases of hyperthyroidism or pregnancy. It is a relatively safe drug when used at the recommended doses. Overdoses can cause gastrointestinal problems and vomiting; therefore, treatment should be started with small doses and gradually increased. Ashwagandha is best taken in the evening because, in substantial doses, the herbal extract can act as a sedative bulbectomy mice compared to controls. Olfactory bulbectomy reduced cholinergic activity and thus choline acetyltransferase expression in the hippocampus. However, subsequent administration of Bacopa monnieri alcohol extract reversed this effect and gradually improved the induced cognitive dysfunction [ [195](#B195-nutrients-14-03367)]. In a rat model of Alzheimer's disease, Bacopa monnieri alcohol extract improved escape latency in the Morris water maze test. In addition, the loss of neurons and the density of cholinergic neurons were also mitigated [ [198](#B198-nutrients-14-03367)]. Experiments have shown inhibition of the degeneration of cholinergic neurons by Bacopa monnieri, suggesting that the herb is a cognitive enhancer and neuroprotectant and may serve as a potential adjunctive drug for treating Alzheimer's administration of Paullinia cupana seed extract by gavage to rats at various doses on their cognitive behavior was studied using the Morris water maze test, which showed identical results in rats with scopolamine-induced amnesia compared with controls [ [200](#B200-nutrients-14-03367)]. Mice that ingested guarana suspension showed a significant increase in physical capacity when exposed to stressful situations such as forced swimming. After both single and chronic administration, guarana partially reversed the amnesic effect of scopolamine, as measured by a passive avoidance test in rats and mice, indicating a positive impact on memory acquisition [ [199](#B199-nutrients-14-03367)]. Studies have shown that oral administration of processed Paullinia cupana seeds had a significant nootropic effect. Herbal drugs that exhibit this property may offer a useful adjunct therapeutic option for preventing or treating memory deficits, such as those seen in Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease [ [199](#B199-nutrients-14-03367), [200](#B200-nutrients-14-03367)]. [243](#B243-nutrients-14-03367)]. Guarana should not be used in persons with cardiovascular disease, who are pregnant or breastfeeding, have chronic headaches, diabetes, insomnia, mental disorders, stomach ulcers, or are taking theophylline [ [ [207](#B207-nutrients-14-03367)]. [210](#B210-nutrients-14-03367)]. A study in normal mice examined the effects of an aqueous extract from eleuthero leaves on memory function. These in vivo tests showed that oral administration of the extract improved memory functions, and ex vivo confirmed that the active compounds of the extract, such as eleutheroside M and ciwujianoside B and C3, were able to penetrate the BBB and act on the brain. These three compounds and the leaf extract showed dendritic elongation activity against primary cultured cortical neurons, which may be related to improved memory [ [211](#B211-nutrients-14-03367)]. [209](#B209-nutrients-14-03367)]. The detoxification properties of the extract have been used in treating chronic lead poisoning in mine workers [ [246](#B246-nutrients-14-03367)]. Siberian ginseng has also been used in cosmetics [ [207](#B207-nutrients-14-03367)]. [247](#B247-nutrients-14-03367)]. According to the Russian Pharmacopeia, a standardized liquid extract of roots and rhizomes of Eleutherococcus senticosus (10 mg of the extract is equivalent to 120 mg of the crude herb) is currently available as an over-the-counter drug in a ratio of 1:1 with 40% ethanol. In the Russian medical system, this extract is recommended for oral use at a daily dose of 20-40 drops for an adult. However, further research is needed to investigate the appropriate dosing regimen to improve healthy adults' cognitive function and physical performance [ [246](#B246-nutrients-14-03367), [248](#B248-nutrients-14-03367)]. Side effects occur infrequently. Eleuthero increases blood pressure, so its use in hypertension is not recommended [ [249](#B249-nutrients-14-03367)]. 6.3.8. Rhodiola (Rhodiola known to the people of the Far East primarily as a tonic and stimulant against fatigue and exhaustion [ [253](#B253-nutrients-14-03367)]. [206](#B206-nutrients-14-03367)]. [204](#B204-nutrients-14-03367)]. These findings demonstrate that schisantherin A may have potential therapeutic value for oxidative stress-related neurodegenerative disorders, [205](#B205-nutrients-14-03367)]. [253](#B253-nutrients-14-03367), [255](#B255-nutrients-14-03367)]. No serious side effects have been reported. Side effects have only occurred after regular ingestion of excessive amounts of fruits and included restlessness and coordination, and endurance in middle-aged mice, increased mitochondrial respiratory function, and upregulated proteins associated autophagy in the cortex [ [213](#B213-nutrients-14-03367)]. [259](#B259-nutrients-14-03367), [260](#B260-nutrients-14-03367)]. [261](#B261-nutrients-14-03367)]. 7. Summary and Recommendations [262](#B262-nutrients-14-03367)]. A typical dose of guarana is 75 mg of extract (approximately 12% caffeine) taken as a tablet [ [243](#B243-nutrients-14-03367)]. Each such tablet, therefore, contains an average of 9 mg of caffeine. Therefore, in order to get close to the limit of 600 mg of caffeine, a person would have to consume around 66 of these tablets per day. A nootropic that could help in this case is naftidrofuryl, which functions as a vasodilator with rheological effects on the blood and is directly used in treating cardiovascular disorders [ [134](#B134-nutrients-14-03367)]. Some nootropics can also affect psychiatric problems; for example, rhodiola is not recommended for patients with manic-depressive psychosis [ [252](#B252-nutrients-14-03367)], and dihydroergotoxine is also contraindicated in psychosis [ [153](#B153-nutrients-14-03367)]. An expert should be consulted before the use of any of these nootropics. Ginseng and eleuthero are contraindicated in patients with hypertension [ [218](#B218-nutrients-14-03367), [219](#B219-nutrients-14-03367), [249](#B249-nutrients-14-03367)]. Ginkgo causes blood thinning, so people taking certain anticoagulants should not take it, for example, before surgery [ [219](#B219-nutrients-14-03367), [225](#B225-nutrients-14-03367)]. Additionally, ashwagandha is best taken in the evening because it can act as a sedative in large doses. It is also indicated by its Latin name Withania somnifera, where the Latin species name somnifera means \"sleep-inducing\" [ [234](#B234-nutrients-14-03367)]. Therefore, nootropics users should consider their state of health and mood before deciding to try a certain compound; however, if the recommended dosage is followed, no serious complications should occur. Because of their potential for improving memory and thinking and their easy availability, nootropics have particularly attracted the attention of college students, who call them \"smart drugs\". Because of the incomplete clinical evidence on their effectiveness, safety, and social consequences in the case of long-term use, especially with synthetic variants of these drugs, they cannot be recommended to healthy individuals who do not suffer from any cognitive dysfunction. There have not been sufficient experimental studies and results to support prophylactic use, even though the use of herbal supplements with nootropic effects has shown little risk of side effects and contraindications have been minimal. In any case, to be safe, none of these substances should be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Future research regarding nootropics should focus on experiments with more diverse human groups, whether in terms of age, health, gender, or weight. It should also mainly focus on young, healthy people, mostly university students, who use these substances a lot and obtain them, especially on the black market. Furthermore, already advanced methods based on neuroimaging assessment should be used more in experiments and studies to confirm or refute the potential beneficial effects.
