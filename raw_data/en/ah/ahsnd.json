Project Documents are a family of publications by the World Health Organization (WHO)/Internati onal Programme on Chemical Sa fety (IPCS). Harmonization Project Documents complement the Enviro nmental Health Criteria (EHC) methodology (yellow cover) series of documents as aut horitative documents on methods for the risk assessment of chemicals. The main impetus for the current coordinated in ternational, regional an d national efforts on the assessment and management of hazardous chemicals arose from the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED). UNCED Agenda 21, Chapter 19, provides the \"blueprint\" for the environmentally sound management of toxic chemicals. This commitment by governments was reconfirmed at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development and in 2006 in the Strategic Appr oach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM). The IPCS project on the Harmonization of Approaches to th e Assessment of Risk from Exposure to Chemicals (H armonization Project) is con ducted under Agenda 21, Chapter 19, and contributes to the implementation of SAIC M. In particular, the project addresses the SAICM objective on Risk Reduction and the SA ICM Global Plan of Action activity to \"Develop and use new and harmonized methods for risk assessment\". The IPCS Harmonization Project goal is to improve chemical risk assessment globally, through the pursuit of common principles and approaches, and, hence, strengthen national and international management practices that de liver better protection of human health and the environment within the framework of sustainability. The Harmonization Project aims to harmonize global approaches to chemical risk assessment, including by developing inter- national guidance documents on specific issues. The guidance is intended for adoption and use in countries and by international bodies in the performance of chem ical risk assessments. The guidance is developed by engaging experts worldwide. The project has been imple- mented using a stepwise approach, first shar ing information and increasing understanding of methods and practices used by various countr ies, identifying areas where convergence of different approaches would be beneficial a nd then developing guidance that enables imple- mentation of harmonized approaches. The projec t uses a building block approach, focusing at any one time on the aspects of risk assessmen t that are particularly important for har- monization. The project enables risk assessments (or components thereof) to be performed using inter- nationally accepted methods, and these assessments can then be shared to avoid duplication and optimize use of valuable resources for risk management. It also promotes sound science as a basis for risk management decisions, prom otes transparency in risk assessment and reduces unnecessary testing of chemicals. Advan ces in scientific knowledge can be translated into new harmonized methods. ix ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This Harmonization Project Document was pl anned at a World Health Organization (WHO)/ International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) Scoping Meeting and prepared by the WHO/IPCS Drafting Group on Imm unotoxicity, both under the ch airmanship of Professor Henk Van Loveren.

These consequences range from reduced resistance to infection and neoplas ia to allergic and autoimmune conditions. Chemicals may act directly on components of the immune system, leading to immuno- suppression and resulting in reduced resistance to infections and tumours. Direct toxicity may also lead to dysregulation of homeostasis, resulting in exag gerated immune responses, which may facilitate allergic or autoimmune phenomena. Alternatively, chemicals may be recog- nized by the immune system as foreign or alter host tissues in such a way that they are recognized as foreign, resulting in allergy or autoimmunity, re spectively. Wher eas infectious and neoplastic diseases remain a significant bu rden on public health, allergic and auto- immune diseases have risen over the last decades. The role of chemical exposures in changes to these immune-related health outcomes over time remains an open question. A proper risk assessment of chemicals in terms of i mmunotoxicity is therefore warranted. Immunotoxicity is a non-cancer end-point compar able to other types of potential systemic toxicity considered in a general risk assessmen t. As with other types of systemic toxicity, assessment of immunotoxicological risk relies on a variety of e nd-points that reflect immune system health and, in aggregate, are predictive of disease states. In general, the differences in the approaches to assess the risk of immunotoxi city and other forms of toxicity are minimal, and apparent differences likely stem from a l ack of familiarity with immune system end- points that link cellular toxicity with downstream disease outcomes. As is the case with the reproductive and centr al nervous systems, the immune system is particularly vulnerable to chemical exposure du ring development, and function declines with age, resulting in increased ri sk of adverse health outcomes from chemical exposure at the extremes of age. A special case does exist for dose-response relationships related to allergy, because the dose required to induc e allergic hypersensit ivity in a naive indi vidual is typically higher than the dose required to elicit symptoms in sensitized individuals. As such, dose- response relationships for allergic hypersensitivi ty are typically more complex than for other immune system end-points. The Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals provides background information on the immune system and its pert urbation by xenobiotics a nd clear step-by-step weight of evidence approaches to assess th e risk for immunotoxicity from chemical expo- sures. The guidance is organized in separate chapters that represent different types of immunotoxicity that may follow ex posure to chemicals. A table of entry points for the risk assessment process will help the risk assessor to identify the type(s) of immunotoxicity suggested by the data and decide which of th e risk assessment schemes should be followed. Nevertheless, it is critical to realize that the same chemical or chemical class may exert different or sometimes partly overlapping type s of immunotoxicity, and a comprehensive risk assessment demands that all types of immunotoxicity be addressed. The ultimate goal of the risk assessment process is to integrate hazard identification, hazard characterization and exposure assessment into a plain language risk ch aracterization aimed at estimating the likelihood that identified adve rse effects will occur in exposed people and presenting immunotoxicity information and refere nce values that are useful to the risk manager. The assessment should include a critical review of the quality of the assessment, Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals xixincluding uncertainties and c onfidence in conclusions, which includes a weight of evidence approach. Whereas in general terms human data may be pref erable to animal data for risk assessment, both types of data have limitations. Epidemiologi cal studies often lack precise information on exposure and may not control fo r important confounding variable s. Laboratory animal data typically do not suffer the same shortcomings, but extrapolation to likely human effects may be problematic. For both approaches, dose-respon se relationships, biologi cal plausibility and mode of action are critical aspects that need to be considered and from which uncertainty factors may be determined and used to arrive at reliable reference values. Whereas several guidelines for immunotoxicity te sting are in place, de ficiencies are also evident that have so far inhibited full impl ementation of immunotoxi city risk evaluation. Guidelines for mouse or guinea-pig skin tests are available for identi fying skin sensitizers, but no such guidelines exist for respiratory sensitizers. For di rect immunotoxicity testing, guidelines for (sub)chronic or reproductive toxicity testing in rodents include a range of immune parameters. Guidance is availabl e for assessing autoimmunity (IPCS, 2006a), although none of the animal models of auto immunity have been validated for use in regulatory decision-making. For human testing of immunotoxicity, no sp ecific gudelines are in place. Hence, the risk assessor is often f aced with incomplete information on which the risk assessment needs to be based. Depending on how complete or incomplete the entry points for assessing the risk of immunotoxicity may be, the risk assessor may want to seek advice from someone with expert knowledge of i mmunotoxicity to aid in the interpretation of the data. The internationally developed guidance presented in this doc ument aims to improve immuno- toxicity risk assessment of chemicals to reduce or preven t human exposure to immunotoxic concentrations of chemicals and thereby prot ect public health. The guidance also aims to facilitate harmonization of i mmunotoxicity risk assessment and to promote transparency, mutual understanding and sharing of the chem ical risk assessments produced, to avoid duplication of effort. This guida nce is intended for adoption a nd use by regulatory authorities and other risk assessment bodies, industry, res earch institutions and others involved in chemical risk assessment. The guidance includes six case-studies of se lected immunotoxic chemicals provided to illus- trate how the risk assessment guidance can be used for assessing the risk of immunotoxicity. 1 1 The case-studies were developed for illustrative purposes only and are not to be interpreted as comprehensive risk assessments or final regulatory positions of any agency or government. 1 1.

BACKGROUND 2.1 The immune system as a special case The immune system presents a readily accessible toxicological target regardless of the route of chemical exposure, in that, as a fully disper sed system, it is represented in most tissues, organs and peripheral sites (e.g. respiratory, dermal, gastroin testinal, neurological, cardio- vascular, reproductive, hepatic and endocrine). The implication is that xenobiotic exposure via virtually any route will result in exposu re of some immune system components. Therefore, from a risk assessment perspectiv e, the issue is not wh ether immune exposure occurs following a chemical exposure, but whet her a given exposure is likely to produce an adverse immunotoxic outcome am ong susceptible populations. The immune system is designed both to provi de host integrity and to ensure appropriate function of organs and tissues. To accomplish this , it must be able to distinguish self from non-self and be able to assess tissue-specific cell status and functi on. The immune system protects host integrity via surveillance against a myriad of invading pathogens as well as the transformation of host cells into tumour cells. It also resp onds to tissue damage and any external stimuli that appear to pose a threat to the host. During the cour se of a lifetime, an individual will be exposed to pathogens ra nging from small intracellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses to large extracellular bacteria and parasites. Ideally, immune responses against invading pa thogens and emerging tumour cells should be tailored to the task at hand, in cluding the nature of the diseas e challenge, the temporal nature of the challenge and the specific location of the challenge. It is increasingly recognized that inappropriate immune responses in scope, durati on, location or specificit y have the potential to be as problematic, in terms of disease ris k, as insufficient immune responses. Therefore, immunotoxicity risk assessment has evolved to consider not only whether chemical expo- chemicals can increase health risk by changing the scope, duration, location or specificity of responses. ciated with immune dysfunction. Two categorie s are shown. In the first category, evidence suggests that environmentally induced immune dys function contributes dire ctly to the disease or condition. In the second category, patients with the disease have reported immune dys- function and/or misregulated inflammation, but a cause-effect relationship between immune dysfunction and these diseases ha s yet to be established. Reduction in the incidence of these diseases is one expected outcome of eff ective immunotoxicological risk assessment. A second, often overlooked role of the imm une system concerns the homeoregulatory maintenance of organ and tissue function. This role is played by reside nt myelomonocytic derived cells (e.g. macrophages) that can take numerous forms and are given different tissue- specific names (e.g. microglia, alveolar macr ophages, Kupffer cells , Langerhans cells). Because the forms are diverse and tissue specific , the interaction of these cell populations with the environment also has the potential to differ across tissues. Therefore, potential sensitivity of a Kupffer cell to a chemical expos ure is likely to differ significantly from that of an alveolar macrophage. The problem fro m an immunotoxicity perspective is that chemical-induced disruption of the homeoregulatory role of th e immune system may take the form of organ function alteration. Unless the mech anism is clear, the role of immune cells as targets leading to the advers e outcome may go unrecognized. Examples of the importance ofsures might compromise the sufficiency of imm une responses, but also whether exposure to Table 2.1 provides examples of di seases that have environmenta l risk factors and are asso-Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 5Table 2.1: Potential target diseases and disorders for immunotoxicology-driven risk reduction.a Disease or disorder Sex predominance, if any References Category 1b Acute otitis media \u2014 Boyle et al.

The immune system has several primary site s important for immune cell maturation (bone marrow, liver, thymus, Peyer's patches), as well as specific secondary lymphoid sites (spleen, lymph nodes, tonsils) that prov ide opportunities for an tigen presentation and the initiation of adaptive immune responses. Not surprisingly, an exposure to an immunotoxicant is likely to affect these various sites of immune ma turation and cell cooperation differentially. Beyond the presence of immune cells in most tissues, there exis ts a regional organization of immune cell populations that are important in lo cal immunity and are generally referred to as mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue. Two of th ese regional immune sites are also connected with two important chemical exposure routes: respiratory and oral. These are the bronchus- associated lymphoid tissue and the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, respectively. Additionally, mucosal lymphoid tissue is present in the urogenita l tract. Another important route is the skin, which has a specialized immune system base d on the Langerhans cell. Comparative immuno- toxicity information about these regional ly mphoid sites is only beginning to emerge. 2.2 The importance of immune challenge in detecting immunotoxicity Because the immune system is designed to prot ect host integrity from foreign challenge and potential insult, a gold standard for measuring i mmune system status is to evaluate the host response to foreign challenge. Th is requires challenge with an infectious agent (or tumour cells) or immunization with a foreign antigen. Depending upon the nature of the agent used for challenge or the immunogen, various immune cells will interact and respond with a predictable profile of responses . These responses can be standa rdized quite e xquisitely in terms of kinetics of responses, patterns of cell mobilization and emigration, spectrum of effector functions and magnitude of the re sponse, given the species, age and genetic background employed. Because the goal is to de tect chemically induced immune dysfunction toxicity in the lung and acetami nophen toxicity in the liver. Ta ble 2.1 also includes diseases Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 7with an impact on health risk, almost by de finition, immune function data are needed for the evaluation. In human and wildlife populations, it may be a ssumed that some low level of antigenic challenge is occurring at any given time. Howe ver, even in those populations, assessment of an immune system that is responding to an overt challenge (imm unization, vaccination or challenge with an infectious agent) is beneficial for dete cting immunotoxic outcomes. For example, Luster et al. (2005b) advocated the use of childhood vaccination responses, instead of standard blood cell profiles, as the prefer able and more sensitive biomarker for childhood immunotoxicity. This was employed by Heilmann et al. (2006) to dem onstrate the inverse relationship between cord blood polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels and response of the offspring to childhood vaccinations at age 7. Ther efore, opportunities to take advantage of normal immune challenges among human populat ions should be utilized for the most sensitive indicator of immune status. In safety testing employing labo ratory animals (e.g. rodents), th ere is the added problem that controlled environments may limit the opport unity for robust antigenic stimulation or infectious agent challenge. As a result, the res ting immune system of a laboratory animal in a controlled, relatively pathogen-free environment is an insensitive test system for evaluating chemically induced immune dysfunction. In cont rast, if host challenge is performed, the low ambient background stimulation in the laboratory animals becomes an advantage rather than a disadvantage. However, to accommodate devel opmental/reproductive or other safety test- ing, prior protocols have excl uded immunization or infecti ous agent challenge using the argument that such animal manipulation woul d alter the routine toxicological assessment performed on other physiological systems. It is important to recognize that evaluation of a resting immune system is unlikely to generate data that can be extrapolated with confidence to predict the spectrum of ch emically induced immune dysfunctions of concern. Using data generated by the United States National Toxico logy Program (NTP), Luster et al. (1992) reported eight different combinations of thr ee immune parameters that resulted in 100% predictability for the identific ation of immunotoxicants. None of these eight combinations lacked a functional assay, and a majority of the combinations included more than one immune function assay. Among the eight combina tions, the T helper-1 (Th1)-driven delayed- type hypersensitivity (DTH) y was several comb inations, the plaque-forming cell (PFC) assay in four combinations and na tural killer (NK) cell activity in three com- binations. If immune responses to antigen challenge are recognized as a sensitive approach for evalu- ating immune system status a nd structural evaluations of th e resting immune system are considered as less sensitive (as per Luster et al., 2005b), then first-tier immunotoxicity evaluations should include functional responses to antigeni c challenge. Testing strategies predicated solely on the detection of structur al (e.g. immunopathology) alterations of an un- challenged immune system may be convenient, but the parameters measured are far removed from the adverse effects of gr eatest concern. Vaccination res ponses in adults and children have been proposed as the gold standard for identifying human immunotoxicity (Van Loveren et al., 2001; Luster et al., 2005b), and the data support this (Sleijffers et al., 2001; Weisglas-Kuperus et al., 2004; Heilmann et No. 10 82.3 Dose-response relati onships and thresholds Comparative sensitivity of immune parameters to xenobiotic modulation can vary widely depending upon the nature of the toxicant, the ro ute of exposure and differential sensitivity of immune cell populations. Across th e literature, there are exampl es in which virtually every well-defined immune cell population has at some point been observed as the most sensitive target in immunotoxicity studies. For this re ason, no single immune bi omarker identified to date is reliable as an indicator of hazard iden tification for the immune system. The status of the host at the time of immune parameter m easurement can have an influence on sensitivity of the immune parameter as a biomarker of immunotoxicity. For example, the dose-response curve is likely to differ fo r NK cell activity following expos ure to an immunotoxicant, depending upon whether the host has received treatments that would activate NK cells (e.g. a viral infection) compared with NK activity m easured from an unchallenged host system. Use of activated instead of resting NK cells is more likely to provide a broader dose-response range, making it potentially easier to detect significant alterations (e.g. suppression) in function. This could influence the lowest-observed-adverse-e ffect level (LOAEL) for this parameter and therefore might have an impact on the low-dose end of a dose-response curve. Some studies have been published comparing the shape of dose-response curves for immuno- toxicants determined under activ ated versus resting conditions (Daniels et al., 1987). How- ever, further comparisons could prove benefi cial for risk assessment considerations. Additionally, because two immune parameters influenced by xenobiotic exposure may have different dose-response ranges as well as differently shaped dose-response curves, a \"safe\" dose for one parameter may not be \"safe\" for th e second. It should be noted that the dose- response relationship for a chemical toxicant can be influenced by the immunizing dose of antigen or challenge dose of infectious agent. Fu rthermore, in the case of chemical sensitizers with biphasic host responses, different dose-resp onse relationships can exist for the sensitiza- tion phase of the response compared with the induction phase of the allergic response. One of the concerns for immunotoxicity risk as sessment and for toxicity to other systems as well is the potential for non-monotonic (e.g. U- shaped) dose-response relationships. These types of responses were recen tly discussed for endocrine di srupting chemicals, such as bisphenol A (Hotchkiss et al., 2008). The mo st comprehensive review of dose-response curves for immune and immunotoxic respon ses was performed by Calabrese (2005), including this analysis Lovelace, 2005). The conclusions were that whereas linear and simple dose- response relationships exist for most xenobioti cs over some range of exposures, the entire dose-response curves can often ta ke the shape of \"U\" or inverted \"U\" forms. In these cases, very low dose exposures may produce effects that are opposite to those of high-dose exposures, otherwise known as hormesis. U-shap ed dose-response curves are also discussed by Portier & Ye (1998), includ ing their observation of the impact of toxicants on host responses to infectious agent challenge (Luster et al., 1993). Holladay et al. (2005) discussed how the U-shaped dose-response curves appear to be common with endocrine disruption of the immune system and are likely to represen t different contributing mechanisms, each with its own responding range of conc entrations for a given chemi cal. Hastings (2005) also provided examples of immunotoxicants with more than one mechanistic impact on the immune system, where each mechanism had a potentially different dose-response curve. From a practical discussion of the no-observe d-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) extrapolation from experimental animals to humans, Ladics & Lovelace (2005) pointed out the likelihood that most hormetic responses would not be observe d in the context of cu rrent safety testing, Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 9and they may be even more common than anticip ated. However, the authors added that there are significant challenges in applying a potential low-dose beneficial eff ect seen in a study of an otherwise highly immunotoxic chemical wh en considering risk for a diverse human population. One of the factors contributing to immune hormetic responses and usual dose-response curves may be the role of regulatory lymphocyte populations, such as the CD4+CD25+highFoxp3+ regulatory T cells, as targ ets of immunotoxicity. The cells have the capacity to control toleran ce, autoimmunity and tumour et al., 2008; Sakaguchi et al., 2008; Welters et al., 2008). Subtle shifts in the popu lation size or activity of regulatory T cells following chemical exposure could significantly affect the course of antigen-driven immune responses, and regulatory T cells are known to serve as targets of some immunotoxicants (Marshall et al., 2008). Therefore, regulatory T cells may play a role in mediating the opposing immune response outcomes observed at opposite ends of some dose-response curves. The question of possible thresholds for immu notoxicity (or the lack thereof) remains a controversial issue. Certainly, NOAELs have been found in many immunotoxicity investi- gations, including those with early-life exposure to chemicals. Kroes et al. (2000) reviewed the opportunity to apply a threshold of toxico logical concern (TTC) standard to determine priorities in toxicology testin g among chemicals. Their analys is included the NTP database for the immune system. However, other st udies have found the latency effect, where supposed subthreshold exposures to xenobiotics seem to rewire the immune system for prob- lematic later-life responses (pot entially requiring a second subthreshold exposure to the same chemical). These findings raise problems with the threshold concept. Additionally, hormetic simply the bottom of the \"U\" on the U-shaped curve. These contradictory findings indicate the importance of defining subt hreshold/threshold boundaries in the context of those immune parameters evaluated. A prior WHO document, Environmental Health Criteria (EHC) 170 (IPCS, 1994), considered risk assessment for ch emical exposures with non-threshold effects extrapolation by mathematical modelling of th e dose-response curve, 2) relative ranking of potencies in the experimental range and 3) divi sion of effect levels by an uncertainty factor. threshold values as well as the application of uncertainty factor s as influenced by such factors as species, sex, strain, age, de velopmental status of test animals, group size, sensitivity of methodology, duration of exposure and se lection of the doses examined. 2.4 Induction of tolerance EHC 236 (IPCS, 2006a). The capacity to betw een self and non-self is a crit ical feature of the immune system and one that operates at self levels in several locations, involvi ng multiple cell types, receptors, cytokines and metabolites. Improper r ecognition of, and response directed against, autoantigens can result in autoimmune disease. These self-reactions can occur by a variety of mechanisms and cause damage to a variety of tis sues and organs classified under a variety of names (e.g. type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Gr aves disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, U-shaped dose-response curves suggest that so me apparent subthreshold results might be (see section 3.1.1 of EHC 170). Among the appr oaches utilized were 1) quantitative The same document (see section 3.1.2 of EHC 170) also discussed ri sk assessment with Mechanisms of self-tolerance were recently re viewed in section 3.4 of the WHO document, Harmonization Project Document No. 10 10myasthenia gravis). It should be noted that most autoimmune diseases show sex bias (occurring predominantly in either females or males). Therefore, environmentally mediated risk of specific autoimmune manifestations is significantly different across sexes. Central immune tolerance is ge nerated via the thymus (for T cells) and bone marrow (for B cells) during development. In the thymus, thymoc ytes receive positive or negative selection signals from the epithelial stoma. The natu re of the signal is dependent upon the binding affinity of a given thymocyte for se lf major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (Daniels et al., 2006). Autoreac tive thymocytes recognize self -MHC peptides with a strong binding affinity and receive a negative selec tion signal in the thymus that results in programmed cell death or apoptosi s. This subsequent deletion of autoreactive thymocytes is directly linked to the level of the T cell receptor affinity binding for self-MHC peptides (Naeher et al., 2007). This negative selection event in early development is critical for reduced risk of autoimmunity (Sohn et al., 2007). Generation of self-recognizing T cells via impaired negative selection in the developi ng thymus (Parish & H eath, 2008) increases the risk of autoimmunity. B cell tolerance can be achieved by receptor edit ing, revision of the B cell repertoire, via a negative selection deletion of cells (fetal) in the bone marrow or via T cell anergy in the periphery (Caucheteux et al., 2008). Peripheral immune tolerance is important, as ne gative selection in the thymus is not fully efficient, and T cell receptor ed iting and revision may lead to the emergence of autoreactive T cells in the periphery. Generation of diversity in the periphery can help to maintain resistance to a wide spectrum of pathogens , but the downside is the poten tial for peripherally generated autoreactive T cells (Wagner, 2007). The balance between having a suffici ently robust T cell receptor repertoire and the potential for autoi mmunity is one of the major areas of concern with xenobiotic-immune system interactions. A variety of cell types and cell- derived factors are important in the control of tolerance factor-beta (TGF- ) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a critical link in tolerance maintenance (Li & Flavell, 2008). Inte ractions of invariant NK T cells with dendriti c cells appear to be important in the tolerogenic network (Yamamura et al., 2007; Tamura et al., 2008). Additionally, classic immunotoxica nts can cause persistent antig en-specific tolerance (i.e. immunosuppression) through th e inappropriate stimulation of re gulatory T cells (Kang et al., 2008). The status of regula tory T cells is an impo rtant factor in risk of human disease (Cools et al., 2007a,b). These cells can induce tole rance and suppress autoimmune responses. However, if their activity is inappropriately en hanced, their action can result in immuno- suppression. In contrast, if regulatory T cell ac tivity is impaired follo wing chemical exposure, a higher risk of autoimmunity can result. Fina lly, regulatory B cells as well as specialized populations of myelocytic cells have also been identified as playing a role in tolerance and appear to be mediated via TGF- and IL-10 production (M auri & Ehrenstein, 2008). 2.5 The possibilities for advers e outcomes: immune stimulation, suppression and/or misregulation Because the immune system has numerous effector and regulatory cell functions that operate at local, regional and systemic levels, exposur e to xenobiotics has the capability of producing any combination of the following recognized adve rse outcomes: 1) focused or more extensive immunosuppression, 2) increased propensity fo r allergic disease, including atopy, food allergies and asthma, 3) hypersensitivity reactions directed at the chemical itself, 4) increased (reviewed in section 3.4 of EHC 236; IPCS, 2006a). Producti on of transforming growth Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 11risk of autoimmune disease and 5) dysfunctiona l responses of innate immune cells producing tissue or organ damage or dysfunction. These dysfunctional responses include pseudoallergic responses or exaggerated or inappropriately pr olonged inflammatory responses that result in significant organ insult, dysfunc tion and disease. The innate immune inflammatory dys- function may also affect the status of adap tive immune function, crea ting additional health risks. The present document recognizes that each adve rse outcome has potentially serious implica- tions for health risk. Whereas immunosuppression might be expect ed to increase the risk of infectious and neoplastic diseases, inappropriate stimulation could elevate the risk of allergic and autoimmune diseases. Likewise , misregulation of immune res ponses can affect the risk of both inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. Th erefore, the ramificati ons of inappropriate immune stimulation, suppression and misregulation are given e qual weight in the present document. As discussed below, these adverse outcomes are not always mutually exclusive. Instead, they can co-exist followi ng exposure to certain toxicants. Numerous examples of combinations of thes e immunotoxic outcomes exist in the literature. For example, exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin (TCDD) can produce immuno- suppression (Smialowicz et al., 2004), increased risk of autoimmunity (Mustafa et al., 2008) and misregulated inflammation (Luebke et al., 2002). In fact, it seems likely that a greater percentage of immunotoxicants than previous ly recognized do produce a broad spectrum of dysfunction or misregulation rather than only immunosuppression. Additionally, chemicals with little to no systemic immunosuppressive effects at relevant ex posure levels are not necessarily free from producing effects locally that result in immunotoxic adverse outcomes. If testing did not include assessment of risk of allergic disease and autoimmunity, the potential risk remains unknown. One reason w hy these broader possibilities for adverse outcomes were not previously recognized is th at prior immunotoxicity testing analyses were focused primarily on immunosuppression or chem ical-specific contact hypersensitivity. They were never designed to detect elevated risk of allergic disease, autoimmunity, misdirected inflammation or even limited or local imm unosuppression. The categorization of a xenobiotic as an immunosuppressive agent, as an aller gy-inducing agent or as posing little immunotoxic risk is only as accurate as the range of te sting performed. Therefore, in many cases, assess- ment has been incomplete, and the categoriz ation should be viewed in this context. The impact of genotype is impor tant in determining the risk of any potential immunotoxic adverse outcome for an individual. Not only can the toxicokinetics (or pharmacokinetics) of chemical metabolism and distribution differ acro ss populations, but so can the propensity for certain spectra and levels of immune respons es. Therefore, low-le vel exposure of a popula- tion to a chemical capable of increasing the risk of allergic disease or reducing childhood vaccine responses would be expected to produ ce adverse outcomes in only a portion of the exposed population. This means that a significa nt exposure to a risk factor for increased allergic disease (e.g. diesel exhaust) might shift only a s ubpopulation of the exposed group into atopy. Nevertheless, the impact of a 10-15% in crease in allergic dise ase or, alternatively, childhood vaccine failures represents a significant public health concern. 2.6 The developing immune system If the immune system itself is a special toxicological case base d on its systemic distribution and multifunctional nature, risk assessment for th e developing immune system represents an extra complexity of health concern (I PCS, 2006b). Developmental immunotoxicity Harmonization Project Document No. 10 12considerations were not included in the pr ior WHO document, EHC 180, on immunotoxicity associated with exposure to chemicals (IPCS, 1996). However, significant progress has been made in developmental immunotoxicology rese arch and potential developmental immuno- toxicity testing in the interim. Therefore, it is appropriate that the developing immune system be included. Because normal maturation of the immune syst em is dependent upon specific processes that differ in both time and location within the body, the immune system of the non-adult is truly a moving toxicological target for xenobiotic Piersma, 2004; Burns-Naas et al., 2008). Much of immune development in humans occurs during gestation (Holsapple et al., 2003; Leibnitz, 2005), although critical adjustments in the leve l and spectrum of immune response capacities as well as in the capacity for immunological memory (a hallmark of the immune system) continue to change after birth. Hence, the pren atal, neonatal, juvenile and adolescent immune systems should be viewed as distinct from that of the adult in terms of risk assessment. Prenatal immune maturational processes are de pendent upon reservoirs of immature immune cell types (e.g. fetal liver, bone marrow) as well as specific organs (thymus) or regions (Peyer's patch) in which specific cell maturati on and repertoire selection can occur. Both cell trafficking and cell-cell intera ctions are prerequisites for immune maturation. It is during these early-life processes that critical functions emerge, such as the ability to correctly identify self from non-self and to establish resident immune populations in each organ for homeoregulatory surveillance. In an effort to facilitate examination of the comparative sus- ceptibility of these processes to immunotoxic disruption, works hop participants and others partitioned both systemic and local immune de velopment into critical windows or stages, which would be expected to differ in immuno toxic vulnerability (Dietert The windows of potential differential vulnerability are defined by functional or active processes involving the immune system rather than more static mor phometric alterations. At issue is not simply whether the non-adult differs from the adult in specific immune-b ased health risks following a given xenobiotic exposure, but also whether different stages of life within the non-adult would exhibit significant di fferential vulnerabilities. Research results using age-timed exposures and several categories of xenobiotics suggest that critical windows of immune development do differ in terms of the potential health risk that would result from a given early-life exposur e to a toxicant (Bunn et al., 2001a; Hogaboam et al., 2008). For example, early gestational exposure of rats to the heavy metal lead targets macrophage activity, whereas later gestational exposure produces the hallmark shift in Th function towards a Th2 bias (Bunn et al., 2001a). There are several ways in which the young are at greater health risk from immunotoxicants compared with adults (reviewe d in Dietert & Piepenbrink, 2 006b). First, the fetus and neo- nate are sensitive to lower doses of immunotoxi cants compared with the adult. Additionally, both the duration (persistence versus transitory adverse outcomes) and the spectrum of effects are usually greater following early-life compared with adult exposure. Finally, early-life, low- level exposure to toxicants can rewire the im mune system for unpredictable host responses with later-life, lower-level exposure to the same chemical and/or adult stress. This has been termed latency and is among the outcomes c onsidered in the next section. Obviously, a significantly increased dose sensitivity in ear ly life, potentially pe rmanent effects after chemical exposure has ceased, broader-spectrum adverse effects and fetal rewiring of the Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 13immune system are all special developmental im munotoxic risks that need to be considered in determining safe levels of chemical expos ure for the young. An example of the challenge follows. Dose sensitivity is greater in early life than in adulthood for those immunotoxicants com- pared across ages. Luebke et al. (2006a) reported that dose sensitivity to lead prenatally was approximately 10-fold higher than that in adu lts. In contrast, the age-based sensitivity to TCDD differed by approximately 100-fold in rats . This suggests the util ity of having direct developmental immunotoxicity data when possible, as applicat ion of standard uncertainty factors may be problematic. The spectrum of adverse outcomes from deve lopmental immunotoxicity testing falls into several subcategories; all of them are encompassed under th e umbrella of immune dys- function and/or misregulati on. Immunosuppression can produce an increased risk of infec- tions and cancer (Vorderstrasse et al., 2006; Ng et al., 2006), whereas exaggerated responses (Rowe et al., 2006) are likely to c ontribute to an increased risk of allergic or autoimmune diseases. However, the same chemical can pr oduce both targeted immune suppression (Gehrs & Smialowicz, 1999) and increased risk of au toimmunity (Mustafa et al., 2008). Because specific immune testing is frequently limite d to a few immune parameters, detection of immunosuppression in one series of tests would not preclude th e test chemical from also producing enhanced risk of alle rgy or autoimmunity unless pr edictive immunotoxicity testing eliminated those additional possibilities. An ex ample of the latter is with diethylstilbestrol (DES), an agent that produces significant th ymic atrophy and T ce ll loss with prenatal exposure (Besteman et al., 2005) while concomitantly increasing the positive selection and persistence of autoreactive T cell clones (Brown et al., 2006). Prenatal exposure to heavy metals such as lead and mercury can suppres s certain immune func tion capacities while simultaneously elevating the ri sk of allergies and/or auto immunity (Miller et al., 1998; Pilones et al., 2007). Sex-related effects ar e developm ental immunotoxicity (Blyler et al., 1994; Bunn et Rooney et al., 2003; Guo et al., 2005a); for this reason, differential health risks following chemi cal exposure of female and male fetuses and neonates should be taken into cons ideration in risk assessment. 2.7 Early-life exposure/later-life effects Later-life diseases linked to early-life immune insults were recently considered by several researchers (Bakker et al., 2000; Holladay, et al., 201 0). These diseases linked to environmental risk factors and i mmune dysfunction, where the immune dysfunction appears to be causally related to the disease, and 2) those diseases where immune dysfunction and/or misregulated inflammation are evident, which may represent either a cause of the disease or an associated adverse outcome. The former group includes enhancement of paed iatric diseases such as childhood ear infec- tions, leukaemia, influenza, asthma, type 1 di abetes seases (Greaves, 2006; Yeatts et Dieter t & Zelikoff, 2008; A. Schneider et al., 2008). Additional diseases of paediatric and/or adul t onset include multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, coelia c disease, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune thyroiditis (Graves and Hashimoto diseases) and atherosclerosis (Villanueva et al., 2000; and disorders, as listed in Table 2.1, fall into two major categor ies: 1) those diseases clearly Harmonization Project Document No. 10 14Briani et al., 2008; Compston & Coles, 2008; Rahman et al., 2008; Stanca et al., 2008; Hanson, 2009). Diseases in the second category have possible links to early-life misr egulated inflammation and/or immune insult. However, in these ca ses, cause-effect relationships between the immune problems and the diseases have not been firmly established. These diseases include autism, myalgic encephalomyelitis, schizophrenia, Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease (Block & Hong, 2007; Klimas 2009; Rentzos et al., 2009). It should be noted that some of these diseases may involve prenat al immunotoxicity paired with pos tnatal events that serve as a disease trigger. For example, a dysf unctional immune response to common childhood infections is now seen as a final step leading to childhood leukaemia (Greaves, 2006). An environmentally induced, prenatal-perinatal immunotoxic event would be needed to produce the required neonatal immune dysf unction. This would precede th e infectious agent trigger for the disease (discussed in Dietert, 2009b; Di etert & Dietert, 2010). Similarly, it has been suggested that risk of Parkinson disease ma y involve a combination of early-life inflam- matory insults in the brain and cell loss th rough normal ageing processes (Block & Hong, 2007; Soreq et al., 2008; Yankner et al., 2008). Early-life immune in sult can interact with the normal ageing process such that the adverse outcome of developmental immunotoxicity may not appear until long after the original prenatal-neonatal immune insult and may affect multiple health risks over a life course (Dietert & Zelikoff, 2009) . In other cases, a later adult exposure to the same or a similar chemical may be needed for the developmental immuno-toxicity-related adverse outcome to become a pparent. An example of this has been reported with estrogenic chemicals (Fenaux et al., 2004). One of the concerns with deve lopmental immunotoxicity is that an early-life insult of the thymus may affect the age-related decline in T cell-dependent immune responses observed in geriatric populations. Mouse mo dels suggest that normal ageing involving the thymus can produce holes in the diversity of the T cell repertoire in concert with otherwise normal levels of immune response (Yager et al., 2008). The hei ghtened disease risk is that these repertoire gaps increase the likelihood of failed responses to specific infectious agents and/or tumour cells. Investigators have observed this as a re duced spectrum of eff ective host resistance responses as well as the potential for reduced responses to vaccinations (Yager et al., 2008). Some low-level prenatal-neonatal exposures to xenobiotics may result in later adult host resistance gaps that might be seen only am ong geriatric populations fo llowing challenge with an infectious agent or vaccine. This is one pot ential early-life exposure/ later-life disease risk that has yet to be i nvestigated extensively. 2.8 Current practices At the time of the development of this documen t, current practices in immunotoxicity testing are varied and employ both unchallenged as well as challenged immune systems. Therefore, testing results in different types of data for us e in risk assessment. The basic regulations for immunotoxicity testing of chemicals and drugs are discussed in two reviews (Schulte & Ruehl-Fehlert, 2006; Spanhaak, 2006). Most im munotoxicity testing historically has been organized into tiers that increase in specifici ty at each subsequent le vel (Luster et al., 1988, 1992; Hinton, 2000). Use of second or third tiers enables the generation of data of increased quality and specificity. However, this also come s as a result of added time, cost and potential use of laboratory animals. Therefor e, the nature of the primary screen (tier 1) is crucial in the type of data usually availabl e to the risk assessor. The organization and composition of each Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 15tier have evolved in recent deca des and are under further discu ssion at this time. The primary issues are as follows: 1) Should histopathology and cell enumeration of an unchallenged immune system be considered sufficient for hazard id entification of immunotoxicants? 2) When would immune function assessment be performed in a testing scheme? 3) What is sufficient as a functional assessment of the immune system? 4) How and when would relevant developmen tal immunotoxicity data be collected? 5) How will testing strategies originally de signed to detect immunosuppression be modified for detection of the full spect rum of immune dysfunction (e.g. risk of immunosuppression, allergy, autoimmunity and misregulated inflammation)? Obviously, the simplest and least expensive pr actice is for extended histopathology and cell counting data to be collected on existing anim als. These animals may also be used in developmental and reproductive protocols for ag e-based evaluations. However, this informa- tion would usually be collected from an uncha llenged immune system. The potential pitfalls of this strategy have been previously di scussed. If histopathology-haematology of an un- immunized or unchallenged immu ne system represents the primary screen for immune- related hazard identification (e.g. as used in OECD Test Guidelines 407, 416, 419 and 421, the EU's Registration, Evaluation, Authorisatio n and Restriction of Chemical Substances [REACH] and the ICH S8 protocol s), then immune function data may never be collected. It should be noted that the 1998 immu notoxicity testing guidelines of the Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances (OPPTS) of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) (OPPTS 870.7800: USEPA, 1998) indicate that routine toxicity testing (e.g. histology, organ weights, haematology) alone is not sufficient to predict immuno- toxicity. It seems highly questionable whether combined histological an alysis, organ weights and cell counting in the absence of robust functional testing would detect unintended immunosuppression as well as unintended immune stimulation. Unintended immune stimula- tion has significant implications for potential disease (Karrow et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2005a; Ponce, 2008). Additionally, unintended immune stim ulation would affect the risk of allergy and autoimmunity, two categories of disease that need to be addressed in immunotoxicity risk assessment (Luster et al., 1999; Smith & Germolec, 1999; Selgrade et al., 2006; Yeatts et al., Several recent reviews have disc ussed these testing issues for the adult and/or developing immune system. Some have emphasized using histopathology, or gan weights and cell enumeration without the necessity of functi onal testing (Snodin, 2004) or placed a special emphasis on the use of pathology (Burns-Naas et al., 2008). In contrast, others have advo- cated the benefits of extending beyond hi stopathology to include functional immune assessment of a challenged immune system in pr imary testing (Luster et al., 2003; Putman et al., 2003; Van Loveren et 006; Dietert & 2007). At present, following recent (2008) harmonization efforts, ther e is no requirement for functional testing of a challenged immune system in any primar y testing tier (e.g. OECD test guidelines, EU REACH and ICH S8), except for pesticide testing in the USA (OPPTS 870.7800: USEPA, 1998). However, given the recent call for direct immune function data to be collected from children to aid in their protection (Luster et al., 2005b), continued reliance on non-functional data derived from unchallenged animals seems doubtful. 2006) (see Table 2.1). Harmonization Project Document No. 10 16Some strategies to obtain im mune function data in the most relevant context for human disease risk have used infectious agent chal lenges that combine imm une function evaluations with host resistance measures (Mitchell & Lawrence, 2003; Vorderstrasse et al., 2006; Burleson & Burleson, 2007). This can offer an ex tensive challenge of the immune system (potentially beyond that normally obtained with protein antigen immunization) and also permits a direct assessment of cytotoxic T ly mphocyte function along with other standard immune function tests. If infectious agent ch allenge is used to re place immunizations sheep erythrocytes or keyhole limpet ha emocyanin [KLH]), then combined immune function and host resistance data may be collect ed using the same number of animals as required for routine immune function assays (e.g. a T cell-dependent antibody response assay). 2.9 Newer approaches Although there is incentive to obtain data more directly indicative of immune function status in immunotoxicity screening, there is also a desire to minimize labor atory animal use in safety screening. This combination has led to the pursuit of several new avenues of investigation into screening tools (Chatterjee et al., 2006). The new tools may help to direct which chemicals should be subjected to more detailed immunotoxicity testing. One of the new areas is that of immunotoxi cogenomics. Progress in this area was recently reviewed by Luebke et al. (2006b), Vandebriel & Van Lovere n (2010) and Vandebriel et al. (2011). The strategy behind this approach is to be able to detect critical change s in the expression of immune function-related genes or pathways th at might direct more extensive functional testing among candidate chemicals. In addition to genes, profiling of protein expression (i.e. proteomics) may also be applied for this pur pose (Osman et al., 2009, 201 0). Because it is not feasible to test all chemicals fully for i mmunotoxic potential, an immunotoxicogenomics screen could serve to identify the subset of chemicals of greatest he alth concern requiring further testing. In a similar ve in, Baken et al. (2007, 2008), Hoch stenbach et al. (2010) and Vandebriel et al. (2010) recently reported the use of overlapping gene expression as a strategy to assess immunotoxicity. While th e immunotoxicogenomics and immunoproteomics approaches are new and offer considerable promis e, additional work is needed in defining the optimum set of biomarkers refl ecting the array of immune func tion concerns. Currently, such information may aid in the understanding of mechanisms of immunotoxicity, but the application will likely be limited to hazar d identification for the immediate future. In addition to traditional in vivo exposure assess ment, in vitro approaches continue to play a role as screening tools (Lankveld et al., 2010 ; Vandebriel et al., 2010). One of the newer strategies has been the use of a \"cell chip\" a nd various immune cell lines (e.g. T cells, mast cells, monocytes) as a reporter system for ch emically induced changes in immune-relevant gene expression (e.g. cytokine expression) (Trzaska et al., 2005; Wagner et al., 2006). Large numbers of chemicals can be compared with the in vitro procedure. It remains to be determined precisely how and when this would be integrated into other testing strategies, and currently such information may be used to elucidate mechanisms of immunotoxicity. Yet development of sensitive and predictive in vitr o approaches using molecular biomarkers for identifying immunotoxicants moves quickl y, and, based on proper phenotypic anchoring, they do hold promise for hazard identification and eventually may aid in qualitative or quantitative risk assessment (Adler et al., 2011). 17 3. FRAMEWORK FOR IMMUNOTOXICITY RISK ASSESSMENT FOR CHEMICALS 3.1 Risk assessment The risk assessment process is composed of f our main steps: hazard identification, hazard characterization (or dose-response assessment), exposure assessment and risk characteriza- tion. IPCS (2004) defined hazard as the inherent property of an agent or situation having the potential to cause adverse effect s when an organism, system or (sub)population is exposed to that agent. An adverse effect is define d as any change in the morphology, physiology, growth, development, reproduction or lifespan of an organism, system or (sub)population that results in an impairment of functional capacity, an impairment of the capacity to compensate for additional stress or an increase in susceptibi lity to other influences. Risk is described as the probability of an adverse effect in an organism, sy stem or (sub)population caused under specified circumstances by exposure to an agent. Safety is defined as the practical certainty that adverse effects will not result from expos ure to an agent under defined circumstances and is considered the reciprocal of risk. A risk assessment should be preceded by a problem formulation phase, which establis hes the goals, scope and focus of the risk assessment. The term risk analysis is used to describe the ove rall procedure comprising all the steps of risk assessment, risk management and risk communi cation. Risk management can be described as the process of weighing po licy alternatives, decision- making and action taking. A risk assessment can be performed as a basis for a safety assessment or as an actual risk assessment estimating the likelihood and the nature of adverse health effects in the case of an exposure in excess of a derived safe exposure lim it or in the absence of a safe exposure limit (for thresholded toxicity ) or in the case of an exposure to a substanc e for which a threshold risk assessment processes have been published to which the reader is referred for detailed information. The toxicological hazard identificati on is aimed at identifying the nature of the potential health effects of a chemical substan ce. Information on toxicological end-points may be derived from laboratory animal studies, but human data should be used whenever available. If the data from humans and anim als address comparable exposure scenarios and end-points and are of similar quality, human da ta should take precedence over extrapolation from laboratory animal data. During the charac terization of the hazard database, mode of action (MOA) information can be used to dete rmine the human relevance for immunotoxicity following chemical exposure and can contribut e to a weight of evidence approach. A postulated MOA is a biologically plausible sequence of key ev ents leading to an observed effect supported by robust expe rimental observations and mechan istic data. It describes key cytological and biochemical even ts\u2014that is, those that are both measurable and necessary to the observed effect\u2014in a logical framework. MOA contrasts with mechanism of action, which generally involves a sufficient understandi ng of the molecular basis for an effect and its detailed description so that causation can be established in molecular terms (Boobis et al., 2006). Key event approaches have been discu ssed in general by Julien et al. (2009) and focused on an immune disorder (food allerg y) by Taylor et al. (2009). WHO recently published a framework for MOA analysis for non-cancer end-points, including immunotoxicity (Boobis et al., 2008). The hazard characterization inves tigates and describes the dose-effect relationships for the identifie d hazards. Where a threshold for toxicity is assumed, as is the case for imm unotoxicity, a level of exposure c onsidered to present minimal or no risk for health effects to the general population can be established on the basis of an for toxicity is not or cannot be assumed to exist. Several reviews (see chapter 1 ) on safety and Harmonization Project Document No. 10 18overall NOAEL and an applicable uncertainty/safety/assessment factor. The basic method for deriving these health-based guidance values is similar across national and international agencies; however, the definitions and specific methods used to derive these values from toxicity data differ slightly and depend on th e agency involved. Commonly derived values include the reference dose/reference concen tration (RfD/RfC) used by the USEPA, the minimal risk levels used by the United States Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the acceptable daily intake/tole rable daily intake (ADI/TDI) used by WHO (IPCS, 1994, 1999a, 2009). There are also a number of adaptations of these general terms, such as the acceptable exposure level (AEL) co mmonly referred to in risk assessments for sensitization. The NOAEL may be used as the po int of departure (POD) for application of the total uncertainty factor in derivation of health -based guidance values such as the RfD/RfC or ADI/TDI, but health-based guidance values may also be derived through the benchmark dose (BMD) approach (see EHC 239 [IPCS, 2009] for a detailed discussion). A health-based guidance value is meant as a reference point in safety assessment and for determining the need to perform a detailed risk assessment, as exposure at or below the RfD/RfC or ADI/TDI is considered to be safe. An integral step in the risk assessment pro cess concerns the exposure assessment, in which information on previous, current or expected exposure is collected and quantitatively described. The final step of the risk assessment process is the risk characterization, in which the e xposure assessment results are inte grated with and assessed in relation to the hazard assessment results. In the case of threshold effects, an exposure below the RfD/RfC or ADI/TDI can be regarded to be without appreciable risk. However, when the health-based guidance value is exceeded, it cannot be automatically concluded that an adverse effect will occur. It is important to r ealize that the health-based guidance value is not the lower bound of toxicity in humans. The RfD/RfC or ADI/TDI is regarded as a safe dose, and there is generally a margin of safety between this valu e and the lower bound of toxicity. In many cases, short-term excursions above th e health-based guidance value may be without appreciable risk. To judge for how long and by how much the health -based guidance value may be exceeded or to characterize the risk in the case of an exposure exceeding the health- based guidance value, an evaluation on a case-by-case basis is needed. The TTC approach is a pragma tic aid in risk assessment fo r substances for which no or limited toxicological information is available. It is aimed at establishing a human exposure threshold value for chemicals, below which there is a very low probability of an appreciable risk for human health. Kroes et al. (2000) concluded that it is applicable for immuno- toxicology. Further guidance on th e application of the TTC prin ciple in risk assessment is provided by Kroes et al. (2004) and Munro et al. (2008). Kroe s et al. (2004) proposed a guidance for the application of the TTC principl e in risk assessment of low molecular weight chemicals in food. This guidan ce includes a stepwise approac h, allocating different TTCs to different classes of chemicals. Munro et al. (2 008) proposed a further refinement of the appli- cation of the TTC approach in risk assessment. This guidance document generally presents the de terministic approach to risk assessment. In some situations and cases, a probabilistic approach is feasible and may be more useful to quantify risk at the population level. For exampl e, in the area of food allergy, a probabilistic approach has been developed and applied, am ong others, for quantifying risks of cross- contamination of food products with allergens (Spa njersberg et al., 2007, 2010; Kruizinga et al., 2008; Madsen, 2009). Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 193.2 Application of risk assessment principles to immunotoxicity Immunotoxicity risk assessment should be pe rformed according to the same principal approaches as applied in risk assessment fo r other (thresholded) t oxicological end-points. There is no evidence suggesting fundamental differences between immunotoxicity and other toxicological areas that would demand a fundamentally differe nt approach in risk assessment. specific consideration in risk assessment. In pa rticular, the lack of harmonized guidelines or consensus regarding data requirements and st udy protocols for immunotoxicity assessment poses specific complexity for immunotoxicity ri sk assessment in comparison with other, more developed areas of toxicology. Exposure to xenobiotics has the capability of producing any combination of the following recognized adverse outcomes (c hapter 2): 1) focused or mo re extensive immunosuppression, 2) increased propensity for alle rgic disease, including atopy, food allergies and asthma, 3) hypersensitivity reactions directed at the chemical itself, 4) increased risk of autoimmune tissue or organ damage or dysfunction. Each type of immunotoxicity manifests different specific aspects and therefore requires different specific considerations for risk asse ssment. The different t ypes of immunotoxicity and their specific aspects are addressed in the next chapters, giving ri sk assessment guidance suppression and sensitization, and to a lesser extent for autoimmunity, risk assessment can be built upon well-established model sy stems, mechanistic data and e xperience. This is reflected in a higher level of detail in these chapters relative to that on immunostimulation. As described in the following chapters, structur ed approaches can be followed in the risk assessment for each separate type of immunotoxicity. For risk a ssessors, not only is it impor- tant to be able to follow transparent and structured approaches for risk assessment for each type of immunotoxicity, but it is also important to have entr y points for immunotoxicity risk assessment. Such entry points are based on the available data for a given chemical and are structured to help the risk assessor determ ine whether immunotoxicity needs to be consid- ered, and what type of immunotoxicity needs to be considered, in a risk analysis. Therefore, an overview with possible entry points was developed for chemical risk assessors and is Expert judgement of the available information and situation on a case-by-case basis is crucial. Experts in immunotoxicology may n eed to be consulted for this. The entry points for immu- notoxicity risk assessment given in this chapter can also be considered to convey triggers (information retrieved from a data set that aler ts for potential immunotoxic ity) that might lead to an interaction between a risk assessor confronted with potential immunotoxicity and immunotoxicology experts. The guidance given in this document should not be considered as an inflexible set of require- ments, but rather as an aid to determine when and what type of immu notoxicity needs to be considered and what steps (stepwise approach in risk assessment) might be followed. The (stepwise) approach needs to be attuned to the objective of th e risk assessment and the risk management questions. An inhere nt problem of any risk assessm ent is the question of how to However, the immune system manifests many special aspects (see chapter 2 ) that need for immunosuppression (chapter 4), immunostimulation (chapter 5), sensitization and allergic disease and 5) dysfunctional inflammatory re sponses of innate immune cells, producing response (chapter 6) and auto immunity and autoimmune di sease (chapter 7). For immuno- described in section 3.4. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 20identify and deal with knowledge and data gaps. This should be an aspect of specific consid- eration in the eval uation of the health -related database. 3.3 General considerations for immunotoxicity risk assessment 3.3.1 Introduction To accurately predict the risk of immunotoxicity from xe nobiotic exposures in human populations, a scientifically sound immunotoxicity risk assessm ent framework is required ences in immune function during development and old age are not well understood, concerns for the special vulnerability of these life stages have been established and must be taken into tibility to infectious and neoplastic diseases, if the magnitude of suppression is sufficient to allow overgrowth of infectious agents or prev ent destruction of spontaneously arising neo- plastic cells (see chapter 4). H ypersensitivity (allerg ic) responses associated with chemical exposure may be the result of a di rect allergic response to the chemical or modulation of the immune response that skews the immune respons e so that allergic responses are more common or of greater severity (see chapte r 6). Autoimmune disease following chemical exposure may be caused by a loss of immune sy stem ignorance (tolerance) of self-antigens, by chemical modification of tissu es that renders them sufficiently foreign that they engender an immune response or by loss of other control mechanisms that results in self-reactivity (see chapter 7). Unintended stimulation of immune function has received very limited research attention and may or may not be a direct ca use of disease (see chapter 5). However, chemicals that cause unintended stimulation have been associat ed with autoimmune disease and thus may signal dysregulation of homeostatic processes required to maintain the critical balance between adequate immune responses and pathological loss of immune system control. 3.3.2 Clinical and epidemiological data 3.3.2.1 Clinical data Immunotoxicology data in humans may be derived from well-designed clinical or epidemio- logical studies, observational studies or case reports. Although controlled clinical studies represent the best oppo rtunity to identify a nd characterize immunotoxicants, they are not routinely conducted for environmental or occ upational chemicals for obvious ethical reasons. Where the ethical issues have been appropriately resolved, immune function data following controlled exposure in humans would require the least extrapolation and present the strongest data for estimating risk for the general population. 3.3.2.2 Epidemiological data The primary study design employed for evalua tion of potential immunotoxicity in humans following exposure to environmental or occupa tional agents has been the retrospective epidemiological study, usually in individuals wi th transient high-level occupational exposure or large cohorts with chroni c low-level exposures.

Many of the studies are based upon fairly small sample sizes, the subjects may have been exposed to additional chemicals other than those specifically addressed by the st udy, the population may be self-selected or characterization of exposure (duration and intensity) may have re lied upon subject recall. Immunological testing is often limited to one or two tests and designed to identify very severe immunological effects, ra ther than mild to moderate changes. Studies evaluating changes in host resistance have been reviewed in detail by several authors (Thomas et al., 1995; Vial et al., 1996; Voccia et al., 1999; Luebke, 2002). Some of the more complete immunotoxicology studies in humans have exam ined persistent organochlorine compounds, formerly found in pesticides and industrial chemicals (e.g. PCBs), in children following prenatal or postnatal exposure (via maternal diet and breast milk) (reviewed in Luster et al., 2004). There is also considerable human evid ence for an associati on between exposure to pesticides and autoimmunity (reviewed in Holsapple, 2002). Surface marker analysis (immunophenotyping) and serum immunoglobulin levels are the most commonly employed tests to evaluate immunological changes in human studies. These tests are routinely conducted in large hospitals and have provi ded considerable information on the ontogeny and activation state of the human immune system, as well as assisting in the clinical diagnosis for immunological (e.g. primary immunodeficien cy, acquired immuno- deficiency syndrome [AIDS]) and haematopoietic disorders. However, care in both experi- mental design and technical performance is impor tant in order to obtain the sensitivity that would consistently detect subt le changes in the immune system due to considerable inter- laboratory and interindividual va riability. Shearer et al. (2003) , working with the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group to determ ine immunophenotype valu es in a large ( n = 807) control population as a function of age, demons trated variances within each age group that often exceeded 2-fold, despite efforts to cont rol for interlaboratory and intralaboratory methodological differences and di scarding the highest and lowe st 10th percentile values. In addition to age, immunophenotype values can be greatly influenced by sex, ethnicity and environmental factors (Marti et al., 2002). In many human st udies, statistically significant differences have been found between the contro l and case populations w ith respect to serum immunoglobulin levels and immuno phenotypes. However, because of the large variability in historical control values, case values may be si gnificantly different from control values while still falling within historically normal ranges, making interpretation of the results difficult. An example of this problem can be seen in CD8+ T cell enumeration derived from studies of children with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (H IV-1) infection (Shearer et al., 2000) and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon exposur e (Weisglas-Kuperus et al., 1995). Although differences in the number of CD8+ T cells were statistically significan t in both experimental populations, the values were still within normal ranges. This is also an example of the inter- individual and age vari ability that would likely be obser ved in an observational study. When evaluating routine immune system data collect ed during epidemiologica l studies or routine toxicity testing (e.g. immunoglobulin levels , white blood cell [WBC] counts, immuno- phenotyping), the assessor should generally be less concerned w ith whether values from the exposed population fall within typically broad hi storically normal ranges than with whether the changes are statistically different from values obtained in an appropriately matched control population or whether ther e is a shift in the number of individuals who fall outside of the normal range. When interpreting human immune data, considerab ly more credence is given to those studies in which multiple immune tests were conducted and the resulting data provide a biologically Harmonization Project Document No. 10 22plausible interpretation. When a large number of immunophenotypic markers is examined, an abnormal value in one or two immunophenotypes is likely to result simply from a type 1 error. A more reliable indicator of immunotoxicity would be multiple changes consistent with a specific pattern. For example, it is unlikely that a significant decrease in immunoglobulin level would be observed without a concomitant decrease in certain lymphocyte markers, particularly those associated with B cells. A description of biomarkers in epidemiological studies for general immunotoxicity data is pr ovided in \"Report of the Bilthoven symposium: advancement of epidemiological studies in assessing the human hea lth effects of immuno- toxic agents in the environmen t and the workplace\" (Van Love ren et al., 1999) and EHC 180: Principles and methods for asse ssing direct immunotoxicity with exposure to chemicals (IPCS, 1996). addition, epidemiological consid erations are presented sensitization and allerg ic response in EHC 212: Principles and methods for assessing allergic hypersensitization associated with exposure to chemicals (IPCS, 1999b) and for auto- immunity in EHC 236: Principles and methods for assess ing autoimmunity associated with exposure to chemicals (IPCS, 2006a). The risk assessor should refer to the epidemiology sections in EHCs 180, 212 and 236 for immunotoxicity, hyperse nsitization and autoimmunity end-points contained in the data set for the chem ical in question to provide specific context, cautions and information that may assist in the interpretation of immunot oxicity data for risk assessment. Because the data for a given chemical may indicate one or more types of immu-notoxicity, it is expected that the risk assessor may want to re fer to the epidemiology sections of one or more of these three EHC documents and utilize one or more of the following chap- specific areas of immunotoxicity. 3.3.3 Laboratory animal data 3.3.3.1 Introduction A basic understanding of the typical methodologi es used to evaluate immunotoxicity in laboratory animal models is necessary to evalua te the database of studies for hazard charac- terization of a given chemical as the first step in risk assessment. Detailed discussions of end- points and methods utilized in characterizing general immunot oxicity are provided in EHC 180: Principles and methods for assessing direct immunotoxicity with ex posure to chemicals (IPCS, 1996). A similar in-depth discussion of end-points and methods utilized in charac- terizing sensitization and allergic response is provided in EHC 212: Principles and methods for assessing allergic hypersensitization associated with exposure to chemicals (IPCS, 1999b). In addition, a detailed description and ev aluation of end-points and methods utilized in characterizing autoimmunity are provided in EHC 236: Principles and methods for assessing autoimmunity associated with exposure to chemicals (IPCS, 2006a). The data set for most chemicals is unlikely to contain data on all of the describe d end-points. The risk assessor should refer to the assay descripti ons in EHCs 212 hypersensitization and autoimmunity end-points c ontained in the data se t for the chemical in question to provide specific context, cautions and information that may assist in the inter- pretation of immunotoxicity data for risk assessment. The risk assessor may utilize more than immunostimulation data, chapter 6 for sensitiz ation data and chapter 7 for autoimmunity data) on specific areas of imm unotoxicity, because the data for a given chemical may indicate more than one type of immunotoxicity. The follo wing general considerations are provided for ters (i.e. chapter 4 for immunosuppression data, chapter 5 for immunostimulation data, chapter 6 for sensitization data and chapter 7 for autoimmunity data) on risk assessment for one of the following chapters (i.e. chapter 4 for immunosuppression data, chapter 5 for Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 23evaluation of any and all data on immunotoxic ity available for the chemical under assess- ment. 3.3.3.2 Considerations in evaluating immunotoxicity data Many of the standard toxicity testing guidelines published by va rious agencies, including the USEPA, specify 28 days as the minimum multidose exposure period, although 14-day expo- sures are common in studies published before th e middle to late 1990s and as part of some tiered approaches to immunotoxicity testing or screening, as in EH C 180 (IPCS, 1996). For immunotoxicity hazard characterization, the 28- day exposure period would typically be adequate to elicit a response. Furthermore, the USEPA te sting guidelines (USEPA, 1996a,b, 1998) indicate that immunization of animals s hould be done towards the end of the exposure period and timed so that samples are taken th e day after the final exposure. This scheme ensures that all phases of the host response to immunization take place in the presence of the test chemical and its metabolites, maximizing the chance of identifying potential hazards. A significant proportion of immunot oxicity studies published befo re the middle to late 1990s delayed immunization until after exposure en ded, citing concerns th at unpredictable or undetectable direct interactions between toxicant and antigen could potentially decrease the immunogenicity of antigens. That approach has largely been replaced by immunization during exposure, although similar results would likely be obtained by either scheme unless toxicity was minimal and toxican t clearance was extremely rapid. The role of stress and the immune system in chemical-induced immuno toxicity has received considerable discussion. If imm unotoxicity is observed at dose levels that do not induce overt toxicity, the test chemical can be considered immunotoxic, independent of whether it occurs via a direct effect on the immune system or an indirect effect , such as induction of a stress response. Given clear evidence of general toxicity, stress-induced immunotoxicity is usually determined using adrenalectomized animals. Changes in serum corticosteroid levels or characteristic leukograms (i.e. decreases in ly mphocytes and elevated monocyte numbers) are supportive but not sufficient to definitive ly establish a stress-induced response. (a) Sex considerations Qualitative and quantitative sex-dependent differences in baseline levels of immune function are well known in humans and laboratory animal s and in part have been linked to relative levels and response to sex steroids. Although the interaction between the endocrine and immune systems is complex, females typically mount a more robust antibody response than males, whereas cell-mediated responses are more robust in males. Resi stance to infections requiring antibody or cell-mediated immune responses generally follows the same pattern of responses. Whereas there is some indication that females are the more reactive responder population to contact allergens (Rees et al., 1 989), the weight of evidence suggests that females and males react similarly (Felter et al., 2002). Only recently, with the advent of adult immunotoxicity testing guidelines that parallel general toxicity testing, have male and female rodents been evaluated simultaneously. Histori cally, male mice have rarely been used in immunotoxicity testing, as they are generally caged separately to avoid the stress response associated with fighting; male rats are some what less prone to fighting than male mice and have found wide use in routine toxicity testing. Immune functi on in both rodents and humans is also known to be affected by the estrous cycle and pregnancy. Se x-dependent differences in the effects of chemicals on immune function have been described, pa rticularly in develop- mental immunotoxicity studies. For example, female mice expos ed to DES early in life are Harmonization Project Document No. 10 24dramatically immunosuppressed, whereas imm une function in males quickly returns to normal (Kalland, 1980); various sex-related differe nces have also been described in the offspring of lead-exposed rats (Miller et al., 1998; Bunn et al., 2000, 2001a,b). However, there is only limited evidence that these alterati ons in immune function may affect disease in autoimmune disease-prone mice following de velopmental exposure (Stoll & Gavalchin, 2000). Data on the potential immuno toxicity in both sexes woul d reduce uncertainty in the evaluation of immunotoxicity for chemicals with known effects on the endocrine system and should be collected when the te st chemical is suspected to be an endocrine disruptor, particularly those that may interfere with levels of sex steroids or e nd-points mediated by sex steroids. Given the known sex-dependent diffe rences in immune function, consistency in response to immunotoxicants strengthens the we ight of evidence for immunotoxicity, but is not required to demonstrate chemical immunot oxicity. A lack of consistency of chemical- induced immunotoxicity in specific assays be tween sexes does not necessarily represent conflicting data and may repres ent sex-dependent differences. Negative data from one sex do not disprove positive data from a well-conducted study in the other sex. Data from the more sensitive sex (i.e. with the lowest POD) base d on an adverse immune effect demonstrating a dose-response relationship should be used in the risk assessment. (b) Species and strain considerations Although the number of chemicals with clear ev idence of immunotoxicity in humans is limited, there is general consistency between human evidence from clinical and epidemio- logical studies and the experimental animal da ta (Descotes, 2003; see reviews by Vos & Van Loveren, Rodent of subsequent clinical observations after toxicokinetic adjust- ments. For example, a comparison of immunosuppressive effects of cyclosporin A among various species (mouse, rat, guinea-pig, dog, Rhesus monkey and human) demonstrated good quantitative and qualitative ag reement (IPCS, 1996). Exceptions representing species-specific immunotoxicity exist, notably TCDD. Although TCDD is immunotoxic in multiple species (reviewed in Vos & Van Loveren, 1995, 1998), there are pronounced species differences in sensitivity (Luebke et al., 1994, 1995; Smialowi cz et al., 1996). In vitr o data may provide information to inform potential species and strain differences in sensitivi ty to immunotoxicity for a given chemical. For example, me dian inhibitory concentrations (IC 50s) for several cyclosporin A and benzo( assay dependent in several in vitr o assays selected to detect potential immuno- toxicity (cytotoxicity, cytokine release, myelotoxicity and antigen responsiveness) (Carfi et al., 2007). In cases where species or strain di fferences in immunotoxicity are demonstrated, data on toxicokinetics and the MOA(s) will help to select the best animal model for immuno- toxicity in humans. At this point, there are no reliable a priori bases for the prediction of species-specific sensitivity or which species would be most sensitive for a particular immunosuppressive effect from an immunotoxicant. A lack of c onsistency of chemical-i nduced immunotoxicity in specific assays across speci es or strains does not necessarily represent conflicting data and may represent species or strain differences. Negative data from one species or strain do not disprove positive data from a well-conducted study in a separate species or strain. In general, data from the most sensitive species or strain (i.e. with the lowest P OD) based on an adverse immune effect demonstrating a dose-response re lationship should be used in the risk assess- ment. Data from multiple animal species streng then the human risk assessment implications of animal data, and therefore most testi ng guidelines recommend obtaining data from Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 25multiple animal species. For example, immunotoxicity studies that are performed according to the harmonized USEPA Health Effects Test Guidelines for immunotoxicity (OPPTS 870.7800) state that unless absorption, distribu tion, metabolism and elimination (ADME) data are available and similar in rats and mice, both specie s should be used for testing (USEPA, 1998). (c) Exposure duration A majority of cells of the innate and adap tive immune systems have a relatively short lifetime, ranging from hours to a day for neutr ophils and days for lymphocytes, except in the case of memory cells, which can survive for years. As such, the immune system is in a state of constant renewal by precursor cells produc ed by the haematopoietic system (adult bone marrow) or by clonal expansion of lymphocytes following antigenic stimulation. Soluble products of the immune system also have a limit ed lifetime as a result of protein catabolism. For example, the half-lives of circulating antibodies range from 3 to 28 days, depending on the immunoglobulin class. Severe suppression of the haematopoietic system or antibody synthesis should be detectable by simply coun ting circulating myeloi d and lymphoid cells and measuring concentrations of serum immuno globulin classes if chemical exposure spans one or more half-lives of the evaluated pr eformed immune system components. However, suppression of haematopoiesis or antibody synthesis is unlikel y to occur following exposure to chemicals not specifically designed to ta rget the immune system or to block DNA or protein synthesis, suggesting that such nonspeci fic end-points will lack sensitivity and have low predictive value in subchronic studies. (d) Age at initial exposure As the immune system develops and changes during life, this has consequences both for vulnerability to chemical exposure during various life stages as well as for the age at the time of assessment. The effects of chemicals on immunocompetence are most often evaluated in animals that are immunologically mature prior to chemical exposure. The persistence of effects in adult animals has not been systema tically evaluated; howev er, based on data from humans exposed to potent immunosuppressive drugs , the expectation is that immune function returns to normal as immunotoxican ts are cleared. In contrast, exposure during gestation or in the early postnatal period has b een shown to have much longer lasting effects, persisting for weeks, months or even most of the lifespa n of the host (Luebke et al., 2006a; Dietert & Dietert, 2007). Based on experimental animal studies, perturbations of the developing im- mune system may be manifested as a quali tative (i.e. affecting the developing immune system without affecting the adult immune system ) or a quantitative (i.e. affecting the devel- oping immune system at lower doses than in adults) difference. Immune maturation may simply be delayed by toxicant exposure and rec over to normal adult levels over time, or, if exposure interferes with a critic al step in the matu rational process, it may result in lifelong defects in immune function (D ietert & Piepenbrink, 2006b; Luebke et al., 2006a; Dietert & Dietert, 2007). While infectious diseases are also more common in the elderly than in young adults, it is not the immaturity of the immune system but rath er age-related loss of immune responsiveness (i.e. immunosenescence) that is responsible for the increased susceptibility. In the simplest terms, the very young lack immunological experience, and the elderly, in spite of a wealth of experience, are no longer able to respond as well as the younger popul ation. At this time, there are no data to demonstrate that the immune system of the elderly is uniquely susceptible Harmonization Project Document No. 10 26to immunotoxic agents. However, as a resu lt of immunosenescence, a moderate loss of immune function may have more significant ad verse effects in the elderly than in young adults. (e) Route of exposure There is no single standard exposure method fo r immunotoxicology studies, and the \"best\" method of exposure should match the most lik ely route of human exposure for a given chemical (IPCS, 1996; USEPA, 1998). For example, the relevant exposure of humans to JP-8 jet fuel occurs primarily through inhalation and dermal contact, and bo th routes of exposure (dermal: Ullrich, 1999; Ullrich & Lyons, 2000; i nhalation: Harris et al ., 1997) have been associated with reduced thymus weight and suppression of T cell prolifera tion in mice. It is generally accepted that the ci rculating concentration of immunotoxicant or immunotoxic metabolite(s) determines the level of immunot oxicity, and equal concentrations of immuno- toxicant in the blood following different routes of exposure should result in similar levels of immunotoxicity. The potential for exposure route- associated differences in metabolism of the toxicant and resulting differential exposure of immune cells and immune tissues should be considered if data are available. Toxicokineti c determinations, perfor med in conjunction with immunotoxicity investigations, ar e extremely valuable. In the ab sence of toxicokinetic data, increased detoxification or cleara nce associated with dermal or oral exposure is presumed due to reduced absorption. The possibility of local rather than systemic immune reactions is an additional consideration for immunotoxicity differences associated with route of exposure. For example, chemical immunotoxicity may suppress immune function at the site of exposure, such as inhalation- dependent suppression of the resident macropha ge populations of the lung, without affecting immune function of macrophages elsewhere in the body. This may be due to either higher concentrations at the site of exposure or ra pid clearance and detoxi fication as the toxicant enters the circulation. The dist inction between local and system ic immunity is covered in greater detail in the following section. 3.3.4 Local versus systemic effects The concept of distinct local t oxicity related to the route of exposure is not unique to immu- notoxicology and may result from direct expos ure or increased local concentrations of toxicant at the exposure site. The contrast between local and systemic toxicity within general toxicology is illustrated by exam ples such as local route-depe ndent histopathological changes associated with lowest inhalation concentr ation of furfural of 6 mg/kg body weight per day, well below any observed toxicity associated with oral exposure, in a study that examined route-dependent toxicity of furfural in Fische r 344 rats (Arts et al., 2004a). Route-associated local exposure effects may explain some aspects of local toxicity; in the case of inhalational toxicity of furfural in rats, the observed eff ects may be exacerbated by the increased local exposure resulting from the partic ular morphology of the rat nasal cavity (see Kimbell et al., 1997, for discussion of rat nasal exposure). Howe ver, unlike most toxicological end-points, for immunotoxicology, the route of exposure is not simply a local increased concentration or uptake issue. There are local, partially independe nt portions of the immune system associated with each of the major routes of exposure: i nhalation, dermal and oral . Therefore, route of exposure is potentially more important for im munotoxicity end-points and the appropriate assay to use in testing for immunotoxicity, as local immunotoxicological effects may occur independent of systemic immunity. Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 273.3.5 (Ir)reversibility of effects Human studies indicate that im mune function returns to norma l following exposure to potent immunosuppressive drugs, and the expectation is that immune function will return to normal as xenobiotics are cleared. Simila rly, drug-induced autoimmunity is often ameliorated when sistence of effects in adult animals has not been systematically evaluated, and more long- lasting effects are expected to occur if exposure affects precursor or stem cells. This is not the case for exposure during gestation or in the early postnatal period, where immunotoxicity & Dietert, 2007). The likelihood of persistence of immunotoxicity is a combined effect of dose, duration, result in higher effective dose in certain tissues and a potentially longer relative dose after the exposure, timing of exposure is an important consideration, particularly for early develop- mental exposure, where the ability to produce pe rsistent immunotoxicity may be categorically different from that associated with adult exposure. The MOA for immunotoxicity and the half-life of cells or mediators involved in the key events of imm unotoxicity by particular chemicals directly affect the likelihood of persistence of immunotoxicity. Thus, the prob- ability of persistence is incr eased for immunotoxicity that involves stem cells in the bone marrow and decreased when the MOA is restrict ed to short-lived cells, such as peripheral neutrophils. 3.3.6 Biological plausibility The data for a given chemical may indicate one or more types of immunotoxicity, and therefore the risk assessor may utilize more than one of the following chapters (i.e. chapter 4 tion data and chapter 7 for autoimmunity data) on risk assessment for specific areas of immunotoxicity. The following general considerati ons for a weight of evidence evaluation of the health-related imm unotoxicity database should be perfo rmed for all data sets. Further consideration of specific areas of immunotoxicity and the use of risk assessment guidance provided in chapters 4-7 will depend on the data set for a given chemical. Each of these chapters presents a specific weight of eviden ce evaluation for the pa rticular type of immuno- toxicity discussed within the chapter. A general outline of possible entry points for chapters 4-7 based on the particular immuno toxicity data for a chemical of interest is described in provide the appropriate guida nce for a given data set. 3.3.6.1 Characterization of the health-related database Each chemical is evaluated to judge whether th e available data are su fficient to characterize the potential immunotoxicity hazard\u2014that is , if the data collectively provide enough evidence to judge whether or not a human i mmunotoxicity hazard could exist. The approach presented below is based on three categories: 1) sufficient evidence for immunotoxicity, 2) sufficient evidence for lack of immunotoxicity and 3) insufficient evidence regarding the therapeutic that induces self-reactivity is discontinued (see chapter 7). However, per- most of the lifespan of the hos t (Dietert & Piepenbrink, 2006b; Luebke et al., 2006a; Dietert may have much longer lasting eff ects than in the adult, persistin g for weeks, months or even for immunosuppression data, chap ter 5 for immunostimulation da ta, chapter 6 for sensitiza-timing and MOA (see additional discussion in section 4.7 of chapter 4, section 5.7 of chapter 5 and section 7.6 of chapter 7). For chemicals that bioaccumulate, in creased duration will chemical exposure is removed. As discussed pr eviously in section 3.3.3.2( d) on age at initial section 3.4 to assist the risk assessor in the de termination of which chapter or chapters will Harmonization Project Document No. 10 28immunotoxicity. Data from all studies relevant to immunotoxicity are examined, whether or not immunotoxicity is detected. Data from humans have prefer ence over animal data, provided that the data are of sufficient quality and cover adequate exposure scenarios and end-points. Currently, in vitr o data alone are inadequate evidence for immunotoxicity; however, in vitro data can help to establis h an MOA when accompanied by in vivo data. The evaluation should describe the database in term s of its strengths, weaknesses, uncertainties and data gaps. An assessment of data quality contributes to th e overall evaluation and characterization of the health-related database for immunotoxicity. Th e strengths and limitations of each individual study and of the broader array of available chemical-specific data should be considered in the weight of evidence assessment. Such factors as conformance with stan dard of study conduct (including principles of good laboratory practice) , adequacy of study design (e.g. the use of a sufficient number of test subjec ts, the use of appropriate test methods) and the application of relevant and appropriate analytic al techniques all contribute to a scientific judgement regard- ing data (and/or study) quality. The weight of evidence considerations are applie d to characterization of the data within the same or similar assays as well as across diverg ent measures of the immune system and across multiple species. 1 Host resistance assays in experimental animals, without immune test data, are sufficient for the determination of rele vant immunotoxicity hazard for humans; however, negative data from host resistance assays do not necessarily precl ude immunotoxicity. Con- flicting data should be evaluated by the strengt hs and weaknesses (e.g. sample size, exposure duration) of the individual studies, as well as in the context of the remainder of the immuno- toxicity database for a given chemical. The analysis evaluates the observed change in host resistance within the entire da tabase, including the degree of s uppression; number and type of end-points examined; relevance of dose, route a nd duration of exposure; and relevance of the challenge used. Although structur e-activity relationships (SARs) are currently not well estab- lished for immunotoxicity, information on SARs, M OA, toxicokinetic data and other factors may affect the characteri zation of the database. As mentioned above, the weight of evidence ev aluation of the health-related database gener- ally results in one of three conclusions: 1) Sufficient evidence for immunotoxicity indicates that, collectively, the data provide enough information to judge that a human immunotoxicity hazard exists. Data that support such a conclusion incl ude, but are not limited to, the illustrative examples listed below: 9 Epidemiological studies (e.g. case-control or cohort studies ) that demonstrate that exposure is associated with immunotoxici ty. Case-studies ma y support the weight of evidence but are generally insufficient alone to comprise sufficient evidence. 1 The predictivity of individual assays for a determination of general immunotoxicity (Luster et al., 1992) and host resistance (Luster et al., 1993) was systematically evaluated for over 50 chemicals in the NTP database. Some assays, such as leukocyte or WBC counts, had a concordance or predictive value of less than 50% for immunotoxicity, whereas others (e.g. measures of the antibody response with the PFC assay) had a concordance of up to 78%. The predictive power for general immunotoxicity or reduced host resistance was increased when two assays demonstrated immunosuppression, with certain combinations, such as the PFC and NK cell assays, resulting in over 90% concordance. Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 299 Evidence of immunotoxicity is demonstrated by the results of a study or studies in humans (e.g. the human repeated insult patch test [HRIPT] for induction of contact sensitization or adequately contro lled studies that demonstrate reduced resistance to common infections) or in one or more laboratory animal species that indicate a dose- and treatment-related e ffect on disease resistance assays and/or other parameters predictive for imm unotoxicity (e.g. a local lymph node assay [LLNA] result indicating a contact sensiti zer or a decrease in a functional measure of immunity, such as antigen-specific antibody production) that is not secondary to overt systemic toxicity. 9 Evidence of immunotoxicity is demonstrat ed by data from multiple end-points with limited predictive ev idence of immunotoxicity along with supporting evi- dence that suggests biological plausibilit y. The evidence of deficits in immune parameters may be supported by other data from in vivo laborato ry animal studies (e.g. 14- or 90-day studies) that show gr oss and histopathological effects in the primary or secondary immune tissues of a nature and extent indicating a high likelihood of an adverse effect on imm une function (e.g. lymphoid organ atrophy, reduced bone marrow function, significant ch anges in haematological end-points). A relationship of the chemical with ot her known immune system toxicants or SAR would also add to the supporting evidence. 2) Sufficient evidence for lack of immunotoxicity would be based on a database that demonstrated i) a lack of immunotoxicity for a range of end-points covering different aspects of the immune system in several species (preferably including humans) and ii) no other toxic effects that are expected to be predictive of immunotoxicity. 3) Insufficient evidence regarding immunotoxicity would include databa ses that i) are inadequate, ii) have conflicting outcomes that cannot be attributed to differences in study design (e.g. different species, strains or exposure durations), iii) present equivo- cal evidence interpreted as s howing marginal deficits in immune parameters that may be chemically related (e.g. stat istically significant changes in one or more parameters at middle or low doses in the absence of other supportive data) or iv) are limited by the insufficient number or types of studies that address immunotoxicity (e.g. many general toxicity studies only evaluate thymus weight and provide data that, in the absence of additional evidence, are insuffi cient to judge immunosuppression hazard). Data that could support such a conclusion include, but ar e not limited to, the illus- trative examples listed below: 9 In vitro data alone are generally considered insufficient in the absence of in vivo functional data. 9 Statistically significan t changes in the histology of the immune tissues or leuko- cyte counts without any clear effects on a ssociated functional parameters (e.g. no changes in antibody production or no data on any functional immune measure) or deficits in one or more less sensitive end-points (e.g. lymphoproliferative responses) with no associated histologica l changes in the spleen, thymus, bone marrow or lymph nodes are generally e quivocal evidence of immunosuppression. As a default, any effect should be taken into consideration in the risk assessment, unless general knowledge or additiona l data indicate otherwise. When the determination is made that the database for a given chemical provides sufficient evidence for immunotoxicity or lack of immunot oxicity, the risk asse ssor is directed to Harmonization Project Document No. 10 30that the assessment will continue through the hazard characterization (or dose-response assessment), exposure assessment and risk characterization steps. Alternatively, when the determination is made th at the database for a given chemical does not provide adequate evidence of immunotoxicity or lack of immunotoxicity, a separate analysis can be performed to evaluate the need for additional data to determine the potential 3.3.6.2 Weight of evidence evaluation of the health-related database The NTP of the United States Department of Health and Human Services outlined five categories ranking the weight or strength of evidence of immune system toxicity from stronger evidence to uncertain findings (Germo lec, 2009). The NTP's explanation of this system for summarizing the strength of ev idence for immunotoxicity can be used for evaluating individual studies as well as bodies of evidence. Although the NTP's level of evidence explanation is focused on immunosuppr ession, the principles can be used to evaluate immunotoxicity in general. The NTP describes the results of individual studies of chemical ag ents and other test articles and notes the strength of the evidence for c onclusions regarding each study. Generally, each study is confined to a single laboratory animal species, although in some instances, multiple species may be investigated under the purview of a single st udy report. Negative results, in which the study animals do not ex hibit evidence of immunotoxicity, do not necessarily imply that a test article is not an im mune system toxicant, but only th at the test article is not an immune system toxicant under those specific cond itions. Positive results demonstrating that a test article causes immunotoxic ity in laboratory animals under the conditions of the study are assumed to be relevant to humans, unless data are available that demonstrate otherwise. In addition, such positive effects shou ld be assumed to be primary effects, unless there is clear evidence that they are secondary consequen ces of overt toxicity to non-immune organ systems. It is critical to recognize that the \"levels of evidence\" statements described herein describe only immunological hazard . The actual determination of risk to humans requires exposure data that are not considered in these summary st atements. This fact is particularly important to keep in mind when communicating study results to the general public. Five categories of evidence of i mmune system toxicity are used to summarize the strength of the evidence observed in each experimen t: two categories for positive results ( clear evidence and some evidence ); one category for uncertain findings ( equivocal evidence ); one category for no observable effects ( no evidence ); and one category for e xperiments that cannot be evaluated because of major de sign or performance flaws ( inadequate study ). Application of these criteria requires professi onal judgement by individuals w ith ample experience with and understanding of the an imal models and study designs em ployed. For each study, conclusion statements are made using one of the five cat egories to describe the findings; if warranted, these conclusion statements should be made separately for males and females. These categories refer to the strength of the evidence of the experimental results and not to potency or mechanism. hazard identification step in the risk assessment. As described in section 3.1, it is expected immunotoxicity hazard. A detailed approach for this analysis is pres ented in section 3.3.6.3. perform a weight of evidence evaluation, as outlined in section 3.3.6.2, and complete the Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 31The levels of evidence for evaluating imm une system toxicity are as follows: 1) Clear evidence of toxicity to the immune system Is demonstrated by data that indicate a dose-related1 effect (considering the magnitude of the effect and the dose- response) on more than one functional parameter and/or a disease resistance assay that is not a secondary effect of overt systemic toxicity, or Is demonstrated by data that indicate dose-related effects on one functional assay and additional end-points that i ndicate biological plausibility. 2) Some evidence of toxicity to the immune system Is demonstrated by data that indicate a dose-related effect on one functional parameter with no other supporting data, or Is demonstrated by data that indicate dose-related effects on multiple observa- tional parameters without robust effect s on a functional immune parameter or a disease resistance assay, or Is demonstrated by data that indicate e ffects on functional para meters or a disease resistance assay that are not dose rela ted with other data providing biological plausibility. 3) Equivocal evidence of toxici ty to the immune system Is demonstrated by data that indicate e ffects on functional para meters or a disease resistance assay that are not dose relate d without other data providing biological plausibility, or Is demonstrated by data that indicate dose-related effects on a single observational parameter without effects on a functional immune parameter or a disease resistance assay, or Is demonstrated by data that indicate eff ects on the immune system at dose(s) that produce evidence of overt systemic toxicity, or Is demonstrated by data that ar e conflicting in repeat studies. 4) No evidence of toxicity to the immune system Is demonstrated by data from studies w ith appropriate experimental design and conduct that are interprete d as showing no evidence of biologically relevant effects on the immune system that are related to the test article. 5) Inadequate study of imm une system toxicity Is demonstrated by a study that, because of major design or performance flaws, cannot be used to determine the occu rrence of immune system toxicity. When a conclusion statement for a particular stu dy is selected, consideration must be given to key factors that would support th e selection of an individual category of evidence. Such consideration should allow for incorporation of scientific experience and current under- standing of immunotoxicity studi es in laboratory animals, part icularly with respect to the interrelationships between end-points, impact of the effect on immune function, relative 1 The term \"dose-related\" describes any dose-response re lationship, recognizing that the test article-related responses for some end-points may be non-monotonic due to saturation of exposure or effect, overlapping dose- response behaviours, changes in immunological manifesta tions at different dose levels or other phenomena. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 32sensitivity of end-points and specificity of the ef fect. Factors to consider in selecting the level of evidence of immune system toxicity are given below: Immunotoxicity is defined in the context th at immune responses can be enhanced or suppressed by toxicants. As such, dose-rela ted effects consistent with immuno- suppression and immunostimulation will be considered in hazard identification. Functional effects, as defined as an alteration in the ability of the immune system to respond to a challenge or stimulus, should usually be weighed more heavily than observational parameters, such as alterations in cell counts. Increases in severity and/or prevalence (mor e individuals with the effect) as a function of dose generally strengthen the level of evidence, keeping in mind that the specific manifestation may be different with incr easing dose. For example, histological changes at a lower dose level may reflect de ficits in immune f unction at higher dose levels. Biological plausibility for immunotoxicity mu st be considered in the context of the nature of the response, the magnitude of th e response and the pattern of the response, as well as the current unde rstanding of immune system structure and function. Insights from supportive studies (e.g. toxi cokinetics, ADME, computational models, structure-activity relations hips) and immunological findings from other in vivo animal studies (NTP or otherwise) s hould be drawn upon when interpreting the biological plausibility of a change. The characterization of immunotoxicity must consider the impact of overt toxicity (e.g. effects on the immune system are not the direct effects of te st article treatment, but are indirect effects mediated via stre ss and/or other dose-re lated responses). The characterization of immunotoxicity must consider the intended pharmacology of the test article. Immunotoxi city is reserved for unint ended immunosuppression or immunostimulation. Results in one species or one sex are c onsidered sufficient for evidence of immuno- toxicity. 3.3.6.3 \"Triggers\" and the need for additional data to determine immunotoxicity hazard Triggers for immunotoxicity tes ting may stem from available data on the chemical, such as epidemiological information or data from in v itro screening or mechanistic studies. Immune system-related data obtained in routine toxicity testing (e .g. immune system organ weights) are not definitive indicators of immunotoxicity but may be the only data available for a specific agent. Significant effects in the absenc e of overt toxicity s uggest that functional testing would provide reliable data for risk a ssessment. A key issue in determining the need for special immunotoxicology studie s is the identifica tion of appropriate \"triggers\" or causes for concern. Several reviews ha ve previously described poten tial triggers based on some evidence of immunotoxicity (Holsapple et al., 2005; Ladics et al., 2005) excluding extended histopathology (Germolec et al., 2004a,b) , the ability of data that trigger specific immunotoxicity testing to accura tely predict immunotoxicity ha s not been established. These Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 33data may still provide sufficient evidence to support evaluation of imm une function. Factors to consider include: SARs and MOA alerts : There are no public databases that can be used for computa- tional determination of immunotoxic potenti al. Historical immunotoxicity data sup- port the notion that chemicals with a simila r structure or the ability to bind certain receptors may modulate immune function. Al though structural classes are relatively broad, heavy metals (e.g. lead, cadmium), halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (TCDD and dioxin-like PCBs), polycycli c aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. benzo( a)pyrene and related bay region-containing compounds that are metabolized to diol epoxides) and various mycotoxins all cause adverse eff ects on immune function. MOA relationships are also somewhat general and include alte ration of cellular prol iferation or redox state and binding to intracellular or memb rane receptors associated with pe roxisome proliferators, opiates, antagonists for ndrogenic and estr ogenic compounds) and muscarenic agents. Routine toxicology studies : A prime routine toxicol ogy study is the 28-day oral toxicity study in rodents. This study invol ves screening a range of end-points across multiple organ systems, following exposure via the route that is expected to be most relevant to humans. Indicator s of potential immunotoxicity include certain changes in haematological profiles, lymphoid organ we ights and lymphoid organ histopathology. For example, whereas alterations in W BC numbers or differe ntial WBC counts are not particularly sensitive indicators of immunotoxicity, neutr openia is a common finding in patients receiving immunotoxic drugs. Even small changes in WBC counts or phenotypes are associated with mortalit y risk in older individuals (Izaks et al., 2003) and development of cold sores in the general population (Parks et al., 2007). There are some cellular alterations that are nonspecific indicators of an effect on the immune response (e.g. increased number s of macrophages in lung tissue or an increased incidence of inflammatory derm al lesions). Changes in lymphoid organ weights, including the thymus, spleen or bone marrow, may also indicate immuno- toxicity. Thymus atrophy is a more sensi tive indicator than weight changes in the lymph nodes or spleen, as the thymus is a primary lymphoid organ and the latter represent secondary lymphoi d organs. Microscopic find ings or histopathology of spleen, thymus and lymph nodes, when conducted under more defined conditions such as those proposed by Elmore (2006a,b,c,d,e), can also be a sens itive indicator of immunotoxicity. Clinical and observational data : Transmission of infectious disease is unlikely to occur in properly run specific pathogen-fr ee animal facilities. However, a dose- related increase in spontaneous infectious di sease in test animals is strong evidence of compromised host resistance and should tri gger studies to determine the underlying cause of the increased infection incidence. Range of values and statistical analysis : When evaluating routine immune system data collected during epidemiological studie s or routine toxicity testing (e.g. immuno- globulin, WBC counts, immunophenotyping), the assessor should put l ittle weight on whether values within the exposed population fall within typically broad historically normal ranges and more on whether the changes are statistically different from values obtained in an appropriately matched cont rol population. It should be cautioned, Harmonization Project Document No. 10 34however, that as immunotoxicity testing in humans normally includes performing multiple, often functionally overlapping tests, the most convincing evidence of altered immune function is alteration in several para meters that share a biologically plausible profile of change, rather than a statis tically significant difference in a single parameter. Appropriate data analysis met hods must be used when numerous markers are examined (e.g. a large suite of lym phocyte surface markers) to avoid type 1 statistical error. 3.3.7 Dose-response relationships and thresholds The determination and evaluation of the dose-re sponse relationship are important steps in the qualitative immunotoxicity hazar d characterization. A dose-res ponse relationship is a neces- sary criterion in demonstrating chemical imm unotoxicity. In addition to identifying the shape of the dose-response curve and the effective dose range for immunotoxicity, factors such as exposure (route, timing and duration), toxicokine tics and other issues that might affect comparisons with human exposure scenarios are identified and discussed as part of the dose- response evaluation. The re sults from dose-response analyses can be used in various ways, depending on the goals of the ri sk assessment and the nature of the effect modelled: estab- lishment of a health-based guidance value (RfD /RfC or ADI/TDI), estimation of the margin of exposure or quantitative estimation of the ma gnitude of the risk at the level of human exposure (see IPCS, 1999a, 2009, for detailed di scussion). The interpretation of dose- response data should identify doses associated with the adverse effect (immunotoxicity), as well as doses associated with no adverse effe cts, to determine the most appropriate end- point(s) or critical effect(s). For sensitization and subsequent e licitation, there are likely to be different thresholds and dose-response relation ships, and the elicitat ion dose is generally the development of health-based guidance values, the critical effect or effects are used for the development of POD(s) from which an RfD/RfC or ADI/TDI can be calculated. The identifi- cation of a critical effect base d upon immunotoxicity data is li kely to involve considerable judgement and should therefore be facilitat ed by the inclusion of appropriate immuno- toxicology experts in the ri sk assessment process. 3.3.7.1 Shape of the dose-response curve As is the case for most non-cancer end-point s, the dose-response functions for chemical- induced immunotoxicity are generally assumed to be non-linear 1 and to demonstrate a threshold dose below which effects on immun ity would not be expect ed. Additionally, based upon our current understanding of immune proce sses in humans and available human study data (reviewed in Luster et al., 2005a), one wo uld most likely assume that a linear relation- ship exists between the loss of immune function and increased disease. The immuno- toxicology literature contains examples of non-linear and biphasic dose-response curves across the spectrum of immunological measures, such as lymphocyte pr oliferation, antibody production, phagocytosis, DTH and host resistance assays. The assumption of a threshold dose as the POD for risk assessment would be supported by the available data for these types of immunotoxicity-related end-points. 1 The term \"non-linear\" is used here in a more narrow sense than its usual meaning in the field of mathematical modelling. In this guidance document, the term non-linear refers to threshold models (which show no response over a range of low doses that include zero) and some non-threshold models (e.g. a quadratic model, which shows some response at all doses above zero). In th is guidance document, a non-linear model is one whose slope is zero at (and perhaps above) a dose of zero. lower than the dose required to induce sensitization (see chapter 6 for further discussion). For Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 35In addition to linear and c (threshold) dose-response rela tionships, invert ed U-shaped have been fo llowing exposure to immunotoxic compounds (reviewed by Calabrese, 2005). The exis tence and validity of non-linear effects in immunotoxicology been recognized et al., 2005; Ladics & Loveless, 2005). Immune function and regulation involve the integration of the endocrine, immune and nervous systems; chemical exposure may produce a complex series of effects that result in stimulation of some measure or at some concentrations, while producing suppression of other measures or at other concentrations (Hastings, 2005). One example of this type of effect is the low-dose stimulation (3- to 6-fold) and high-dose suppression (0- to 3-fold) of the proliferativ e response of peripheral blood lymphocytes to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) observed in rats exposed to methylmercury (0.35 \u00b5g/kg body weight per day and 35 \u00b5g/kg body weight per da y, respectively) in dri nking-water (Ortega et al., 1997). Holladay et al. (2005) suggested that non-linear responses within the immune system may represent different MOAs for diffe rent portions of the curve; that is, the stimulation portion of the curve may represent a different mechanism or a response from different subsets of immune cel ls compared with the suppression portion of the curve. In contrast, the increase in prolif eration routinely observed at the low end of the dose-response curve in mitogen proliferation assays may si mply reflect the activation of DNA repair mechanisms that would ensue following cellula r damage. When evidence indicates that the observed response can be attributed to distinct effects of different dose-based or exposure duration-based MOAs, the NOAELs/LOAELs for each effect should be considered separ- ately. Although interpretation of these types of responses may be complicated, it should not be assumed that because immunotoxicity is cons idered adverse, stimul ation of the immune system should be considered positive or bene ficial. Stimulation of the immune system can lead to hypersensitivity and asthma or autoimmune reactions with severe adverse conse-quences (interpretation of imm unotoxicity associated with stim ulation of the immune system autoimmunity). 3.3.7.2 Mode of action and dose metric Information about the MOA for the identifie d immunotoxicity e nd-points (including characterization of the key events) and related to xicokinetic data may ai d the risk assessor in evaluating proposed dose-response models. In particular, know ledge of the expected dose- response relationship (e.g. threshold, linear or inverted-U shaped) for the end-points of concern can support the selection of a specific model (in case s where available data support quantitative modelling). MOA information can al so increase confidence in the methods used to extrapolate immunotoxicity risk from experimental animal data to humans. The choice of an appropriate dose metric will more accurately reflect the relationship between exposure and response. The underlying assumption of the dose-response analysis is that the appropriate dose me tric will reflect the same response at equivalent doses, independent of species and route of exposur e, provided that there are no toxicodynamic (pharmacodynamic) differences (Andersen & De nnison, 2001; Clewell et al., 2002). The selection of the dose metric may include consid eration of the active form of a chemical, the tissue or system affected, pe rsistence of the chemical in the body and available MOA information indicating whether th e specific effect of concern is more dependent on average, peak or frequency of exposure. Many metric s have been proposed, including the maximum tissue concentration and area under the concen tration versus time curve (AUC). Use of metrics other than dose in milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day may suggest is discussed in chapter 5 for immunostimulati on, chapter 6 for sensiti zation and chapter 7 for Harmonization Project Document No. 10 36consideration of alternative appr oaches or values to address interspecies extrapolation or intraspecies below). For exampl e, the AUC for corticos terone has been used successfully as the dose metric for immunot oxicity of some end-points (e.g. antibody response to KLH) in several chemicals that i nduce a stress response; however, suppression of some measures (e.g. NK cell function) were great er than predicted on the basis of cortico- sterone, indicating other mechanisms of immuno toxicity and that AUC would not be appro- priate in these cases (Pruett et al., 2003). 3.3.7.3 Dose-response analytical approaches In the establishment of a health-based guidanc e value, margin of exposure or quantitative estimate of the magnitude of risk at the le vel of human exposure, dose-response assessment allows estimation of PODs from which an RfD/RfC or ADI/TDI can be derived (USEPA, 1994, 1995a, 1999a, 2009). The BMD or benchmark concentration (BMC) approach is often the preferre d method for determination of POD(s) near the low end of the available data; for example, the BMD approach is preferred by the USEPA (1995a, 2000a,b). If the relevant data are not amenable to quantitative modelling, the NOAEL/LOAEL method may be used. The BMD methodology that is us ed for estimating both the BMD and the BMC is presented in detail elsewhere (USEPA, 1995a, 2000b; IPCS, 2009), and application of these procedures to immunotoxicity data is done with standard techniques. In general, PODs are developed from the most sensitive adverse immune end-point(s) from the most appropriate species (or the most sensitive mamm alian species in the absence of information to determine the most appropriate species). The majority of im munotoxicity data are continuous; therefore, when applying BMD methodologies to data on immunotoxicity, \"relative risks\" are usually estimated. In cont rast, histopathological data are likely to be dichotomous, and BMD methodologies estimate \"ex tra risk\" for this type of data. While directed immunotoxicity studies may not be av ailable for many chemicals, histopathological examination of immune tissues is often performe d as part of standard toxicological studies. Therefore, histopathology ma y be the only available imm une-related data for some chemicals. Extended histopathologic al analyses of a semiquantita tive nature have been shown to be good predictors of immunotoxicity. Studies that examined the sensitivity of extended histopathology suggest that lesions in the thymic cortex were the most consistent (Germolec et al., 2004b), and these lesions correlated wi th thymus to body weight ratios and, to a slightly lesser extent, antigen-specific antibody responses (Germolec et al., 2004a). Current practices for health-based guidance valu e derivation and the app lication of dosimetric adjustments and uncertainty factors are de tailed elsewhere (IPCS, 1999a, 2009; USEPA, 2002). The dose-response analysis should desc ribe how the RfD/RfC or the ADI/TDI was data as the critical effect), the immunotoxic ity-based POD for the adverse treatment-related response is divided by the total uncertainty factor (a multiple of either default uncertainty factors or chemical-specific adjustment fact ors [CSAFs]) to derive the RfD/RfC or the ADI/TDI. In each case, immunotoxicity data s hould be discussed in the context of other toxicity data. uncertainty factors used, as well as the conf idence in the estimates. Discussion of the calculated and should include a discussion of the assumptions , dosimetric adjustments and application of uncertainty f actors specific to immunotoxicity is provided below in section 3.3.7.4 Dose-response risk assessment output: health-based guidance values 3.3.10. To health-based guidance values for immunotoxicity (i.e . use immunotoxicity Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 37Health-based guidance values are frequently derived for chronic exposure or intake over a lifetime that is considered to be without apprec iable health risk. However, some organizations (e.g. WHO and some USEPA programme offices ) have established practices for the application of less-than-lifetime risk calculations. The USEPA publication A review of the reference dose and reference concentration (USEPA, 2002) discusses th e use of toxicity data in deriving reference values in risk assessmen ts for exposures of various durations, including chronic, intermediate term and acute. WHO has published guidance for setting acute reference doses (ARfDs) that is specific for consideration of the acute effects of pesticides (Solecki et al., 2005). Immunotoxicity data that identify adverse outcomes following defined toxicant exposures are considered ap propriate for these applications. 3.3.8 Groups at risk (developing immune system, elderly, immunocompromised) Age-related physiological differences and immatu rity of the immune system are both likely to play a role in increased susceptibility to chem ical modulation. It has been demonstrated that for some chemicals, the immature immune system is more susceptible to chemicals than the fully mature system. Sequelae of developm ental immunotoxicant exposure may be more persistent than effects observed following a dult exposure, which gene rally occur at higher doses and are expected to re solve soon after exposure ends (Holladay & Smialowicz, 2000; Dietert & Dietert, 2007). Based on results obtain ed in various experimental animal studies, perturbations of the developi ng immune system may be mani fested as a qualitative (i.e. affecting only the developing immune system) or a quantitative (i.e. lo wer doses affect the developing immune system) difference. Following developmental exposure, immune matura- tion may simply be delayed and recover to no rmal adult levels over time, or, if exposure interferes with a critical step in the maturational process, lif elong defects in immune function may follow (e.g. DES: Kalland & Forsberg, 1980; Kalland, 1984). The steps involved in human and rodent immune system maturation a ppear to be remarkably similar, but at different developmental stages, and no compelli ng evidence exists to suggest that effects observed in rodents are not repr esentative of what might be expected to occur in humans. Thus, effects of rodent exposur e shortly after birth are likely to reflect what may happen in humans exposed during late gestation, assuming that the chemical crosses the placenta. This concept was reviewed in detail by Hollada y & Smialowicz (2000) and Holsapple (2003). The elderly are also acknowledged as a pote ntially sensitive population, and age-related changes in immune function are described in EHC 144 (IPCS, 1993). The age-related decline in immune function and homeostasis at the molecu lar, cellular and organism levels is referred to as immunosenescence, a condition characterized by reduced immunocompetence (effector and regulatory function), increas ed rates of infecti on, autoimmune disease, inflammation and neoplasia (for reviews, see Hausman & We ksler, 1985; Miller, 1996; DeWitt & Luebke, 2009). Decreased immune system function associat ed with the advancement of age has been described for multiple aspects of the immune sy stem (e.g. response to vaccination: Targonski et al., 2007; asthma: Vignola et al., 2003). Add itionally, there may be a correlation between deterioration of normal immune function a nd higher incidences of some cancers (Cohen, 1994) and/or autoimmune dis eases that are observed in the elderly (Goronzy & Weyand, 2003). Enhanced susceptibility may also be a functi on of genetic disposition (i.e. genetic poly- morphisms at the individual or population leve l), disease state (e.g. AIDS) or pharmaceutical intervention (e.g. organ transp lant therapy). Sex differences in response to immunotoxic agents are not uncommon, either in laboratory an imal studies or in epidemiological studies. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 383.3.9 Acute versus chronic exposure Developmental exposure to an immunotoxicant may result in qua ntitatively and qualitatively different immunotoxicity compared with expos ure at other life stag es (see discussion in risk) and may result in long-lasting or permanen t immunotoxicity after an acute or short-term exposure. Although there are no testing guideline s in widespread use that are designed to evaluate acute or developmental immunotoxicity at this time, the use of less-than-lifetime risk estimates may be appropriate for chemi cals with a sufficient database demonstrating developmental immunotoxicity. 3.3.10 Uncertainty factors As is the case for other areas of toxicological risk assessment, the use of uncertainty factors in immunotoxicity risk assessment and considera tions in establishing ov erall factors based on risk assessment. Detailed discussion of the app lication of uncertainty factors in human health risk assessment can be found elsewher e (IPCS, 1994, 1999a; USEPA, 2002; FAO/WHO, 2009), and the following discussion is focuse d on the use of uncertainty factors in the development of immunotoxicity risk assessments. Although gene rally applied values for the factors are discussed, it is emphasized that th e numerical values for each factor (generally ranging from 0.1 to 10) need to be establ ished on a case-by-case basis depending on the science, scope and regulatory framework. Par ticular caution is needed for preventing over- conservatism in combining variou s subfactors into one overall factor. Risk assessment for database) as well as uncertainty factors addressing subchronic to chronic extrapolation and LOAEL to NOAEL extrapolation, as determined by the scope of the risk assessment and the data used for the POD. Considerations in the application of intraspeci es (or interindividual), interspecies and database uncer tainty factors for immunotoxicity data are described below. Uncertainty factors app lied to hypersensitiv ity generally include intr aspecies, interspecies, It should be noted that, in some cases, specific knowledge is available on the basis of which a certain correction could be made in the ri sk assessment\u2014for instance, where there is information that dermal absorption for humans is higher or lower than for the animal species on which the toxicological data are based. In su ch a case, a data-derived adjustment factor may be applied in the risk assessment. 3.3.10.1 Intraspecies uncertainty factor In the absence of information on the potential variab ility in susceptibil ity among the general population to the particular type of immunotoxicity considered for a POD, a default intra- species uncertainty factor of 10 is recommende d, similar to that used for other non-cancer end-points. This uncertainty factor is used to address the vari ability in responses from one human to the next and protect sensitive subpopul ations. The intraspecies uncertainty factor can be subdivided into toxicokinetic (e.g. 100.5 or 3.2 in IPCS [1994, in 3.2 or 100.5 or in that can be repl aced by CSAFs when hu man toxicokinetic and immunosuppression (chapter 4), unintended stimulation (cha pter 5) and autoimmunity various subfactors depend on the regulatory framework and/or the sc ope and purpose of the (chapter 7) should use all of the standard un certainty factors (intraspecies, interspecies, matrix, and use and time factors and may include database uncertainty factors (see chapter 6). chapter 2, in section 3.3.3.2(d) on age at initial exposure a nd in section 3.3.8 on groups at toxicodynamic data exist for a given compoun d. As discussed in section 3.3.8, age-related Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 39physiological differences and immaturity of th e developing immune system are likely to affect susceptibility to immunotoxicity. As a result, the young (in utero and postnatal expo- sure or children) and the elderly may be at greater risk for imm unotoxicity. Genetic poly- morphisms are also potential s ources of variability in susceptibility for immunotoxicity associated with chemical exposure, as has b een demonstrated for the response to vaccination (e.g. Hennig et al., 2008; Ovsyanniko va et al., 2008) and for the development of certain auto- immune diseases (e.g. Rose & Mackay, 2006). Th e risk assessor should consider a reduction in the intraspecies uncertainty factor if data for the POD are derived from the most sensitive subpopulation of humans. 3.3.10.2 Interspecies uncertainty factor When PODs for immunotoxicity are derived from human data, no inte rspecies uncertainty factor is required, and it is set to 1. However, the availability of dose-response data in humans is generally limited, a nd therefore the extrapolation of laboratory animal data to humans is often necessary. Available data s upport this approach, be cause immunotoxicity data from experimental animals are generally go od predictors for subseque nt clinical data or epidemiological studies. The r oute and level of expos ure in the data set should be compared with those of expected human exposures. As for other non-cancer end-points, a default interspecies uncerta inty factor of 10 is recom- mended to extrapolate from laboratory animal species to humans when animal data are used to derive PODs for immunotoxicity. Similar to the intraspecies uncerta inty factor, the inter- species uncertainty factor can be su bdivided into toxicokinetic (e.g. 10 0.6 or 4 in IPCS 1999a] 100.5 or 3 in USEPA or 2.5 1999a] or 100.5 or 3 in USEPA [2002]) components. Rather than applying these default inter- species uncertainty factors, data-derived uncer tainty factors or CSAFs can be used when sufficient data are available to address spec ies differences in the toxicokinetics for the chemical under evaluation. For example, the US EPA RfC process descri bes the interspecies adjustment from laboratory animal exposure to a human equivalent concentration via dosimetric adjustment factors (USEPA, 1994, 2002). This process applies to the toxicokinetic aspects of cross-species extrapolation and doe s not address toxicodynamic differences that may exist between species. Recent harmoniza tion efforts at the USEPA advocate the adoption of body weight raised to the \u00be power (BW\u00be) scaling for RfD deri vation in instances where there are limited data with which to perform an assessment (U SEPA, 2011). Therefore, when species-specific data are available, there are procedures to apply CSAFs for both the RfC and the RfD (USEPA, 2002). In the case that information on intersp ecies variability is available\u2014for instance, in the form of comparis on of kinetic data or internal doses\u2014a data- derived adjustment factor can be applie species-to-sp ecies extrapolation. 3.3.10.3 end-points in toxico logy, use of an additiona l uncertainty factor (usually a factor of 10, unless indicated othe rwise, depending on the dose-response data and/or regulatory framework) is recommended when a LOAEL is used to derive the POD, rather than a NOAEL or BMD. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 403.3.10.4 Subchronic to chronic uncertainty factor The scope of the assessment outlined in the problem formulation phase will determine the need to apply an uncertainty factor for study duration. If the assessment is for risk over a lifetime of exposure (i.e. chronic) and the data used to derive the POD are from a subchronic exposure study, then an additional uncertainty fa ctor (10 or 3, depending on study duration) is applied to extrapolate the risk from subchronic to chronic exposu re. This uncertainty factor is often not applied to hypersensitiv ity data. First, hypersensitivity reference values for skin or respiratory sensitization are of ten derived for daily exposure, so the extrapolation would not apply. Second, sensitization and hypersensitivity may develop after relatively few exposures or may develop after years of exposure, as for hypersensitivity to halogenated platinum compounds (Merget et al., 2000). Th e use of a subchronic to chro nic uncertainty factor for hypersensitivity is therefore a matter of deba te and should be eval uated on a case-by-case basis for the compound in question. 3.3.10.5 Database uncertainty factor Examination of the extent of the database, the qu ality of individual studies and data gaps will assist the weight of evidence determination of database sufficiency. Although there is no regulatory guidance for determination of da tabase sufficiency, the following discussion provides examples where use of a database uncer tainty factor for lack of immunotoxicity data may be appropriate. The database for a chemical may not contain a ny toxicity studies spec ifically designed to determine immunotoxicity. Nevertheless, risk asse ssors determine which of the available data may provide information on immunotoxicity. In some cases, a limited data set may suggest the possibility of immunotoxicity without approp riate data to make a determination of immu- notoxicity risk or perform a dos e-response assessment. In such cases, the risk assessor should consider the use of the database uncertainty fact or to indicate that the lack of information on this end-point may be significant. In additi on, the risk assessor may be in the position of requesting additional data. The following discussion, while not comprehensive, is intended to present some examples of situations where additional data may be necessary to characterize the immunotoxicity hazard and therefore where a database uncertainty factor or request for additional data should be considered. The database uncertainty factor is intended to account for the potential for deriving an under- protective reference value as a result of a data base that leads to an incomplete character- ization of a chemical's toxicity. When characte rizing the overall toxic ity of a xenobiotic, a database uncertainty factor is often applied in th e absence of certain toxicity studies, such as a two-generation reproduction study; however, a value is generall y not applied a priori for databases lacking immunotoxicity studies. Inst ead, evidence of immuno toxicity may contrib- ute to the database uncertainty factor in se veral ways, depending on the weight of evidence Therefore, the database uncertainty factor refl ects the conclusion of the weight of evidence evaluation and the potential for addi tional data to affect the PODs for the particular reference value under development. Note, as illustrated in the following example, that the potential for additional immunotoxicity data to affect the POD is an importan t factor to consider in the application of the uncertainty factor: analysis for immunotoxicity (see weight of evidence discussion in section 3.3.6.2 above). Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 41 If sufficient evidence indicates that a hum an immunotoxicity hazard could exist and the limited data suggest that more extensiv e data might decrease the POD, this is taken into account in assigning the databa se uncertainty factor . On a case-by-case basis, the application of an un certainty factor of 3 or 10 is suggested for this type of database deficiency. There are several situations where insufficient evidence may be available to judge whether or not an immunotoxicity hazard ex ists. The implications for the database uncertainty factor differ depending on the reason why the evidence is insufficient to judge immunotoxicity and the purpose of the risk assessmen t. In cases of insufficient evidence, the risk assessor is faced with three options: 1) not performing a risk assessment, 2) performing a risk assessment on the most sensitive end-point without adjustment for the immunotoxicity-related uncertainty or 3) performing a risk assessment on another en d-point with a databa se uncertainty factor to characterize the immunotoxicity-related uncerta inty. An additional consideration is how to treat a complete lack of immune data to in form the evaluation of potential immunotoxicity for a given chemical. The following examples illustra te important considerations in the use of database uncertainty factors to address major gaps in the database that affect the ability to conclude whether or not a given chemical presents an immunotoxicity hazard: If the available data do not provide any ev idence for immunotoxicity (i.e. no change in any immune parameter including immune organ weights in stan dard toxicological studies and a complete lack of immunotoxi city studies or no evidence of immuno- toxicity from available studies), then imm unotoxicity does not contribute to the data- base uncertainty, and the database uncertainty factor for immunotoxicity is set to 1. As discussed above, the risk assessor must determine if a complete lack of data on immunotoxicity requires the use of a database uncertainty factor (note: this is likely to differ depending on the purpose of the risk assessment and the regulatory mandates involved). The conservative approach is to use the maximum database uncertainty factor of 10 when there is a complete lack of immune data. Therefore, setting the database uncertainty factor to 1 under the conservative approach assumes that a mini- mum data set of studies with immune data is available for the chemical in question. If there is equivocal evidence, limited evid ence or conflicting evidence that cannot be attributed to differences in study design, the poten tial that data to address the uncer- tainty might decrease a POD is taken into account in assigning the database uncertain- ty factor. On a case-by-case basis, the applic ation of an uncertainty factor of 3 or 10 is suggested to address database deficiency. Additional considerations and examples wherein data from the available toxicology studies raise suspici ons of immunotoxicity The size of the database uncertainty factor to be applied will depend on the available data for the weight of evidence eval uation of immunotoxicity as we ll as the completeness of the overall database of toxicity studies and on how much impact the missing data may have on determining a POD or PODs. 3.3.11 Exposure assessment Exposure assessments are used to obtain an es timate of human exposure in order to help quantify the risk to a populat ion. Specific guidelines on expo sure assessment (e.g. USEPA, 1992; IPCS, 2006a, 2009) and guidance specific to assessing the exposure of children (e.g. are detailed in section 3.3.6.3. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 42USEPA, 2005a; IPCS, 2006b) have been published separately and will not be discussed here. Rather, issues important for exposure assessmen t for immunotoxicity will be addressed. The resulting exposure estimate is a function of the be haviour of the expos ed population and the amount of the agent available for potential exposure. Exposure assessments may consider the frequency, magnitude, duration, schedule, source and route of human e xposure as well as bio- availability to humans and any special features of the population that will affect exposure. Information may be developed from monitori ng data, from estimates based upon modelling of environmental exposures and from applic ation of paradigms to exposure databases. 3.3.11.1 Exposure-related effects on severity and persistence Interactions between the biol ogy of various types of immunot oxicity and exposure paradigms are relevant for exposure assessment of imm unotoxic agents. The exposure paradigm may be defined at the particular point in time when exposure occurred or may reflect cumulative exposures. Each approach makes an assump tion about the underlying relationship between exposure and outcome. For example, using a cu mulative exposure measure, a greater proba- bility of an effect is assu med with greater total exposure or body burden. With a dichotomous exposure model (i.e. ever exposed or never exposed), the assump tion is that the effect is irreversible. Models that define exposures only at a specific time may assume that only the present exposure is important. In the case of imm unotoxicity, the magnit ude of the adverse effect (e.g. infectious disease incidences) wi ll be proportional to the severity of immune system damage as well as the length of time the effect remains (persistence). In biological terms, the adverse health outcome is proportional to both the severity and persistence of the immune effect. Thus, only the contribution of exposure to the severity of outcome may need to be considered if sufficient biological data are available indicating that the effect is per- sistent. This would be expected, for example, if the injury occurs in cells that cannot be replaced, such as long-term or short-term stem cells from the bone marrow, memory cells are left undisturbed and immunological tolerance is not induced. In contrast, an assumption can be made that any immune e ffects caused by an exposure are fully reversible under most conditions, if, for example, progenitor cells ar e left undisturbed and th e effects are focused exclusively on clonally expanding immune cells (i.e. post-antigen challenge). 3.3.11.2 Exposure timing and susceptibility Another consideration regarding exposure assess ments for immunotoxicity is the life stage at which exposure occurs. Diseases associated w ith abnormal immune f unction, including some common infectious diseases, are considerably mo re prevalent in immature individuals and the aged. It is generally assumed that the immatu re immune system is more susceptible to chemicals than the fully mature system and that sequelae of developmental immunotoxicant exposure may be particularly pe rsistent, in contrast to eff ects observed following adult expo- sure, which generally occur at higher doses and are expected to resolve soon after exposure ends (see review by Holladay & Smialowicz, 2000). Certain types of infectious diseases are more common in the elderly than in neonates or young adults due to age-related loss of immune responsiveness (i.e. immunosenescence). In the simplest terms, the very young lack immunologi cal experience, and the elderly, in spite of a wealth of experience, are no longer able to respond as well as the younger population. There are no data to support th e notion that the immune system of the elderly is uniquely susceptible to immunotoxic agents. However, as a result of immunosenescence, a moderate loss of immune function and homeostatic contro ls may have more significant adverse effects Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 43in the elderly than in young adults. An expos ure assessment should characterize the likeli- hood of exposure of at least three genera l age groups\u2014prenatal, young adult and elderly\u2014 and factor the susceptibility of the groups into the risk assess ment to the extent possible. 3.3.11.3 Route of exposure and local immunity The route of exposure as it pertains to poten tial systemic or local immunological effects of local immunity). Whereas the route of ex posure (i.e. respiratory, dermal or gastro- intestinal) for most toxicological end-points need only be considered in terms of its influence on uptake to the potential target, for immunotoxicity, it is impo rtant to consider both systemic and potential local immunologica l effects. All three major r outes of exposure to environ- mental toxicants are associated with the presen ce of local immune tissu e and, to some extent, represent partially independent systems, such as the immune system associated with the skin (Elmets, 1994) or the lung (Selgrade, 2000). Seve ral lines of evidence have suggested that although systemic immunity is not necessarily sp ared, the predominant immunological effect may occur at these local sites. For example, exposure to respirat ory toxicants such as gallium arsenide or aerosolized JP-8 jet fuel may have a preferential effect on lung immunity and pulmonary defence mechanisms compared with non-pulmonary lymphoid tissues. Thus, exposure assessment for immunotoxicity should c onsider potential systemic uptake to central lymphoid organs (i.e. spleen, thymus and bone marrow) as well as exposure of local immune tissue. However, even when systemic immuno toxicity has been observed following respira- tory or dermal exposure, in some cases, it may not be a direct result of the agent interacting with the central lymphoid tissue, but rather th e release of immunomodulatory mediators from the local immune tissue. In th is respect, the release of inflammatory/immunomodulatory mediators from the skin and lung following expo sure may cause systemic effects (e.g. Rivas & Ullrich, 1994). 3.3.11.4 Exposure and toxicokinetic considerations The toxicity of an exogenous chemical and th e dose-response relationship for that chemical are both dependent upon the concentration of th e toxicant at the site (s) of action (e.g. the target organ(s)). The disposition of a chemi cal in an organism is dependent upon the ADME processes, defined as toxicokinetic data (R enwick, 1994). Qualitative and quantitative infor- mation on each of these processes can be informative for stu dy design and data interpretation, as well as in risk assessment. Toxicokinetic information may provide the key to scientifically valid interpretation of the results of immunotoxicology studies. The determ ination of the toxicological relevance of events observed in individual laboratory animal studies may rely extensively on ADME data. For example, characterization of the metabolic profile of a toxican t may reveal species- specific differences in the bi oavailability of active metabolites, which can influence the expression of adverse outcomes on the immune sy stem. Toxicokinetic data that demonstrate in utero and/or lactational exposures can be va luable for interpretation of developmental im- munotoxicity outcomes. Toxicokinetic data may al so contribute to the analysis of and ration- ale for the MOA of the active mo iety (Dybing et al., 2002). These data can be instrumental in building a weight of evidence approach for the use of immunotoxicity end-points in risk calculations. Establishing a valid physiologi cally toxicokine tic (PBTK) or physio- logically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model through the analysis a nd incorporation of toxicokinetic data can be an informative step in building the scien tific foundation upon which needs to be considered in exposure assessment (see section 3.3.4 above for further discussion Harmonization Project Document No. 10 44dose metrics are selected and risk calculations are based, both for a dults and during develop- ment (Andersen of species-to-species extrapolat ion and the use of CSAFs in the risk assessment are often reliant upon adequa te toxicokinetic information (Suter et al., 2005). Toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic aspects to be addressed in uncertainty factor adjustment include identification of the active ch emical species, the relevant internal expo- sure and the choice of the metric or end-point used in assessments (Gundert-Remy & Sonich- Mullin, Dorne & Renwick, 2005). Alternatively, toxicokinetic da ta may provide an important piece of the rationale for application of a database uncertainty factor wh en, for example, bioaccumulation of the test chemical in immune system tissues has been established, but no studies of immune system function are available. 3.3.12 Risk characterization Risk characterization is the summary and integr ation portion of the risk assessment process in which the hazard characterization, quantitat ive dose-response assessment and exposure assessment are combined, along with a critical appraisal of the toxicity information. The critical evaluation contains a review of the overall quality of the assessment, including a discussion of uncertainties and a valuation of confidence in the conclusions. Ideally, a quantitative risk assessment is performed, but wh ere the available data do not allow for such an assessment, a qualitative risk assessment may still be possibl e. For instance, the conclu- sion that a substance may be a sensitizer is an example of a qualitative risk assessment outcome. This basically is a form of hazard iden tification and is often used for classification and labelling purposes. Quantitative outcomes may be limited to a conclusion that there is a risk because exposure may be in excess of a health-based guidance value, but the risk characterization may also include a section describing risk in te rms of the nature and extent of possible harm. The resulting summary is the final step in the risk assessment process, providing the risk manager with a useful synopsis of the risk assessment for a given chemical, including the following general components, to clearly illustrate the assumptions, uncertain- ties and methods used in the risk assessment process: the nature, reliability, consistency and variability of the data used; the reasoning behind the sele ction of key studies and cr itical effect(s), including relevance to human outcomes; occurrence of common versus rare immune deficits; use of historical control da ta to place the concurrent control into perspective; the consideration of sensitive populations and life stages; the qualitative and quantitativ e descriptors of the result s of the risk assessment; the limitations of the available data, the a ssumptions used to bridge knowledge gaps in working with those data and the impli cations of using alte rnative assumptions; the strengths and weaknesses of the risk a ssessment and the level of scientific confi- dence in the assessment; the areas of uncertainty, additional data/res earch needs to improve confidence in the risk assessment and the potential impacts of new research; the science policy choices and the context of risk estimates relative to other similar risks or previous assessments. Particular attention is to be given in the risk characterization phase to the interpretation of multiple or varying effects i nduced by a chemical. Different qualitative outcomes may, for Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 45instance, appear with increasing doses or incr easing exposure duration. In such cases, it is important to consider whether such variations may be attributed to changing outcomes of one and the same MOA or may be a result of differe nt mechanisms with different dose-effect or exposure duration-effect relationships . All different effects need to be considered in the risk assessment and in the selection of appropriate safety factors. At each of the first three stag es of the risk assessment pr ocess\u2014hazard characterization, quantitative dose-response assessment and exposure assessment\u2014judgements are made on the relevance of the toxicity data for likely human exposure. Judgements made in one section may have implications for other portions of the assessment, and these decisions should be re- examined in the integration of the first three sections as part of the process of risk charac-terization. The immune system is highly comple x, being composed of a number of interacting components. Thus, when reviewing immunotoxico logy data, it is important that an immuno- the results suggest biological plausibility. 3.4 Entry points for immunotoxicity risk assessment Prior to applying a risk assessment guidance for a specific type of immunotoxicity (see sidered and what type(s) of (potential) immuno toxicity to address need to be addressed. Therefore, an overview of po ssible entry points for immunotoxi city risk assessment was pre- more general immunotoxicological parameters to parameters that more specifically indicate separate types of immunotoxicity. It is to be noted that this overview is not exhaustive and that other indications of potential immunotoxicity may arise. It is a dvised that an immuno- toxicology expert be consulted where indicatio ns for possible immunotoxicity are assumed, to assist the risk assessor in establishing the need for immunot oxicity risk assessment and the type of immunotoxicity to be addressed and for performing the required risk assessment. In addition to these specific entry points, information on SARs and MOAs may form important entry points for immunotox icity risk assessment as well. chapters 4-7), the questions as to how to judge whether immunotoxicity needs to be con-logical profile is evident.

ASSESSMENT OF IMMUNOSUPPRESSION 4.1 Introduction This section of the guidance document focuses on unintended immunosuppression, an area of immunotoxicity for which there is wide acceptan ce of the relevance of end-points in humans and laboratory animals for the determination of human risk (see reviews by Vos & Van Loveren, first brought to the attention of the scientific comm unity in the 1970s as a result of inter- national workshops held by the United States National Academy of Sciences, the United States Food and Drug Administ ration (USFDA) and WHO (Luste r et al., 1980a,b). Numerous experimental and epidemiological studies have since been published, suggesting that while immunosuppression is not a common occurrence, it is not rare a nd may arise as a result of chemical exposure in both humans and experime ntal animals. Immunosuppression represents a series of complex cascading cellular and organ-related events that can lead to an increased incidence and/or severity of infectious and ne oplastic diseases (Luebk e et al., 2004); thus, data from experimental immunotoxi cological or epidemiological st udies that are addressed in quantitative risk assessment may require careful interpretation. This is particularly true when the immunological effects are slight to moderate in nature, as may be expected from inadver- tent exposures to immunosuppressive agents in human populations. This is in contrast to the severe immunosuppression that can occur in in dividuals with primar y (i.e. genetic) immuno- deficiency or AIDS. In cases of severe imm unosuppression, the incidence of certain types of cancers and infections is greatly increased. In order to accurately predict the risk of immuno- suppression from xenobiotic exposures in hum an populations, a scientifically sound immuno- suppression framework should be established that will support an accurate and quantitative interpretation of experimental and epidemiol ogical studies and applic ation to human health risk assessment. This framework should also cons ider susceptible populati ons. In this respect, while age-related differences in immune f unction during development and old age are not well understood, concerns for the special vulnerabi lity of these populations have been estab- lished. 4.2 Hazard identification The questions to be answered during hazard id entification are similar across all types of systemic toxicants: does the compound increase the risk of adverse effect s, and are the effects in time determination, do not reflect persistence of the change or necessarily indicate that immune function was sufficiently compromised to increase the risk of infection or neoplasia. In contrast, functional assays measure the resp onse of the immune system to a challenge at the cellular or whole-animal level. The latte r assay type provides the best evidence of immune system health by mimicking host respons es that reduce the risk of infection (e.g. producing antibodies in response to immunization). Testing schemes may include tiers of observational and functional end-points (e.g. Lust er et al., 1988) or one or two functional assays (e.g. OPPTS 870.7800: USEP A, 1998). Certain guidelines th at include screening for potential immunotoxicants (e.g. OECD Test Guideline 407, WHO/IPCS's EHC 180, ICH S8 protocols, the EU's REACH) rely on cha nges in observational e nd-points to trigger end-points reflect changes in cells and products of the immune sy stem, but, as a single point likely to occur in humans? Da ta used to identif y potential immunosuppressants may be the form of observational or functional end-poi nts (see Table 3.1). In general, observational generated as part of general t oxicity studies or in dedicated immunotoxicity studies and take Harmonization Project Document No. 10 50assessment of immune function. However, conc ordance analysis determined that many observational end-points have low predictive po wer for functional cha nges (Luster et al., 1992), leading to the requireme nt for functional testing in the USEPA's OPPTS 870.7800 guideline. Humans and laboratory animals ofte n respond similarly to immune system chal- lenges (e.g. immunization) and exposure to immunotoxicants, although there are documented differences. As such, human da ta should be used whenever available and should take precedence over extrapolation from laboratory an imal data, provided that equivalent end- points are compared and the data are of sufficient quality and reliability. 4.3 Hazard characterization Unintended suppression of immune function is cl early adverse. Even mo derate suppression in humans may decrease responses to immunization and in crease suscep tibility to infection and certain types of cancer, partic ularly when exposure occurs during immune system develop- ment and maturation or under other circumstan ces (e.g. therapeutic suppression of immune function and inflammation, chronic stress, r ecreational drug use) that decrease immuno- competence. Specific examples and detailed discussion of immunosuppression are presented 4.4 Clinical and ep idemiological data 4.4.1 Clinical data Immunotoxicology data in humans may be derived from well-designed clinical or epidemio- logical studies, observational studies or case reports. Although controlled clinical studies represent the best oppo rtunity to identify a nd characterize immunotoxicants, they are not routinely conducted for environmental or occ upational chemicals for obvious ethical reasons. Pharmaceuticals that have been examined c linically for possible immunosuppression have been limited to cytoreductive drugs and tran splantation agents (D escotes & Vial, 1994; Ryffel et al., 1994), with tests usually restri cted to monitoring changes in WBC counts which most likely reflect fairly severe immunosuppression (Luster et al., 2004). However, a common finding from these clinic al studies indicates that oppor tunistic infections and/or neutropenia are frequently observe d in patients on high-dose, acu te exposure to drugs (Neumann & Fauser, 1982; Lawson et al., 1984; Bradley et al., 1989; Antonelli et al., 1991). Where the ethical issues have been appropriately resolved, immune function data following controlled exposure in humans would require the least extrapolation and present the strongest data for estimating risk to the general population. For example, Sleijffers et al. (2001) investi- gated the effects of ultraviolet B exposure on th e antibody titres to the hepatitis B vaccine in human volunteers. The advantages and potential utility of meas uring the response to vaccina- tion as an indicator of immune effects associat ed with exposure to environmental agents have been suggested for adults as well as infants (Van Loveren et al., 2001; Gans et al., 2003). 4.4.2 Epidemiological data In contrast to patients with a suspected prim ary immunodeficiency disease or HIV infection, it is considerably more difficult to detect mild to moderate states of immunodeficiency, as in sections 4.8.2 and 4.8.3. Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 51would likely occur following exposure to i mmunotoxic chemicals, using common clinical immune tests. Testing for primary immunodefici ency diseases is normally undertaken by a stepwise (tiered) approach, which initially in cludes general parameters, such as complete blood counts, serum immunoglobulin levels, chest radiographs of the thymus and DTH tests, and is usually initiated because the patient pr esents with excessive infectious diseases (Noroski & Shearer, 1998). As has been shown in laboratory animal st udies (Luster et al., 1992, 1993), such tests are not sensitive indicators of immunotoxicity and thus may not detect subtle immune changes. Further, in contra st to diagnoses of pr imary immunodeficiency disease in a child or adult, immunotoxicological studies are conducted routinely within an epidemiological framework, requ iring relatively larg e populations and care ful consideration of experimental design to account for absenc e of selection bias, exposure and outcome misclassifications, and confounding factors. As discussed previously, from a population st andpoint, small changes in the immune system have been shown to result in an increased ri sk of disease when studied under appropriate conditions. Changes in disease may not be a pparent owing to limitations of study designs where, for example, the populatio n is too small, the most appr opriate infections were not being monitored or the population was not fo llowed for a sufficient period to encounter infectious agents. When interpreting human immune data, considerably more credence is given to those studies in which multiple immune tests were conducted and the resulting data provide a biologically plausibl e interpretation. When examin ing a large number of immuno- phenotypic markers, an abnormal value in one or two immunophenotypes is likely to result simply from a type 1 error. A more reliable indicator of immunotoxicity would be multiple changes consistent with a specific pattern. Fo r example, it is unlikely that a significant decrease in immunoglobulin le vel would be observed without a concomitant decrease in certain lymphocyte markers, particularly those associated with B cells. A description of bio- markers in epidemiological studi es is provided in EHC 180: Principles and methods for assessing direct immunotoxicity with exposure to chemicals (IPCS, 1996). The risk assessor should refer to the assay descri ptions in EHC 180 for immunotoxi city end-points contained in the data set for the chemical in question to pr ovide specific context, cautions and information that may assist in th e interpretation of immunosuppressi on data for risk assessment. In addition, it is recommended that the risk assessor consult an expert in immunotoxicology or clinical immunology to help in terpret the biological plausibi lity of the study results. Although data from functional immune assays (e.g. the antibody res ponse to vaccine) are generally not available in humans, such data represent the strongest evidence of an immuno- suppression. As described above, human data are generally restricted to immunophenotyping, cytokines and serum immunoglob ulin levels, and these end- points are neit her sensitive enough to detect mild to moderate immunos uppression nor predictive enough of an adverse response to be used as the sole indicator of an immunosuppressive effect of a given chemical. These end-points are, instead, useful to s upport the human relevance of laboratory animal data with evidence of immunosuppression, sugges t that additional studies should be con- ducted to examine the possibility of immunosuppr ession or indicate that a database uncer- tainty factor may be appropriate to address the suggesti on of immunosuppression. 4.5 Laboratory animal data Rodent models have also been used to incr ease understanding of im mune function end-points and disease resistance. Immunotoxi cologists have historically us ed host resistance assays to validate the predictive value of other methods a nd extrapolate the potenti al for environmental Harmonization Project Document No. 10 52agents to alter host su sceptibility in the human population, because altered resistance is a biologically plausible effect wi th clear relevance for potential adverse effects in humans. In these assays, groups of experimental animals are challenged with either an infectious agent or a transplantable tumour at a challenge level su fficient to produce disease in a small number of control animals. However, challenge agents in host resistance assays should be chosen to explore or confirm a known func tional defect, not used to screen for effects. Non-lethal resistance models, in which numbers of tumour fo ci, viral titres or bact erial counts in target tissues are assessed, provide greater sensitivity than mortality, because the data provide a quantitative assessment of the host response to challenge and are a better reflection of pro- tective immunity in the organism. Furthermore, the biological relevance of death as an end- point is questionable when most or all of the immunocompetent controls do not survive, because the virulence or number of the challe nge agents simply overwhelms the initial response to infection, killing the host before a protective response can be mounted. In gen- eral, there is a good correlation between experime ntal animal data and human clinical and epidemiological data on chemicals for which th ere are studies of immu nosuppression in both humans and laboratory animals (Descotes, 2003; see also reviews by Vos & Van Koller, 2001). Rodent data on immunosuppres sive good predictors of subsequent clinical observa tions after toxicokinetic adjustments. For example, a comparison of immunosuppressive effects of cyclosporin A among various spe- cies (mouse, rat, guinea-pig, dog, Rhesus monkey and human) demonstrated good quanti- tative and qualitative agreement (IPCS, 1996). One approach to examine the relationship be tween immunosuppression and disease has been to determine the concordance between immune tests routinely used in rodent studies of chemical-induced immunosuppression and host resistance models (Luster et al., 1993). Although it is rare for a single co mponent of the immune system to be solely responsible for resistance to specific infectious agents or tumour types, certain immune measures show increased correlation with the outcomes of indivi dual host resistance assa ys (Luster et al., 1988). Using mathematical models to assess th e relationship between immune function tests and disease resistance models following exposur e to cyclophosphamide, Luster et al. (1993) found that a majority of the immune functi on-host resistance relati onships appeared to approximate a linear relationship. However, for several parameters, a linear-quadratic model best fit the relationship. Note th at the models in Luster et al . (1993) describe the relationship between functional immune test s and disease resist ance assays, not between chemical expo- sure (cyclophosphamide in this example) and immune function. While individual immune tests ranged from good (PFC assay, 73%; NK cell activity, 73%; se to lipopolysaccharide [LPS], 54%) predictors of changes in resistance to any disease challenge, a co mbination of multiple immune tests, including those assays found to be good individual predicto rs of host resistance, could result in con- cordance rates as high as 100% (Luster et al., 1993). A basic understanding of the typical methodologi es used to evaluate immunotoxicity in laboratory animal models is necessary to evalua te the database of studies for hazard charac- terization of a given chemical as the first step in risk assessment. Detailed discussions of end- points and methods utilized in characteriz ing immunosuppression are provided in EHC 180 (IPCS, 1996). The data set for most chemicals is unlikely to contai n data on all of the described end-points. The risk assessor should refer to the assay descriptions in EHC 180 for immunotoxicity end-points contained in the data set for the chemical in question to provide specific context, cautions and information that may assist in the interpretation of immuno- suppression data for risk assessment. Chapter 3 presents a detailed di scussion of general Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 53considerations in the assessm ent of immunotoxicity data available for the chemical under assessment that should be consulted when evaluating the database for immunosuppression. 4.6 Local versus systemic effects The concept of distinct local toxicity related to the route of exposure is not unique to immunotoxicology and may result fr om direct exposure or increas ed local concentrations of toxicant at the exposure site. The contrast between local and systemic toxicity within general toxicology is illustrated by exam ples such as local route-depe ndent histopathological changes associated with lowest inhalation concentr ation of furfural of 6 mg/kg body weight per day, well below any observed toxicity associated with oral exposure, in a study that examined route-dependent toxicity of furfural in Fische r 344 rats (Arts et al., 2004a). Route-associated local exposure effects may explain some aspects of local toxicity; in the case of inhalational toxicity of furfural in rats, the observed eff ects may be exacerbated by the increased local exposure resulting from the particular morphology of the rat nasal cavity (for a discussion of rat nasal exposure, see Kimbell et al., 1997). However, unlike mo st toxicological end-points, for immunotoxicology, the route of exposure is not simply a local increased concentration or uptake issue. There are local, partially independe nt portions of the immune system associated with each of the major routes of exposure: i nhalation, dermal and oral . Therefore, route of exposure is potentially important for imm unosuppression, as local immunotoxicological effects may occur independent of systemic immunity. Potential enhancement of respirat ory infection as a result of exposure to an inhaled toxicant and subsequent immunosuppression are important considerations for risk assessors. Four decades of research demonstrat e that the alveolar macrophage is an important target for inhaled toxicants and that suppr ession of this response increases the risk of bacterial pneu- monia (reviewed by Selgrade & Gilmour, 2006). A widely accepted method for identification of this hazard is a ssessment of phagocytic function of alveolar macrophages contained in bronchoalveolar fluid ob tained from laboratory rodent s following inhalation exposure to the toxicant. Several good met hods are available using different types of par ticles (Lewis, 1995; Neldon et al., 1995; Brousseau et al., 1999; Tasat et al., 2003). Mortality in response to inhalati on or intratracheal ch allenge with a variet y of extracellular bacteria has been shown to increase with exposures to environmentally relevant concentra-tions of criteria air pollutants (ozone, nitroge n dioxide and sulfur dioxide) in mice. Also, inhalation of certain particulate air pollutants, pa rticulate-associated meta ls as well as certain soluble metal salts and volatile organics has be en shown to enhance susceptibility to infec- tion. In addition to enhanced mo rtality, many of the same studie s have demonstrated impaired bacterial clearance from the lung and/or impa ired alveolar macrophage function (reviewed by Selgrade & Gilmour, 2006). Pulmonary macropha ges, however (through the production of cytokines in response to microbi al exposures), provide an impor tant link betwee n the innate and adaptive cell-mediated response, and enha ncement of these infections following exposure to air pollutants has also been associated w ith suppression of alveol ar macrophage function (reviewed by Selgrade & Gilmour, 2006). Early bacterial clearance is mediated by a dual phagocytic system involving both macro- phages and neutrophils (Zhang et al., 2000). The alveolar macr ophage is the first line of defence; for some bacterial species (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus ), the alveolar macrophage is normally sufficient for clearance (Rehm et al ., 1980). When the invading pathogens are too virulent or represent too larg e a load to be contained by th e macrophage alone, alveolar Harmonization Project Document No. 10 54macrophages generate numerous me diators that recruit large numb ers of neutrophils into the alveolar space to help defend the host against the bacterial invasion. However, this influx of neutrophils is a double-edged sword, because the resulting inflammation can cause pneu- monia or bronchitis. When rats were exposed to ozone and challenged with Streptococcus zooepidemicus , bacterial clearance from the lung was in itially impaired, and bacteria isolated from the exposed rats exhibited enhanced viru lence factors, but no mortality was observed. This more favourable outcome in rats (compared with mice) appears to be related to a more timely influx of neutrophils, which peaked at 1 day post-infection in rats compared with day 2 or later (depending on the strain) in mice (Gilmour & Selgrade, 1993). Although the neutrophil response represents an overlapping resistance mechanism, ozone-exposed rats exhibit both prolonged infection and pulmonary inflammation well above those observed with bacteria or pollutant alone. Studies with phosgene suggest that once the t oxic insult is removed, alveolar macrophage function rebounds rather quickly. Hence, a single short-term exposure may create only a small window of vulnerability, during which an infectious agent might gain an advantage over the host. However, chronic exposure may result in a longer window of vulnerability, and there is no evidence that macrophages adap t to such insults (Selgrade, 1999). 4.7 (Ir)reversibility of effects Human studies indicate that im mune function returns to norma l following exposure to potent immunosuppressive drugs, and the expectation is that immune function will return to normal in humans and laboratory animals as xenobiotics ar e cleared. However, persistence of effects in adult animals has not been systematically ev aluated, and greater persistence of effects is expected if chemical exposure affects precur sor or stem cells. This is not the case for exposure during gestation or in the early postnatal period, wh en immunotoxicity may have much longer lasting effects than in the adult, persisting for weeks, months or even most of the lifespan of the host (Dietert & Piepenbrink, 2006b; Luebke et al., 2006a; Dietert & Dietert, 2007). The outcome of chemical exposure may be either reversible or irreversible in some cases, depending on the combination of dose and duration of the chemical exposure (see additional used in cancer chemotherapy can temporarily affect the immune response by diminishing the ability of immunocompete nt cells to respond to antigen. The immune system would likely recover when the offending agent is removed. However, these same agents, when adminis- tered at higher concentrations or over prolonged periods of time, may affect the haemato- poietic stem cells. This could re sult in either a delay in recovery, to allow sufficient time for the stem cell repopulation, or immune failure, in which the stem cells or stromal cell micro- environment is irreversibly damaged. Thus, th e final outcome will de pend upon the dose and duration of exposure, as well as the specific ta rget within the microe nvironment (e.g. stromal cells versus long-term stem cells versus short-term stem cells). 4.8 Biological plausibility discussion in section 4.13 below). For example, it is known that many an tiproliferative agents Biological plausibility is discu ssed in detail in section 3.3.6 of chapter 3. In particular, the reader is referred to section 3.3.6.1 for a disc ussion on the health-rela ted database and the components of sufficient evidence for immunotoxicity and section 3.3.6.3 for a discussion of Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 55\"triggers\" and factors to be considered in determining whether additional data may be required to complete the risk assessment. 4.8.1 Weight of evidence approach for assessment of immunosuppression Hazard identification for immunosuppression should result in weight of evidence conclusions based on the available human a nd laboratory animal data for a given chemical. The risk assessor should consider the entire database of effects, both positive and negative. Data are evaluated within the same or similar assays, as well as across divergent measures of the immune system and across multiple species. For each assay, a dose-response relationship for chemical exposure in the absence of generalize d overt toxicity is a necessary criterion in demonstrating immunosuppression. The weight of evidence conclusions are stre ngthened by consistenc y (particularly across species, sexes or related end-point s), biological plausibility and breadth (range of effects) of the evidence for immunotoxicity. A lack of cons istency of specific assays or types of immu- notoxicity across species, strains or sexes does not necessarily represent conflicting data and often represents species, strain or sex differe nces. Conflicting data should be evaluated by the strengths and weaknesse s (e.g. sample size and exposure dura tion) of the individual studies, as well as in the context of the remainder of the immunotoxicity database for a given chemical. Additional information with which to interpret species, strain or sex differences may be gained by considering toxicokinetic data (when available) or the likelihood of sex differences resulting from hormonally active ch emicals, such as endocrine disrupting end-points, the we ight of evidence evalua tion should represent an expert judgement of the da tabase to determine the poten tial for immunosuppression for a 1999a; Weed, dose-r esponse consistency of tion, temporal association, biol ogical plausibility, specificity, coherence and analogy. The following outline presents a structured approach to organizing the available data for developing weight of evidence conclusions in the assessment of immunosuppression hazard identification through seven questio ns asking the risk assessor to evaluate the available data from the strongest and most predictive data (human data) through the least predictive (immune organ weight). While not exhaustive, the relative strength and predictability of different assays are presented below for major types of immunotoxicity data. This outline is below for important considerations identifyi ng key strengths and weaknesses for particular types of human and laboratory animal data. As described below, some data (i.e. huma n disease incidence, human functional immune data, host resistance assays in experiment al animals and immune function assays in experimental animals) present clear eviden ce of adverse immunosuppression, whereas other data (i.e. general immune assays, haematol ogy, histopathology and immune organ weights) are more difficult to interpre t and often present equivocal evidence without additional support for immunosuppression from othe r assays. It is particularly recommended that the risk assessor consult an expert in immunotoxicology or clinical imm unology to help interpret the biological plausibility and adve rsity of these less predictive assays. The risk assessor should evaluate the weight of evidence for immunos uppression based on the database for a given chemical by considering all seven of the follo wing questions, beginning with the extent orpresented in brief in Figure 4.1; however, the risk assessor s hould refer to the detailed text given compound in accordance with the following key considerations (Hill, 1965; IPCS, 56 Figure 4.1: Weight of evidence approach for assessment of immunosuppression. The figure presents a structured approach for organizing all of the available data for developing weight of evidence conclusions for immunosuppression ha zard identification. It presents a summary of decision-tree.

Controlled clinical studies with quantitative evalua- tion of immune function, such as primar y antibody response to influenza vaccina- tion, secondary antibody res ponse to tetanus toxoid, DTH to naturally occurring antigens or disease resistan ce assays, represent clear ev adverse immuno- suppression. These in vivo functional assays are appropriate to derive an effect level for immunosuppression; however, they are not frequently performed, because testing procedures require inject ion of the human subjects with antigen. Ex vivo functional assays (e.g. NK function, phagocytosis, bacterial killing by monocytes or polymorphonuclear leukocyte [PMNL] activity) al so represent good human data that are considered clear evidence of adverse immunosuppression with the added benefit of providing f unctional immune data from peripheral blood samples without subjecting humans to an antigenic challenge . These ex vivo functional assays are appropr iate end-points to derive an effect level for immuno- suppression, but they should be evaluate d with additional sc rutiny; the risk assessor should closely evaluate the degr ee of suppression, consistency of data across studies and biological plausibility from supporting data, because the ex vivo tests do not directly test an intact immune system. 9 Human data are more likely to be enumera tion of immune system components (for a more complete discussion of typical hum an data, see the above discussions in assays, such as lymphocyte proliferati on, are the most common assays used in human immunotoxicity studies, but individually are not predictive measures for immunotoxicity. These data are therefore not appropr iate to derive an effect level for immunosuppression. These less predic tive immune measures can be used to support laboratory animal data and should be considered with the weight of evidence evaluation of human and experiment al animal data to determine biologi- cal plausibility and consider potential mechanisms or MOAs. Epidemiological studies with effects data and demonstrated chemical exposure lacking dose levels (as is frequently the case for retrosp ective studies) can be used to evaluate consistency of effects betw een the laboratory animal da ta and the available human data and to support the development of e ffect levels from the laboratory animal data. Available data support the notion that chemical immunosuppression is much more likely to result in mild to m oderate immunosuppression than the severe suppression associated with primary im munodeficiency diseases and AIDS (see studies are generally not designed to detect mild to moderate changes in immune function or relatively small increases in incidences of infection, and therefore careful consideration of ne gative data is suggested. section 4.4). Immunophenotyping, serum immunoglobulin levels and in vitro section 4.8.3 below for a more detailed discussion). However, epidemiological Harmonization Project Document No. 10 582) Host resistance (laboratory animal data) : Is there evidence that the chemical reduces resistance to infecti ons and/or tumours? 9 Suppression of a host resistance measure is considered clear evidence of adverse immunosuppression and appropriate for derivation of an effect level. 9 Suppression of the same host resistance as say in multiple species or multiple host resistance assays with concordance among end-points increases th e strength of the data indicating suppression and provides da ta appropriate for de rivation of effect level(s). 9 Suppression of a host resistance measure in combination with suppression of associated immune function(s) that medi ated resistance to the challenge agent increases the strength of the data indicati ng suppression, supports determination of an MOA and provides data appropriate for derivation of effect level(s). 9 Suppression of a host resistance measur e with additional ev idence of immuno- toxicity (e.g. immunophenotyping, cytoki nes, altered histology, immune organ weight) may support determination of an MOA. 3) Immune function (laboratory animal data) : Is there evidence that the chemical reduces immune function (antibody production, NK cell function, DTH, mixed leukocyte reaction [MLR], cytotoxic a single func tional immune assay is consid ered clear evidence of adverse immunosuppression and appropriate for derivation of an effect level. 9 Suppression of the same functional assay in multiple species or multiple func-tional assays with concordance among end- points increases the strength of the data indicating immunosuppre ssion and provides data a ppropriate for derivation of effect level(s). 9 Suppression of a functional measure in co mbination with add itional evidence of immunotoxicity that suppor ts an MOA or biological ly plausible mechanism greatly increases the support for immunosuppression. 9 Suppression of a functional measure in co mbination with add itional evidence of immunotoxicity (e.g. immunophenotyping, cyto kines, altered histology, immune organ weight) increases the strength of the data indicating immunosuppression. 9 Some ex vivo functional assays (MLR, C TL) may be appropriate end-points to derive an effect level for immunosuppressi on, but they should be evaluated with additional scrutiny; the risk assessor shoul d more closely evaluate the degree of suppression, consistency of data across st udies and biological plausibility from supporting data, because the ex vivo tests do not directly test an intact immune system. 9 Nonspecific T or B cell proliferation assays have been listed as functional assays in some guidelines (e.g. IPCS, 1996), but th ey are not considered true functional tests and are covered below under general immune assays. 4) General immune assays (laboratory animal data) : Is there evidence from general or observational immune assays (lymphocyt e phenotyping, cytokines, complement, lymphocyte proliferation, chemical is immunosuppressive? 9 Lymphocyte phenotyping, cytokines and ot her assays may add MOA information to support a biologically plausibl e description of immunosuppression. 9 Phenotyping, lymphocyte proliferation or al tered soluble mediator concentrations are generally not considered to be re liable predictors of immunosuppression and Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 59therefore should generally no t be used to derive an effect level for immuno- suppression. 9 In vitro data alone are inade quate evidence of immunotoxicity. 5) Haematology (laboratory animal data) : Is there evidence that the chemical causes haematological changes (e.g. altered WBC c ounts) suggestive of immune effects? 9 Severe haematological cha nges alone are sufficient to demonstrate adverse immunosuppression and appropriate for deriva tion of an effect level; otherwise, haematological data should generally not be used to derive an effect level for immunosuppression. 9 Haematological changes may add MOA information to support a biologically plausible description of immunosuppression. 9 Haematological changes consistent with histopathological evidence may indicate immunotoxicity and constitute additional support for the weight of evidence of immunosuppression. 6) Histopathology (laboratory animal data) : Is there histopathological evidence (thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, etc.) that sugg ests that the chemical causes immuno- toxicity? 9 Descriptive (extended) histopathological evidence from multiple immune organs alone may indicate immunotoxicity and suppor t the weight of evidence of immu- nosuppression, but should not be used to derive an effect level for immuno- suppression. 9 Limited histopathological ev idence alone is equivocal. 9 Decreased immune organ weight may support histopathological evidence. 7) Organ weight (laboratory animal data) : Is there evidence that the chemical reduces immune organ weight (thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, etc.)? 9 Decreased immune organ weight may suppor t other evidence of immunosuppres- sion. 9 Immune organ weight change alone is equivocal and theref ore should generally not be used to derive an e ffect level for immunosuppression. 9 Evidence for immunotoxicity based on reduc ed immune organ weight must be evaluated with caution, as reduced immune organ wei ght may be secondary to general toxicity, resu lting potentially in a stress response. The risk assessor should develop the weight of evidence for immunosuppression hazard identification based on answers to all seven qu estions. The weight of evidence conclusions for immunosuppression should also describe the database in terms of consistency and biological plausibility, including strengths, weaknesses, uncertainties and data gaps. A small database with negative data is equivocal. Just as positive data on a range of assays strengthen the weight of evidence for immunotoxicity, negative data on a range of more predictive assays such as immune function data increase confidence to support a lack of immuno- toxicity. The strength of the immune database will determine whether additional evidence is necessary to determine immunotoxicity. Incomplete or questionable data sets and high usage or high risk of exposure shoul d trigger a request for additiona l data, if regulatory mandate allows. When immunosuppression is indicated by the weight of evidence, these conclusions are then prepared to be brought forward to perform a dose-response assessment, beginning with the Harmonization Project Document No. 10 60selection of the most appropria te end-point(s) or critical e ffect(s) and the development of POD(s). Health-based guidance values or referen ce values are then calculated by dividing the dose-response assessment and derivation of refe rence values). Data from human exposures (e.g. occupational exposure studies and case reports) are preferre d for the critical effect, because fewer assumptions are required to dete rmine the relative risk of immunotoxicity for the general population from human data compared with experimental animal data. Therefore, when human data are used for the critical eff ect and the POD, smaller uncertainty factors are generally utilized to derive the reference values. Nevertheless, all available data are con- sidered for the critical effect. The quantitati ve risk assessment may be based on laboratory animal data even if th ere are human data for a given chemi cal in cases such as inadequate information on dose levels, no information on effects at low doses or absence of a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) in the human data set. Dose-related changes in four principal types of data provide clear evidence of adverse immunosuppression appropriate for use as the cr itical effect for chemical-related immuno- suppression: 1) increased human disease incide nce, 2) reduced immune function in humans, 3) suppression of host resistance measure(s) in laboratory animals or 4) suppression of func- tional immune assay(s) in laboratory animals. In general, PODs are developed from the most sensitive adverse immune end-point(s) from the most appropriate species (or the most sensi- tive mammalian species, in the absence of information to determine the most appropriate species). Data from general immune assays , haematology, histopathol ogy and immune organ weight changes may indicate pot ential immunotoxicity and are useful to support biological plausibility and potential MOAs for more predic tive data (e.g. data). Observational end-points such as lymphocyte prolif eration and altered soluble mediator (cyto- kines or complement) concentrations should generall y not be used to derive an effect level for immunosuppression, because they are not considered to be re liable predictors of adverse immunosuppression. Similarly, haemat ological changes should not be used as a critical effect for immunosuppression unless they are severe. Ma jor haematological changes are unlikely to below). Therefore, the risk assessor should cons ider available functiona l and host resistance data on related end-points when considering de riving an effect level from haematological data. Changes in immune organ weights and general histopathology may indicate potential immunotoxicity and can be used to support mo re predictive data (e.g. functional data); however, these data should not be used to derive an eff ect level for immunosuppression because of the low predictive value of these end-points when considered alone. 4.8.2 Biological relatedness of different outcomes 4.8.2.1 Diseases associated with specific types of immunosuppression in humans Whereas both infectious and neoplastic diseas es are associated w ith immunodeficiency, infectious disease incidence is often the focus of epidemiological studies, because changes in incidence are detectable over a shorter time span. The part icular microorganism responsible for an infection may assist in identifying the qualitative and quantitative nature of the immunodeficiency. For example, ex tracellular pathogens, such Haemophilus influenzae , multiply outside phagocytic cells disease they resist phagocytosis. Facultativ e intracellular pathogens (e.g. Mycobacterium but k illing. Thus, infections from extracellular or facultative intracellular organisms will be more frequent in individuals in which impaired POD(s) by the total uncertainty factor (see sections 3.3.7 and 4.9 for a detailed discussion of occur in the absence of a related change in immune function (see di scussion in section 4.8.2 Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 61phagocytic mechanisms exist, such as neutrope nia, or when humoral (i.e. antibody) deficien- cies are present. Obligate intracellular pat hogens, which include all viruses, cannot multiply unless they are within a host cell and are mo re commonly observed in individuals with defects in cellular (T cell) immunity. The importance of antibodies in controlling ex tracellular bacteria is sufficiently well known that a history of repeated infections with th ese organisms is a key diagnostic indicator of primary or acquired antibody deficiency in human s. The DTH response is used clinically to evaluate the potential to res pond to intracellular infections a nd has been used to determine immunocompetence in populations where exposure to environmen tal contaminants has been suggested. A variety of naturally occurring anti gens known to induce DTH (e.g. an extract of the fungus Candida or products of bacteria in the normal flora) to wh ich all adults have been exposed are used as test antig ens. Individuals who do not res pond to challenge are considered to be at greater risk for certain infections. Microbial agents associated w ith immunodeficiency disorders can also be classified into common, opportunistic or latent pathogens. Common pathogens , such as influenza viruses, occur in the general population at frequencies associated with their infectious nature (e.g. virulence, ease of transmission). The respiratory system is the most vulnerable target for most common pathogens, as it is directly exposed to the external environment and has a large surface area, 4 times the combined total surface areas of the gastrointestinal tract and skin (Patriarca, 1994). The low individual rates of co mmon infections in the general population (only one or two episodes in an individual per year), combined with under-reporting, make it difficult to detect changes in infection rates. It is of significant impact , however, as influenza results in 3-5 million serious illnesses and 250 000-500 000 deaths annually worldwide (WHO, 2009). While infections with common pathogens occu r routinely in the healthy population, oppor- tunistic infections typically occur in indivi duals with more severe immunosuppression, such as patients with AIDS, and cause disease in th e general population at very low incidences. The microorganisms in this group are commonly encountered in food, water, dust or soil and include certain protozoans, such as Toxoplasma gondii , which causes cerebral infections fungi Candida albicans and Pneumocystis carinii , and bacteria in the Mycobacterium avium complex (Morris & Potter, 1997). A third group of pathogenic microorganisms is re sponsible for latent infections. Cytomegalo- virus (EBV), all members of the herpes virus family, can remain in the tissue following primary infection for the duration of the host's life without causing disease. In he althy individuals, the immune system usually maintains viral latency, with cellular immun ity playing a major role. When the immune response is compromised, viral replication can en sue, and reactivation occurs and, in rare instances, causes severe complications, includi ng death. Preceding viral activation, a vigorous immune response to viral-specific antigens occurs in response to viral rep lication. Changes in virus-specific immune response or activation of latent viruses have been observed in individ- uals with secondary immunodeficiency disorders and, as will be discussed further, may reflect mild to moderate immunosuppression. Immunodeficiency is also associated with an increased incidence of certain virus-induced tumours, such as non-Hodgkin lymphomas and sk in tumours (Penn, 2000). In contrast to cancers of internal organs, such as the lung and liver, which are often induced by chemicalHarmonization Project Document No. 10 62Table 4.1: Host resistance and infections associated with antibody deficiency.

Source: Adapted from Stiehm et al. (1986) carcinogens, virus-induced cancers are consider ably more immunogenic and therefore more likely to be influenced by immunological fact ors. Examples of cancers that are common in immunosuppressed individuals include leukaemia and lymphoproliferative disorders as well as cancers of the skin, seen in transplant patie nts, Kaposi sarcoma and EBV-associated B cell lymphomas. 4.8.2.2 Diseases associated with specific types of immunosuppression in laboratory animals Reduction in NK cell activity has been shown to correlate with increased susceptibility to challenge with PYB6 sarcoma cells, B16F10 mela et al., 1988; Selgrade et al., 1992). Suppression of cel l-mediated immunity, complement deficiency and depressed macrophage and neutrophil function have all been associated with decreased resistance to Listeria monocytogenes (Petit, 1980; Luster et al., 1988; Bradley, 1995). The relationship between suppression of humoral immunity (antibody response) and infections as well as specific challeng e agents is illustrate d in Table 4.1. The rela tionship between suppres- sion of cell-mediated immunity (T cell-mediated response) and infections as well as specific Plasmodium yoelii and Trichinella spiralis has both a cellular and a humoral component, and increased infectivity has been shown followi ng depression of both arms of the immune system (Luebke, 1995; Van Loveren et al., 1995). Deletion or functional block of specific immune components is another method that has been used to examine this relationship. This can be achieved via targeted gene disruption resulting in animals deficient in speci fic cell populations (e.g. CD4+ T cell knockout), administration of agents that affect cells or mediators involved in host de fence (e.g. the use of gadoliniumchallenge agents is illustrated in Table 4.2.

Source: Adapted from Stiehm et al. (1986) chloride to block macrophage function) or th e functional depletion of specific cell popula- tions through the binding of m onoclonal antibodies to cell surfac e receptors. It should be noted, however, that multiple genes are usually involved in disease resistance (Hickman- Davis, 2001). Previous studies have suggested that alteration s in one or more lymphocyte subpopulations are predictive of changes in host resistance approximately 70% of the time, although no attempt was made to correlate changes in specific cell types with specific infec- tion models (Luster et al., 1993). Studies by W ilson et al. (2001) were specifically designed to determine the magnitude of NK cell suppression that would translate into altered resistance in three host resistan ce models. The studies were conducted by blocking NK cell activity with an antibody to the cell surface mo lecule Asialo GM1 using a treatment regimen that did not alter any other of the standa rd immune function tests used in the assessment of immuno- toxicity in rodents. These authors demonstrated that at low levels of tumour challenge, such as might occur spontaneously, NK cell activity would need to be suppressed approximately 50% or more before significant effects on resist ance to an NK cell-sensitive tumour would be observed. These studies also demo nstrated that the level of s uppression needed to alter host Harmonization Project Document No. 10 64resistance was related to the number of tumour ce lls in the challe nge. Conversely, studies that have used monoclonal antibodies to effectivel y deplete CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes from the peripheral blood have found lit tle evidence of alte red resistance to ch allenge with PYB6 sarcoma cells, a model that is thought to be dependent on cell-mediated immunity (Weaver et al., 2001). The lack of effects may be related to the fact that cell popu lations in secondary lymphoid tissues such as the spleen and lymph nodes were unaltered. Resistance to most common infections is mediat ed by multiple immune processes, and each effector mechanism may express differential sensitivity to a given toxicant. As individuals are typically exposed to a variety of chemical s, it may be difficult to predict the level of suppression for any one process required to increase the risk of disease. 4.8.3 Adversity and significance of mild to moderate immunosuppression One question that often arises in interpreting laboratory animal studies is, \"What degree of immune change constitutes a biologically significan t effect for either a specific test or group of tests?\" In one respect, this can be answered relatively simply, in that any statistically significant effect should be consid ered meaningful, provided the quality of the animal data is sufficient. This argument is based on the assumption that a linear relationship exists between loss of immune responsiveness and increased risk of developing disease. Although a linear relationship has never been defi nitively established and may neve r be, it is consistent with our understanding of immunological processes and is supported by both laboratory animal (e.g. Luster et al., 1993) and human studies (reviewed in Lu ster et al., 2005a) in which changes in immune tests correlated progressively with increased incidence of disease over a broad range. In contrast to laboratory animals, for which th e majority of data specific to the immune system will likely be quantitati ve evaluation of immune function, with disease resistance tests potentially included if immunosuppression is eviden ced, human data are more likely to be an enumeration of immune system components, such as class-specifi c serum immunoglobulin concentrations and immunophenotyping, or eval uation of burden of disease following expo- sures, such as infectious disease incidence. It should be emphasized that small and transient changes in the incidence of common infectious diseases in exposed populations would be the most likely outcome of a mild to moderate immunosuppression resulting from exposure to chemicals in the environment, although this is difficult to capture in retrospective epidemio- logical studies (see below). The clinical consequences of severe forms of immunosuppression, such as those that may occur in individuals with AIDS or primary (genetic) immunodeficiency diseases, are mani- fested as increased frequency or greater sever ity of certain types of cancers or infectious diseases. While these effects are profound, adverse effects that occur from mild to moderate immunosuppression, such as those associated with chronic stress, transpla nt therapies or even excessive exercise and that might occur in populations exposed to immunotoxic chemicals, are considerably more difficult to detect. The most comprehensive databases that address immunosuppression-adversity relati onships, specifically primar y immunodeficiency diseases and AIDS, are not included in these discussion s, as these represent severe examples of immunosuppression, and neith er the specific clinic al diseases that resu lt nor their eventual outcomes have much in common with those that occur in individuals w ith chronic mild to moderate immunosuppression. The issue of adve rse health effects and immunotoxicology has been a topic of several recent reviews (e.g. Kimber & Dearman, 2002; Luster et al., 2005a). Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 65To assist in assessing the hea lth impact of mild to modera te immunosuppression, some of the most likely adverse effects that may occur fr om chronic mild to moderate immunosuppres- sion associated with chronic stress, stem cell transplantation and organ transplantation are described below, as well as phys iological factors and study desi gn issues that can affect interpretation. Chronic psychological factors (i.e . stressors), such as separati on and divorce, caregiving for patients with Alzheimer disease or bereavem ent, produce low to moderate degrees of immunosuppression and increase infectious disease incidences (Cohen, 1995; Biondi & Zannino, 1997; Yang & Glaser, 2000; Kiecolt-Gla ser et al., 2002). This immunosuppressive response to stress has also been confirmed in a controlled infectious challenge study in humans (Cohen et al., 1991). Although usually c onducted in small cohorts, immune testing in other chronically stressed indivi duals has also provided insights into the relationship between mild to moderate immunosuppression and di sease (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1986, 1987). In one chronic stress population showing an increased rate of infec tions, specific cell populations were reduced below mean control values by 20-40%; however, as with a number of immunotoxicology studies, some changes were with in the range of norma l values reported by the authors. Associations have also been observed between chronic stress and reactivation of latent viruses, such as CMV, HSV-1 or EBV, as m easured by either recurrence of symptoms or elevations in specific antibody ti tre (Kasl et al., 1979; Glaser et al., 1987, 1993; Esterling et al., 1993; Cohen, 1995; Biondi & Zannino, 1997; Yang & Glas er, 2000). Elevations in antiviral antibody titre (i.e. seroc onversion), a reflection of vira l reactivation and replication, precede disease onset, although only a bout 20% of those with elevat ed titres actually develop clinical disease. Studies have also been conducted to examine associations between psycho- logical stress and the immune re sponse to vaccination for hepa titis B, influenza virus or pneumococcus (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1996, 2002). Haematopoietic stem cell transp lantation, which came into gene ral practice in the 1980s, is employed in the treatment of certain haematological malignancies, aplastic anaemia and inborn genetic errors of cells originating in haematopoietic stem cells. Following cell graft- ing, immunodeficiency can persist for well over a year due to pre-graftin g radiation treatment (Ochs et al., 1995). Thus, prospective studies can help identify qua ntitative relationships between immune function and disease as the immune system recovers. The incidence of infections in these patients can be high, with 80% of the patients de veloping an infection during the first 2 years post-e ngraftment and 50% of the pati ents having three or more infections. Opportunistic infections predominate, with fungi being the most common type of organism causing disease, followed by bacteria and viruses (Ochs et al., 1995; Atkinson, 2000). Incidence data for upper resp iratory tract infections are ge nerally unavailable for these patients, as these infections are seldom monitored in allo geneic bone marrow recipients. Although infections that occur in the first month following transp lant are most likely due to severe deficiencies in granulocytes, later infectio ns appear to be due to deficiencies in CD4+ T cells and B cells (Storek et al., 1997, 2000; Small et al., 1 999; Chakrabarti et al., 2001). Studies in renal organ transpla nt patients have provided insight s into the consequences of long-term (chronic) moderate immunosuppres sion. Although immunos uppressive therapies have greatly improved over the past 40 years, transplant patients are still predisposed to higher rates of malignancies (Jamil et al., 1999) and infections (Clark et al., 1993) compared with the normal population. Infection rates can range between 65% and 70% during the first 6 Harmonization Project Document No. 10 66months post-transplantation, with CMV repres enting anywhere from 18% to 67% of the reported infections (Sia & Paya, 1998). As a resu lt of the surgical procedure, urinary tract infections are commonly observed in all renal transplants, whereas severe bacterial infections (pneumonia and septicaemia) and systemic/invasi ve fungal infections were almost exclu- sively associated with the most immunosuppressed group. Wien eke et al. (1996) noted that reduced immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) subclass leve ls and CD4+ T cell c ounts were the best predictors for infections. Increased skin cancers have also been noted in patients on long-term immunosuppressive therapy. For example, the risk of developing sk in tumours following rena l transplantation is 10% after 10 years and 40% after 20 years, wher eas the incidence of squamous and basal cell carcinomas is 10-fold and 250-fold higher, respectively, than in the general population (Hartevelt et al., 1990). 4.8.4 Mode of action/mechanisms Information on the key events of the MOA can be used to evaluate human relevance and to help predict the types of adverse effect that mi ght be expected to occur. For example, reduced antibody production would be expected to reduce re sistance to infections caused by bacteria that live outside host cells, but not to those th at live inside host cells. Defects in cellular and molecular immune function may result from a variety of mechanisms, including develop- mental arrest, blockage of metabolic pathways synthesis tion, altered MHC expression, disrupted signal ling pathways, impaired DNA synthesis and lymphocyte proliferation, and/or failure of nor mal apoptotic mechanisms . It is important to note that a chemical can have more than one MOA. The MOA can also be used to evaluate the prob ability of a particular effect. For example, total suppression of haematopoiesis or antibo dy synthesis is unlikely to occur following exposure to chemicals not specif ically designed to target th e immune system or to block DNA or protein synthesis. Howeve r, if an immune defect occu rs in cells that cannot be replaced, such as long-term or short-term stem cells from the bone marrow, persistent immune effects may occur. In contrast, any immune effects caused by an exposure may be fully reversible if, for example, progenitor cells are left undisturbe d and the effects are focused exclusively on clonally expanding immune cells (i.e. post-antigen challenge). Thus, information about the MOA and potential key events may help predict the likelihood of persistence, even if the full MOA cannot be de termined. For example, alterations in stem cells would likely have long-term effects, comp ared with alterations limited to secondary lymphoid organs, such as the spleen or lymph node. 4.9 Dose-response relati onships and thresholds A dose-response relationship is a necessary criterion in demonstrating chemical immuno- suppression. The interpretation of dose-response data should identify doses associated with the adverse effect (immunosuppressi on), as well as doses associat ed with no adverse effects, to determine the most appropriate end-point(s) or critical effect(s). The critical effect or effects are then used for the development of POD(s) from which health-based guidance values or reference values (ADI/TDI or RfD/Rf C) can be calculated by dividing the POD(s) by the total uncertainty factor, using either defa ult uncertainty factors or CSAFs. The process for determining and evaluating the dose-response relationship for immunotoxicity data is presented in section 3.3.7 of chapter 3 and should be consulted for a more detailed discussion. Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 67The dose-response functions for chemical -induced immunosuppression are generally assumed to be non-linear1 and to demonstrate a threshold dose below which effects on immu- nosuppression would not be expected. Additiona lly, based upon our current understanding of immune processes in humans and available hu man study data (reviewed in Luster et al., 2005a), one would most likely assu me that a linear relationshi p exists between the loss of immune function and increased disease incide nce. The immunotoxicology literature contains examples of non-linear and biphasic dose-resp onse curves across the spectrum of immuno- logical measures, such as lymphocyte prolif eration, antibody production, phagocytosis, DTH and host resistance assays. The assumption of a threshold dose as the POD for risk assess- ment is supported by the available data fo r these types of immunosuppression-related end- points. In contrast, there are some examples, such as corticosterone-associat ed immunosuppression, for which linear dose-response curves have been demonstrated for the same end-points. For example, Pruett and colleagues (Pruett et al., 1999, 2000; Pruett & Fan, 2001) generated linearly proportional models for measures of immunosuppre ssion (e.g. NK cell activity, lymphocyte subpopulations in the spleen and thymus, MHC class II expression and antibody response to the T cell-dependent antigen KLH) re sulting from exposure to increased levels of either exogenous or endogenous (from restrain t stress) corticostero ne using the AUC for corticosterone as the dose metric. Pruett et al . (2003) also found that the corticosterone AUC was an appropriate metric for some measures , such as the antibody response to KLH, for chemicals known to induce a stress response (e.g. ethanol a nd atrazine) and that the magnitude of the effect was again linearly prop ortional to the corticosterone AUC (Pruett et al., 2003). 4.10 Groups at risk (developing immune system, elderly, immunocompromised) Age-related physiological differences and immatu rity of the immune system are both likely to play a role in increased suscep tibility associated with the de veloping immune system. It has been demonstrated that for some chemicals, th e immature immune system is more susceptible to chemicals than the fully mature system, and sequelae of developmental immunotoxicant exposure may be more persistent , in contrast to effects observed following adult exposure, which generally occur at higher doses and are expected to resolve s oon after exposure ends (Holladay & Smialowicz, 2000; Dietert & Dieter t, 2007). Based on re sults obtained in various experimental animal studies, perturbatio ns of the developing immune system may be manifested as a qualitative (i.e. affecting only the developing immune system) or a quanti- further discussion). Following developmental ex posure, immune maturation may simply be delayed and may recover to normal adult levels over time, or, if expos ure interferes with a critical step in the maturational process, life long defects in immune function may follow (e.g. DES: Kalland & Forsberg, 1980; Kalland, 1984). The steps involved in human and rodent immune system maturation appear to be remark ably similar, but occur at different develop- mental stages, and no compelling evidence exists to suggest that effects observed in rodents are not representative of what might be expected to occur in humans. Thus, effects of rodent 1 The term \"non-linear\" is used here in a more narrow sense than its usual meaning in the field of mathematical modelling. In this guidance document, the term non-linear refers to threshold models (which show no response over a range of low doses that include zero) and some non-threshold models (e.g. a quadratic model, which shows some response at all doses above zero). In th is guidance document, a non-linear model is one whose slope is zero at (and perhaps above) a dose of zero. tative (i.e. lower doses affect the developi ng immune system) difference (see chapter 2 for Harmonization Project Document No. 10 68exposure shortly after birth are likely to refl ect what may happen in humans exposed during late gestation, assuming that the chemical cro sses the placenta. This concept was reviewed in detail by Holladay & Smialowicz (2000) and by Holsapple (2003). Several studies have shown increased rates of certain infections in children following peri- natal exposure to environmental agents (Lus ter et al., 2005b). For example, Weisglas- Kuperus et al. (2000) demonstr ated that exposure to levels of polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons normally found in highly industrialized countries is a ssociated with increases in childhood infections and lower vaccination respon ses. Likewise, Karmaus et al. (2001) found that children with elevated levels of the dichlorodiphenyltrichloroe thane (DDT) hexachlorobenzene (HCB) had more cases of inner ear infection than e xpected. Higher burdens of DDE alone increased the odds ratio (OR) for the development of asthma and elevated IgE levels. Limited human immune function data are avai lable from offspring of wome n taking therapeutic doses of immunosuppressants during pregnancy, although ma ternal use of azathioprine (Price et al., 1976) or cyclosporin A (Tendron et al., 2002) during gestation ha s been reported to suppress immune function in human infants up to 1 year of age. The elderly may also be at increased risk for immunosuppression, and, as described in EHC 144, the elderly represent an acknowledged se nsitive population because of age-related changes in immune function (IPCS, 1993). Typi cally, immune system function decreases with the advancement of age (reviewed in Miller, 1996; Aw et al., 2007). The thymus contin- ues a post-puberty process of at rophy, in which cellular compone nts are replaced by adipose tissue, and the production of thymic hormone s ceases by about 40 years of age (USEPA, 2005c). Altered immune system responses have b een attributed to altered intracellular signal- ling in macrophages and neutrophils and decreased stimula- tion of T and B cells by dendritic cells (Plack ett et al., 2004). The presentation of IL-10, IL- 12 and antigen by dendritic cells may also be a ltered (Uyemura et al., 2002). Other immune system functions that are often impaired in th e elderly are the ability of T lymphocytes to increase in number in response to an an tigen and the amount of antibody secreted by B lymphocytes. Owing to this normal process of i mmune system senescence, the elderly exhibit a poor vaccine response and are often more su sceptible to infectious diseases, such as pneumonias, urinary tract infections or tuberculosis, and th e responses to th ese diseases may be more severe in the elderly than in young, healthy adults (Kumar & Burns, 2008). Like-wise, responses in the elderly to microbial c ontaminants in the environment may be differen- tially severe (USEPA, 2007). Addi tionally, the incidence of cancer increases with age in both humans and laboratory animals, suggesting that there is a correlation between immuno- senescence and higher incidences of some cancers (Cohen, 1994; Anisimov, 2007). Enhanced susceptibility may also be a functi on of genetic disposition (i.e. genetic poly- morphisms at the individual or population leve l), disease state (e.g. AIDS) or pharmaceutical intervention (e.g. organ transp lant therapy). Sex differences in response to immunotoxic agents are not uncommon, either in laboratory anim al studies or in epidemiological studies. 4.11 Acute versus chronic exposure Developmental exposure to an immunotoxicant may result in qua ntitatively and qualitatively different immunosuppression compared with exposur e at other life stages (see discussion in immunosuppression after an acute or short-term exposure. Fo r example, a single injection of chapter 2 and section 3.3.3.2(d) of chapter 3) and may result in long-lasting or permanent Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 69TCDD at 1 mg/kg body weight suppressed the antibody response to th e T cell-independent antigen trinitrophenyl (TNP)-LPS in mice tional, juven ile) exposure to TCDD resulted in immunosuppression in rats, which lasted for 19 months (Smialowicz, 2002) . Although there are no testing guidelines in widespread use that are designed to evaluate acute or developmental immunotoxicity at this time, the use of less-than-lifetime risk estimat es may be appropriate for chemicals with a sufficient database demonstrating developmen tal immunotoxicity. Some authors have sug- gested replacing adult exposure assessment for i mmune evaluation with pr otocols to evaluate the developing immune system (Dietert & Piepenbrink, 2006b). 4.12 Uncertainty factors Considerations in the applicati on of uncertainty factors for i mmunotoxicity data are presented interspecies, database) as well as uncertain ty factors addressing subchronic to chronic extrapolation and LOAEL to NOAEL extrapolati on, as determined by the scope of the risk assessment and the data used for the POD, shou ld be used to derive health-based guidance values for immunosuppression. Considerations in th e application of intraspecies, interspecies and database uncertainty factors for imm unosuppression data are described below. 4.12.1 Intraspecies uncertainty factor In the absence of information on the potential variab ility in susceptibil ity among the general population to the particular type of immunosupp ression considered for a POD, a default intra- species uncertainty factor of 10 is recomme nded, similar to that recommended for other non- cancer end-points. This uncertain ty factor is used to addre ss the variability in responses (in utero and postnatal exposure or children) and the elderly may be at greater risk for immunosuppression. Susceptibility may also be a function of genetic polymorphisms, as has been demonstrated for the response to vaccina tion (e.g. Hennig et al., 2008; Ovsyannikova et al., 2008). The risk assessor should consider a re duction in the intraspecies uncertainty factor if data for the POD are derived from the most sensitive subpopulation of humans. 4.12.2 Interspecies uncertainty factor When PODs for immunosuppression are derived from human data, no interspecies uncer- tainty factor is required, and it is set to 1. Ho wever, the availability of dose-response data in humans is generally limited, a nd therefore the extrapolation of laboratory animal data to humans is often necessary. Similar to the situ ation for other non-cancer end-points, a default interspecies uncertainty factor of 10 is reco mmended to extrapolate from laboratory animal species to humans when laboratory animal data are used to derive PODs for immunosuppres- sion. Available data sup port this approach, because immuno suppression data from experi- mental animals are generally good predictors for subsequent clinical data or epidemiological studies. 4.12.3 Database uncertainty factor Examination of the extent of the database, the qu ality of individual studies and data gaps will assist the weight of evidence determination of database sufficienc y. The database for a chemical may not contain any toxicity st udies specifically designed to determine in detail in chapter 3 (section 3.3.10). All of the standard uncertainty factors (intraspecies, among humans and protect sensitive subpopula tions. As discussed in section 4.10, the young Harmonization Project Document No. 10 70immunotoxicity. Nevertheless, risk assessors determine which of the available data may provide information on immunosuppression. In so me cases, a limited data set may suggest the possibility of immunosuppressi on without appropriate data to make a determination of immunosuppression risk or perf orm a dose-response assessment. In such cases, the risk assessor should consider the use of the database uncertainty factor to indicate that the lack of terize the immunosuppression hazard. In addition, the risk assessor may be in the position of requesting additional data. A related discussion of \"triggers\" and the need for additional data 4.13 Exposure assessment Exposure assessments are used to obtain an es timate of human exposure in order to help quantify the risk to a populat ion. Specific guidelines on expo sure assessment (e.g. USEPA, 1992) and guidance specific to assessing the ex posure of children (e.g. USEPA, 2005a; IPCS, chapter 3 should be consulted for general cons iderations important for exposure assessment for immunotoxicity, including co ntributions of dose and timing of exposure to the severity and persistence of effects, susceptibility base d on timing of exposure, the importance of route of exposure for localized as we ll as systemic immune effects, and toxicokinetic factors of exposure that influence the immunotoxicity outcome(s). 4.13.1 Exposure-related effects on severity and persistence For immunosuppression, the magnitude of the a dverse effect (e.g. inf ectious disease inci- dence) will be proportional to the severity of immune system damage as well as the length of time the effect remains (persistence). In biologic al terms, this can be summarized as follows: the adverse health outcome is proportional to both the severity and persistence of the immune effect. Thus, the contribution of exposure to the severity of outcome may need to be consid- ered only if sufficient biological da ta are available indicating that the effect is persistent. This would be expected, for example, if the injury oc curs in cells that cannot be replaced, such as long-term or short-term stem cells from the bone marrow, memory cells are left undisturbed and tolerance is not indu ced. In contrast, an a ssumption can be made th at any immune effects caused by an exposure are fully reversible under most conditions, if, for example, progenitor cells are left undisturbed a nd the effects are focused ex clusively on clonally expanding immune cells (i.e. post-antigen challenge). The timing of exposure to pathogens relative to the period of immunosuppression is also critical. Obviously, the outcome from exposure to influenza virus or a neoplastic cell could be very different if exposure to the pathogen o ccurs while the individual is immunosuppressed as opposed to exposure after recovery from immunosuppression. Pe rsistence of immuno- suppression following chemical exposure would resu lt in a larger window of vulnerability to pathogens; however, short-term suppression may stil l have long-term effects. For example, if an individual who is immunosuppressed for only a few days as a result of chemical exposure also receives a vaccine (e.g. the influenza vacc ine) while suppressed, the effect may be less than adequate response to vaccination and ultima tely lead to being infected with influenza virus months after recovering from the chemi cal immunosuppression. Ther efore, the issue of persistence and reversibility ma y be affected by the types of immune challenges that the organism faces during the period of s uppression (either short or long term). of chapter 3 for a detailed discussion of the us e of the database uncerta inty factor to charac-information on this end-point may be signifi cant. The reader should consult section 3.3.10.5 to determine immunotoxicity hazard is presented in secti on 3.3.6.3 of chapter 3. 2006b) have been published separately and will not be discussed here. Section 3.3.11 of Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 71The issue of persistence versus reversibility may also be complicated by the dose or duration of the chemical exposure. For example, many an tiproliferative agents used in cancer chemo- therapy temporarily reduce the ability of immuno competent cells to respond to antigen at low doses, whereas at high doses or for longer treatment periods, they may have a greater per- sistence of effects. This could result in either a delay in recovery, to allow sufficient time for the stem cell repopulation, or immune failure, in which the stem cells or stromal cell microenvironment is irreversibly damaged. Thus, the final outcome will depend upon the dose and duration of exposure, as well as the specific target within the microenvironment (e.g. stromal cells versus long-term stem cells ve rsus short-term stem ce lls). For agents that bioaccumulate, increasing duration of exposure may also increase the extent of damage to the stem cell microenvironment. In some instances , a delayed effect on the immune system may result. This may occur if memory cells or ci rculating immunocompetent cells are affected, although this would be an unlikely occurrence. Exposure in host resistance models used to assay immunosuppression is complicated by the dose and biology of the challenge agent as well as the dose of the chemical immunosuppres- sant. In laboratory studies, higher doses of pathogen and gr eater virulence are generally associated with increased severity of the outcome, including clinical score or mortality (Cohen, 2007). Although an effectiv e immune response may be elic ited, at higher doses, the associated disease can overwhelm the host. For example, a wide range of challenge doses of influenza virus resulted in similar influenza-sp ecific antibody titres in mice; however, larger doses were associated with increased wei ght loss and mortality (Powell et al., 2006). 4.13.2 Exposure timing and susceptibility Another consideration regarding exposure assess ments for immunotoxicity is the life stage at which exposure occurs. It is generally believed that the imma ture immune system is more susceptible than the fully mature system to chemicals and that sequelae of developmental immunotoxicant exposure may be particularly pe rsistent, in contrast to effects observed following adult exposure, which generally occur at higher doses and are expected to resolve soon after exposure ends (see review by Holladay & Smialowicz, 2000). Luebke et al. (2006a) recently reviewed adult and developmen tal animal data and, where available, human data on five diverse immunot oxic compounds for age-dependent differences. The chemicals reviewed included DES, diazepam, lead, TCDD and tributyltin oxide. For all five chemicals, the developing immune system was found to be at greater risk than that of the adult, because either lower doses caused immunotoxicity or a dverse effects were more persistent, or both. When comparing doses that adversely affect the developing and adult immune systems, it is important to bear in mind that offspring may be exposed during pregnancy to only a fraction of the maternal dose, even though the maternal dos e is typically referred to in the literature. The review by Luebke et al. (2006a) concluded that the exclusive use of adult animals in immunotoxicological studies is likely to undere stimate the risk of exposure to chemicals during development and maturation of the imm une system. These general conclusions are also presumed to pertain to humans, as th e developmental processes between rodents and humans are relatively similar, except that immune maturation proceeds more slowly in rodents than in humans (Holladay & Smialo wicz, 2000; Landreth, 2002 ; Holsapple, 2003). Certain types of infectious diseases are more common in the elderly than in neonates or young adults owing to age-relate d loss of immune responsivene ss (i.e. immunosenescence). In the simplest terms, the very young lack immu nological experien ce, and the elderly, in spite of a wealth of experience, are no longer ab le to respond as well as the younger population. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 72There are no data to support the hypothesis that the immune system of the elderly is uniquely susceptible to immunotoxic agents. However, as a result of immunosenescence, a moderate loss of immune function may have more significan t adverse effects in the elderly than in the young adult. An exposure assessment should char acterize the likelihood of exposure of at least three general age groups \u2014prenatal, young adult and elde rly\u2014and factor the suscep- tibility of the groups into the risk assessment to the extent possible. 4.14 Risk characterization in terms of reduced resistance to infections or tumours Risk characterization is a synthesi s of estimates of exposure levels and health risk s. It is the summary and integration portion of the risk assessment process in which the hazard characterization, quantitative dose-response and exposure asse ssment are combined, along with a critical appraisal of the toxicity information. The critical evaluation contains a review of the overall quality of the assessment, in cluding a discussion of uncertainties and a valuation of confidence in the conclusions. In addition to the thorough appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses of the assessment, ri sk characterization also includes a section describing risk in terms of the nature and exte nt of harm. Additionally, to the extent permitted by the available data, risk characterization in dicates how risk varies with exposure and provides information to help risk managers eval uate a range of options. Ideally, a quantitative risk assessment is performed. Wh ere the available data do not allow for this, a qualitative risk assessment may be possible. A risk assessment for lead is used as a case-s tudy to illustrate the ap plication of the above guidance on immunosuppression risk assessment (see Case-study 1). 73 5. ASSESSMENT OF IMMUNOSTIMULATION 5.1 Introduction Destruction of infectious agents and certain types of neoplasia requires activation and stimulation of the immune system, resulting in the release of potent cytokines, cellular proliferation and differentiation and multifunctional mediator release. Multiple feedback systems, including signals produced by cells of the immune, endocrine and central nervous systems, promote immune system homeost asis by balancing upr egulatory and down- regulatory signals to minimize collateral tissue damage in the course of normal immune responses or clonal expansion of cells that inappropriately recogni ze and respond to host proteins. Failure to control the intensity and duration of normally protective immune responses is a well-documente d cause of immune-mediated tissue damage. Nevertheless, deliberate artificial stimulation of the immune system is a routine and mostly beneficial clinical procedure. For example, chemical and/ or biological adjuvant s are routinely included in vaccines to increase and prolong the immune response a nd to improve the response to weak antigens; successful induction of prot ective immunity is often dependent on their activity. Adverse effects associated with stimulation of the immune system by a xenobiotic include inappropriate stimulation or skewing of normally protective immune responses, direct allergenicity of the xenobiotic, induction or worsening of autoimmune disease and non- specific inflammation. Inappropriate stimulatio n of normally protective responses to infec- tious agents may increase in flammation, resulting in excess tissue damage or potentially exposing cryptic host antigens, one possible pathway to autoimmune disease. Skewing of the immune response to favour either inflammation or allergy can also occur; some studies have linked such changes with an increased risk of developing allergies and reduced resistance to certain infectious agents. Xenobiotics may act as complete allergen s to induce allergic disease or may bind to host pr oteins, forming a complex that induces allergy or altering host proteins sufficiently that they are no longer recognized as \"self\", resulting in autoimmune respectively. Inflammation is a normal component of tissue injury associated with toxicant exposure, although this type of injury is genera lly considered in the context of specific organ system toxicity and will not be addressed in th is chapter. The possibility also exists that a chemical may act as a superantigen or cause a \"cytokine storm\", which can occur when cyto- kines, monoclonal antibodies to functional immune system epit opes or potent immune system regulators are given therapeutica lly. However, it is unlikely that this will be observed with chemicals (reviewed by Ponce, 2008). This chapter will examine the evidence to s upport the hypothesis that unintended stimulation of either the innate or adaptive immune respon se should be considered as an adverse effect and taken into account in a weight of ev idence approach to risk assessment. 5.2 Hazard identification Immunotoxicity testing for hazard identificati on, exclusive of hypersensitivity and auto- assays used to detect immunosuppression have in stead indicated respons es at greater than control group values following exposure to certa in pesticides, drugs and other chemicals of environmental concern. Although there is signifi cant concordance between suppression of the disease. Allergy and autoimmune disease are co vered in chapters 6 and 7 of this document, immunity, has focused on suppression of immune function (see chapter 4). In some cases, Harmonization Project Document No. 10 74IgM response and increased suscepti bility to infectious disease, it is unkn own whether similar concordance exists between increased IgM respon ses and adverse outcomes. The same is true for other commonly assessed functional end-poi nts (e.g. DTH or NK cell activity), although more data may be available for the primary antibody response simply because extant immu- notoxicity testing guidelines re quire evaluating the primary humo ral response, but not tests of cellular or innate function. Many immunotoxicol ogists consider unintended immune system stimulation to be a noteworthy finding, but one that may be difficult to characterize or unam- biguously define as adverse, because assays currently used to screen for potential immuno- suppression, allergy or autoimmunity may or may not be the most appropriate methods to detect immunostimulation. 5.3 Hazard characterization Regulatory acknowledgement of un intended immune system stimulation as an adverse effect is limited. However, the USFDA Immunotoxici ty Testing Guidance tion, immunogenicity and adjuva nt activity as potentially adverse effects. According to the USFDA documen t, \"Change in an imm une function or level of immunological mediator may not necessarily a ppear as an 'adverse e ffect', but rather as immunostimulation. Caution must be exercised in such cases, because a non-specific en- hancement of the immune response that might be interpreted as a beneficial effect may result in suppression of specific immunity against a pa rticular infection.\" The USFDA also states that unintended stimulation may result in autoimmunity, hypersensitivity and chronic inflammation, but does not offer guidance on the be st practices for interpretation of stimula- tion. Allergy, hypersensitivity, inflammation and auto immunity are clearly adverse. However, it can be argued that increased antibody producti on in response to immunization should not be interpreted as adverse per se, because current va ccination protocols typically rely on chemical adjuvants that stimulate antibody production. E xposure to xenobiotics that elevate antibody synthesis has been associated with increased production of autoantibodies or worsening of disease in autoimmune disease-prone animal m odels. These data suggest that adverse effects may occur in individuals with genotypes that are associated with aller gy or autoimmunity, but tell us little about the level of risk that the general population will experi ence. As such, identi- fication of elevated humoral responses in gr oups of experimental an imals immunized during tier testing for immunotoxicity should not be ig nored, as elevated resp onses are a clear indi- cation that modulation of the immune system ha s occurred. Furthermore, as discussed in the point may be accompanied by suppression of other immune functions that mediate host resistance. Identification of unexpected stimul ated immune function may therefore depend on which assays were used for hazard identificatio n. The final decision on how to interpret the data is a policy decision. The regulatory mandate and the ability of the risk assessor to ask for additional testing will determine how, or if, additional testing will be pursued. Because inflammation is a normal response to toxi city, the possibility ex ists that toxic expo- sures can synergistic ally or additively increase inflammato ry responses to infectious or aller- gen challenge. In animal models , several types of chemical ex posure, most notably to dioxin, have been shown to increase pulmonary damage caused by the immune response to influenza infection. Similarly, exposure to air pollutant s has been shown to exacerbate respiratory responses to allergen challeng e in rodent and human studies, and air pollutants act as adju- vants to promote allergic sensitization. examples provided in section 5.5 below, it is clear that upregulation of one functional end-Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 755.4 Clinical and ep idemiological data Human data may be the most appealing as a ba sis for risk assessment, although care must be taken when interpreting these data. Issues criti cal to interpreting clinical and epidemiological suggest that moderate stimulation of the im mune system by adjuvants commonly used in vaccines or dietary supplements taken to \"boost\" the immune system is not associated with immune-mediated disease in the general popula tion. However, individuals with pre-existing autoimmune disease may constitute a suscep tible subpopulation in which activation of the immune system may have adverse effects. For example, the use of herbal supplements has been temporally associated with flare-up of pemphigus vulgaris in tw o patients and with the onset and later flare-up of dermatomyositis in another (Lee & Werth, 2004). Nevertheless, human studies suggest that routine vaccination against influenza and pneumonia is safe and effective in patients with various systemic au toimmune diseases, in spite of previously ex- pressed concerns that immune system activation by components of the vaccine may activate or worsen systemic autoimmune disease (e .g. Elkayam et al., 2007; Holvast et al., 2007; Gl\u00fcck & M\u00fcller-Ladner, 2008). In contrast, unintentional stimulation of hu man immune function by chemical exposure may have an adverse outcome. For example, occupati onal exposure to silica, reported to have an adjuvant-like effect on cells of the innate immu ne system, is associated with development of human autoimmune disease (Parks et al., 1999) . The heavy metal merc ury has been reported to polarize the response of stimulated human lymphocytes towards the Th2 phenotype by increasing production of IL-4 and IL-10, sugge sting that mercury ma y upregulate ongoing immune responses (Hemdan et al., 2007). Unintended upregulation of human antibody pro- duction by mercury is suggested by a study in which removal of dental amalgam from individuals with autoimmune thyroiditis a nd mercury hypersensitivity was determined to reduce autoantibodies to thyroglobulin and thyr oid peroxidase (Sterz l et al., 2006). Lead exposure also increases Th2 cytokine producti on and has been associated with increased human IgE synthesis, although co nflicting results have been reported for other antibody classes (Dietert & Piepenbrink, 2006a). Disruption of immune system balance by suppressi on of certain immune f unctions can lead to stimulation of other immune functions. For ex ample, suppression of Th 1 cells could increase stimulated responses, particularly against self-peptides. Hence, it is possible to enhance the risk of both infectious and alle rgic disease at the same time, an outcome that is supported by human data. For example, in ut ero exposure to cigarette smoke has been strongly associated with increased risk of developing asthma (Jaakkola & Gissler, 2004; Ng & Zelikoff, 2007), yet laboratory animal data demonstrated that such exposures increased susceptibility to tumour challenge in association with persistent suppression of cytotoxic T cell activity (Ng et al., 2006). Similarly, Soto-Pe\u00f1a et al. (2006) demonstrated that proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to PHA was significantly decreased in association with an increase in arsenic concentration in ur ine of children 6-10 years of age exposed chron- ically to arsenic. This same study demonstrat ed a tendency towards increased incidence of allergies and asthma among indi viduals with urinary arsenic concentrations higher than 50 \u00b5g/l. However, exposure to PCBs was associat ed with less shortne ss of breath and wheeze (Weisglas-Kuperus et al., 2000), whereas im munosuppression and increased infection were observed in similarly expos ed populations (Dallaire et al., 2006; Heil mann et al., 2006). Thus, chemical immunosuppressant s may or may not be associat ed with allerg ic risk. The Th2 responses (see chapter 4), and reduced re gulatory T cell function may also result in data are presented in sections 3.3.2.1 and 3.3.2.2 of chapter 3, respectiv ely. Clinical data Harmonization Project Document No. 10 76best evidence that environmental exposures may in crease the risk of allergic disease is found in the air pollution literature. In addition to the tobacco smoke example above, several pros- pective studies support a modest increase in risk for asthma from other air pollutants, including oxidant gases and di esel exhaust particles (reviewed by Gilmour et al., 2006). In aggregate, the human litera ture suggests that inadverten t stimulation of the immune response may have adverse effects. However, in almost all cases, there appears to be a genetic component associated w ith adverse effects, suggesting that adverse effects are most 5.5 Laboratory animal data Animal data will constitute the bulk of inform ation available to the risk assessor, originating in response to a regulatory mandate or publis hed in the peer-reviewed immunotoxicity literature. Many factors may influence the ou tcome of published studi es, including sex, species and strain, route and dur ation of exposure, and age at initial exposure. Understanding how these factors influence immune system homeos tasis and toxicity is critical; the reader is Immunotoxicity studies have cons istently determined that e xposure to various classes of xenobiotics (heavy metals, pestic ides endocrine disruptors ) and drugs is asso- ciated with increased or st imulated immune function, part icularly the T cell-dependent antibody response. In many cases, these same compounds were determined to hasten the onset or enhance the severity of autoimmune disease in genetically susceptible models. Well-characterized methods for testing chemical exposure for adjuvant-type effects in rodent models are not currently availa ble; however, animal studies have shown that exposure to a variety of air pollutants stimulat es sensitization to common allergens, such as dust mites or ovalbumin (Gilmour et al., 2000; Steerenberg et al., 2005). Recent mechanistic studies have defined the prominent role of inflammation a nd oxidative stress in the proallergic immuno- logical effects of particul ate and gaseous pollutants (reviewed by Riedl, 2008). 5.5.1 Vaccination Animal studies have evaluated the effects of vaccination on various autoimmune diseases. For example, repeated immunization with a commercial conjugated Haemophilus influenzae B vaccine was reported to cause a secondary IgA nephropathy in outbred mice (Kavuk\u00e7u et al., 1997). In contrast, plasmid DN A vaccines caused a transient in crease in circulating anti- DNA levels in BALB/c mice, but did not cause autoimmune disease (Mor et al., 1997). These results suggest that under some conditions, vaccination alone may be associated with at least transient signs of autoimmunity, if not auto immune disease. Combining vaccination with exposure to an immunotoxicant, Ravel et al. (2 004) found that repeated vaccination of mice concurrent with exposure to methylmercury in creased serum IgG con centration, although the authors suggested that interpretation of the results was difficult because of the \"extreme experimental conditions of this study\". Direct comparison of the limited rodent data with human data is difficult, because most human studies evaluated the potentially exacerbating effects of vaccination in patients who were receiving immunosuppressive therapy to treat symptoms of their disease; in most studies, patients typicall y made a more modest response to immunization than disease-fr ee and drug-free normal controls , although titres were gener- ally judged to be protective. likely in sensitive individuals, rather than the general population (see section 5.9 below). referred to section 3.3.3.2 of chap ter 3 for a detailed discussion. Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 775.5.2 Heavy metals Exposure to heavy metals has been reported to increase serum imm unoglobulin levels and antibody responses to T cell-dependent and T ce ll-independent antigens and worsening of autoimmune disease in genetic ally prone strains of rodents. For example, mercury(II) chloride injected subcutaneously (1 mg/kg body weight, 3 times per week) has been reported to increase the concen tration of all serum immunoglobulin isotypes af ter 2 and 3 weeks of exposure; however, even with continued e xposure, serum immunoglobu lin concentrations returned to control leve ls by 6 weeks (Pelletier et al., 1988 ). Similar doses caused transient increases in antibodies to the T cell-independe nt antigen, TNP-bovine serum albumin, and to the T cell-dependent antigen, sh eep erythrocytes, and induced autoimmune kidney disease in Brown Norway, but not in Lewis, rats (Hirsch et al., 1982). Cytokine production is skewed in favour of antibody production in Brown Norway rats; autoimmune kidne y disease in this strain is antibody dependent. Lewis rats, in co ntrast, are biased towards Th1 (proinflamma- tory) cytokine production and are prone to deve loping inflammatory dis ease due to defective hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ax is control of inflammation (S ternberg et al., 1989). Like- wise, drinking-water containi ng lead at a concentration of 2072 mg/l for 10 weeks was reported to increase the antibody response to sheep red blood ce lls (SRBCs) in BALB/c mice (Mudzinski et al., 1986). Lead expo sure was also associated w ith worsening of autoimmune disease in a genetically prone mouse model of lupus, but it did not induce disease in resistant strains of mice (Hudson et al ., 2003). In contrast to enhanced humoral immune responses, other host-protective functions ma y be suppressed by heavy meta ls, including re sistance to infection with the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Kishikawa et al., 1997). Furthermore, survival was decreased and body burdens of the ex tracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were increased in mice challenged with the organism after drinking water containing lead at a concentration of 2072 mg/l for 16 weeks (Al-Ramadi et al., 2006). Dietert & Piepenbrink (2006a) reviewed the evidence that lead exposure may stimulate inflammatory responses. Increased production of the proinflammatory cytokines tumour mented, as has production of reactive oxygen intermediates (in laboratory animals and children) by macrophages and neutrophils an d increased eosinophil de granulation, all of which may lead to tissue damage. Cadmium exposure has also been associated with increased IgM and IgG class antibody responses to sheep erythrocytes following a single exposure (Koller et al., 1976) or after short-term (3-4 weeks) or long-term (9-11 weeks) exposure to 50 or 200 mg/l in the drinking-water (Malav\u00e9 & de Ruffino, 1984). In the latter st udy, long-term exposure to 300 mg/l suppressed the humoral response, suggesting that a dose threshold may exist for stimu- lation and that higher doses may lead to suppression. Furthermore, although recognition and proliferation in responses to allogeneic anti gens were suppressed by subcutaneous injection of cadmium at doses of 0.11-1 mg/kg body weight for 5 days, the total numbers of splenic B cells producing IgM and IgG we re increased (Hurtenbach et al., 1988). The increase in numbers of total spleen cells and both splenic T and B ce lls was also found in outbred ICR mice that drank water containing cadmium at 3, 30 or 300 mg/l for 10 weeks (Ohsawa et al., 1983). Moreover, Ohsawa et al. (1988) reported an tinuclear antibodies (IgG class) in outbred ICR mice that drank water containing cadmium at 3, 30 or 300 mg/l for 10 weeks and increased numbers of spleen cells producing an tibody that reacted with SRBCs in mice that had not been immunized. In contrast, the high est concentration of cadmium suppressed the Harmonization Project Document No. 10 78PFC response in immunized animals exposed to cadmium at 300 mg/l, but not at the lower doses. Unfortunately, nonspecific stimulation of antibodies that react with SRBCs has not been investigated following exposure to othe r chemicals that increase the antibody response to SRBCs. Such studies would help to determ ine whether this is a common finding and the extent to which this unexpected response may contribute to overall titres to SRBCs in exposed immunized animals. Cell-mediated imm unity (DTH) was not affected. In contrast, antinuclear antibodies were detect ed only at the highest dose in inbred (BALB/c) mice. In a separate study, no effect s on the antibody res ponse to SRBCs or resi stance to infection (survival rate) were detected in B6C3F1 mice exposed to cadmium at concentrations of 10, 50 or 200 mg/l in drinking-water for 90 days (Thomas et al., 1985). Furthermore, in auto-immune-prone mice (NZB/NZW, a model of s pontaneous lupus nephritis), cadmium at 10 mg/l in drinking-water exacerbate d immune complex deposition in the kidney and proteinuria after 4 weeks of exposure (Leffe l et al., 2003). Compared across studies, these results reflect the importance of host genotype in susceptibility to modulation of the immune response by cadmium. 5.5.3 Pesticides Rodgers et al. (1986) reported that a single high-dose (50% of the median lethal dose [LD 50]) exposure to the insecticide ma lathion increased the number of C57BL/6 mouse spleen cells that made IgM antibody when cultured with SR BCs 5 days, but not 1 day, after in vivo expo- sure. Changes in body and spleen weights, sple nic cellularity and ev idence of cholinergic activity were not detected at this dose. Spl een cell proliferation in response to the T cell mitogen concanavalin A or the B cell mitoge n LPS was increased. Acute exposure did not affect body or thymus weights, splenic cellularity, generation of cytotoxic T cells or cholinesterase activity. E xposure to 10% of the LD 50 for 14 days was without effect. An MOA study subsequently determined that mast cel ls have a central role in malathion-induced enhanced antibody synthesis (Rodgers et al., 1996 ). A later study (Rodgers, 1997) determined that oral exposure to malathion (33-300 mg /kg body weight per week, beginning at 6 weeks of age) accelerated the onset of autoimmune disease and increased autoantibody production in autoimmune disease-prone mice (MRL-lpr , a model of spontaneous systemic lupus erythematosus), but not in c ongenic resistant mice (MRL+/+). Studies in another laboratory corroborated malathion stimula tion of the primary immune re sponse to SRBCs; however, similar increases in numbers of antibody-pro ducing cells were documented at oral doses ranging from 0.018 to 180 mg/kg body weight administ ered every other day over 28 days to SJL/J mice, a strain that can be stimulated to develop lupus-like di sease (Johnson et al., 2002). Augmented antibody production occurred in the absence of apparent lymphocyte hyper-responsiveness to mitogenic signals (e.g. T and B cell mitogens) or activation of macrophages. This finding is of particular inte rest, because significant enhancement was at a dose that is lower than the upper end of the WHO-established ADI of 0-0.02 mg/kg body weight (FAO/WHO, 1998). Route-dependent stimulation (oral and dermal exposure), suppression (intraperitoneal) and lack of effects (inhalation) were reporte d in C57BL/6 mice exposed to the carbamate insecticide aminocarb (Bernier et al., 1995). Although the toxico logical significance of these results is questionable, it is noteworthy that class II MHC expression was upregulated in LPS-stimulated B cells isolated from the sp leens of mice exposed by the oral and dermal routes only, suggesting that early B cell activ ation events were upregulated. The authors concluded that this compound was possibly au toimmunogenic, based on the apparent immune system stimulation. Intraperitoneal administra tion of another carbamate insecticide, propoxur, Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 79was reported to increase anti body titres and numbers of spleen cells secreting SRBC-specific IgM at 2 mg/kg body weight per day for 28 da ys, a dose that was not associated with histopathological changes in lymphoid organs ; suppression of the primary antibody response was observed at 10 mg/kg body weight per day, as were lesions in the spleen and thymus (Hassan et al., 2004). The synthetic pyrethroids deltamethrin and -cypermethrin were evaluated for immuno- toxicity in male F344 rats (Madsen et al., 1996). Increases in the number of spleen cells producing antibody to SRBCs and in NK cell activity were reported at oral doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg body weight per day for 28 days. These e ffects were accompanied at the highest dose by reduced body weight and increa sed adrenal weight, suggesting that effects at the highest dose were accompanied by generalized toxicity. In mice, the herbicide propani l (a single intraper itoneal injection of 50 or 150 mg/kg body weight) was reported to increas e the number of spleen cells, but not bone marrow B cells, producing IgM, IgG2b and IgG3 isotype antibod ies Streptococcus pneumoniae , although concentrations of specific antibody isotypes in the serum were not affected (Salazar et al., 2005). Th e authors suggested that serum antibody concentrations were similar because antibody production in the bone marrow con-tributes significantly to serum titres in mice. This pattern of isotype enhancement suggests that propanil exposure did not skew Th cytoki ne production patterns; IgG2b synthesis is a Th2 response, and IgG3 requires Th1 cytokine. Responses to the T cell-dependent portion of the bacterium were similar in control and treat ed animals. The observed effects suggested a pattern of effects that are si milar to those of estrogen (17 -estradiol). A second study by this group (Salazar et al., 2006) dete rmined that while propanil did not bind to estrogen receptors, ovariectomy or treatment with an inhibitor of gonadotropin -releasing hormone blocked the increase in splenic antibody-producing cells, but pretreatment with estrogen or progesterone antagonists did not. Experiments in male mice corroborated the appare nt estrogen indepen- dence. Why increased antibody production was confined to the spl een is unknown, but the results do provide an example of local versus systemic effects. If the underlying MOA depends on events or pathways unique to the spl een, it is unlikely that propanil-related upreg- ulated antibody production in the spleen is a signal of potential adversity, at le ast with our current understanding of the role of antibodies in immunopathol ogy and circulating levels of autoantibodies as an indicator of autoimmune processes. The toxic effects of HCB were reviewed by Mich ielsen et al. (1999). HCB is present in the environment as a persistent and easily tran sported industrial wa ste product and was pre- viously used to prevent fungus growth in seed grain. Exposure to HCB has been associated with immune system abnormalities, including in creased immune function. A detailed discus- sion of immune system modulation in humans a nd rodents as a result of exposure to HCB is 5.5.4 Endocrine disruptors Sex is a well-documented host fa ctor immune functio n; as a general rule, estro- gens increase and androgens decrease immune responses at physiological and pharmacolog- ical levels. Many laboratory animal studies ha ve shown that gonadectomy and/or introduction of opposite sex hormones will mask or swit ch sex-typical immune response phenotypes. Although, at first glance, stimulated function ma y appear to be beneficial, the generally enhancing effect of estrogen on immune function is considered to be a major factor in the presented later in this document , as a case-study (see Case-study 2). Harmonization Project Document No. 10 80exposure to estrogenic environmental chem icals may unintenti onally increase immune function and ultimately result in inflammatory or autoimmune disease. However, the relation- ship between endocrine disrupti on and immune-mediated disease is complex, particularly if exposure occurs after puberty, a nd there are few studies that ha ve focused on adverse effects related to inadvertent stimulation of the immune system. Bisphenol A has been reported to increase the hormone prolactin in animal models, although not all studies have found this to be the case (Youn et al., 2002; Jung et al., 2007). In genetically susceptible mice, hyperprolactinaemia is associated with markers of immune system upregulation, including increased pro-B cell development, MHC class II expression by antigen-presenting cells and antibody synthe sis (Orbach & Shoenfeld, 2007), as well as reduced negative selection of autoreactive B cell s and worsening of autoimmune disease. In humans, hyperprolactinaemia is associated with the onset or worsening of autoimmune dis- eases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis and autoimmune thyroiditis (Orbach & Shoenfeld, 2007), s uggesting a link between immune system upregulation and adverse health effects in a susceptible subpopulation. Exposure to bisphenol A and DES, a synthetic estrogen, increases synthesis of autoantibodies in a mouse model of lupus by stimulating B1 ce lls, a subset of B lymphocytes that is self- renewing and associated with production of autoantibodies (Yurino et al., 2004), reinforcing the link between a genetic component of sus ceptibility and upregula tion of the immune response. 5.5.5 Drugs Although chronic cocaine intake suppresses the T cell-dependent antibody response in mice, acute exposure prior to imm unization elevates the re sponse; the latter effect is associated with elevated levels of corticosterone and can be reproduced by exogenous corticosterone under the same conditions (Stanulis et al., 1997b). Th e apparent MOA was identified as disruption of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance; additional studies determined that acute administration of cocaine or corticosterone upregulated IL -4 and IL-10 production and modulated T cell- dependent, but not T cell-independent, antibody responses (Stanulis et al., 1997a). Shifts in cytokine production patterns are of concern, because host-protective responses against intra- cellular microbes are dependent on Th1 cytokines. One of the interesting obser vations made by Stanulis et al. (1997a) was that corticoste rone did suppress Th1-dependent T cell function in this series of studies, but cocaine did not, indicating that generalized stimulation of the immune system was not responsible for increased antibody responses. 5.5.6 Air pollutants and other examples Complementing the human epidem iological studies above, a num ber of studies in rodents have demonstrated that respiratory exposure to a number of air polluta nts (nitrogen dioxide, ozone, residual oil fly ash and diesel exhaust) enhances both allergic sensitization to common allergens such as dust mites a nd respiratory responses to alle rgen challenge (Gilmour et al., 2000, 2006; Steerenberg et al., 2005). The role of pollutants in the induction and exacerbation ozone) have been reported to exacerbate im mune pathology associated with influenza infection (Selgrade et al., 1988). In simila r studies with both aryl hydrocarbon receptor targets (dioxin) (Luebke et al., 2002; Teske et al., 2008) and ultraviolet radi ation (Ryan et al., preponderance of autoimmune diseases in female s (see chapter 7). Thus, there is concern that of hypersensitivity is extensively discussed in chapter 6. In addition, oxidant gases (e.g. Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 812002), decreased host resistance to influenza infection was associated with exacerbated immune pathology rather than suppressed immune defences. 5.6 Local versus systemic effects A single study was identified that reported local versus system ic effects. The herbicide propanil (single intraperiton eal injection of 50 or 150 mg /kg body weight in mice) was reported to increase the number of spleen cells, but not bon e marrow B cells, producing IgM, IgG2b and IgG3 isotype antibodies to the T cell-independent component heat-killed pneumoniae , although concentrations of sp ecific antibody isotypes in the serum were not affected (Salazar et al., 2005). The authors suggested that serum antibody concentrations were similar because anti body production in the bone marrow contributes significantly to serum titres in mice. Route-depe ndent stimulation (oral and dermal exposure), suppression (intraperitoneal) and lack of effects (inhalation) we re reported in C57BL/6 mice exposed to the carbamate insecticide ami nocarb (Bernier et al., 1995). Although the toxicological significance of thes e results is questionable, it is noteworthy that class II MHC expression was upregulated in LPS-stimulated B cells isolated from the spleens of mice exposed by the oral and dermal routes only. Although not investigated by these authors, route-specific effects may depend on differences in the toxicokinetics associated with each route of exposure. 5.7 (Ir)reversibility of effects None of the adult studies evaluated for this sect ion were specifically de signed to evaluate the reversibility of the reported effects. The studies by Stanulis et al. (1997a,b) did determine that stimulation of antibody synthesi s was the product of acute cocai ne exposure, in contrast to suppression observed with chronic exposure. In adults, upregulation of the immune response is likely related to the half-life of active parent or metabolites. However, persistence of effects following exposure to immunosuppressi ve or immunostimulating compounds has rarely been investigated. Clin ical data from human recipien ts of haematopoietic stem cell grafts indicate that the immune function retu rns over time, with a concomitant reduction of infections (Ochs et al., 1995; Atkinson, 2000); thus, the severity and persis tence of effect may depend on the potency of the agent and the cell types affected. Irreversible effects of xeno- biotic exposure occur in mice ge netically predisposed to spontaneous au toimmunity; disease may occur in younger animals or be more severe . These models typically follow an unrelent- ing course of disease that results in mortality, in contrast to many human autoimmune diseases characterized by flare and remission, at least in the ear ly stages of disease. Auto- 5.8 Biological plausibility It is clear from the examples above that unin tended immune system stimulation, relative to appropriate controls, may be an indicator of immunotoxicity and should not be ignored. Rather, the data should trigger the risk assessor to consider autoimmunity (see chapter 7), pathways as a consequence of exposure. Biologi cal plausibility is di scussed in detail in discussion of the health-related database and the components of sufficient evidence for immunity is discussed in detail in chapter 7. hypersensitivity (see chapter 6) or suppression (see chapter 4) of other immune system section 3.3.6 of chapter 3. In particular, the reader is referred to section 3.3.6.1 for a Harmonization Project Document No. 10 82in determining whether additional data may be required to complete the risk assessment. 5.8.1 Weight of evidence approach for assessment of immunostimulation As noted above, stimulation of the immune response is not adve rse per se, given that most vaccine preparations include adjuvants to en sure that the immune response to microbes or their toxic products provides protective immun ity. Clinical experience with biopharmaceuti- cals, particularly cytokines used to stim ulate immune responses, or exposure to \"super- antigens\" indicates that morbidity or morta lity may be associated with accidental or deliberate exposure to potent immune system activators. In contrast, most reports of stimulated immune function following exposure to environmental agents or recreational drugs suggest that mild to moderate immune system activation is the most likely outcome. Whether or not immunostimulati on represents a hazard to the host is likely the product of stimulating potency, persistence of elevated immune function and, perhaps the most important, host genotype. Nevertheless, stimulati on of the immune system should be regarded as unintended immune system modulation and should not be disregarded. In most of the (particularly antibody synthesis) have also been shown to adve rsely affect the course of disease in animals that are genetically prone to development of autoimmune disease. Likewise, adjuvant-like activity of some xenobiotics (e.g. diesel exhaust particles) has also been associated with stimulated antibody responses to allergens in susceptible rodent strains, as well as worsening of allergic hypersen sitivity, including asthma (Chan et al., 2006). Although increased antibody synthesis does not nece ssarily constitute sufficient evidence of adversity, it should raise concern that susceptib le populations may be adversely affected or that host resistance mechanisms not addresse d in the suite of assays used for hazard identification may be suppressed. Hazard identification for immunostimulation shoul d result in weight of evidence conclusions based on the available human a nd laboratory animal data for a given chemical. The risk assessor should consider the entire database of effects, including data that support and do not support unintended stimulation. Data are evaluated within the same or similar assays, as well as across divergent measures of the immune system and across multiple species. For each assay, a dose-response relationship for chemical exposure in the absence of generalized overt toxicity is necessary to de monstrate immunostimulation. The weight of evidence conclusions are stre ngthened by consistenc y (particularly across species, sexes or related end-point s), biological plausibility and breadth (range of effects) of the evidence for immunotoxicity. A lack of c onsistency among specific assays or types of immunotoxicity across species, strains or sexes does not necessarily represent conflicting data and often represents species, st rain or sex differences. Confli cting data should be evaluated by the strengths and weaknesses (e.g. sample si ze and exposure duratio n) of the individual studies, as well as in the context of the remai nder of the immunotoxicity database for a given chemical. Additional information with which to interpret species, strain or sex differences may be gained by considering toxicokinetic data (when available) or the likelihood of sex differences resulting from hormonally active chemicals, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals. As with other non-cancer end-points , the weight of evidence evaluation should represent an expert judgement of the data base to determine the potential for immuno- stimulation for a given compound in accordance w ith the following key considerations (Hill, 1965; IPCS, 1999a; Weed, 2005): experimental evidence, dose-response relationship, immunotoxicity and section 3.3.6.3 for a discussion of \"triggers\" and factor s to be considered examples discussed in section 5.5, environm ental agents that in crease immune function Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 83consistency of association, strength of the association, temporal association, biological plausibility, specificit y, coherence and analogy. data from the strongest and most predictive da ta (human data) through the least predictive considerations for identifying key data set strengths, weaknesses and utility of data for derivation of effect levels ar e presented below. The risk as sessor should develop weight of evidence conclusions for immunostimulation hazard based on the database for a given chemical by considering all six of the following questions: 1) Human data : Are there epidemiological studies, clinical studies or case-studies that provide human data on end-points relevant to immunostimulation (i.e. unintended stimulation of cellular or humoral imm une function, autoimmunity or allergy)? 9 Data from well-controlled clinical a nd epidemiological studies represent the strongest evidence to support immunostimul ation. In some cases, data may be used to support stimulation and sensiti zation or stimulation and autoimmunity. immunity, as appropriate. Allergy, hypersen sitivity and autoimmunity are clearly adverse; therefore, if all of the data can be considered in chapters 6 and 7, there is no need to evaluate the data for immunostimulation as well. In other cases, there will be data, such as increased antibody production in response to immunization, that are more appropriate to consider as measures of immunostimulation than for allergy or autoimmunity. Data can be used for derivation of effect level(s) for immunostimulation if there ar e concordant and biologic ally plausible human or animal data demonstrating stimulation of functional end-points. Human data will most likely come from individuals with unexpected worsening clinical symptoms of allergy or autoimmune disease that can be linked to xenobiotic exposure or from epidemiological investigations of di sease clusters. As noted above, data do support the biological plausibility of xenobiotic-induced immunostimulation in human disease. 9 Induction or exacerbation of allergic or autoimmune disease or modulation of resistance to infectious agents, without evidence of concordant stimulation of functional end-points, should be considered in the haza rd identification of sensi- tization and allergic response in chap ter 6 or autoimmunity in chapter 7. 2) Allergic, autoimmune or infectious disease (laboratory animal data) : Is there evi- dence that exposure to the chemical is a ssociated with exacerbation of hypersensi- tivity responses or induction or exacerbation of autoimmune disease or alters the outcome of host re sistance assays? 9 Induction or exacerbation of allergic or autoimmune disease or modulation of resistance to infectious agents in multiple species, with concordant and biologi- cally plausible stimulation of functional end-points, provides the strongest evi- dence to link stimulated responses to disease development and provides data appropriate for derivation of effect level(s). A series of questions similar to those used to organize immunosuppres sion data (see chapter designed to detect immunosuppression.

The risk assessor should develop the weight of evidence for immunostimulation hazard identification based on answers to all six questions. The weight of evidence conclusions for immunostimulation should also de scribe the database in terms of consistency and biological plausibility, including strength s, weaknesses, uncertainties a nd data gaps. A small database with negative data is equivocal. Just as posit ive data on a range of assays strengthen the weight of evidence for immunotoxi city, negative data on a range of more predictive assays, such as immune function data, increase confid ence to support a lack of immunotoxicity. The strength of the immune database will determine whether additional evidence is necessary to determine immunotoxicity. Incomplete or questiona ble data sets and high usage or high risk of exposure should trigger a request for add itional data, if regulatory mandate allows. When immunostimulation is indicated by the wei ght of evidence, these conclusions are then prepared to be brought forward to perform a dose-response assessment, beginning with the selection of the most appropria te end-point(s) or critical e ffect(s) and the development of POD(s). Health-based guidance values or referen ce values are then calc ulated by dividing the dose-response assessment and derivation of refe rence values). Data from human exposures (e.g. occupational exposure studies and case reports) are preferre d for the critical effect, because fewer assumptions are required to dete rmine the relative risk of immunotoxicity for the general population from human data compared with experimental animal data. Therefore, when human data are used for the critical eff ect and the POD, smaller uncertainty factors are generally utilized to derive the reference valu es. Nevertheless, all avai lable data are consid- ered for the critical effect. The quantitativ e risk assessment may be based on laboratory animal data even if th ere are human data for a given chemic al in cases such as inadequate information on dose levels, no information on eff ects at low doses or absence of a NOEL in the human data set. Dose-related changes in three principal types of data provide strong evidence of adverse immunostimulation appropriate fo r use as the critical effect for chemical-related immuno- stimulation: 1) human data on end-points relevant to immunostimulation (i.e. abnormal elevation of cellular or humora l immune function, autoimmunity or allergy) with concordant data supporting immunostimulation as the MOA, 2) induction or exacerbation of allergic or autoimmune disease, or modulation of resistance to infectious agents, in multiple laboratory animal species with concordant data s upporting immunostimulation as the MOA and 3)POD(s) by the total uncertainty factor (see sections 3.3.7 and 4.9 for a detailed discussion of A schematic for organizing the data is presented in Figure 5.1.

The figure presents a summary of categorical data binning, there are immunotoxicological data relevant to end-points other than immunostimulation, evaluate those data in the appropriate chapter and include in weight of evidence evaluation for immunotoxicity. stimulation of functional immune measures in laboratory animals. In general, PODs are developed from the most sensitive adverse imm une end-point(s) from the most appropriate species (or the most sensitive mammalian species, in the absence of information to determine the most appropriate sp ecies). Data from general immune assays, haematology, histopathol- ogy and immune organ weight changes may indi cate potential immunotox icity and are useful from the most to least predictive, as described in section 5.8.1, rather than a decision-tree. Note: If Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 87to support biological plausibility and a poten tial immunostimulation MOA for more pre- dictive data (e.g. functio nal data). Observational end-point s such as phe notyping, lymphocyte proliferation and altered solubl e mediator (cytokines or comp lement) concentrations should generally not be used to derive an effect level for immunostimulation, because they are not considered to be reliable predictors of adverse immunostimulation. Major haematological changes are unlikely to occur in the absence of a related change in immune function. Therefore, the risk assessor s hould consider available functi onal and host resistance data on related end-points when consid ering deriving an effect le vel from haematological data. Changes in immune organ weights and general histopathology may indicate potential immu- notoxicity and can be used to support more predictive data (e.g. functional data); however, these data should not be used to derive an e ffect level for immunostimulation because of the low predictive value of these end-points when considered alone. 5.8.2 Mode of action/mechanisms Adverse effects of unintended immune system stimulation include allergy, hypersensitivity, autoimmunity and inflammation. Initiating and sustaining events that are responsible for allergy, hypersensitiv ity and autoimmunity are discussed in other chapters of this document. These effects are clearly adverse, and their underlying MOAs are fa irly well documented. However, it is worth noting that these effects are typically observed in animal models that include a genetic propensity to develop allergic or autoimmune disease. In contrast, unin- tended upregulation of function has also been observed in the absence of readily apparent adversity (e.g. increased antibody responses to T cell-dependent antigens) in animal models that are not necessarily prone to allergy or autoimmune dis ease, but fewer studies have addressed MOAs under these conditions. Examples of studies that have addressed MOAs for stimulation of allergy and autoimmu ne disease are presented below. Mercury(II) chloride increased antibody titres to T cell-dependent and T cell-independent antigens in allergy-prone Brown Norway rats by acting as a pol yclonal activator of B and T lymphocytes, which may also be responsible for the observed autoi mmune kidney disease that co-occurs in this rat strain (Hirsch et al., 1982). It is noteworthy that similar effects were not observed by Hirsh et al. (1982) in Lewis rats, a strain that is prone to developing inflam- matory disease due to defective hypothalamic-p ituitary-adrenal axis control of inflammation (Sternberg et al., 1989). Genotype appears to be pivotal in determining the outcome of expo- sure; a Th2 cytokine-driven re sponse is responsible for both increased antibody synthesis and development of autoimmune disease in susceptib le strains, whereas resistant strains (e.g. Lewis) experience immunosuppression follo wing exposure (reviewed by Lawrence & McCabe, 2002). Lead in drinking-water for 10 weeks was reported to increase the antibody response to SRBCs in BALB/c mi ce, an allergy-prone strain that is biased towards Th2 responses, but not in C57BL/6 mice, which lack a Th2 bias (Mudzinski et al., 1986). These effects are supported by later studies (McCabe & Lawrence, 1991) that reported increased B cell differentiation and increased antigen pr esentation by Th2 clones exposed to lead. Lead exposure is likewise associ ated with worsening of autoi mmune disease in a genetically prone mouse model of lupus, but does not induc e disease in resistant strains of mice (Hudson et al., 2003). Shifts in cytokine production patter ns are linked to shifts in cellular (Th1) or humoral/allergic (Th2) function, such that signi ficant overproduction of Th1 or Th2 cytokines is reflected in changing pattern s of infection resistance and, in some cases, allergic disease. Significant loss of Th1 cytokine production has b een associated with reduced resistance to intracellular pathogens; lead exposure (414.4 mg /l in drinking-water for 3 weeks) decreases Harmonization Project Document No. 10 88resistance to the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes due to overproduction of Th2 cytokines, a process that can be reversed by administration of the potent Th1 cytokine, IL-12 (Kishikawa et al., 1997). Although not directly re lated to the effects of lead on cytokine profiles, lead also reduces production of nitr ic oxide by macrophages, a key component of the intracellular bactericidal mechan ism that clears listerial inf ection. Thus, although a portion of reduced resistance is attributable to altered cytokine expression, eff ects on cells other than lymphocytes also underlie reduced resistance. Furthermore, survival was decreased and body burdens of the extr acellular pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were increased in mice challenged with the organism after drinking water containing lead at a concentration of 2072 mg/l for 16 weeks. This level of exposure was associated with high levels of lead in blood (106.2 \u00b1 8.9 \u00b5g/dl), increa sed (approximately 3 times) levels of IL-4, normal levels of protective Ig G2a antibody to the bacterium a nd elevated levels of non- protective IgG1 antibody (Al-Rama di et al., 2006). Th1 cytokine s are required for production of protective IgG2a (Snapper et al., 1988). Thus, even though lead exposure was associated with an elevated anti body response to infecti on, the lead-induced shif t in cytokine production resulted in reduced production of the protective antibody isotype. Mechanistic studies suggest that the adjuvant e ffects of diesel exhaust particle extracts are due to oxidative stress in dendritic cells. This perturbation of de ndritic cell function is accompanied by decreased IFN- and increased IL-10 inducti on in antigen-specific T cells. The data suggest that pro-oxidative diesel exha ust particle chemicals can interfere in Th1- 5.9 Groups at risk (devel oping immune system, elderly, allergic/autoimmune patients) of immune function indicate that host genotype is an important factor in determining study outcome. Effects were often detected in strains of laboratory animals that have a bias towards production of Th2 cytokines; thes e same strains are often used to evaluate allergenicity and, less commonly, autoimmunity. Immunostimulation has also been detect ed in Th1-biased strains, and data from MOA studies indicate that upregulation of f unction by xenobiotics is not caused by a single event or MOA. Initial obs ervations of increased function have been further evaluated for potential adversity by dos ing strains of rodents that spontaneously develop autoimmune diseases or that are more sensitive to induction of autoimmune diseases under laboratory conditions. This may be an inherent bias in experimental design, as loss of immunological control or increased intensity or duration of immune responses is often observed in autoimmune diseases. As a group, ho wever, these studies s uggest that increased specific or nonspecific antibody sy nthesis is associated with more rapid onset, or greater pathology, of the spontaneously developing diseas e. The studies also suggest that some of these compounds may provide the environmen tal trigger portion of human autoimmune disease by inappropriate upregul ation of immune function. Endocrine hormones are responsible for a more robust immune response in females, and, as significant portion of xenobiotics that stimulat e immune function are endocrine disrupting chemicals with estrogenic activit y, suggesting that females may be more likely than males to experience unintended stimulation of immune function and, perhaps, at greater risk of immune system dysregulation resulting in autoim mune disease. Sex-dependent stimulation of discussed in chapter 7, the greater preponderan ce of autoimmune disease is in females. A A general discussion of groups that may be at risk for immunotoxi city is presen ted in section promoting response pathways in a homogeneous dendritic cell population (Chan et al., 2006). 3.3.8 of chapter 3. In aggregate, immunotoxicological studies th at have identified stimulation Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 89the antibody response to SRBCs is not an exclusive finding in fe males; increased numbers of antibody-producing cells were detected in male offspring of rats exposed to feed containing methoxychlor from gestational day 7 until postpartum day 51 (White et al., 2005). NK cell activity was increased in dams, but only at th e highest dose (1000 mg/kg of feed), a dose that also caused maternal weight loss. Increased num bers of antibody-forming cells were detected in male offspring continually exposed to methoxychlor at concentrations of 100 and 1000 mg/kg feed until 11 weeks of age, although body we ight was reduced at the highest dose. NK cell activity was also increased in males, but only at the 1000 mg /kg concentrati on in feed. In contrast, suppression, rather th an stimulation, of i mmune function was reported for female offspring, along with reduced body weight, at 1000 mg/kg feed. El evated immune function at 1000 mg/kg feed is of questionabl e significance, given the indicati ons of generalized toxicity at this dose. It is generally accepted that developing organi sms are more susceptible, and often more sensitive, than adults to the effects of chemical exposure. Most developmental immuno- exposure to lead may provide one of the clearest examples of late effects of early exposure on increased immune responses. Increased IgE pr oduction occurs long after blood lead levels return to near normal, whic h may predispose offspring to allergy (reviewed by Dietert & Piepenbrink, 2006a). Likewise, maternal exposu re of B6C3F1 mice to genistein enhanced IgE production in adult offspring challenged with the respiratory allergen trimellitic anhydride (Guo et al., 2005b). 5.10 Dose-response relationships and thresholds A thorough understanding of dose-related effects is critical to a successf ul risk assessment. Prior to evaluating dose-response and threshold as applied to immunostimulation, the reader between inadvertent immune system activation and chemical dose is complex, and effects are of this chapter, the administered dose may de termine whether immune function is stimulated or suppressed by the same compound (e.g. propoxur : Hassan et al., 2004; lindane: Meera et al., 1992). In some studies, elevated function wa s reported for all doses, including those that caused signs of overt toxicity, suggesting that different MOAs may be responsible for immu- nostimulation and toxicity. Colle ctively, the observed patterns of stimulated function across various doses suggest that immunostimulation is not an artefact of very high or very low doses. From a practical standpoint , this observation suggests that stimulation can be detected at dose ranges that are appropriate for st udies designed to det ect immunosuppression. The interpretation of dose-response data should identify doses associated with the adverse effect (immunostimulation), as well as doses associated with no adverse effects, to determine the most appropriate end-points or critical effects. The toxici ty data and the shape of the dose-response relationship (e.g. an inverted U-shaped curve) may indicate that different qualitative outcomes occur as dose or exposure duration increases. In such a case, it is important to consider whether different outcomes are attributable to the same or different MOAs. If it can be determined that variable effects have the same underlying MOA, a risk assessment can be based on the lowest NOAEL or LOAEL. However, if evidence indicates that the observed response can be attributed to distinct eff ects of different dose-based or exposure duration-based MOAs, the NOAEL or LOAEL for each MOA should be consid- ered separately. In general, PODs are deve loped from the most sensitive adverse immune toxicity studies have focuse d on suppression (see chapter 4) . The effects of gestational not necessarily restricted to either end of the dose-response curve. As described in section 5.5 must be familiar with the issues discussed in section 3.3.7 of chapter 3. The relationship Harmonization Project Document No. 10 90end-points from the most appropriate species or the most sensitive mammalian species in the absence of information to determine the most appropriate species. Reference values (e.g. RfD/RfC or ADI/TDI) are then calculated by dividing the P ODs by the total uncertainty factor, using either default uncertainty factor s or CSAFs. These concepts are discussed in 5.11 Acute versus chronic exposure Few studies have evaluated immunostimulation as a function of acute or chronic exposure. The studies by Stanulis et al. (1997a,b) dete rmined that acute cocaine exposure stimulated antibody synthesis, in contrast to suppression following ch ronic exposure. Cadmium expo- sure has also been associated with increased IgM and IgG antibody responses to sheep ery- throcytes after single (Koller et al., 1976), short-term (3-4 week s) or long-term (9-11 weeks) exposure to cadmium concentrations of 50 or 200 mg/l in the drinking-water, suggesting a degree of insensitivity to exposure duration (M alav\u00e9 & De Ruffino, 1984). However, in the latter study, exposure to cadmium at 300 mg/l fo r 10 weeks suppressed th e humoral response, suggesting a dose threshold that favours suppr ession over stimulation. Finally, the primary antibody response was elevated 4 days into a 6- week inhalation exposure to crystalline silica, but not after 10 weeks of exposure, during a phase of pulmonary inflammation and granu- loma formation (Langley et al., 2004). These resu lts suggest that the temporal component of immunostimulation in this case was the direct result of changing cytokine production patterns that accompany disease progression. 5.12 Uncertainty factors The predictive value of stimulated IgM an tibody synthesis for disease development or progression has yet to be established. However, if IgM synthesis is elevated at doses that will change the POD, and in the absence of other immunotoxicit y data (e.g. autoimmune or hypersensitivity data), this is taken into account in the database uncertainty factor. On a case- by-case basis, the application of an uncertainty factor of 3 or 10 is suggested for this type of 5.13 Exposure assessment Laboratory animal studies suggest that immuno stimulation is not simply a high-dose or low- dose effect, but is dependent on the chemical an d, in some cases, the animal model. Immuno- stimulation has been de monstrated following oral, dermal and inhalation exposure to xeno- biotics. Route-appropriate exposure assessments , as described in othe r chapters of this document, are therefore also appropriate to assess stimulated immune function. A general addresses exposure-related severi ty and persistence, suscepti bility based on timing of expo- sure, the consequences of exposure on localized and systemic immune tissues, and toxico- kinetic factors that will infl uence the outcome of exposure. 5.14 Risk characterization Deliberate enhancement of immune function, part icularly in the context of vaccination, is a common therapeutic practice that is not gene rally associated with adverse effects. database deficiency.

Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 91Unexpected stimulation of the immune system following chemical exposure may likewise be without apparent adverse cons equences or, as noted above, may be accompanied by sup- pression of critical functions that were not assessed during ha zard identification. Data derived from models of inherited spontaneous autoim mune diseases or inadequate homeostatic control of immune responses s uggest a causal link be tween host genotype (including sex), dose-dependent stimulation of immune functi on and exacerbation of allergy, hypersensitivity or inflammation.

ASSESSMENT OF SENSIT IZATION AND ALLERGIC RESPONSE 6.1 Introduction IPCS (1999b) defines allergy as: the adverse health effects resulting from hyper sensitivity caused by exposure to an exogenous antigen [either in the form of an allergen when th e molecule is large enough or as a hapten, i.e. a low molecular weight chemical that can combine wi th a larger (self) molecule to form a complete antigen] resulting in a marked increase in reactivit y and responsiveness to that particular antigen on subsequent exposure. Allergy is not necessarily , or usually, the consequence of perturbed immune function, but the result of an immune system response to an [otherwise innocuous] antigen (in this case allergen) in such a way that a temporary or long-lasting disease results. The immunological processes that are involved in the de velopment of allergic responses and allergic disease are in principle and practice no different to those that provide protective immunity and host resistance against potential pathogens. .... Although from the occupational[, c onsumer] and environmental health standpoint allergic contact dermatitis respiratory hypersensitivity [e.g. alle rgic rhinitis and allergic asthma] represent the most important types of allergy induced by chemicals, it should not be forgotten that exposure to xenobiotics has been implicated in other forms of allergic disease. Certain drugs are associated with systemic allergic reactions that are some times reminiscent of autoimmune diseases. In addition, food components and food additives are im plicated in adverse reactions, which in some cases take the form of an allergic response. Hypersensitivity reactions to ch emicals (or other allergens) pose some particularly challeng- ing problems for quantitative risk assessment becau se they develop in two stages. First, there is a \"learning phase\" without symptoms (termed sensitizatio n phase or induction phase), followed by the immune response effector pha se (termed elicitation phase or challenge reaction). Consequently, the first contact (and often repeated cont acts), even with relatively high concentrations of a sens itizing chemical, can go unnotice d, because no signs or symp- toms of allergy occur. Nevertheless, this co ntact may induce sensitization\u2014that is, cause the immune system to prepare for a reaction at the next contact. On ce sensitization is established, contact with the same sensitizer, sometimes even at concentrations se veral orders of magni- tude lower, may lead to symptoms of allergic disease. The dose-response relationships for sensitization and elicitation ar e different, but not entirely independent (Friedmann et al., 1983; Scott et al., 2002), and in practice it is so metimes difficult to determine the point at which sensitization ends and elic itation begins. For this reason, risk assessors have tended to deal with hypersensitivity responses as a ll-or-none responses. Recently, however, significant progress has been made, particularly with allergic contact dermatitis, in the development of dose-response relationships and thresholds. Owing to the distribution of the cells of the immune system over diverse primary and second- ary immune organs and tissues throughout the body and constant recirc ulation of immune cells via the lymphatic and blood vessels, the de velopment of sensitization is always a sys- temic reaction, although allergic reactions may preferentially occur at localized sites: for example, in exposed skin areas (e.g. as dela yed contact allergy or immediate-type contact urticaria), mouth, upper respiratory tract (e.g. as allergic rhinitis ), lower respiratory tract (e.g. Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 93as allergic asthma) or ga strointestinal tract (e.g. in food allergy) or as more systemic anaphyl- axis. The site of reaction is not necessarily dete rmined by the route of exposure; for example, dermal and food exposures may sometim es result in respiratory reactions. components: 1) the likelihood that a chemical will induce sensitization in a previously non- sensitized individual and 2) the likelihood that a chemical will provoke an allergic reaction in those who are already sensitized. induction and elicitation of skin allergy, respiratory allergy and oral (systemic) allergy. The most progress in this regard ha s been made with allergic cont act dermatitis; tools for dealing with respiratory allergy are more limited, and sy stemic (oral) allergy has received the least caused by exposure to chemical substances via the dermal, inhalation and systemic routes. It should be emphasized that for the toxicologi cal end-points addressed here, with the excep- tion of allergic contact dermatitis, there are cu rrently no internationally harmonized toxicity test guidelines that have been officially endorsed as a basi s for quantitative risk assessment and that very limited databases exist for ma ny compounds. Also, while quantitative risk assessment for skin sensitizers has become an industry standard to a ssess consumer exposure to sensitizing fragrance ingredients, it stil l lacks acceptance in other areas and has been employed in only a few cases by competen t authorities and regulatory bodies. The reader should note that some sensitizing chemicals may additionally cause other immu- notoxic effects (or may constitu te other toxic hazards beside s immunotoxicity). For other 6.2 Hazard identification Sensitization hazard identifica tion has been comprehensively discussed in IPCS (1999b): Testing [of the sensitizing potential] requires study of selected immunological effects and differs from conventional toxicity testing in the nature and content of its procedures, which are focused on responses of the immune system and not on ge neral screening for changes in all body systems. In both types of testing, however, there will be some form of relation between dose (exposure) and effect, as the capacity of a substance to prod uce effects, its potency, will be represented by the dose (exposure) required to produce sensitization (or toxicity). A strong sensitizer will require only a small dose, whereas a less potent compound will require a higher dose, or multiple expo- sures. Unlike conventional toxicity, further exposur e of a sensitized animal (or man) will elicit a harmful allergic reaction after a much smaller dose than that required for sensitization, although there will still be a graduation of the severity a nd nature of the hypersensitivity reaction, for example ranging from slight bronchoconstriction to fatal bronchospasm or anaphylaxis after respiratory challenge. Identification of a sensitization h azard indicates, at the same time, that an elicitation reaction can be induced in sensitized laboratory animals or individuals, and ofte n an elicitation reac- tion is the read-out in a sensitization test. Therefore, separate hazard identification tests for risk assessment\", in chapter 3 of this guidance document. have been developed as a guide through the pr ocess of assessing sensitization and allergy In conclusion, it is clear that risk assessmen t for chemically induced hypersensitivity has two attention to date. Decision-trees (see Figur es 6.2A, 6.2B and 6.2C in section 6.4.1 below) In this chapter, guidance will be developed for the conduct of risk assessments for both the immunotoxic effects, the reader is referred to Table 3.1, \"Entry points for i mmunotoxicity Harmonization Project Document No. 10 94elicitation are not required, but elicitation tests are usually performed to do hazard charac- terization (dose-res ponse analysis). An additional important difference between conve ntional toxicity and sensitization is that allergic sensitization (the indu ced state of hyper-reactivity to a substance) normally persists for a long time, even for life, whereas for many toxic responses, a state of lasting responsive- ness is not induced. It is possibl e for different types of hypersen sitivity and provocation to be effective in the same organ or tissue, but it is also possible for the r oute of sensitization and response to subsequent challenge to differ (e .g. sensitization via the skin and subsequent asthma on inhalation exposure). A special case of sensitization is photosensitization, where photodynamic compounds activated by sunlig ht cause the allergic response. With regard to skin sensiti zation hazard identification, the development of in vitro, in chemico or in silico models for predicting th e sensitizing potential an d/or potency of chemi- cals has received widespr ead interest during rece nt years, mainly beca use of increasing public and political concerns regarding the use of animals for the tes ting of cosmetic ingredients. Currently, the replacement strategy foresees that data from several non-animal test methods will need to be combined to produce adequate information on skin sensitizing potency (Jowsey et al., 2006; Natsch et al., 2009). Each alternative test method aims to address a key element in the induction of skin sensitization, such as dermal bioavailability (skin penetra- tion), activation of keratinocytes and innate immune cells (phagocyte activation), chemical reactivity with skin protein, activation of epider mal Langerhans cells or dermal dendritic cells and the chemical-specific T cell activation. Besides well-established methods, such as in vitro skin penetration assays, novel alternative approa ches for the identification of skin sensitizing chemicals include stimulation assays using human peripheral blood monocyte-derived den- dritic cells (Aeby et al., 2004; Reuter et 2011), keratinocyt e cell line-based reporter gene assay (Natsch et al., the reactivity assay, the my eloid U937 skin sensiti- zation test and the human cell lin e activation test (Maxwell et al., 2011). The latter four non- animal tests have been evaluated in interlab oratory ring trials and have recently been submitted to the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods for formal pre-validation. 6.3 Hazard characterization (quant itative dose-response analysis) Many predictive test methods serve simply to iden tify the inherent poten tial of a chemical to induce allergy but provide no indi cation of the potency with wh ich it will do so. One problem is that some methods do not incorporate a do se-response analysis or identification of a threshold (or NOEL). According to IPCS (1999b): The other issue is that some tests measure activ ity as the frequency of responses [i.e. incidence, such as the number of animals showing an allergic response] rather than the severity of responses. The need is to have available information on potency defined as the quantity of chemical neces- sary to induce sensitization (or to elicit a reaction).... As in any form of toxic reaction, \"dose\" is importa nt, in that initial sensitization requires at least a certain minimum exposure (concentration of allergen , its local availability at the site of adminis- tration, and the duration of contact). In someone already sensitized, the likelihood of producing a clinical disorder and its severity are also relate d to dose, although, by definition, the quantity of allergen required to produce an effect [may be] very much smaller than that associated with a conventional toxic action. This aspect of the extent or intensity of dose (= exposure) is [very] Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 95important [in risk assessment aiming at] preven ting sensitization or protecting the sensitized individual.... 6.3.1 Skin sensitization The dose metric recommended for use in dermal sensitization risk assessment is the area dose\u2014that is, the dose of a chemical applied per area of skin (\u00b5g/cm 2 per day). In experi- ments on patients or volunteers, the applied skin area dose can be determined by calculating the absolute amount of test substance from its concentration (in %) in vehicle and the applied volume and then dividing this amount by the application area of skin (in cm2). In the same manner, the skin area dose in an LLNA can be calculated assuming that on each mouse ear, 25 \u00b5l of test substance in vehicle is applied onto 1 cm2 of ear skin (Robinson et al., 2000). It would be important to know the applied vers us the intradermally de livered dose (but data are rarely available), as there are factors that can affect the effective amount of material delivered to the viable epider mis\u2014evaporation, binding/sequestr ation in the skin and metabo- lism (inactivation and activation) . Throughout the skin se nsitization l iterature, both historical and current, allergen exposures are most comm only expressed in terms of percentage (i.e. weight of allergen per volume of vehicle applied to the skin). This leads to the assumption that in any given test system, an equal percen tage exposure will lead to a similar incidence and/or severity of skin sensitization. Base d upon the understanding of the immunological mechanism involved, it is logical to assume th at for an immune response to be initiated, a certain number of Langerhans cells must be activ ated to initiate the cascade of events neces- sary for acquiring skin sensitiza tion, thereby thre shold of induction of sensitiza- tion. This would suggest that for the induction of contact allergy, the application of an amount of allergen expressed as per cent weig ht per volume is not as important as under- standing both the dose applied and the surface area over which the allergen is applied. Pub- lished data that support the use of this dose metric for the induc tion of skin sensitization are both robust and convincing in humans and expe rimental animals. There are a number of literature references to support this pos ition (Kligman, 1966; Magnusson & Kligman, 1970; Friedmann & 2008). 6.3.1.1 Clinical and epidemiological data (a) Induction Human repeated patch testing methodology has evol ved over more than 50 years. In essence, human repeated patch tests are experimental se nsitization studies in hum ans. While they may generate valuable information for risk assessme nt in the species of interest, experiments on humans may cause fundamental ethical conc erns and are not endor sed by all competent authorities and official bodies. According to McNamee et al. (2008), every human repeated patch method uses a number of ... induction exposures, followed by a rest peri od and then a challenge exposure, but varia- tions exist as to patch type, number of subjects, skin site, number of induction patches, patch application time, duration [of treatment phase] an d rest period prior to challenge. In all, enhancement of the skin response after challe nge over that seen during early induction expo- sures has been the criterion by which induction of contact allergy is measured.... The sample size of test subjects must be sufficiently large so that results are valid for the population at Harmonization Project Document No. 10 96large, yet small enough ... to be logistically feasible to conduct the study.... Test volunteers are typically healthy adults who are enrolled without restriction as to gender or ethnicity.... The test most typically conducted is the HRIP T. Generally, the induction phase in the HRIPT comprises a total of nine 24-hour occluded patch a pplications, and the app lication skin site is changed if moderate or strong skin reactions ar e observed at removal of a patch. In contrast, the human maximization test (HMT) induction phase typically consists of five alternate 48- hour patches applied to sodium laur yl sulfate-irritated skin if th e test substance is not irritat- ing itself. These conditions may be considered unsuitable for characte rization of the skin sensitizing potency. Also, the HMT is no longer performed for ethical reasons. Therefore, HRIPT data are often given precedence over HMT data in the weight of evidence approach. From HRIPTs done in the classical design usin g several different induc tion concentrations, a dose-response curve (induction incidence vers us concentration or skin area dose), NOELs and lowest-observed-effect levels (LOELs) can be derived. When no NOEL is reported, doses producing sensitization ra tes below 50% may be extrapol ated to a LOEL (it was felt that, without any dose-response curve, the uncerta inty would be too larg e if extrapolation of higher incidences were to be done). To extrap olate to a suitable LOEL value, it has been suggested that a factor of 3 be applied to doses producing se nsitization rates between 10% and 25% and a factor of 10 for sensitization ra tes between 25% and 50% (Griem et al., 2003). Today, based on ethical considerations, skin se nsitization hazard is usually in the first instance determined in laboratory animal assa ys (such as the LLNA, Buehler test), wh ereas human sensitization tests are no longer used to determine hazard. The HRIPT is sometim es employed as a confirmatory assay to substantiate the lack of sensit ization at an exposure level that was identified as a NOEL in an animal model or that was derived as a lik ely NOEL from quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). When only one dose is te sted, such a test will often deliver \"a\" dose without observable effect, but not necessarily \"the\" NOEL. In contrast, in many human hazard identification tests performed decades ago, only one high dose was tested, which causes problems when a high percentage of subj ects were sensitized\u2014that is, when no LOEL made for how such data may be used to deri ve a POD when more suitable data are lacking. Besides experimental human studies, for certain substances, such as those that have already been used for some time in the workplace or in consumer products, epidemiological data may also be available. Such investigations can provide hazard identification and exposure assess- ment information. Data include studies of occupational or non-occu pational cohorts, the general population or dermatol ogy clinic patients and may cons ist of patch testing and/or questionnaire data. Although negative epidemiol ogical data should not normally be used as proof of absence of a sensitizing hazard, the prevalence of acute contact dermatitis in reaction to a certain substance in an exposed subpopulation not only may indicate a sensitizing hazard, but also may provide dose-response information if the exposure that led to sensitization is adequately assessed and can be reported in terms of skin area dose (eventually using a quanti- tative exposure model). At best, a NOEL and LO EL or BMD can be derived from epidemio- logical data. (and of course no NOEL) was identified. In Table 6.1 in section 6.3.3 below, a proposal is Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 97(b) Elicitation The elicitation of an allergic skin response is usually tested in humans. However, only for a small number of sensitizing chemicals has the elicitation threshold been experimentally determined. This is due to the fact that for di agnostic purposes, often a single, relatively high concentration is employed in the patch test (e .g. 1% chemical in petrolatum) in order to reliably detect a sensitization, whereas the determination of the NO EL or LOEL for elicita- tion is usually not the aim of a diagnostic patch test study. The dose-response relationship for el icitation of allergic contact dermatitis can be determined in different experimental setups. In clinical pa tch tests on allergic patients, the concentration of the sensitizer (in a suitable vehicle such as petrolatum) can easily be varied and an elicitation threshold determined. Alternatively, the repeated open application test (ROAT) or a product use test can be employed in which formul ations with different concentrations of the sensitizer as well as a control formulation wi thout the sensitizer are usually employed. The patch test minimum elicitation threshol d (MET)\u2014for example, the MET inducing a threshold response in 10% of the subjects tested (MET 10)\u2014and the NOEL or BMD from a ROAT or use test have been proposed as P ODs for risk assessmen t (Weaver et al., 1985; Sosted et al., 2006; Zachariae et al., 2006). The results from the patch test and the ROAT were shown to correlate quite well (Fischer et al., 2009). The elicitation thresholds are usually determin ed in subjects who have had an established allergy for a long period of time. Tests in wh ich elicitation thresholds were obtained using newly sensitized subjects (e.g. in the HMT or HRIPT) showed that el icitation thresholds in these subjects depend on the sensitization dose us ed; that is, the higher the sensitization dose, the lower the elicitation threshold (Friedmann et al., 1983). This dependency has also been found in mice (Scott et al., 2002). Thus, it seems that the elicitation thre shold decreases with the time of established aller gy and with the number of e xposures. Although it has not been formally shown that a \"minimum threshold\" is finally approached over time, the thresholds determined in well-established allergic individuals seem more reliable than those determined after experimental sensitization. With regard to elicitation of contact allergy, there is a cons iderable variation of the NOEL and MET both between individuals and when th e test is repeated in the same individual (Jerschow et al., 2001). It should also be noted that when te sting elicitation reactions in humans, it cannot be excluded that ag ainst a chemical does not neces- sarily indicate that th e individual has also been sensitized through contact with this chemical (see, for example, Tanaka et al., 2004; Ventura et al., 2006). 6.3.1.2 Laboratory animal data (a) Induction The LLNA (OECD Test Guideline 429) was orig inally used for qua litatively identifying sensitizing chemicals (hazard identification). A stim ulation index (SI) of 3 or higher is used to differentiate sensitizers from non-sensitizers. As at least three test concentrations are used in the LLNA, it provides a dose-re sponse curve for induction of se nsitization. The sensitizing potency is expressed as the EC 3 value, which is the effective concentration of a chemical (percentage of chemical in vehicle) required to produce a 3-fold (i.e. threshold level) increase Harmonization Project Document No. 10 98in the proliferation of lymph node cells compared with vehi cle-treated controls. The threshold of an SI of 3 or higher for the LLNA method us ing incorporation of ra dioactively labelled thymidine is replaced by an SI of 1.8 or higher for the non-radioa ctive LLNA: DA method (OECD Test Guideline 442A), which measures adenosine triphosphate content by biolumin- escence as a surrogate of the number of living ce lls, and by an SI of 1.6 or higher for the non- radioactive LLNA: BrdU-ELISA method (OECD Test Guideline 442B), which measures 5- bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into replicating DNA by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In a number of studies, human NOELs and BM Ds were compared with LLNA thresholds (EC 3 values), and it was f ound that the average ratio of both values is close to 1, indicating that area doses are directly comparable between mice and humans\u2014that is, a sensitization threshold of 10 \u00b5mol/cm2 in mice corresponds to a NOEL or BMD of 10 \u00b5mol/cm2 in humans. Therefore, the LLNA EC 3 value has been suggested as a surrogate NOEL in quanti- tative risk assessment (Basketter et al., 2000, 2 005b; Gerberick et al., 2001a,b; Griem et al., 2003; Schneider & Akkan, 2004; Api et al., 2008). Tests in guinea-pigs (GPMT, Buehler test) have been used for decades to identify possible sensitization hazards. However, guinea-pig tests provide only poor information with regard to sensitizing potency. More recently, modified gui nea-pig protocols have been proposed in order to generate useful poten cy data (Anderson et al., 1995; Van Och et al., 2001; Yamano et al., 2001), but these protocols have not yet be en validated. The disadvantages with regard to the potency estimation that can be derived from guinea-pig experiment s are, for example, circumventing the skin barrier by intracutaneous injection, elicit ation of a local inflammatory reaction and activation of Langerhans cells by us e of Freund's adjuvant, the impossibility to express the dose as area dose (in \u00b5g/cm2) and the dependency of th e sensitization rate on the challenge concentration (also disc ussed in Basketter et al., 1997). In cases where no quantitative hazard assessm ent can be performed (e.g. no NOEL can be derived), semiquantitative approaches using po tency categories have been proposed (Ger- berick et al., 2001a; Felter et al., 2002; ECETO C, 2003). Available data from experiments in guinea-pigs and murine LLNA as well as human experience can be used in a weight of evidence approach to put a substance into one of several potency categories. As a starting point for risk assessment, the lower boundary of the potency category is used into which a given sensitizing chemical is grouped. Category boundaries are expressed in units of specific area dose. Different systems with regard to the number of categorie s and their obvious disadvantage of a potency cat egory system is that, by convention, \"arti- ficial\" 10-fold steps are introdu ced into the continuum of sensitization potencies. However, category systems might be used in the future to make use of in vitro sensitization tests (see A broad two-category system has recently been introduced for the classification and labelling of sensitizers under the Globally Harmonized Sy stem of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (UN, 2008). Where data are sufficient, skin sensitizer s are allocated either into subcategory 1A, for strong sensit izers, show a high frequency of occu rrence in humans and/or a high potency in laboratory animals a nd can be presumed to have the potential to produce signifi- cant sensitization in humans. Se verity of allergic reactions may also be considered. Human section 6.3.1.3). boundary values have been put forward and ar e shown in Figure 6.1 (see, for example, EC, Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 99evidence can include skin se nsitization induction threshol ds at or below 500 \u00b5g/cm2 in HRIPT or HMT. Criteria for subcategory 1A in laboratory animal tests are an LLNA EC 3 value at or below 2%, at least 30% responding animals at or below 0.1% intradermal induc- tion intradermal induction in the GPMT, and at least responding guinea-pigs at or be low 0.2% topical induction or at least 60% responding animals at 0.2-20% topical induction in the Buehler test. Figure 6.1: Overview of potency categories for skin sensitizers based on LLNA EC 3 values. (b) Elicitation As already discussed above, elic itation thresholds in newly sensitized animals depend on the and dose used for sensitization. Ther efore, elicitation NOELs are usually deter- mined not in laboratory animal te sts, but in human subjects with well-established skin allergy (see above). 6.3.1.3 In vitro data and general sensitization threshold approach For both animal welfare reasons and compliance with requirements imposed by the chemical legislation in Europe (e.g. 7th Amendment of the Cosmetics Directive and REACH), there is an increasing emphasis on the deve lopment of in vitro methods for hazard identification and potency characterization. In vitro approaches have to dissect the vari ous elements of the immune response to skin sensitizing chemicals, such as skin penetratio n (bioavailability), quantitative measurement of chemical reactivity with glutathione, peptides or proteins with and without metabolic activa- tion Gerberick et al., 2007; Natsch et al ., 2007; Maxwell et al., 2011), measurement of chemical activation of keratinocytes (e.g. Coque tte et al., 2003; Natsch et al., 2011) and dendritic cells (e.g. Sakaguchi et al., 2006; Aeby et al., 2007; Maxwell et al., 2011) and Harmonization Project Document No. 10 100response of T cells against hapt enated peptides. A single parame ter measured in any of these individual elements of sensitization is unlik ely to reflect the skin sensitization potential and/or potency of the chemical. Therefore, a met hod for the integration of the results of an in vitro test battery will be required. One possibi lity is to use the data to assign a potency category to the substance (Jowsey et al., 2006; Natsch et al., 2009). In the tools of toxicological risk assessment, the TTC has evolved as a useful concept. It acknowledges that a human exposure threshold can be determined below which there is no appreciable risk to human health, even when th e toxicological profile of a substance is not known (for review, see Barlow, 2005). Based on a similar approach, Safford (2008) analysed the distribution of 167 LLNA EC 3 values for sensitizing chemicals. The analysis indicated that, assuming that 20% of all chemicals are sk in sensitizers, a 95% probability would exist that the LLNA EC 3 would not be lower than 289 \u00b5g/cm2. Correcting the EC 3 dose area values with a factor derived from the correl ation of skin area doses of LLNA EC 3s with NOELs from HRIPTs and applying a to tal sensitization assessment fact or (SAF) of 100 for shampoos and 300 for deodorants, deodorants, respectiv ely, were derived. This concep t may prove useful in the future for risk assessments of very low skin exposures to chemicals with insufficient data on sensitization hazard and/or sensitization potency. 6.3.2 Respiratory sensitization A wide variety of synthetic chemicals are sensitizers, and they may be responsible for occupational rhinitis and asthma, if they can be inhaled as gases, vapours or aerosols, at any stage of their utilizat ion, from their synthesis to their disposal. In add ition, occupational respiratory allergy to macromolecular agents fr om animal, vegetal or microbiological origin is also an important problem in sectors su ch as the food industry, biotechnology and health care (Oberd\u00f6rster et al., 1998). It should be noted that expo sure via other routes, especially via the skin, has been implicated in the developm ent of respiratory allergy and has also been described in experimental animals (Pauluhn, 2008). Among respiratory allergies, allergic asthma has received the most attention from risk asses- sors because it is more serious than allergic rhinitis and laryngitis and occurs more frequently (or is at least identified more frequently) than hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis) and related conditi ons, such as chronic berylliu m disease and hard metal lung disease, which are important and still incompletely resolved health problems in some work- forces (Oberd\u00f6rster et al., 1998 ). Allergic asthma can result from exposure to proteins (frequently enzymes) or from exposure to lo w molecular weight chemicals that, as with contact sensitizers, must be chemically linked to a protein carrier in order to activate the immune system. There is some debate as to whether the mechanisms underlying protein- associated asthma are the same as those unde rlying asthma associated with low molecular weight chemicals. More work has been done with protein allergies. Currently, there are no universally accepted mode ls applicable to humans that permit the determination of the dose-response relationshi p or relative potency of enzymes or low molecular weight chemicals for causing producti on of allergen-specific antibodies or symp- toms of allergy via the inhalation route. A lthough the generation of total IgE or enzyme- specific IgE serum antibodies assessed by ELISA or cytophilic antibody (usually predom- inantly IgE) as measured by skin prick testing is often used as a component of the benchmark Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 101value, it is not a disease stat e. Therefore, the generation of IgE antibodies is a conservative end-point on which to establish a benchmark. In the detergent enzyme industry, more intense exposures have been associated with symp- toms, whereas less intense exposures have been associated with pr oduction of allergen- specific antibodies (Sarlo & Kirchne r, 2002). According to SDA (2005): The occupational data indicate that there are thr esholds for the induction of antibodies and for the elicitation of symptoms. Experimental data in guinea-pigs support the observations made from the occupational experience [and vice versa]. The rate at which guinea pigs develop allergen-specific antibodies is dose related, with lower exposures lead ing to a low rate of animals having allergen- specific antibodies. However, combining low expos ure with short peak exposures of enzyme allergen led to a greater number of animals with allergen-specific antibodies than expected. Inter- mittent peak exposures alone were also associated with allergen-specific antibodies. Elicitation was also dose-related, where symptoms in guin ea pigs were only associated with the peak expo- sures. Exposure routes in laboratory animal studies incl intradermal, intranasal and intratracheal routes. Although inha lation is the preferred route be cause of the similarity to human exposure, inhalation studies are labour in tensive, time-consuming and expensive, and they present difficulties in delivering an accurate dose. Therefore, methods using other routes of exposure have been develope d as surrogates for inhalation st udies. Guinea-pigs are usually the species of choice for sensi tization studies, although a mouse model is being developed for intratracheal and intranasal studies. Antibody responses of gui nea-pigs showed that a dose inhaled over 6 hours/day has appr oximately the same effect as a single intratracheal dose (Ritz et al., 1993). The time-weighted average (TWA) concentration (in mg/m 3) during a day or an 8-hour work- shift can currently be c onsidered as the relevant measure of exposure. This can be justified because the uptake of antigen deposited in the respiratory tract by dendritic cells and their migration to the draining lymph nodes\u2014as in skin sensitization\u2014occur in a matter of hours. As mentioned below in this section, peak exposure concentrations or aggregate1 exposure values have also been proposed as dose measures. From a mechanistic point of view , the amount of antigen that gets to antigen-presenting cells in the airways and is presented to T cells and B cells affects the immune response (Bullock et al., 2000; Eisen, 2001). The delivered dose of enzy me is dependent on a number of factors, such as its concentration in the air, the rate of resp iration, the particle or droplet size and the duration of exposure. Considera tion of all the variables involved in determining the \"deliv- ered dose\", perhaps assisted by applying co mputational deposition models, may help in describing exposure more accurately; currently, however, such information is available in only a few special cases. As for skin sensitizers, a broad two-categor y system has recently been introduced for the classification and labelling of sensitizers under the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (UN, 2008). Where data are su fficient, respiratory sensitizers are allocated either into subcategory 1A, for strong se nsitizers, or into subcategory other respiratory sensitizers. Sensitizer s of subcategory 1A show a high frequency of 1 In this document, the term aggregate exposure is used to refer to exposures to a single chemical from multiple sources and by all exposure routes over a given period of time (e.g. when hand soap is used 5 times per day). Harmonization Project Document No. 10 102occurrence in humans and/or a high probability of a high sensitization rate in humans based on laboratory animal or other tests. The severity of allergic reactions may also be considered. 6.3.2.1 Clinical and epidemiological data (a) Induction Dose-response data on the induc tion of respiratory sensitization may be obtained from clin- ical studies that are designed either as a prospective study (when a new compound or product is introduced in the consumer market) or as a retrospective study (in which cases of allergy are analysed post hoc as the inducing exposure, often involving experimental measurement of reconstituted expos ure scenarios). Heederik & Houba (2001) conducte d an epidemiological study in bakery workers, analysing respiratory sensitization against wheat (measured as IgE antibodies). The prevalence of wheat allergy was positively correlated with exposur e, no matter whether this was expressed as estimated average inhalable dust concentration (in mg/m3) or as aggregate inhalable dust concentration (in mg-years/m3). There was no indication of th e existence of a threshold for wheat sensitization risk in any of the plots. For atopi cs, the sensitization risk levelled off at higher exposure levels and decreased at even higher levels (average exposures of approx- imately 4 mg/m3 for inhalable dust or 10 g/m3 for wheat allergens). When a more rigid definition of sensitization was applied (anti-wh eat IgE titre of 0.7 kU /l instead of 0.35 kU/l), the exposure-response relationship shifted somewhat to the righ t, and elevated risks were observed only in the highest exposure categor y. The same thing happened when sensitization in combination with the presence of work-relate d symptoms was used as the end-point in the analyses (rhinitis, asthma). The exposure-re sponse relationship obtained for sensitization accompanied by symptoms is the result of supe rimposing the exposure-response relationship for exposure and symptoms on the relationships between exposure and sensitization. In this study, the steepest relationship wa s obtained for sensitization in combination with rhinitis symptoms, compared with sensitization only or sensitization in combination with asthmatic symptoms. The analysis of a ggregate inhalable dust exposure suggested a concentration around 11.97 mg-years/m3 as a no-observed-effect concen tration over an pe riod was estimated as 11.97/11.7 = 1.02 mg/m3. Dusty laundry products caused a llergy to enzymes in some consumers in Sweden during the late 1960s and early 19 70s (Belin et al., 1970; Zetterstrom & Wide, 1974). An analysis of 1645 individual serum samples showed that 15 individuals had enzyme-specific IgE anti- bodies (0.91%). These 15 also ha d a positive skin prick test ( SPT) in reaction to the enzyme. Exposure data have been generate d retrospectively to simulate the exposure to these materials that occurred from filling a sink with water and adding laundry detergent for hand laundering. The results suggested an average peak level of 212 ng/m3 for this use scenario. This example demonstrates the effects resul ting from high exposure over a s hort duration that occurred on a regular basis. Some of these 15 individuals repor ted symptoms of allergy when they used the dusty enzyme-containing laundry powder. A provocat ion test with some of these consumers showed that 8 out of 12 patients who had Ig E antibodies to enzymes had symptoms after challenge with an enzyme-containing product (l aundry powder mixed with enzyme). Several retrospective studies revealed that for indoor pouring of liquid laundry products, exposures ranged between 0.01 and 1 ng/m3, which were considered safe, as no additional new cases of allergy were observed (SDA, 2005). Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 103Mapp et al. (2005) suggested in their review that enough data for assessment of exposure- response relationships are available for severa l other high molecula r weight occupational allergens\u2014namely, for cedar, fungal -amylase and laboratory animal proteins. Baur (2003) reviewed clinical epidemiological and exposure evaluati on findings as well as theoretical relationships between concentrations of respirator y allergens in workplaces and prevalence of sensitized worker s, lung function impairment, and symptoms and/or frequency of occupational asthma. Corresponding slopes we re found in the nanograms per cubic metre range for latex, purified enzymes and rat urinar y proteins; in the micrograms per cubic metre range for wheat flour allergens, cyanates and platinum salts; and in the milligrams per cubic metre range for acid anhydrides, wood dust and th e rather heterogeneous bakery flour dust (i.e. 1000-fold differences exist, partly depending on the purity of the allergen). Prospective epidemiological studies in workers have been reported for toluene diisocyanate and several organic acid anhydrides used in e poxy resins (reviewed in Arts et al., 2006). In the prospective study performed in toluene diis ocyanate-exposed workers, it was shown that accidental exposure to high concentrations of toluene diisocyanate resulted in IgE antibody formation. In contrast, exposure to low concentrations of tolu ene diisocyanate (at or below 0.14 mg/m 3) for up to 3 years did not result in any cases of toluene diisocyanate hyper- sensitivity or in the production of to luene diisocyanate-specific antibodies. Other low molecular weight respiratory sens itizers for which dose-re sponse relationships have been reported include col ophony and platinum salts (reviewe d in Mapp et al., 2005) (see From epidemiological investigations, NOECs or BMCs can be derived that may serve as PODs for risk assessment. However, appropriate data seem to be available for only a very limited number of allergens. (b) Elicitation Dose-response relationships and thresholds for the elicitation of resp iratory allergy can be derived from epidemiological studies or experimental/diagnostic provocation tests. Yokota et al. (1999) reported on two condenser plants using epoxy resins containing methyl- tetrahydrophthalic anhydride. Ai r concentrations of methylte trahydrophthalic anhydride were higher in plant A than in plant B (mean concentrations approximately 25-64 \u00b5g/m3 and 4.9- 5.5 \u00b5g/m3, respectively). Of a total of 95 work ers, 24 workers (65%) in plant A and 38 workers (66%) in plant B had me thyltetrahydrophthali c anhydride-specific IgE antibodies. In sensitized workers in plant A, eye, nose and pharynx symptoms were observed at a higher incidence when compared with sensitized work ers in plant B. Furthermore, only 15% of persons often displayed work-related symptoms among the 20 symptomatic workers in plant B, compared with 73% of the 26 symptomatic wo rkers in plant A. In plant B, the minimum level that was associated with work-related symptoms was 15-22 \u00b5g/m3, indicating a threshold level for elicitation of about 15 \u00b5g/m3. Similar occupational studies ha ve been reported for other organic acid anhydrides and for isocyanates (reviewed by Arts et al., 2006). For high molecular weight antigens, positive relationships between allergen exposure and work-related symp toms were also published. The prevalence of sensitized workers experi encing symptoms, the frequency of symptoms also Case-study 3 on halogenated platinum salts). Harmonization Project Document No. 10 104and their severity (e.g. measured as forced e xpiratory volume in 1 second) were correlated with the mean exposure concentrations of antig en in air for antigens such as wheat flour, seafood protein and wood dust (see Arts et al., 2006). Baur et al. (1998) reported that allergen exposures were not associated with an increased occurrence of asthma symptoms if levels stay ed below threshold limits. Corresponding data were available for wheat flour (1-2.4 \u00b5g/m3), fungal -amylase (0.25 ng/m3), natural rubber latex (0.6 ng/m3), western red cedar (0.4 \u00b5g/m3) and rat allergens (0.7 \u00b5g/m3). Studies investigating the variability of the NOE Ls or threshold concen trations in bronchial provocation tests are virtually lacking. While thresholds are mainly described for protein allergens, it should be noted that when testin g elicitation reactions in humans, it cannot be excluded that cross-reactions between chemicals forming \"immunologically similar\" haptens occur; therefore, a positive reaction against a ch emical does not necessarily indicate that the individual has also been sensitized through contact with this chemical. 6.3.2.2 Laboratory animal data (a) Induction For protein allergens, such as detergent enzy mes, guinea-pigs and mice have been used to demonstrate thresholds for induction (Kawabat a et al., 1996; Sarlo et al., 1997; Robinson et al., 1998). Guinea-pigs were expo sed by intratracheal instillation with different levels of enzyme protein, and sera from the animals we re evaluated for allergic antibody to the enzyme. The amount of antibody produced in res ponse to an enzyme was compared with the amount of antibody produced in response to the same protein dose of the reference allergen subtilisin A (Alcalase). Dose-response relationships and thresholds were also demonstrated in mice exposed 4 times by involuntary aspiration to a total protein extract from Penicillium chrysogenum (a common indoor mould) (Chung et al., 2005). Using four doses (10, 20, 50 and 70 \u00b5g), dose-dependent increases in eosinophil in bronc hoalveolar lavage tal IgE levels in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, an tigen-specific IgE levels in se rum and IL-5 levels in broncho- alveolar lavage fluid and increas ed severity of histopathologi cal lesions were demonstrated, with a NOEL of 20 \u00b5g protein. Increased allerg en-triggered immediate respiratory responses as well as nonspecific airway hyper-responsiven ess to methacholine as assessed by baro- metric whole-body plethysmography were demonstr ated only at the 70 \u00b5g exposure level. Because these exposures included all the mould pr oteins extracted, it is not possible to draw conclusions about administered dose of specific allergens. Matheson et al. (2005) investig ated a murine model of toluen e inhalation exposure to toluene diisocya by inhalation either subchronically for 6 weeks (0.14 \u00b5g/m3, 4 hours/day, 5 days/week) or by a 2- hour acute exposure at 3.6 \u00b5g/m3. Both groups were challenged 14 days later vi a inhalation with toluene diisocyanate at 0.14 \u00b5g/m3 for 1 hour. Mice that unde rwent the subchronic exposure regimen demonstrated a marked allergic response evidenced by increas es in airway inflam mation, eosinophilia, goblet hyper-responsivenes s, Th1/Th2 cytokine expression in the lung, elevated levels of se rum IgE and toluene diisocyanate-specific IgG antibodies, as well as the ability to transfer these pathologies to naiv e mice with lymphocytes or sera from toluene diisocyanate-exposed mice. In contrast, mice that received acute toluene Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 105diisocyanate exposure demonstrated increase d airway hyper-responsiveness, specific IgG antibodies and pathology in the lung consistent with asthma, but without the presence of elevated serum IgE, lung eosinophilia or increased cyt okine expression. In a similar study in guinea-pigs, Karol et al. (1980) demonstrated that animals exposed for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week, for 70 days to toluene diisocyanate at 1.8 \u00b5g/m 3 showed antibody production, whereas no toluene diisocyanate an tibodies were observed after exposure to 0.14 \u00b5g/m3. The aggregate exposures were (61.7 mg/m3)\u00b7h for the 0.14 mg/m3 group, compared with a (26.7 mg/m3)\u00b7h aggregate exposure that ha d induced antibody formation at 1.8 \u00b5g/m3 (3 hours/day for 5 days, NOEL 0.85 \u00b5g/m3) in the Karol (1983) study. In the latter study, a linear relationship was observed be tween log concentration (range 0.85-6.8 \u00b5g/m3) of toluene diisocyanate and the antibody response as well as the percentage of animals producing antibody to toluene diisocyanate. It wa s concluded that the exposure concentration (in combination with the duration of exposure) was important for establishment of antibody response, rather than total exposure. Brown-Norway rats were exposed to diphenyl methane diisocyanate (MDI) by inhalation on 5 consecutive days according to two concentration \u00d7 exposure time ( C \u00d7 t) regimens: 1000, 5000 or 10 000 (mg/m 3)\u00b7min at exposure durations of either 10 or 360 minutes (Pauluhn & Poole, 2011). Challenge exposures to MDI of 30 minutes each were done at 40 mg/m3 on days 20, 25, 50 and 65. After the last challenge , changes in breathing patterns and broncho- alveolar lavage fluids were examined. The mo st sensitive end-points were the number of neu- trophils in bronchoalveolar lava ge and physiological measurements of respiratory changes. The high concentration delivered for 10 minutes elicited a more vigorous response than the similar C \u00d7 t product at 360 minutes, suggesting that short, high-level exposures have a higher sensitizing potency than equal C \u00d7 t products at longer exposure periods. NOECs or BMCs can be derived from inhalati on studies in experimental animals and may serve as PODs for risk assessment. However, owing to the lack of a harmonized test guide-line for respiratory sensitization, uncertainty exists as to how such tests should be designed in terms of the lengths of the daily exposure, the total exposure pe riod (total number of exposure days) and the challenge concentration and read -out parameters. For the example of toluene diisocyanate, the same NOEC of 0.14 \u00b5g/m 3 was identified from workplace epidemiological studies and from a subchronic study in guinea-pi gs, indicating that on a case-by-case basis, a POD may be derived from repeated exposure studies in laboratory animals. With regard to aerosols and dusts, it is currently unknown whethe r the external exposure concentration used in laboratory animal studies is relevant for risk assessment or whether this value should be corrected through considering amounts of substa nce deposited on the surface of respiratory tract subcompartments by applying computational deposition models. One note of caution is that whereas there is no doubt that IgE antibody plays an important role in respiratory alle rgy to proteins, there is some debate about the suitability of IgE anti- body for the development of occupational asthma in response to low molecular weight com- pounds. Although there is evidence that all k nown chemical respirat ory allergens induce specific IgE in some symptomatic subjects, othe r subjects do not exhibit this response, and late-onset responses occur in th e absence of an immediate res ponse, particularly in allergy and asthma associated with diisocyanates (Carti er et al., 1989; Bernstein, 1996; Park et al., 1999; Bernstein et al., 2002). The animal mode ls described above clearly model human subjects who develop an IgE response. The de bate is whether information developed from these models would be protective for hu mans who do not develop IgE responses. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 106(b) Elicitation Most data on elicitation after inhalation expos ure obtained in animal models of respiratory sensitization were obtained after a single or a few induction exposures , but not after long- established respiratory sensitization. In addition, induction was often done by injection (Botham et al., 1989; Pauluhn & Mohr, 1994) or dermal application (Arts et al., 1998, 2004b; Zhang et al., 2004; Pauluhn, 2008) of the test s ubstance. Challenge was done with either free chemical or chemical-protein adducts. Paramete rs measured included functional respiratory and histopathological parameters as well as an tibody titres. It is uncertain whether the dose- response relationships (which often were not very clear) and NOEL/LOEL values reported are relevant for the situation in humans. Without further research into the topic of comparison of elicitation thresholds in humans and laboratory animals afte r long-established respiratory allergy, it is not recommended that a POD for risk assessment be de rived from laboratory animal studies. An example for the research on elicitation of respiratory tract reactions in laboratory animals is given in the following: Arts et al. (1998) investigated specific functional and histopatho- logical airway reactions to trimellitic anhydride following inhalation challenge as an exten- sion to the IgE test. Brown Norway rats were topically exposed to a fixed dose on days 0 and 7, total serum IgE was measured on day 20 or 2 1, and animals were subs equently challenged with various concentrations of tr imellitic anhydride (16, 31 and 52 mg/m3 on day 21 or day 22). A significant decrease in re spiratory rate during challenge , followed by an increase in breathing rate with a reduced tidal volume 24 hours after challenge, but without a dose- response relationship, was observe d at all concentrations test ed. A challenge concentration- dependent histopathological res ponse to trimellitic anhydride challenge was observed in the larynx and lungs. In a similar study using a wi der range of challenge concentrations (0.2- 61 mg/m3), a concentration-dependent increase in functional and histopathological changes and unspecific airway hype r-responsiveness were obser ved. The NOEC was 0.2 mg/m3 (Arts et al., 2004b). Interestingly, an elicitation NOEC of 0.2 mg/m3 was also found in Brown Norway rats treated dermally with trimellit ic anhydride powder under occlusion on days 0, 7, 14 and 21 and challenged by inhalati on at concentrations of 0.2-40 mg/m3 on day 35 (Zhang et al., 2004). Brown-Norway rats were exposed to MDI by inhalation on 5 c onsecutive days at C \u00d7 t products of 1000, 5000 or 10 000 (mg/m3)\u00b7min for either 10 or 360 minutes (Pauluhn & Poole, 2011). Challenge exposures to MDI of 30 minutes each were done at 40 mg/m3 on days 20, 25 and 50. On day 65, a challenge using a dose escalation regimen (5, 15 and 40 mg/m3) was used to determine the elicitation thre shold (measured as elevated numbers lavage fluid). An elicitation NOEC MDI-aerosol per cubic metre at 30 minutes' dur ation was identified. In topically sensitized rats, this NOEC was estimated to be 3 mg/m3 (estimated by linear extrapolation), suggesting that elicitation NOECs in rats sensitized to MDI by inhalation or skin exposure show no essential differences. 6.3.3 Oral and parenteral sensitization As noted above, all allergic responses are syst emic, in that sensitized immune cells can circulate throughout the body and can respond when challenge occurs at sites other than the original site of sensitization. However, for the allergic diseas es described a bove, the response to challenge is usually localized at the site of challenge. Oral exposur e (e.g. ingestion of food or medicaments) or parenteral administration of substances (e.g. drug injection) can also lead Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 107to sensitization. In these cases, allergic reactions may occur locally, such as at the site of injection or in the mouth or the stomach, but often involve more systemic responses. Food allergy is an example of a more systemic re sponse. IgE-mediated food allergies can cause symptoms in the skin (acute urticaria/angio- oedema and atopic dermatitis), the upper and lower respiratory tract, as well as the gastroin testinal tract. Typically, a sensitized individual will develop symptoms within minutes after ingesting the food. In addition, IgE-mediated reactions to food allergens have been reported to be one of the leading causes of anaphylaxis (a multiorgan reaction involving disseminated re lease of inflammatory mediators and circu- latory collapse) seen in emergency departme nts. Hymenoptera (e.g. honey bee) stings and administered drugs are the other common causes of anaphylactic reactions seen in medical facilities (Treudler et al., 2008). Immune-relate d problems are the largest single area of adverse events that are not detected by preclinic al testing of drugs (Olson et al., 2000). Many of these events are dermal reactions associ ated with systemic administration of drugs, although anaphylaxis is a more worrisome occu rrence (Weaver et al., 2003). Both oral and parenteral allergic reactions ha ve been difficult to model in animals, in part because these reactions occur with low fre quency in the human population and because genetic suscep- tibility is a significant factor. Estimates of the prevalence of food allergies vary dependi ng on the study. Approximately 6- 8% of children suffer from food allergy durin g their first 3 years of life (Sampson, 2005). Many of these children then go on to develop tole rance, and the prevalen ce of food allergy in adults is approximately 3% (Moneret-Vautrin & Morisset , 2005). Only a few foods are known to cause the vast majority of food allergies. In children, reactions are most commonly caused by eggs, peanuts, milk, soy and wheat, wh ereas the most common reactions for adults are to shellfish, fish, tree nut s and peanuts (Bernstein et al., 2003). True food allergy is distinct from food intolera nce, in that the latter does not involve immune mechanisms, although the symptoms generated may be sim ilar. Food allergies can be caused by IgE- mediated or non-IgE-mediated mechanisms, although IgE-mediated events are the most common and have generated the most attention. The SPT is typically used to diagnose IgE- mediated food allergy; however, double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge tests remain the gold standard for diagnosis (Sampson, 2005) . The application of biotechnology to food production, particularly genetic modification to c onfer pest resistance or increase nutritional value, has created the need to consider the pot ential that novel proteins introduced into the food supply could induce oral se nsitization. The introduction of new foods into a population by conventional methods (e.g. importation of kiwi) also occurs (Lucas et al., 2004). The study of oral sensitization is complicated because the normal response (in both rodents and humans) to ingestion of antig en is tolerance, a state of antigen-specific unresponsiveness (Saklayen et al., 1984; Strobel & Mowat, 1998; Christensen et al., 2003). This phenomenon is preferentially directed against IgE and DTH re sponses and in laboratory animal studies had been adoptively transferred by transplanti ng T cells (probably CD25+CD4+ regulatory T cells). Tolerance induction is gene tically determined, and high se nsitivity is co-inherited with low IgE responder phenotype, such that 1000- to 10 000-fold greater allergen exposure is required to tolerize high IgE responders. Toleran ce induction also appears to be a function of age, in that allergen exposure of neonates primes the indivi dual for subsequent T cell reac- tivity rather than tolerance, presumably due to delayed postnatal maturation of one or more key elements of mucosal immune function that are rate limiting in i nducing tolerance. Food allergy appears to be the result of a breach of oral tolerance. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 108The authors of this guidance docum ent think that in light of the currently available scientific data, it is premature to propose a quantitative risk assessment approach for alle rgic reactions following oral or parenteral e xposure. Currently, no validated te st methods for hazard identi- fication are available, and test systems deliverin g NOELs that could be used as starting points for a quantitative risk assessment are virtually lacking (with the exception of allergy elicita- tion in sensitized individuals). Regarding the elicitation of food alle rgy reactions in the general population, a probabilistic risk characterization appro ach has been proposed and suc- cessfully applied in some cases (Spanjersberg et al., 2007; Krui zinga et al., 2008; Madsen et al., 2009). However, the suitability of this met hod for oral and parenteral sensitization to chemicals has yet to be demonstrated, and therefore it is not recommended as an established standard method. A short overview of availabl e data is given in the next sections. 6.3.3.1 Clinical and epidemiological data (a) Induction There is no clinical information available on th e dose-response relationship associated with sensitization to chemicals, drugs or food consti tuents after oral or pa renteral exposure. Pub- lished data on anaphylactic res ponses to drugs are generally detected as a result of post- market surveillance, where the dose of drug admini stered is based on clinical efficacy. In the case of food allergy, induction of oral tolerance versus inducti on of sensitization complicates potential dose-response relationships. There is growing evidence that introduction of small amounts of peanuts early in life may prevent sensitiza tion (Khakoo & Lack, 2004), and variations in factors that cont ribute to potential sensitiza tion (Burks et al., 2008), including relevant route of exposure, form of allergen (Bowman & Selgrade, 2008b), age of sensitiza- tion, intestinal flora (Calder et al., 2006) and others, in addition to the large genetic com- ponent, are still poorly understood and would all likely affect the sens itization dose-response relationships. There are no known cases in whic h introduction of novel proteins via genetic modification of crops has resulted in a new food allergen for humans. (b) Elicitation Double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge, ge nerally used as a diagnostic tool, has only recently been adapted to provide data on thresholds. These studies have indicated a wide variability in the allergic subpopulation, and it is difficult to determine how well the patients tested represent the overall population and thus interpret findings in a population context. Regulatory authorities, such as the USFDA and European Food Safety Authority, have been reluctant to use currently availabl e data to set thresholds. Howeve r, it is clear that there are thresholds for individuals, and standardized prot ocols have been developed that could be used to generate sufficient data to draw conclusions about specific populations, at least for some of the most allergenic foods. It should be noted that the challenge matrix should be one of the real food matrices (Crevel et al., 2007, 2008). In one example of a double-b lind placebo-controlled food challe nge, data from 125 positive oral challenges to egg, 103 to peanut, 59 to milk and 12 to sesame seeds were analysed. LOEL values of 2 mg of egg, 5 mg of peanut, 0.1 ml of milk and 30 mg of sesame seed were found (Morisset et al., 2003). While thresholds are mainly described for prot ein allergens in food, it should be noted that when testing elicitation reac tions in humans, it cannot be excluded that cross-reactions Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 109between chemicals forming \"immunologically sim ilar\" haptens occur; therefore, a positive reaction against a chemical does not necessarily indicate that the individual has also been sensitized through contact with this chemical . Examples of cross-reactivity have been reported for drugs, such as -lactam antibiotics (Ant\u00fanez et al., 2006). In order to perform a pr obabilistic risk characterization (e. g. for food allergy), the statistical distribution of minimum eliciting doses in the sensitized population is necessa ry, rather than a POD, such as a NOEL or BMD (Spanjersberg et al., 2007; Kruizinga et al., 2008; Madsen et al., 2009). For drugs, there is little incentive to determine a threshold for elicitati on, because this would likely be below the level n eeded for clinical efficacy. 6.3.3.2 Laboratory animal data Currently, a number of animal models have been used to study various aspects of oral sensi- tization and oral tolerance, but none have been validated or adopted for use in hazard identification or the generation of dose-respons e data. For genetically modified foods, hazard identification employs a weight of evidence a pproach that takes into account a variety of factors and approaches for an overall assessment of allergenic potential. These various recommendations are based on what is known a bout allergens, including the history of exposure and safety of the gene source; ami no acid sequence identity to human allergens; stability to pepsin digestion in vitro; protein abundance in th e crop and processing effects; and, when appropriate, specific IgE binding stud ies or skin prick te sting (FAO/WHO, 2003). (a) Induction A recent report demonstrated that it was po ssible to distinguish allergenic from non- allergenic food extracts using oral exposure of C3H/HeJ mice with chol era toxin and antigen- specific serum IgE levels as the read-out. Do se-response relationships were demonstrated within a limited range (Bowman & Selgrade, 2008a). A second complementary model also distinguished between a llergenic and non-allergen ic food extracts based on the induction of tolerance following oral exposure (Bowman & Selgrade, 2008b). Neither of these models produced anaphylactic reactions. Another test proposed for haza rd identification is the IgE test in BALB/c mice employing intraperitoneal in jection of the test protein without adjuvant followed by determination of specific IgG and IgE formation (Dearman & Kimber, 2008). (b) Elicitation Another recent report demonstrated systemic anaphylaxis in BALB/c mice sensitized trans- dermally and challenged by the oral route. No attempt was made to develop a dose-response relationship (Birmingham et al., 2007). Both this model and those cited above require additional work before they can be applied to risk assessment. 6.3.3.3 Pseudoallergic reactions Although pseudoallergy is beyond the scope of this document, it is important to recognize that in some cases, exposure to chemicals can result in symptoms that mimic symptoms of allergy, but the underlying mechanisms are not specific immune-mediated responses. For example, aspirin-induced asthma may result fr om inhibition of cyclooxygenase by aspirin and Harmonization Project Document No. 10 110the shunting of arachidonic acid to the lipoxyge nase pathway. Under certain circumstances, this results in increased production of cystei nyl leukotrienes, which cause bronchoconstric- tion and/or increased responsiveness of th e airways (Stevenson & Szczeklik, 2006; National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, 2007), resemb ling the symptoms of allergic asthma. How- ever, aspirin-induced asthma does not invo lve antibody production or specific immune response. Certain drugs, incl uding radiocontrast media, liposomal drugs and micellar solvents, cause complement activation-related pseudoallergy. These agents activate comple- ment through both the classical and the altern ative pathways, giving rise to C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins that trigger rele ase of mediators from mast cells and basophils (Szebeni, 2005). Occasionally, food intoleran ces cause symptoms similar to those of food allergies. Substances that can trigger pseudoallergic food in tolerances include additi ves such as sulfites, tartrazine and glutamate. Pseudoallergic reactions can be triggered in various ways, such as interactions with the central or peripheral ne rvous system, nonspecific release of mediators, enzyme inhibition due to hereditary or pharm acologically induced enzyme deficiencies and pharmacological properties of some natural f ood constituents, such as biogenic amines. 6.3.4 Derivation of point of departure respiratory and systemic sensitization inducti on and elicitation. It is generally recommended that risk assessors not look at only a single test resu lt, although that study might be fully valid and provide a threshold or NOEL that may be used as a POD, but integrate all available information, both from laboratory animal studi es and from human st udies, case reports or otherwise documented experience in a weight of evidence approach. For the evaluation of HRIPTs, criteria for a robust HRIPT have been proposed (see, for example, McNamee et al., 2008). An example of a guideline for applying the weight of evidence approach to human and laboratory an imal skin sensitization induction data, which gives human data precedence over laboratory an imal data, has been proposed by Api et al. (2008) for the assessment of fragrance ingredients. Here, however, in the larger context, it is purposely left open as to whethe r human data should be prefe rred over labora tory animal data, because the scientific and ethical accepta nce of studies in volunteers differs between geographical regions and also de pends on the regulatory framework. Sometimes several studies with the same (or ve ry similar) experimental method are available; for example, for a given chemical, several LLNAs using the same or different vehicles may exist. In this case, a NOEL as a POD can be derived only after discussion of the weight and relevance of each result, considering, for ex ample, whether the study with the lowest LOEL should be given preference, whet her studies can be co mbined to derive a new LOEL (e.g. as a BMD), how studies with non-standa rd vehicles should be weighted or whether studies with vehicles and/or exposure conditions most closely resembling human exposure conditions should be regarded as best evidence. For the LLNA, it has been proposed that a vehicle-based mean EC 3 value be used (Api et al., 2008). If more than one EC 3 is available for a particular vehicle, a mean value for that vehicle is calculated first, and then the mean over a ll vehicles is derived (see worked example in 3 justified, because LLNA EC 3 values, when tested repeatedly, tend to vary within a factor of 2-3 from the mean value, and the variability of the EC 3 value caused by different vehiclesTable 6.1 summarizes the possibl e ways to derive a POD for risk assessment for skin, Case-study 4 on citral). Use of a vehicle-weighted mean, rather than the lowest EC value, is Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 111Table 6.1: Derivation of a POD for risk assessment for skin, respiratory and systemic sensitization induction and elicitation. Type of data Value used as a POD LOEL to NOEL extrapolation Skin sensitization: Induction Human data HRIPT (or HMT) NOEL (or BMD 5) (\u00b5g/cm2 skin per day) If NOEL is lacking and results with sensitization rates below 50% are available, the LOEL may be extrapolated by applying a factor of 3 to doses producing sensitization rates of 10-25% and a factor of 10 for sensitization rates of 25-50% (as proposed in Griem et al., 2003). Laboratory animal data LLNA in mice EC 3 (\u00b5g/cm2 skin per day) None required (see text) GPMT or Buehler test in guinea-pigs Generally not suitable for derivation of POD Not applicable Weight of evidence approach for grouping substance into a skin sensitizing potency category Use the lower boundary of potency category (expressed as \u00b5g/cm 2 skin per day) Not applicable Skin sensitization: Elicitation Human data Patch test BMD, e.g. MET 10 (\u00b5g/cm2 skin per day) Not applicable ROAT or product use test NOEL or BMD (\u00b5g/cm2 skin per day) Not applicable Laboratory animal data Currently not considered suitable for derivation of POD Respiratory sensitization: Induction Human data NOEC or BMC from epidemiological study (TWA concentration in mg/m3 or aggregate dose in (mg/m3)\u00b7h) Based on weight of evidence evaluation, when a NOEC is lacking and the lowest exposure level inducing sensitization can be regarded as the LOEC, the NOEC might be extrapolated by applying a factor of 3 or 10 to the LOEC. Laboratory animal data Only on case-by-case basis and using weight of evidence approach, NOEC or BMC from experimental study with repeated inhalation exposure (TWA concentration in mg/m 3 or aggregate dose in (mg/m3)\u00b7h) Based on weight of evidence evaluation, when a NOEC is lacking and the lowest exposure level inducing sensitization can be regarded as the LOEC, the NOEC might be extrapolated by applying a factor of 3 or 10 to the LOEC. Respiratory sensitization: Elicitation Human data NOEC or BMC from epidemiological or experimental study (TWA concentration in mg/m3 or aggregate dose in (mg/m3)\u00b7h) Based on weight of evidence evaluation, when a NOEC is lacking and the lowest exposure level inducing sensitization can be regarded as the LOEC, the NOEC might be extrapolated by applying a factor of 3 or 10 to the LOEC. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 112Table 6.1 (continued) Type of data Value used as a POD LOEL to NOEL extrapolation Laboratory animal data Currently not considered suitable for derivation of POD Oral and parenteral sensitization: Induction Currently, the database is not considered adequat e for developing a quantitative risk assessment approach. Oral and parenteral sensitization: Elicitation Currently, the database is not considered adequat e for developing a quantitative risk assessment approach. Thresholds for elicitation of systemic sensitization have been reported for allergenic food proteins, but not so far for chemicals. A probabili stic risk assessment approach, as proposed for food allergens, might be considered. BMD 5, benchmark dose for a 5% response leads to uncertainty in the risk assessment that is taken into account in setting the matrix assessment factor. 6.4 Biological plausibility 6.4.1 Weight of evidence approach for assessment of sensitization Hazard identification for sensitization should resu lt in weight of evidence conclusions based on the available human and laboratory animal da ta for a given chemical. The entire database of effects, both positive and negative, should be c onsidered in this process. For skin sensitiza- tion, evidence from epidemiological investigations or several case-studi es from more than one clinical centre reporting allergic contact dermatitis are usually considered sufficient evidence for identifying a skin sensitization hazard. Also, positive findings from laboratory animal tests that were performed accordi ng to OECD test guide lines under GLP provide sufficient evidence for this and several ca se-studies from more than one clinical centre are usually considered sufficient evidence. Labora tory animal studies on oral and parenteral sensitization are currently thought to provide eq uivocal evidence syst emic sensitization. animals that sensit ized and challenged by the inha lation route are considered to provide some evidence of resp iratory sensitization. Studies reporting sensitization after sen- sitization via instillation or topical or intrad ermal application are considered as equivocal evidence of respiratory sensitization. The weight of evidence conclusions are stre ngthened by consistenc y (particularly across species, sexes or related end-poi nts), SAR evaluations and biol ogical plausibility. Conflicting data should be evaluated by the strengths and we aknesses of the individual studies, as well as in the context of other effects on the immune system. Decision-trees to address skin sensitization, respiratory se nsitization and systemic hyper- situation and on the scope of the risk assessment, it may be advisable to address all routes of exposure, that is, to use all three decision-trees, or it may be sufficient to use only one decision-tree, if the relevant sensitization route has alrea dy been clearly identified: sensitivity are illustrated in Figures 6.2A, 6.2B and 6.2C, respectively. Depending on the data For respiratory sensitization, labor atory animal studies that dem onstrate allergic responses in 113 Figure 6.2A: Decision-tree for the assessment of sensitization and allergic response: skin sensitization. 114 Figure 6.2B: Decision-tree for the assessment of sensitization and allergic response: respiratory sensitization. 115 Figure 6.2C: Decision-tree for the assessment of sen sitization and allergic response: systemic sensitization. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 116 if data are available from epidemiological, clinical or experi mental human studies (HRIPT, HMT), from laboratory animal tests (LLNA, GPMT or Buehler test) or from in vitro tests or QSARs that indicate that the substance is a skin sensitizer. 9 If this is the case, a weig ht of evidence approach shoul d consider all data on sensi- tizing potency (e.g. NOEL from human tests, EC 3 from an LLNA or the lower boundary of the potency category into which the substance can be grouped) in order to derive a POD for a quantitative risk assessment. In this acceptable non- sensitizing skin area, doses can be deri ved by applying SAFs to the POD. If quantification of sensitizati on potency is not possible, a qualitative risk assess- ment approach should be used. If possi ble, a quantitative exposure assessment should be performed, the results of whic h are then compared with the derived acceptable dose in the risk characterization. The uses of the subs tance and relevant human exposure scenarios should be described. 9 If a subpopulation of individuals who are already se nsitized to the chemical exists, data on the elicitation potency of the chemical (e.g. as a BMD or NOEL from human elicitation patch tests or ROAT) ma y be available that allow a quantitative ment is done), again by applying an SA F to the POD, followed by quantitative exposure assessment and risk char acterization as described above. 9 If no hazard identification test reporting that the substance does not have to be classified as a skin sensitizer is availabl e, it has to be decided whether this is a data gap that needs to be filled by initiating a skin sensitization hazard identifica- as well as information on use and exposur e.

The eval uation might also purpos efully be limited to only one route of sensitization, dependi ng on the scope of the risk assessment. 6.4.2 Mode of action/mechanisms Hypersensitivity reactions were originally divi ded into four types (G ell and Coombs Types I- IV) based on immunological mechanism (Murphy et al., 2008). Types I-III were transferable by serum from affected animals to a naive animal and thus are described as antibody mediated, whereas Type IV required the transfer of lymphocytes. It should be noted that a number of the disease states involve both cell-mediated an d humoral components. For the purposes of this document, Types I and IV are the most relevant and will be described in more detail. Type I hypersensitivity is mediat ed by antigen-specific cytophilic antibody (u sually IgE) that binds to mast cells and basophils via Fc receptors. Some individuals have a genetic predispo- sition to develop IgE to common allergens (atopy ). These individuals ar e more likely than the general population to develop alle rgic rhinitis and asthma in response to environmental aller- gens. The dose of antigen, route of exposure an d local milieu influence the development of cytophilic antibodies. In a sensiti zed individual, upon subsequent exposure, the allergen binds to cytophilic antibodies on mast cells. Allergen cross-linking of the Fc receptor-bound anti- body causes the release of preforme d mediators such as histamine from the mast cell. In addi- tion, immediate activation of ar achidonate metabolism in the cel l membranes occurs, and the generation of prostanoids (primarily prostagl andin D2) and peptidyl-leukotrienes ensues. These mast cell mediators are thought to be la rgely responsible for the acute symptoms of hypersensitivity seen when these reactions occur in the skin (urticaria), upper respiratory tract (allergic rhinitis or hay fever; congestion, it ching, sneezing, cough) or lung (allergic asthma; bronchoconstriction). In the most severe form, a multisystem Type I hypersensitivity re- sponse (systemic anaphylaxis) can result in severe airway obstruction and cardiovascular collapse, leading to anaphylactic shock and poten tially death. Type I hypersensitivity is also called immediate-type hypersensitivity because the initial reaction can occur within minutes after exposure of a previously sensiti zed individual to the offending antigen. Type IV reactions are mediated by activated T cells rather than antibodies. Much has been learned about T cells since the four hypersensiti vity classifications were originally proposed. As a result, the Type IV res ponses can now be divided into three subtypes, mediated by different populations of T cells: CD4+ Th1 a nd Th2 cells and et al., CD4+ Th1 and Th2 cells recognize modi fied extracellular proteins presented in the context of MHC class II mo lecules and activate macrophages, which release a variety of cytokines and chemokines, leading to inflamma tion characterized by the influx of neutro- phils. CD8+ T cells are cytotoxic and attack cells bearing modified intracellular proteins that are presented on the cell surface in the contex t of MHC class I molecules. Th1 and CD8+ reactions generally occur 24-48 hour s after exposure in a previ ously sensitized individual and are thus referred to as DTH. Th2 cells (in ad dition to facilitating class switching to IgE) mobilize and activate eosinophils an d mast cells. Mast cell activa tion results in production of Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 118As noted above, Type I hypersensitivity is the MOA associated with the most commonly studied food and drug allergies. Allergic cont act dermatitis is a Type IV reaction involving several types of T cells. During the induction phase of this response, the chemical (hapten) couples to carrier proteins on dermal and epid ermal cells to become fully immunogenic. The Langerhans cells take up and process the antigen and migrate to the regional draining lymph node, where they present the antigen to lympho cytes. Activation and ra pid proliferation of lymph node cells ensue, resulti ng in the production of effector and memory T cells, which travel back to the skin. During the elicitation phase, effector Th1 and CD8+ and pruritus th at characteristically appear 24-72 hours post- exposure. The application of hapten to the skin initia tes a cascade of events. Epidermal keratinocytes [GM-CSF]) that facilitate the maturation and mobilization of Langerhans cells, which also produce cytokines in an autocrine fashion. During Langerhans cell maturation, expression of cell surface mo lecules, including MHC class I and II and adhesion and costimulatory molecules, is enhan ced, thus facilitating antigen presentation and subsequent T cell activation and clonal expansio n. T cells activated in this manner express a skin homing receptor, cutaneous lymphocyte a ssociated antigen. Although T cells are thought to be the key effector cells in the development of contact hypersensitivity, both T and B lymphocytes proliferate in response to contact sensitizers. Re-exposure to the relevant hapten triggers the same cytokine responses that occur following induction and elicits a response characterized by rapid recruitment and activation of specific T cells at the site of hapten challenge. Hapten-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes , likely the population, are directly cytotoxic to chemical -exposed keratinocytes and also release cytokine s that boost the inflammatory response. In addition, Th1 cells release a number of cytokines and chemokines that promote inflammation and activate mast ce lls and, in the presen ce of IFN, are also capable of killing keratinocytes. Although the hapt en may persist in skin for some time, this reaction is self-limited. CD4+ re gulatory T cells that secrete IL -10 appear to play an import- ant role in this regulation. Allergic asthma involves both Type I and Type IV responses. Sensitized individuals respond to antigen challenge with an immediate IgE- mediated Type I response. Between 2 and 8 hours after this event, a more severe and prol onged (late phase) reac tion secre tion, bronchoconstriction, airw ay hyper-responsiveness to a variety of nonspecific stimuli (e.g. histamine, methacholine, cold air) and airway inflamma- tion characterized by eosinophils. Late-phase re sponses may last up to 12 hours and do not appear to be mediated by IgE. Th2 cells and as sociated cytokines (particularly IL-5 and IL- 13) and eosinophils are thought to play a sign ificant role. Protein allergens have been shown to produce se nsitization and respirator y allergic responses (both early and late phase) in humans, guinea- pigs and mice. Additionally, they have been strongly associated with asthma morbidity. Of the low molecula r weight chemicals that have been associated with allergic asthma, certain diisocyanates and acid anhydrides have received the most attention. Whereas protein allergens char acteristically result in antigen-specific IgE, the presence of allergen-specific IgE in low molecular weight chemical respiratory allergy has not been universally demonstrated. In addition, the early-phase response does not always occur in individuals with occupational asthma triggered by these low molecular weight com- pounds. The mechanisms underlying low molecular weight chemical resp iratory allergy are still under inve stigation. Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 119Mechanisms underlying the induction of IgE have been studied extensively. There are two primary requirements for B cell immunoglobulin isotype class switching from IgM to IgE: 1) the presence of the Th2-associated cytokine IL-4 (or IL-13) and 2) direct cell to cell interac- tion via CD40 expressed on B cells and CD40 ligand (CD40L) expressed on T cells, baso- phils and mast cells. IL-4 exhibits autocrine activity in Th2 cell diffe rentiation and promotes mast cell development. Bone marrow-derived immature mast cell precursors localize under the epithelium of mucosal areas (respiratory tr act and gut) and the skin, where tissue-specific maturation and expansion occur. These mast cells contain preforme d mediators and are capable of producing other effect er molecules, including IL-4 and IL-5. The IgE-armed mast cells in the respiratory tract are then set for elicitation of antigen-specific allergic events. Upon subsequent exposure, the sp ecific allergen cro sslinks the mast ce ll-bound IgE, resulting in the release of the preforme d mediators and newly synthesi zed substances. Chief among the preformed mediators is histam ine, which acts through receptor ligation to ca use increased vascular are a vari ety of preformed cellular chemotactic factors and enzymes. Products from the activation of two metabolic pathways of membrane-derived arachidonic acid, Th2-asso ciated cytokine IL-5, secreted by mast cells, has been shown to be essential in prolifera tion and maturation of eo sinophil precursors as well as viability and eosinophil granule protein rel ease and chemotaxis. Eosinophils that are recruited into the lung release their own set of mediators, wh ich are thought to be important in late-phase responses. Furthermore, cytoki activ- ated eosinophils found at the site of allergic inflammation may result in a positive feedback loop. 6.5 Uncertainty factors The uncertainty factor approach can, in general, be applied to the POD in order to derive AELs for sensitizing substances. Levels lower th an the derived AELs with regard to sensiti- zation and elicitation are then considered with out appreciable risk of sensitization of non- sensitized subjects and elicitation of allergic re actions in already sensitized subjects, respec- tively. The acceptability or unaccep tability of real-life expos ure situation with respect to sensitization induction or allergy elicitation ca n then be determined accordingly (see follow- ing sections). Individual uncerta inty factors that account for in terspecies and intraspecies variability and, if necessary, a matrix factor and a factor for use and prolonged exposure are combined by multiplication into a total SAF. Below, the factors will be discussed individ-ually, one after the other. It should, however, be noted that some parameters, such as vehicle effects and skin barrier, may be discussed in th e derivation of more than one of these factors. Therefore, it should be ensured that the total SAF is adequate when combining the individual factors. 6.5.1 Interspecies uncertainty factor An interspecies uncertainty factor is generall y used for extrapolating results from laboratory animals to humans. An interspecies uncertainty factor of 1 is applied when the POD is derived from human data\u2014for example, HRIPT results for induction of of respir in humans contact dermatitis, resp iratory allergy or oral allergy. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 120With regard to the induction of skin sensitizat ion, much work has been done to correlate the dose-response data obtained in the mouse LLNA with what is known about sensitizing potency in humans. The LLNA EC 3 value has been found to clos ely correlate with the NOEL from human sensitization tests when the skin area dose (\u00b5g/cm2) is used as the dose metric for both (Basketter et al., 2000, 2005a; Gerberick et al., 2001a,b, 2004; Griem et al., 2003; Schneider & Akkan, 2004). For the variability in test outcomes betw een humans and labora- tory animals, it is not possible to distinguish tr ue interspecies differen ces from experimental influences, such as dose intervals and vehicl e effects. Interspecies differences may, for example, be related to differences in skin pe netration and metabolism. With regard to skin penetration, use of rodent data is considered conservative, because mice and rats tend to show a considerably higher skin penetr ation for chemicals compared with humans (a 3- to 10-fold higher penetration is often reported) (Barber et al., 1992; Boogaard et al., 2000). Metabolism may have limited relevance for the variability between humans and mice, because only local metabolism is relevant. Systemic toxicokinetic differences (e.g. allometric differences) are not considered to play an important role in skin sensitization. In line with this is the observa- tion that sensitizing chemicals that require meta bolism into \"ultimate sensitizers\" do not show a larger variability in terms of human NOEL and LLNA EC 3 values than do chemicals that do not need to be metabolized (Griem et al., 2003) . Based on these analyses, an interspecies un- certainty factor of 3 has been proposed when the LLNA, in the absence of supporting human data, is used to derive a POD for quantitativ e hazard characterization (Griem et al., 2003). When assessing inhalation toxicity, the toxic okinetic component of th e interspecies uncer- tainty factor is usually set to 1 when exposur e concentrations in air are compared between laboratory animals and humans, be cause respiratory parameters for the different species will implicitly contain allometric differences. For loca l effects on the respiratory tract, the toxico- dynamic component of the interspe cies uncertainty factor is al so often reduced to 1. In the case of toluene diisocyanate, the same NOEC was identified from workplace epidemiological studies and from a subchronic study in guinea- pigs. The observation that for skin sensitizers the skin area doses of human NOELs and LLNA EC 3s were very similar supports the view that the underlying immunologica l mechanisms are comparable in qualitative and quantitative terms between laboratory animals and humans and th at this could also be true for respiratory sensitization. However, too few data are available to draw general conclusions on the inter-species ratios of NOECs (or LOECs) for respiratory sensitization. With regard to aerosols and dusts, the external exposure concentration should be corrected in order to take into account particle size limits that may be inhalable or respirable, respectively, in laboratory animals compared with humans. Further, the applicati on of computational depo- sition models may sometimes support species comparison. A weight of evidence evaluation assessing chemi cal-specific and other relevant information is recommended to decide on the appropriate va lue for the interspecies uncertainty factor. 6.5.2 Intraspecies uncertainty factor This uncertainty factor accounts for possible vari ations in the sensitiv ity between individuals due to factors such as genetic effects, inhere nt barrier function, age, sex and ethnicity. For skin sensitization, some inform ation on these contributing fact ors is available and is dis- cussed below (see Felter et al., 2002; Griem et al., 2003; Api et al., 2008). Much less infor- mation is available for respiratory sensitizat ion, and virtually nothin g has been published regarding oral and parent eral sensitization. It should be no ted that the following influencing Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 121factors are usually not consider ed one by one, but are combined in one intraspecies uncer- tainty factor. 6.5.2.1 Genetic effects With regard to skin sensitization, genetic factors, although not co mpletely understood, are clearly relevant in determining individual suscep tibility (Felter et al., 2002). It is well estab- lished that skin enzymes, predominantly located in the epidermis, can metabolize absorbed xenobiotics via reactions analogous to those de termined in the liver (Smith & Hotchkiss, 2001). Thus, genetically determined differences in metabolic capabilities might be expected to influence an individual's susceptibility to the induction of allergic contact dermatitis. Smith et al. (2000) proposed that one of the reasons for differen ces in individua l responses to the same exposure to an allergen may be related to their susceptibility to skin irritation, such that those in whom the epider mal irritant response reaches a sufficient threshold level are more likely to be sensitized. Differences in individual susceptibility may also influence the magnitude of response by affecting other steps in the process of inducing (or eliciting) an allergic response. Regarding the role of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) (the name for the human MHC genes) class II molecules in the development of oc cupational respiratory tract sensitization and asthma, particularly to low molecular weight agents, it was shown that the DQB1*0501 allele is a genetic risk factor for asthma induced by low molecular weight sensitizers such as organ- ic acid anhydrides (Jones et al., 2004). The sa me allele is relevant for asthma induced by isocyanates (Mapp et al., 2000) and plicatic acid , where it has a protective role (Horne et al., 2000), suggesting various affinities of chemical sensitizers for the corresponding specific HLA class II molecules. In the epidemiological study in bakery worker s conducted by Heederik & Houba (2001), the prevalence rates of wheat allergy in atopics we re about twice as high as in non-atopics over the whole exposure range. 6.5.2.2 Inherent barrier function The inherent barrier function of the skin is one f actor likely to affect individual susceptibility. The initial step in the induction and elicitation of allergic contact dermatitis requires that the allergen penetrate the stratum corneum. For example, nickel -allergic individuals showed about 10-fold lower elicitation thresholds when patch testing was performed on skin that showed slight inflammatory changes and dryne ss due to repeated contact with detergent solution (Allenby & Basketter, 1993, 1994). Dermal sensitization risk assessments will usua lly be conducted on he althy skin and not on diseased skin. Individuals with diseased sk in (e.g. psoriasis and eczema) may, on the one hand, show a considerably higher permeation of xenobiotics through the affected skin areas; on the other hand, their skin exposure may be re stricted, as it can be assumed that many of these individuals are under the care of a dermatologist. In a ddition, age, ethnicity and sex may have an influence on inherent barrier function in healthy skin. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 1226.5.2.3 Sex Although there is some indication that female s are the more reactiv e responder population to contact allergens (Jordan & King, 1977; Rees et al., 1989), the weight of evidence suggests that females and males react similarly (Robins on, 1999; Felter et al., 2002). Those differences that have been noted in the general popula tion for percentages of men and women with specific contact allergies can often be attributed to use a nd exposure differences; for example, women are more prone to contact allergies to ni ckel (from jewellery, especially pierced ears), whereas men are more likely to be allergic to chromium as a result of occupational exposures (Young et al., 1988). 6.5.2.4 Ethnicity The weight of evidence indicates that there is no substantial difference in susceptibility to induction of contact allergy am ong individuals of different et hnic origins. In a study of induction by five common skin allergens, Klig man (1966) reported little difference in the response between individuals with highly pigmen ted skin and Caucasians for the strongest allergens. With less potent alle rgens, Kligman (1966) found that those with highly pigmented skin were increasingly resistant to the inductio n of sensitization compared with the response in Caucasians. Some controversy remains as to the sensitivity of Asians relative to Cauca- sians. In regard to percutaneous absorption of chemicals into the skin, highly pigmented skin is generally considered to be somewhat more impervious than Caucasian skin (Weigand et al., 1974). 6.5.2.5 Age The general susceptibilities of infants and adul ts to contact allergens are essentially equal (Cassimos et al., 1980). The structural and func tional skin barrier properties are equal from full-term infancy to late a dulthood (Cunico et al., Rasmussen, 1983; Harpin & Rutte r, 1983). This is in terms of epidermal thickness, density of epidermal cell layers, cellu lar structure, functional stratum corneum and mature skin barrier function. Therefore, no ad justment of uncertainty factors for age is currently considered necessary. 6.5.2.6 Summary In summary, several of the points discussed above argue that interindividual variability exists and thus should be covered by an intraspecies factor. For elic itation, it should also be con- sidered that the POD used for risk assessment is already based on the oc currence of effects in the most susceptible individuals. Using a P OD determined in the most susceptible subpopu- lation could argue for a redu ced intraspecies factor. Values that have been used in risk assessments of sensitizers are, for example, an intraspecies factor of 10 for dermal induction (Felter et Basketter et al., 2003; Griem et al., 2003; Api et al., 2008), factor s of 3 and 10 for respirator y induction (OEHHA, 2000, 2001; NCDENR, undated) and a of 1 for elicitation of contact a llergy (Nethercott et al., 1994; Griem et al., 2003). A weight of evidence evaluation assessing chemi cal-specific and other relevant information is recommended to decide on the appropriate va lue for the intraspecies uncertainty factor. Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 1236.5.3 Matrix factor Besides the uncertainty factors routinely used in toxicological risk assessment, the use of additional factors has been proposed in some in stances to reflect special circumstances with regard to sensitization. A matrix factor is sometimes applied wh en exposure to a sensitizer is done in pure form or in a simple vehicle in the experimental situation, whereas in the use scenarios to be assessed, the sensitizer is co ntained in a complex matrix that may alter the toxicokinetic behaviour or may its elf promote sensitizing effects. The matrix factor concept was originally developed for cosmetic safety assessment (Felter et al., 2002; Api et al., 2008; Basketter et al., 20 08). Here, the consumer can be exposed to sensitizing ingredients in many different pr oduct forms (e.g. cream, shower gel, eau de toilette) that show varying complexity, ranging from a simple ethanol to multiphase creams. In the experimental situation, exposure to sensiti zers is typically in a simple vehicle. In con- trast, some consumer product formulations not on ly contain an inert ve hicle, besides the sen- sitizer in question, but also may contain ingredients that ar e irritants or penetration enhancers. Therefore, the effect of a complex formulation/ matrix on the bioavailability of a sensitizer may be substantially different from that of a simple vehicle (Felter et al., 2002). A case-by-case evaluation ha s to be done to decide if the use of a matrix factor is suitable for the risk assessment that is being developed. 6.5.3.1 Irritants Dermal irritants are known to compromise the skin barrier (Robinson et al., 2000). They are also known to serve as a promoter of dermal se nsitization (Smith et al., 2000). It is apparent that some degree of direct ch emical inflammation or other c oncurrent trauma enhances the keratinocyte activity, produced by the applied ch emical itself, by some other component of the chemical delivery system or by some form of physical insult. Th is may account for the noted enhancing effect of primary skin ir ritation on the sensitiz ation response (Kligman, 1966; Cumberbatch et al., 1993). 6.5.3.2 Penetration enhancers Some chemicals are specifically known to aff ect the penetration of other chemicals through the stratum corneum (Scheuplein & Ross, 1970; Schaefer & Redelmeier, 1996). As such, it remains important to understand the experimental matrix/vehicle as to its effect on the pene- tration of a sensitizer, as it will affect the bioa vailability of the material in the experimental situation. Typically, however, ther e is very little information available about the bioavailabil- ity of a sensitizer in either the experi mental situation or real-life scenario. For most cosmetic products, a matrix factor of 3 was proposed when a NOEL from an HRIPT was used for hazard characterization (Api et al., 2008). Regarding inhalation, the terms matrix and vehi cle might not be well chosen; however, it is known that both sensitization a nd allergy elicitation can be influenced by concomitant expo- sure to substances causing respiratory tract irri tation and/or activation of alveolar cells. The adjuvant effect of irritant gases and particles is most likely caused by the activation of epithelial cells, pneumocytes, alveolar macrophage s and dendritic cells. Alteration of the bio- availability of the sensitizing compound, as di scussed above for the skin, probably does not Harmonization Project Document No. 10 124play a prominent role in the respiratory tract, although it has also been discussed in the litera- ture that sorption of sensitizers to inhalable particles can influence their deposition in the respiratory tract and their toxicokinetic behaviour. Significant increases in ovalbumin-specific IgE, IgG and IgA antibody titres were seen in rats after weekly exposure to ovalbumin (18 mg/m3 for 0.5 hour) with additional nitrogen dioxide exposure (164 mg/m3 for 1 hour either 1 day before or immediately after the ovalbumin expo- sure) compared with rats exposed only to ovalb umin. In contrast, ammonia did not influence antibody titres, although it caused ir ritant effects (Siegel et al., 1997). Increased IgE levels in response to ovalbumin in serum of mice were also found after co-e xposure to ovalbumin (intranasal sensitization on days 0 and 14 and ch allenge on days 35, 38 and 41 with 50 \u00b5l of a 0.4 mg/ml ovalbumin solution) and diesel exhaus t particles (3 mg/ml, mixed with ovalbumin) (Steerenberg et al., 2003). Epidemiological studi es have also suggested a correlation between traffic exhaust particle exposure and the prevalen ce of asthma and/or sensitization to common allergens, such as pollen and house dust mites (Janssen et al., 2003) . However, it is currently unclear whether all respiratory irritants exert this effect or to what extent. 6.5.4 Use and time factor Besides the uncertainty factors routinely used in toxicological risk assessment, the use of additional factors has been proposed in some in stances to reflect special circumstances with regard to sensitization. A use and time factor is sometimes applied when the real-life scenario differs from the experimental situ ation with regard to skin site location, skin barrier integrity, occlusion and frequency of exposure. The use factor concept was originally develope d for cosmetic safety assessment (for review, see Api et al., 2008). Whereas use conditions in experiments are well defined and controlled (e.g. site of contact, skin in tegrity, operator controlled, numb er and duration of exposures), use conditions in real-life scenarios in almost all cases involve less ex aggerated exposure, are more variable and are within consumers' cont rol. The key parameters to consider when extrapolating from the controlled experimental situation to the r eal-life scenario are site of contact, barrier integrity, occlus ion and frequency of exposure. A case-by-case evaluation ha s to be done to decide whether the use of a use and time factor is suitable for the risk assessment that is being developed. 6.5.4.1 Site of contact Regional differences in dermal absorption can be substantial. For example, Feldmann & Maibach (1967) measured the re lative regional permeability of human skin from various body sites to 14C-labelled hydrocortisone. Of 11 sites eval uated, the skin of the back (where most patch studies are conducted) was intermedia te in relative permeabili ty. The plantar foot arch was correspondingly about 12-fold less permeab le than the skin of the back, whereas the scalp and axillae were about 2-fold more permeab le and the forehead was about 3-fold more permeable. As the permeability on the back and th e arm (the sites of contact for most human experimental sensitization tests) is intermediate , it is not unlikely that some products contain- ing a skin sensitizer will have contact with body sites that may be significantly more per- meable. Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 1256.5.4.2 Barrier integrity As mentioned in the discussion of the intraspeci es uncertainty factor, barrier integrity can be inherent, but it can also be in fluenced by use practices. Factor s influencing dermal integrity are known to have a significan t effect on dermal penetration. This might include, for example, dermatitis in an adult (Benfeldt et al., 1999), the presence of diaper rash in infants (Odio & Friedlander, 2000) and, although less dramatic, shaving (Edman, 1994). 6.5.4.3 Occlusion Occlusion of the skin results in multiple effect s, including increases in the hydration of the stratum corneum, skin temperature, microbial count, pH and dermal i rritation. The increase in hydration state, in particular, has been associat ed with increased derm al penetration, although occlusion does not increase the absorption of al l chemicals, and the relative effect of occlu- sion is likely to be dependent on the lipophilicity of the chem ical (Zhai & Maibach, 2001). For many cosmetic products, a use factor of ei ther 3 or 10 was proposed when a NOEL from an HRIPT was used for hazard characterization (Api et al., 2008). 6.5.4.4 Frequency of exposure (time extrapolation) Whereas induction and elicitation are usually de termined after one e xposure (e.g. for elicita- tion in patch test or experime ntal animal study) or a few e xposures (e.g. elicitation in ntal situations, the question arises as to whether a lower dose w ould suffice for sensitization if repeated expo- sures over a longer time occurred. In this context, a few publications on so-called subclinical skin sensitization might be relevant. Ford et al. (1988) reported on an HRIPT using hydroxy- citronellal in which groups of 66 subjec ts each were treated with 4200, 8400 or 12 600 \u00b5g/cm2 during induction. One subject each of th e two highest exposure groups showed a positive challenge reaction. After 6 months, 100 of the panelists who had completed the first HRIPT took part in a second HRIPT with hydr oxycitronellal. During the first and second weeks of the induction phase of the second HRIPT, 29% of the subjects showed signs of allergic contact dermatitis. This result indica tes that, at least for hydroxycitronellal, detectable sensitization needs longer to develop than the time between induction ph ase and challenge in the HRIPT (10-14 days). It is unknown whethe r this phenomenon occurs only at small area doses (i.e. those just beneath th e sensitization threshold), whethe r it occurs with most or only a few sensitizing chemicals and which mechanis m is involved (e.g. slow release of sensitizer initially bound to the upper skin layer [stratum corneum]). Similar observations have also been made with 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (Fri edmann et al., 1990). In addition, Vandenberg & Epstein (1963) performed a sens itization test with nickel chlo ride and found that in a first sensitization test, 16 of 172 (9%) previously non-nickel-allergic subjects were sensitized, whereas upon repetition of the sensitization te st 4 months later with 19 subjects who had shown a negative result in the first challenge test, 5 (19%) we re successfully sensitized. Although it is currently difficult to describe this phenomenon quantitatively owing to the limited data available, it has be en proposed to take time extra polation into consideration to account for a possibly higher sensitizing chemi cal upon continued or repeated exposure (Griem et al., 2003). Harmonization Project Document No. 10 1266.5.5 Database uncertainty factor In some cases, a limited data set may suggest the possibility of allergic effects without appro- priate data to make a determination of th e sensitization risk or perform a dose-response assessment. In such cases, use of a database uncer tainty factor may be considered to indicate that the lack of sufficient information on this end-point may be significa nt. As internationally accepted test guidelines for skin sensitization h azard are available and test results for skin sensitization are in most cases available, the mentioned data gaps will more often relate to respiratory and/or oral sensit ization for which sometimes anecdotal evidence may exist and which, owing to the lack of internationally ac cepted test guidelines, cannot be addressed in a straightforward manner. Sometimes, for the lack of better suited studies, a POD for quantitative risk assessment has to be derived from a study in which confidence is considered low. In these cases, the database uncertainty factor may be used to address the use of a low-confidence st udy in the derivation of AELs. On a case-by-case basis, a justification for the application of an uncertainty factor should be provided to address da tabase deficiency. For further discussion of the database 6.6 Groups at risk (devel oping immune system, elderly, immunocompromised) Much information relevant under this heading ha s already been summarize d in the discussion With regard to skin sensitiz ation, several studie s address the importanc e of including subpop- ulations, such as those with multiple allergie s, who may be more susceptible (Friedmann & Moss, 1985; Moss et al., 1985; Felter et al., 20 02). However, the diffe rences in terms of thresholds for induction and elicitation seem to be well below 1 order of magnitude. Similar to skin sensitization, existing respiratory sensitization (e.g. allergic asthma) seems to exert some limited influence on the risk of developing respiratory allergy to additional res-piratory sensitizers. In their review, Mapp et al. (2005) wrote that atopy (ski n reactivity to common inhalants) is a predis posing factor in workers expos ed to high molecular weight agents, but it is a weak pred ictor of sensitization and deve lopment of occupational asthma. Atopy is not a risk factor for asthma induced by low molecular weight agents such as western red cedar or diisocyanates. For exposure to hi gh molecular weight wo rk-related allergens, subjects with new occupational se nsitization are at grea ter risk of developi ng sensitization to common aeroallergens than are subjects without sensitization. However, after removal or diminution of exposure to both low and high molecular weight agents causing occupational asthma, subjects are not at incr eased risk for developing IgE- mediated sensitization to com- mon allergens, indicating that atopic status does not increase even years after the diagnosis of occupational asthma. There is no compelling evidence to suggest that the elderly are more su sceptible to the induc- tion and elicitation of sk in, respiratory or systemic sensi tization (Bakos et al., 2006). In gen- eral and as discussed above, there are no indica tions that children are much more susceptible to developing allergies. However, it is difficu lt to evaluate this point because, once acquired, allergies tend to persist througho ut life. Therefore, higher incidence rates for skin and respiratory allergies during childhood do not nece ssarily indicate a higher susceptibility. The uncertainty factor, the reader is re ferred to the discussion in chapter 3. on the intraspecies uncertainty factor (see section 6.5.2) and will not be repeated here. Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 127question as to whether a susceptible person would be less likely to get a sensitization if not exposed before adulthood cannot be answered fr om the currently available data. Currently, no adjustment of uncertainty factors for age is considered necessary. 6.7 Derivation of acceptable exposure level above and is calculated by multiplying the inters pecies, intraspecies, ma trix and use and time factors. As discussed above, this approach is curren tly considered appli cable for skin and respiratory sensitization. Divi ding the exposure level that was defined as the POD for risk assessment by the total SAF will result in a da ily exposure dose at which it is considered unlikely that induction of sensitiz ation or elicitation of allergic reactions will occur, or the AEL. The AEL is also termed the \"accepta ble non-sensitizing dose/concentration\" or \"acceptable non-eliciting dose/concentration\". Another approach that has been applied to sens itizing detergent enzymes is to use relative potency data from experimental tests to derive safe levels relative to a well-characterized reference allergen. Induction potency information, includi ng thresholds, for enzymes may be determined in guinea-pigs and mice (Kawabat a et al., 1996; Sarlo et al., 1997; Robinson et al., 1998). Subtilisin (trade na me Alcalase) was chosen as the reference allergen because the American Conference of Governmental and Industrial Hygienists dev- eloped a threshold limit value in the workplace fo r subtilisin A of 60 ng of protein per cubic metre based on historical human data. The dose- response relationships of new enzymes were compared with that of subtilis in and used to determine the po tency factor di fference between subtilisin and the new enzymes. For less pote nt and equivalent enzymes, the occupational exposure guidelines used for subtilisin were assumed to be safe for the new enzyme. For more potent enzymes, the occupational exposure guideline was lowered according to the potency factor derived by comparing the two dose-response curves. Workers exposed to new enzymes at these levels were monitored for ne w sensitization via annu al or semiannual SPTs, and results were similar to that observed for su btilisin (i.e. no more than 0-3% new sensitiza- tions per year, and, as with allergic symp toms were not observ ed; Sarlo et al., 1997). 6.8 Exposure assessment Exposure assessment comprises the qualitative a nd quantitative description of the contact of an individual with a chemical for specific durations of time (IPCS, 2009). For exposure to occur, an individual must be pr esent and must come into contact with the pure chemical or the medium containing the chemical. Exposure usually results in absorbed dose when chemi- cals enter the body. Exposure is described in term s of the intensity (concentration), frequency and duration of contact (USEPA, 1992). General methods for experimental measuremen t of exposure as well as for modelling expo- sure using computational models and for desc ribing ECHA, 2010a,b) . aggregate exposure can be found in USEPA (2001). It is beyond the scope of this guidance document to summarize the complexity of and various appr oaches to exposure a ssessment or even to provide detailed guidance on how exposure assessment should be done and documented in the context of sensitization risk assessment. When characterizing exposure to sensitizing chemicals, the relevant route (d ermal, inhalation or systemic , or combinations of these), The total SAF is a combination of the uncertain ty and other factors de fined in section 6.5 Harmonization Project Document No. 10 128general use, exposure context (e.g. single, in termittent, daily, continuous), regulatory frame- work (e.g. workplace, cosmetics, household produc ts, biocides, artists' paints, medicinal products) and exposed (sub)popula tion will influence the select ion of experimental and computational tools used to generate numerical exposure descriptors and the format in which these are documented. assessment for skin sensitizers in cosmetic and household products based largely on the pro- posed method for sensitizing fragrance ingredient s by the International Fragrance Association (IFRA)/Research Institute fo r Fragrance Materials (RIFM). The case-study on soluble this group of respiratory sensitizers. skin sensitizing substances is the daily substance dose per area of skin (\u00b5g/cm2 per day). This represents the aggregate exposure, defined as the total area dose of a chemical to one skin site from different sources over 1 day (cf. Co wan-Ellsberry & Robinson, 2009). It should be noted that this represents a pragmatic approach because, although aggregating exposure from different sources/products contacted within a s hort period of time is certainly required, there are at present no data available that would allow defining the adequate length of the time period. This uncertainty, however, is cove red by applying the use and time factor. Exposure to respiratory sensitizing substances can be described as a TWA concentration (mg/m 3 during a day or an 8-hour workshift); ho wever, sometimes peak exposure concentra- tions or aggregate exposure values may also be useful exposure metrics. Although there is some uncertainty as to which methods should be used to determine dose-response relation- ships for systemic hypersensi tivity reactions, currently re porting the exposure as a body weight-related dose seems adequate until more information suggesting a better alternative is available. Using a deterministic approach in exposure assessment means that point estimates, such as a maximum (or average) use concentration and a maximum (average) ex posure dose, are used. Therefore, the result reflects a \"high tendency\" when average values are used). In contrast to the deterministic approach, a prob- abilistic approach uses the full range of the da ta and produces a distribu tion of values as an output. Depending on the method and the availabili ty, either all or at least several input parameters are given as probabi lity distributions. From the i nput parameters, a probability distribution for the exposure of interest is calculated using specialized computer software. Often a population-based distri bution is calculated from whic h the 50th, 90th and 99th per- centiles can be report ed. Although no examples of probabi listic exposure assessment for a sensitizing chemical have been published so far, the approach has successfully been used for food allergens, such as peanut protein (Cre vel et al., 2007, 2008; Spanjersberg et al., 2007; Kruizinga et al., 2008). 6.9 Risk characterization Risk characterization is the integration of information from hazard identification, dose- response assessment and exposure assessment into a coherent picture. According to IPCS (1999a): As discussed above in section 6.3, the most ad equate dose metric for describing exposure to The case-study on citral (see Case-study 4) provides an example for an abbreviated exposure platinum salts (see Case-study 3) briefly disc usses the occupational inhalation exposure to Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 129Risk characterization aims to provide a synthesis of estimates of exposure levels and health risks; it also summarizes sources of uncertainty in scien tific data [(regarding both hazard characteriza- tion and exposure characterization), indicates th e confidence in the risk assessment conclusions, suggests what additional data would be necessary to strengthen the risk assessment] and provides the primary basis for making risk management d ecisions [e.g. on personal protective measures at the workplace]. The results of a risk assessment ( as summarized in the [risk] characterization) are the basis of identification of chemical exposures that pose no significant health threat and those that present significant risks. Additionally, to the extent permitted by available data, risk charac- terization indicates how risk varies with expos ure, [describes the number of people exposed and whether levels are of public health concern, a nd identifies susceptible subpopulations,] to help risk managers evaluate a range of options. It assists risk management officials and decision makers in allocating scarce resources and money to the most important resolvable uncertainties and reduction of risks. The evaluation of the real-life exposure situation with respect to sensitization induction or allergy elicitation can then be determined accordingly. To this end, the POD for risk assessment (for either induction or elicitation), expressed as area dose, is divided by the total SAF to derive an AEL. An estimated/determi ned exposure level, expr essed as area dose, below this AEL is then considered without ap preciable risk of, respectively, sensitization of non-sensitized subjects and elicit ation of allergic symptoms in already sensitized subjects For induction and elicitation of skin sensitization and respirat ory sensitization against chem- icals, a quantitative risk characterization curren tly seems feasible in cases for which adequate hazard characterization and exposur e data can be provided. This will more often be the case for skin sensitizers. Otherwise, and in most cases of systemic hypersensitivity reactions, only a qualitative (or semiquantitative) risk charac terization can be done. Th en, uses and exposure information leading to or posing a risk of sy stemic sensitization and/or systemic allergy elicitation can be described. Instead of a deterministic risk assessment approach, a probabilistic risk characterization ap-proach has been proposed for f ood allergy and has been successf ully applied in some cases (Spanjersberg et al., 2007; Kruizinga et al., 2008; Madsen et al., 2009). The model predicts the most likely number of allergic reactions that might result from the accidental presence of an allergenic constituent in a food product. This calcu lation factors in a st atistical distribution of the minimum eliciting dose in the sensitiz ed subpopulation, also in cluding the proportion of the population that is allergic , and statistical dist ribution data for vari ables determining the intake of the allergen ic constituent (presence and concen tration in foods, likelihood that an allergic person consumes the food and amount of the food consumed per eating occasion). The probabilistic risk assessment approach may also be applied to predict the likelihood of allergic skin or allerg ic respiratory tract reactions in the general population and may consti- tute an interesting instrument for risk characterization in the future. As mentioned above, the risk ch aracterization serves to inform risk management decisions. Comparison of an exposure with the derived A EL informs whether or not a risk of an im- mune reaction is likely for the exposure scenario evaluated. It should be noted, however, that this does not constitute a conclusion on whethe r the exposure situation itself is acceptable or unacceptable; that is, even if a ri sk cannot be ruled out, it does not mean that the use of the chemical has to be limited or banned by regulat ory measures. Especially for elicitation, the risk is relevant only for the subgroup of alrea dy sensitized individuals and not for the general (see also section 6.7). Harmonization Project Document No. 10 130population. Here, it is generally more useful for a ffected individuals to avoid contact with the chemical. This can be achieved by, for example, avoidance of contact with the chemical at elicitation risk assessment may be useful to defi ne elicitation-based th reshold concentrations for product labelling.

For the latter, the 131 7. ASSESSMENT OF AUTOIM MUNITY AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE 7.1 Introduction Autoimmunity and autoimmune diseases re sult from immune responses against self- molecules. The immunological effectors and m echanisms involved in autoimmune reactions are the same as those associated with respon ses to foreign antigens, including activation of the innate and adaptive imm une systems, production of inflammatory mediators and activa- tion of T lymphocytes or the gene ration of antibodies with specifi city for self-antigens. Thus, chemicals that induce immunosuppression (e.g. me rcury(II) chloride) or hypersensitivity (e.g. antibiotics) may also have an impact on auto immunity. In many instances, the events that initiate the immune response to self are unknow n; however, intrinsic factors (e.g. specific gene polymorphisms, sex-related hormones and age) and extrinsic factors (e.g. lifestyle, exposures to certain drugs, chemicals and infec tious agents) have been shown to be associ- 7.2 Hazard identification A large number of chemicals and therapeutic ag ents have been identified through epidemio- logical or laboratory studies as potential trigge rs for expression of autoimmunity and have autoimmune disease may occur in the absence of specific chemical exposures and that the strongest associations of predisposing factor s for autoimmune diseases are with specific genetic loci. Hazard assessment for the potentia l to modulate autoimmunity (as with other alterations in immune function) will likely be st be accomplished using a tiered approach and utilization of multiple methods. Occupational epidemiological st udies often provide the best opportunity for identifying chemical-induced m odulation of the immune system in human populations, as exposure levels tend to be hi gher than those found outside the workplace. Work-related exposures to compou nds such as crystalline silica, heavy metals and solvents have been associated with a number of systemic autoimmune diseases. Individuals with high- level exposures to silica-contai ning mineral dusts have been s hown to demonstrate elevated risk for a number of systemic autoimmune di to tobacco smoke and iron pa rticles have been shown to modify disease incidence and severity in worker s exposed to silica, stressing the need to identify potentially hazardous co-exposures to accurately assess th e risk for development of disease. Vinyl chloride has been linked to the development of a scle roderma-like disease character- ized by skin thickening, Raynaud phenomenon, acr o-osteolysis (shorten ing of the terminal digital phalanges due to bone resorption) and pulmonary in volvement. The linkage between vinyl chloride and autoimmunity stimulated re search into associations between systemic autoimmune diseases and other solvents (e.g. tr ichloroethylene, trichl oroethane and xylenes), predominantly in occupational settings. An increased risk for systemic sclerosis was reported in several studies, but the risk is not consis tent for all systemic autoimmune diseases (reviewed in IPCS, 2006a). been suggested to both induce onset and modulat e the severity of autoimmune disease (Table ated with the induction, development or exacerbation of autoimmunity. 7.1) (IPCS, 2006a; Rose & Mackay, 2006). However, it is important to note that spontaneous Harmonization Project Document No. 10 132Table 7.1: Environmental exposures and therapeutics associated PCBs, PBBs Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 133 Table 7.1 (continued) Autoimmune syndrome Compound Allopurinol Silica Vasculitis Tetracyclines PBBs, polybrominated biphenyls a Adapted from Miller (2006). This is not intended to be a comprehensive review, but is meant to provide illustrative examples of the types of co mpounds associated with autoimmunity. 7.3 Hazard characterization A basic understanding of the typical methodologies used to evaluate the induction or exacer- bation of autoimmunity in animal models is nece ssary to evaluate the da tabase of studies for hazard characterization of a give n chemical as the first step in risk assessment. Detailed discussions of end-points and methods utilized in characterizing autoimmunity are provided in EHC 236: Principles and methods for assessing autoi mmunity associated with exposure to chemicals (IPCS, 2006a). The data set for most chemi cals is unlikely to contain data on more than one or two animal models of autoimmune disease. The risk a ssessor should refer to posed target and to the assa y descriptions in EHC 236 (IPCS , 2006a) for end-points contained in the data set for the chemical in question to provide specific context, cautions and informa- tion that may assist in the interpretation of autoimmunity data for risk assessment. 7.4 Clinical and ep idemiological data Autoimmune disorders can affect virtually any site in the body and present as a spectrum of diseases ranging from organ specific, in whic h antibodies and T cells react to self-antigens localized in a specific tissue, to systemic, ch aracterized by reactivity against a specific anti- gen or antigens present in various tissues. R ecent estimates suggest that 3-5% of the general population suffers from autoimmune diseases, and there is epidemiological evidence that the prevalence of certain autoimmune diseases is increasing in industriali zed countries (reviewed in IPCS, 2006a; Cooper et al., 2009). In addition, there is evidence that a number of common health problems, such as atherosclerosis, infl ammatory bowel disease and aspects of male and female infertility, may have an autoimmune component. Women have a significantly higher risk of developing an autoimmune disease comp ared with men, and in a significant number of the most common autoimmune diseases (thyroiditis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythemato- sus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis) , a female predominance is observed. However, for some autoimmune diseases, such as ankyl osing spondylitis and adult-onset diabetes, there appears to be a higher risk among men. Lifestyle factors such as diet, smoking, therapeu tic and recreational drug use, infection with certain bacteria and viruses, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation and environmental chemi- cals have all been implicated in the pathogene sis of autoimmune diseases (Heindel et al., 1999; IPCS, 2006a). Tobacco use demonstrates th e complexity of potential interactions between environmental factors with regard to autoimmune disease. Smoking has been con- firmed as a risk factor for Graves hyperthyroidism and the development and prognosis of Graves ophthalmopathy (Vestergaard, 2002). Howe ver, several studies have demonstrated that tobacco use is associated with a reduced prevalence of thyroid peroxidase antibodies and chapter 3 for guidance on conducting risk assessm ents when the immune system is a pro-Harmonization Project Document No. 10 134elevated levels of thyroid st imulating hormone, suggesting that smokers may be protected against certain autoimmune thyroid disorders, such as Hashimoto thyroiditis (Vestergaard et al., 2002; Belin et al., 2004). Similarly, an i nverse association has been observed between tobacco use and the risk of ulcerative colitis (Loftus, 2004), whereas a number of studies have shown an increased risk of Crohn disease in smokers. It has been suggested that, at least for autoimmune thyroid disease, tobacco use (o r lack thereof) in genetically susceptible individuals may skew the imm une response and determine, to some extent, the type of disease that will develop (Krassas & Wiersi nga, 2006). Smoking has also been associated with Goodpasture disease, as has heavy e xposure to hydrocarbons, such as automobile exhaust, solvents and gasolin e (Bombassei & Kaplan, 1992). For some diseases, the causal link between factor s such as bacterial or viral infection and autoimmunity has been fairly well establishe d. Many peptide fragments of microbial agents are homologous with host proteins, and the i nduction of an immune response to these antigens can result in cross-reactivity with self-antigens and the induction of autoimmunity. The best example of this \"molecular mi micry\" is a membra ne protein on the -haemolytic streptococcus bacterium, which has a high de gree of homology with cardiac myosin. Anti- bodies that target the bacterium also cross- react with cardiac muscle and induce rheumatic fever. Antibodies to Yersinia enterocolitica , a bacterium normally as sociated with food poisoning outbreaks, cross-react with a variety of thyroid antigens, and increased levels of antibodies to Yersinia have been demonstrated in patients with Graves disease or autoimmune thyroiditis. 7.5 Laboratory animal data Animal models of autoimmunity have been us ed to explore both molecular mechanisms and therapeutic interventions for a variety of autoimmune diseases (Germolec, 2005). However, there are currently no validated models to assess or identify chemicals that induce or exacer- bate autoimmune diseases. The popliteal lymph node assay (PLNA), which measures non- specific stimulation and proliferation in the lymph nodes draining chemically exposed tissues, has been shown to be a useful tool for scr eening for immunostimulating compounds (Pieters et al., 2002). Rodents that are genetically pred isposed to develop autoimmune disease, such as the lupus-prone MRL mouse and the non-obe se diabetic (NOD) mouse, a model for insulin-dependent diabetes, have be en used to elucidate the role of specific genetic loci in the disease process and can be used as tools to ev aluate whether a chemical has the potential to modify disease severity in genetically suscepti ble individuals. In some of these genetically prone models, autoimmunity is induced by exposur e to chemical or biological agents. Addi- tional animal models utilize immunization with purified self-antigens, often in the presence of adjuvants, to elicit autoimmune responses. 7.6 (Ir)reversibility of effects In general, the biological mechanisms of auto immune disease preclude the ability to reverse the disease process. Once a casca de of self-reactivity is initiated, the persistence of adaptive immune cells that recognize native antigens or neoantigens and the generation of chronic inflammation perpetuate the disease. A uni que exception may be compounds that induce autoimmunity via the haptenizati on of native proteins. In some instances, such as occur with drug-induced anaemias, removal of the chemical allows resolution of disease. Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 135 7.7 Biological plausibility 7.7.1 Weight of evidence approach to assessment of risk for autoimmunity Epidemiological studies, animal models and an assessment of the most appropriate methods and end-points with which to a ssess autoimmunity are critical factors in re ducing the uncer- tainty in the determination of human risk fo r autoimmunity following exposure to chemicals. A number of general (e.g. changes in leukocy te counts or cytokine levels) or specific (increased autoantibody levels) i mmune effects would suggest the potential for increased risk to develop autoimmune disease and as such w ould \"trigger\" the risk assessment process. A acterization of the potential for a chemical to modulate the immune system and promote self- reactivity can be accomplished with a weight of evidence approach that evaluates the avail- able epidemiological and laboratory animal data for that chemical. Hazard identification for autoimmunity should re sult in weight of evidence conclusions based on the available human and laboratory animal data for a given chemical. The risk assessor should consider the entire database of effects, including data that support induction or exacer- bation of autoimmunity as well as data that do not support chemical-associated autoimmun- ity. Data are evaluated within the same or similar assays, as well as across divergent measures of the immune system and across multiple species. For each assay, a dose-response relationship for chemical exposure in the absence of generalized overt toxicity is a necessary criterion in demonstrating autoimmunity. The weight of evidence conclusions are stre ngthened by consistenc y (particularly across species, sexes or related end-point s), biological plausibility and breadth (range of effects) of the evidence for immunotoxicity. A lack of c onsistency among specific assays or types of immunotoxicity across species, strains or sexes does not necessarily represent conflicting data and often represents species, st rain or sex differences. Confli cting data should be evaluated by the strengths and weaknesses (e.g. sample si ze and exposure duratio n) of the individual studies, as well as in the context of the remai nder of the immunotoxicity database for a given chemical. Additional information with which to interpret species, strain or sex differences differences resulting from hormonally active ch emicals, such as endocrine disrupting end-points, the we ight of evidence evalua tion should represent an expert judgement of the database to dete rmine the potential for autoimmunity associated with a given compound in accordance with th e following key considerations (Hill, 1965; IPCS, 1999a; Weed, 2005): experimental evid ence, dose-response relationship, consistency specificity, coherence and analogy. clusions. The questions are arranged to evaluate the available data from the strongest and most predictive data (human data) through th e least predictive (immune organ weight). A brief description of the relative strength and predictability of different assays is presented risk assessor should refer to the detailed text below for important considerations for identi- fying key strengths and weaknesses for particular types of data and utility of data forA series of questions similar to those used to organize immunosuppres sion data (see chapter of the association, strength of the associati on, temporal association, biological plausibility, 4) can be applied to the eviden ce of autoimmunity to help develop weight of evidence con- below for major types of immunotoxicity data. The process is summarized in Figure 7.1.

We ight of evidence conclusions for autoimmunity hazard for a given chemical should be developed by cons idering all five of the following questions: 1) Human data : Are epidemiological studies, clinical studies or case-studies available that provide human data on end-points re levant to chemical-induced autoimmunity (i.e. increased incidence of all or specific autoimmune di seases, changes in immune parameters indicative of autoimmunity, incr eased levels of autoantibodies, decreased regulatory T cell function, evidence of nonsp ecific stimulation of the immune system, increased levels of markers of inflammation)? 9 Controlled clinical studies with quantitative evaluation of diagnostic criteria for the relevant diseases and documented expos ure levels represent the strongest data and provide clear evidence of autoimmunity appropriate for derivation of effect level(s). However, human data are more likely to be an enum eration of immune system components or evaluation of bur den of disease following exposures. 2) Modulation of disease in cidence or progression (laboratory animal data) : Is there evidence that the chemical causes changes in disease incidence or progression in animal models of autoimmune disease? 9 Modulation of disease incide nce or progression in genetically predisposed animal models of autoimmunity would be consid ered clear evidence for an effect on autoimmunity and appropriate data for deri vation of effect leve l(s). Modulation of a biologically relevant immune function su ch as lymph node reactions to local application of the chemical of interest (e.g. PLNA) would increase the strength of the data and support an MOA. Modulation of disease in genetically predisposed animal models of autoimmun ity with additional evidence of immunotoxicity (e.g. changes in inflammatory cell populations, cytokines, altered histology, immune organ weight) would increase the strengt h of the data and support biological plausibility. Modulation of disease incide nce or progression in multiple species or multiple animal models of autoimmune disease with concordance among end- points increases the support for clear evidence of effects on autoimmunity. 3) Immune function (laboratory animal data) : Is there evidence that the chemical alters immune measures associated with au toimmunity (i.e. autoantibody levels, inflammatory markers, regulatory T cells, lymph node proliferation, etc.) in animal models of autoimmune disease? 9 Positive results in lymph node cell prolifer ation assays such as the PLNA would be considered some evidence for potent ial effects on autoimmunity and provide data appropriate for derivation of effect level(s) when supported by additional evidence that the chemical affects autoimmunity. 9 Increased levels of autoantibodies in non-autoimmune disease-prone strains of mice or changes in immune measures a ssociated with autoimmunity would be considered some evidence that a chemical has the potential to modulate auto- immune disease and provide data appropria te for derivation of effect level(s) when supported by additional evidence that the chemical affects autoimmunity. For example, when the effect is observed in multiple rodent strains or multiple species, there is greater support for use of the end-point in th e derivation of an effect level. Modulation of autoantibody le vels or lymph node cell proliferation assays in combination with additional evidence of inflammation (e.g. immuno- phenotyping, cytokines, alte red histology, immune orga n weight) increases the weight of evidence for an effect on autoimmunity. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 1389 Modulation of measures associated with autoimmunity in combination with additional evidence of immune system dys regulation that supports an MOA or biologically plausible mechanism increases the weight of evidence for an effect on autoimmunity. 4) General immune assays (laboratory animal data) : Is there evidence from general or observational immune assays (lymphocyt e phenotyping, cytokines, complement, lymphocyte proliferation, et c.) that the chemical has the potential to modulate autoimmune disease? 9 Lymphocyte phenotyping, cytokines and ot her assays may add MOA information to present a biologically plausible suggestion of autoimmune effects. 9 The predictive value of changes in imm une cell populations and altered soluble mediator concentrations to indicate inflammation is well established; however, the linkage with autoimmune disease is less clear, and therefore these data should generally not be used to derive an effect level for autoimmunity. 5) Histopathology and haematology (laboratory animal data) : Is there histopathological evidence (thymus, etc.) or are there changes in immune organ weights or haematological changes that suggest that the chemical causes an immune response against self (i.e. immune complex de position, inflammatory cell infiltrates)? 9 Descriptive histopathological evidence from specific target organs may indicate self-reactivity and support the concept of chemical-induced modulation of auto- immune disease, but should not be used to derive an effect level for auto-immunity. 9 Limited histopathological ev idence alone is equivocal. 9 Haematology may reveal inflammatory conditions. The risk assessor should develop the weight of evidence for au toimmunity hazard identifica- tion based on answers to all five questions. Th e weight of evidence conclusions for autoim- munity should also desc ribe the database in te rms of consistency and biological plausibility, including strengths, weaknesses, uncertainties an d data gaps. A small database with negative data is equivocal. Just as positive data on a ra nge of assays strengthen the weight of evidence for immunotoxicity, negative data on a range of more predicti ve assays such as immune function data increase confid ence to support a lack of imm unotoxicity. The strength of the immune database will determine whether ad ditional evidence is necessary to determine immunotoxicity. Incomplete or que stionable data sets and high usage or high risk of exposure should trigger a request for additional data, if regulatory mandate allows. When induction or exacerbation of autoimmunity is indicated by the weight of evidence for a particular chemical, these conc lusions are then prepared to be brought forward to perform a dose-response assessment. That process begins with the selection of the most appropriate end-point(s) or critical effect (s) and the development of POD(s) for autoimmunity. Health- based guidance values or refere nce values are then calculated by dividing the POD(s) by the assessment and derivation of reference values ). Data from human exposures (e.g. occupa- tional exposure studies and case reports) are preferred for the critical effect, because fewer assumptions are required to de termine the relative risk of immunotoxicity for the general population from human data compared with e xperimental animal data. Therefore, when human data are used for the critical effect a nd the POD, smaller uncertainty factors are gen- erally utilized to derive the reference values. Nevertheless, all availabl e data are considered total uncertainty factor (see se ctions 3.3.7 and 4.9 for a detail ed discussion of dose-response Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 139 for the critical effect. The quantitative risk assessment may be based on laboratory animal data even if there are human data for a given chemical in cases such as inadequate informa- tion on dose levels, no information on effects at low doses or absence of a NOEL in the human data set. Dose-related changes in two principal types of data provide clear evid ence of induction or exacerbation of autoimmunity appropriate for use as the critical effect for chemical-related autoimmunity: 1) human data on end-points rele vant to chemical-induced autoimmunity and 2) changes in disease incidence or progression in animal models of au toimmune disease. Data on immune measures a ssociated with autoimmunity from animal models of autoimmune disease can also be used to derive effect le vels when the data are supported by additional evidence that the chemical i nduces or exacerbates autoimmun ity. It is particularly recom- mended that the risk assessor consult an expe rt in immunotoxicology or clinical immunology to help interpret the biological plausibility and adversity of these less predictive assays. In general, PODs are developed from the most sensitive adverse immune end-point(s) from the most appropriate species (or the most sensit ive mammalian species, in the absence of infor- mation to determine the most appropriate sp ecies). Data from general immune assays, haematology, histopathology and immune organ weight change s may indicate potential immunotoxicity and are useful to support biological plausib ility and a potential MOA for autoimmunity observed in more predictive data (e.g. disease progression in animal models of autoimmune disease). Observational end-point s, such as phenotyping, lymphocyte prolifera- tion and altered soluble mediator (cytokines or complement) concentrat ions, should generally not be used to derive an effect level for auto immunity, because they are not considered to be reliable predictors of adve rse autoimmunity. Changes in imm une organ weights and general histopathology may indicate pot ential immunotoxicity and can be used to support more predictive data; however, these data should not be used to derive an effect level for auto- immunity because of the low pr edictive value of these end-points when considered alone. 7.7.2 Mode of action/mechanisms Lifestyle and environmental factors may alter self-recognition by inducing genetic mutations, creating novel antigens through bi nding to self-p roteins or modifying regulatory factors that control immune and inflammatory responses. Ly mphocytes that recogni ze self-antig ens with high affinity undergo negative se lection in the bone marrow (B cells) and thymus (T cells) and are eliminated via apoptosis. However, au toreactive B and T cells constitute a normal part of the immune cell pool, and natural autoantibodies are observed in sera from \"normal, healthy\" individuals. The presence of these ce lls presents a low-grade risk for autoimmune disease in most individuals, because recognition of self-antigens occurs with low affinity and can be controlled by peripheral tolerance, a post-thymic control mechanism that limits antigen-specific activity via the regulatory interactions of a variety of cell types and soluble mediators. The requirement for two signals from antigen-presenting cells, one antigen- specific and a second nonspecific signal, for ly mphocyte proliferation is a good example of one such regulatory check. In the absence of a co-stimulatory signal, self-reactive cells are rendered unresponsive (anergic). In some instances, however, these autoreactive cells can recognize self-antigens in situations that ove rcome anergy and make the antigens appear immunogenic. One cytokine l pathogens nonspecifically stimulate innate immunity, inducing the production of soluble mediators and co-stimulatory molecules im- portant in the perpetuation of the immune respons e. In these cases, the inflammatory stimulus or a microbial protein may serve as an adjuva nt, and tolerance can be broken. The purported Harmonization Project Document No. 10 140association between vaccination and autoimmunity postulates a similar mechanism, where immunization with an antigen in the presence of adjuvant may break tolerance and promote reactivity to self-proteins. It has also been suggested that HCB ma y act as an adjuvant, directly activating macrophages and other infla mmatory cells and generating an inflammatory signal that polyclonally stimulates T lymphocyt es (Ezendam et al., 2005) (see detailed Case- study 2 below). Following activation, regulation of beneficial immune responses is mediated by a number of inhibitory pathways that balance the positiv e and negative aspect s of immune system activation. Intrinsic defects or chemical agen ts that modify these regulatory pathways may lead to failure in restoring normal immune homeostasis and cont ribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease. Changes in apoptotic pathways leading to inappropriate cell death or survival or disturbances in the clearance of ap optotic cells have been suggested as the under- lying mechanisms for several autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and Hashimoto thyroiditis. It is easy to see how these types of changes can lead to a self-perpetuating pathology. Phagocyt osis of particulate materials such as silica by alveolar macrophages results in lipid per oxidation, cytokine and secretion of reactive oxygen speci es and proteolytic enzymes, eventually leading to cell death. As silica is released by dying cel ls, it may be reinge sted by other macro- phages, creating a cyclical process of infla mmation and necrotic cell death. Dysfunction of regulatory NK T cell or T cell act ivity through altered cytokine production and/or deletion or mutation of cell surface molecules have been described for several autoimmune diseases. DNA methylation plays an important role in th e regulation and expression of a number of inflammatory mediators. There is a growing body of literature that suggests that epigenetic changes resulting in altered DNA methylation pa tterns can modify immune function, contrib- uting to the development of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (Strickland & Richardson, 2008). Or gan-specific autoimmune dise ases are typically charac- ected by autoreactive CD8+ (cytotoxic) T cells or indirectly via release of proinflammatory cytokines and other soluble mediators by activated CD4+ T cells and macrophages. In c ontrast, systemic autoimmune diseases are frequently characterized by specific autoantibod ies that can cause injury via activation of complement, blocking or stimulating cell surf ace receptors or aggregation into immune complexes that activate nonspecific inflammato ry responses. It has been suggested that metals such as mercury induce autoimmune di sease via the creation of new high-affinity and halothane are proposed to induce reactions in which antigen-specific T cells provide help to antibody-producing B cells that recognize chem ically modified protei ns, but not the native form of the self-protein. Oxidative damage has been implicated as a m echanism in a number of autoimmune diseases. Free radical-induced damage, lipid peroxida tion and autoantibodies against oxidatively modified proteins and DNA have been observed in patients with systemic lupus erythemato- sus, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes a nd autoimmune hepatitis. Oxidatively modified proteins may act as neoantigens, promoting the breakage of tolerance. The generation of free radicals and the induction of lipid peroxidation have been implicated in halothane-induced hepatitis and trichloroethylene-induced autoim mune disease. The anaesthetic major cyto chrome P450 (CYP)-dependent pathways, both of which are involved in halothane-induced liver injury. At normal oxygen concentrations, halothane is oxidatively metabolized to trifluoroacetyl ch loride, which may proteins such as CYP2E1, leading to immu ne-mediated liver injury. In contrast, under binding sites for MHC molecules (see detailed Ca se-study 5 below). Drugs such as penicillin Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 141 hypoxic conditions, halothane is metabolized vi a a reductive pathway to yield 1,1,1-trifluoro- 2-chloroethyl free radical, which then reacts with cellular protei ns and lipids, resulting in an immune-mediated hepatotoxicity (rev iewed in Masubuchi & Horie, 2007). develop an MOA from laborator y animal studies, the MOA can be evaluated using a weight of evidence approach to esta blish human relevance (Boobis et al., 2008). During the charac- terization of the hazard database, the weight of evidence evaluation of a proposed animal model for autoimmunity can be used to dete rmine the human relevance and therefore to address the potential for the development of autoimmunity following chemical exposure in humans. 7.8 Life stage considerat ions and groups at risk It has been demonstrated for a number of environmental chemicals (e.g. TCDD, mercury, lead) that the same toxicant may disrupt di fferent immune proce sses, depending upon the specific timing of exposure and the target orga n dose (Dietert, 2009a). With regard to the specific timing of exposure, there is evidence from laboratory animal studies and human epidemiology that a single toxicant may prom ote different immune-associated diseases, depending upon the specific window of expos ure (Holladay, 1999; Di etert & Piepenbrink, 2006b). As we better understand the consequences of immune dysregulation, there is increas- ing suspicion that early -life exposures may lead to increas ed risk for autoimmune diseases later in life. A number of health concerns have been raised w ith regard to the children of women who received DES during pregnancy to prevent preterm delivery or pregnancy loss. As part of the follow-up to a large multicentre epidemiological study that examined the inci- dence of cancer and other diseases in DE S-exposed and unexposed cohorts, Noller et al. (1988) examined the self-reported prevalence of autoimmune diseases in 1711 exposed women and 922 controls. The overall frequency of autoimmune diseases was significantly elevated in exposed women when compared with the control group (28.6 per 1000 versus 16.3 per 1000, P = 0.02). Of the 14 autoimmune diseases reported in the cohort, only Hashimoto thyroiditis had a higher prevalence in exposed women (Noller et al., 1988). A number of additional studies have suggested th at the offspring of DES-treated women exhibit a variety of immune system perturbations, including enhanced T cell proliferation and elevated NK cell activity, that could contribute to immune dysregulation (Ford et al., 1983; Ways et al., 1987; Burke et al., 2001) and an elevated risk for autoimmune disease. Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease ch aracterized by self-reactivity to myelin basic protein, inappropriate activatio n of microglial cells and a T cell-mediated lymphocytic infiltration of the nervous system with destru ction of the myelin sh eath. Although the disease has been commonly diagnosed in young adults, it has been suggested that the disease is now increasingly diagnosed in children and adol escents (Thomas & Banwell, 2008). The excess risk of multiple sclerosis in dizygotic twins compared with non-twin siblings, along with evidence for maternal effects on disease rates, suggests that gestatio nal or early-life expo- sures may contribute to susceptibility (Ebe rs, 2008). Although we currently do not understand what environmental factors may contribute to the disease pro cess, exposure to xenobiotics that induce inappropriate myelom onocytic cell activa tion, inappropriate regulation of auto- reactive cells or altered Th function could play a role in the increased risk of multiple sclero- sis (Dietert, 2008). As discussed in detail in chapter 3 (sections 3.3.6 and 3.3.7), when da ta are available to Harmonization Project Document No. 10 142Several investigators have examined immuno logical effects in inbred and autoimmune disease-prone mouse strains following prenatal or perinatal exposure (reviewed in Holladay, 1999). The prototypical immunotoxicant TCDD ha s been shown to induce thymic atrophy, alter thymocyte maturation and expression of MHC molecules and increase the number of extrathymic autoreactive T Blaylock et al., 1992; Silverstone et al., 1994), suggesting that the compound may prom ote autoimmunity. In utero exposure to TCDD has been reported to alter the time to disease onset in mice prone to autoimmune glomerulonephritis (Silverstone et al., 1998; Smith & Germolec, 2000). In C57BL/6 mice, a strain that is not genetically predisposed to the development of autoimmune disease, gesta- tional exposure to TCDD altered T cell populations in the spleen and thymus (Mustafa et al., 2008). Increased immune complex and compleme nt C3 deposition in the glomeruli and elevated titres of auto antibodies indicate that these mice ma y be at risk for the development of autoimmunity (Mustafa et al., 2008; Hollada y et al., 2011). Similar findings were observed in the SNF1 (SWR \u00d7 NZB:F1) lupus-prone mouse following a single istered on day 12 of gesta tion. Increased autoantibody pr oduction and immune complex deposition suggest that prenatal exposure to TCDD may exacerbate autoimmune nephritis in females and induce early disease onset in ma le SNF1 mice (Holladay et al., 2011). As dis- cussed above, prenatal exposure to DES has be en associated with immune dysregulation in humans. In laboratory rodents, DES is a poten t immunotoxicant, and in utero exposure results in thymic atrophy and suppression of cell- and humoral-mediated immunity in a sex-specific fashion (reviewed in Luebke et al., 2006a); how ever, there is only limite d evidence that these alterations in immune function may affect di sease in autoimmune disease-prone mice follow- ing developmental exposure (Stoll & Gavalchin, 2000). With few exceptions (e.g. type 1 diabetes and myocarditis), autoimmu ne diseases are not common in children and adolescents, and the us ual age of diagnosis for many autoimmune diseases is above 40 years (Jacobson et al., 1997). Because immunosenescence is associated with a decline in adaptive immunity, it is so mewhat paradoxical that ageing is linked to an increased frequency of autoantibody producti on, chronic inflammatory disease and auto- immune disease (Hakim & Gress, 2007). It has b een suggested that rath er than considering age-related changes in the immune system as a general decline in im mune responses, it may be more appropriate to view the process as immune remodelling and dysregulation (Huang et al., 2005). Although it is unclear if the number of regulatory T cells decreases with age, studies in both rodents and humans suggest that there is a decrease in functional activity of regulatory T cells that may contribute to th e development and progression of autoimmune diseases (Tsaknaridis et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2007). Reduced B cell lymphopoiesis and the lack of competition from naive B cells may lead to retention of self-reactive B cells in lymphoid follicles (Johnson & Cambier, 2004). In addition, although the number of B cells in the periphery remains fairly constant, it has been suggested that the im mune response in aged individuals is skewed towards utilization of long-lived antigen-experienced B cells that pro- duce Julius , 2008). Cytokine produc tion is altered in a number of T cell populations in the elderly, and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines may contribute to altered function of both B and T cells and nonspecific immune activation resulting in a breakdown in tolerance, allo wing autoimmunity to proceed (Huang et al., 2005). 7.9 Dose-response relati onships and thresholds dose-response relationship are important f actors in establishing the potential for many As discussed in detail in chapter 3 (section 3.3.7), the determination and evaluation of a Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 143 compounds to induce immune system toxicity. It is somewhat problematical for auto- immunity, however, as the same chemical may have differing effects on the immune system, depending on the level of exposure and the target organ dose. The prototypical immuno- toxicant cyclophosphamide provides an interesting example of this atypical dose-response relationship. Cyclophosphamide is routinely used as a positive contro l in immunotoxicology studies. When used at cumulative doses of 100-200 mg/kg body weight, it suppresses a number of immune parameters, including host resistance to tumour cell challenge and bacterial infection, induction of antigen-spe cific antibody responses, tumour cell killing via cytotoxic T lymphocytes and lymphoprolifera tive responses (Luster et al., 1993). Surpris- ingly, certain immune measures have been sh own to be enhanced following treatment with lower doses of cyclophosphamide (Luster et al., 1993; Brode & Cooke, 2008). Adminis- tration of cyclophosphamide has been shown to increase DTH responses, enhance antitumour responses and augment the progression of type 1 diabetes in NOD mi ce (reviewed in Brode & Cooke, 2008). Two proposed mechanisms underlying these augmented immune responses include skewing of Th2/Th1 responses and th e removal or inhibition of regulatory or suppressor cell populations. Alt hough the relationship between e nhanced immune responses and breakdown of self-tolerance is unclear, ther e is increasing evidence that suppression of regulatory factors may increase the risk for autoimmune diseases. A similar effect of suppression of some immu ne parameters and stimulation of others has been shown for HCB, a pesticide associated with immune effects in humans following acci- dental and occupational exposures. In mice, HCB has been shown to be a potent immuno- suppressive agent, decreasing antibody responses and resistance to infectious disease and neoplasia. In contrast, studies in the Brown Norway and other genetically susceptible rat strains have demonstrated that HCB exposur e enhances production of serum and antigen- specific immunoglobulins and stimulates lymphoc yte proliferative responses. For additional information on the epidemiology, pathology and mechanisms of HCB-induced modulation of and IPCS (2006a). Autoimmune end-points in the Brown Norway rat ha ve been used as the basis for current oral RfDs in the risk assessment for mercury(I I) chloride in the USA (USEPA, 1995b). Although a weight of evidence approach was used and mu ltiple studies were considered, three studies using the Brown Norway rat as the test strain demonstrated that the development of mercury- induced autoimmune glomerulonephritis was the most sensitive end-point for adverse effects following mercury exposure and were used to set a recommended safe drinking-water expo- sure level of 0.010 mg/l for inorganic et al., 1978; Be rnaudin et al., 1981; Andres, 1984). The production and deposition of Ig G antibodies to the glomerular basement membrane were considered the first step in the formation of mercury-induced autoimmune disease. Because of the similarities between the disease processes in the Brown Norway rat and in sensitive humans, a combined uncertainty factor of 10 was used to account for both laboratory animal to human extrapolation a nd sensitive human populations (i.e. intra- individual variability) (USEPA, 1995b). In effect, the uncertainty factor used to calculate criteria and health advisories was reduced 10-fo ld because the animal model is considered a good surrogate for the study of mercury-induced kidney da mage in sensitive humans (USEPA, 1995b). In addition to identifying the shape of the dose-response curve and th e effective dose range for autoimmune effects, factor s such as exposure (route, ti ming and duration) and toxico- kinetics that might affect comparisons with human exposure scenarios are identified and the immune system, the reader is referred to the HCB case-st udy (see Case-study 2 below) Harmonization Project Document No. 10 144factors, such as the development of tole rance, may complicate the assessment of dose- response relationships in autoi mmunity. For example, low-leve l exposures to some agents that promote autoimmunity, such as mercury(II) chloride and penicillamine, have been shown to induce tolerance in some r odent models, such that auto immune pathology is not induced 3, the interpretation of dose-response data should identify doses associated with the adverse effect as well as doses associated with no adve rse effects, to determine the most appropriate end-points or critical effects. 7.10 Uncertainty factors tion of uncertainty factors in the characterizatio n of the risk for a given chemical to induce immune system toxicity. However, because of unique concerns with regard to genetic varia- bility of the human population and the observed predisposition of some genotypes to exhibit specific autoimmune diseases, as well as differe ntial susceptibilities associated with age and sex, the risk assessor may consider the addition of uncertainty factors in order to derive AELs. 7.10.1 Genetic susceptibility Familial aggregation and laboratory animal st udies suggest a strong association between genetics and most autoimmune diseases. Concordance rates between identical twins range from approximately 9% to 40%, depending on the disease. Limited concordance may be explained by non-identity in immune repertoire s due to T cell recepto r and immunoglobulin gene recombination, variations in receptor assembly and so matic mutation, although evidence indicates that environmental factors can cont ribute to disease etiology. Many susceptibility genes have been identified in transgenic an imal models; research on these monogenic auto- immune diseases has shown the importance of mutations in pr oteins associated with fas- mediated T cell apoptosis, negative selection in the thymus and the development and activa- tion of regulatory T cells. However, any gene coding for products that are involved in the induction and maintenance of self -tolerance and in re gulating immune effector functions as well as organ-specific functions may be involved in defining individual susceptibility. In the majority of autoimmune diseases, a multigenic process with multiple su sceptibility loci work- ing in concert has been suggested. The most clearly established genetic association is with specific alleles within the MHC gene complex (Rose & Mackay, FcRIIIB have also been implicated as ge netic factors in determining the pathogenesis and course of many autoimmune diseases. Polymorphisms in regulatory regions of genes coding for immunoinhibitory receptors, such as CTLA-4, that regulate T cell activa- tion have also been shown to be important in disease susceptibility. Gene polymorphisms that affect the function or the level of expression of regulatory or effector molecules of inflam- mation, fibrosis or other pathol ogical processes involved in au toimmune disease development have also been observed. Examples of these include systemic sclerosis (TGF- 1, TGF-2, TGF-3), juvenile and Wegener granulomatos is (IL-10). TNF polymorphisms have been implicated as independent susceptibility factor s for rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus following subsequent exposure to higher doses of these compounds. As discussed in chapter discussed as part of the dose-response eval uation (see chapter 3, sections 3.3.7-3.3.9). Other The reader should consult chapter 3 (section 3.3.10) for a general discussion of the applica-Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 145 erythematosus. These polymorphisms may be dire ctly involved in disease pathogenesis, as TNF- is known to be a strong inflammatory fact or and has been a successful target for therapeutic intervention and long-lasting immune response modification. Finally, polymorph- isms in genes associated with non-immune para meters, such as drug-metabolizing enzymes, may result in differential susceptibilities to dr ug- or chemical-induced autoimmunity. This is likely the result of changes in the generation of protein adducts and covalently modified antigens through the use of alte rnative metabolic pathways. Genetic defects that lead to primary immunodefi ciencies are now recognized as the basis of susceptibility to specific autoimmune syndr omes; for a large number of primary immuno- deficiencies, autoimmunity is the primary diseas e and is present in most individuals with the specific genetic defect (Car neiro-Sampaio & Coutinho, 2007; Torgerson, 2008). Defects in critical steps in the process of establishing tolerance and immune re gulation are systematic- ally associated with clinical manifestations of autoimmunity early in life and have been identified in genes important in T cell regulation, somatic recombination of T and B cell sur-face receptors, apoptosis and the production of complement components (Carneiro-Sampaio & Coutinho, 2007). The two most common antibody deficiencies, selective IgA deficiency and common variable immunodeficiency, are associ ated with self-reactivity to a broad group of target tissues, and clinical manifestations of autoimmunity may appear in as many as 35% of individuals with primary imm unodeficiencies. The fact that not all individuals with a par- ticular primary immunodeficiency develop any or the same manifestations of autoimmunity is further support for the infl uence of environmental factor s on the development and pro- gression of these diseases. As discussed above , transgenic and knockout mice are frequently used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which genetically based immune dys- regulation may alter the development, maintena nce and function of regul atory T cells, leading to abnormal immune tolerance. While it is believed that a gene tic predisposition to self-reactiv ity exists in all individuals with autoimmune diseases, differing suscep tibility factors may govern the timing of the disease or the specific disease that an indivi dual develops. As with other multifactorial diseases, such as cancer, it is suggested that bot h genetic and environmental factors interact to determine disease outcome and progression; howeve r, we have little knowledge with regard to whether they result in cumulative and sequential changes or are the sequelae of mixtures of exposures. This would imply that the timing of evaluation of immune effects may have an impact on the perceived risk for specific diseases. For example, mercury-containing compounds have potent immunosu ppressive effects in many r odent strains (reviewed in Havarinasab & Hultman, 2005). However, in gene tically susceptible strains such as the Brown Norway rat, the pattern of effects change s in a relatively short time frame to reflect immunostimulation, as characte rized by polyclonal B cell act ivation, LOELs for methylmercur y are similar (Havarinasab et al., 2007). 7.11 Exposure assessment As with other toxicological end-points and co mplicated biological processes, assessing the relative contributions that environmental exposur es may have in the risk for development of disease is problematical. Miller et al. (2000) proposed a structur ed set of criteria to define environmentally associated autoimmune diseas es in the human population. The five primary elements of these criteria are temporal plau sibility, exclusion of other causative agents, Harmonization Project Document No. 10 146dechallenge (resolution or improvement of th e condition after removal of the agent), rechallenge (recurrence or wors ening of the condition after -exposure to the agent) and biological plausibility. Identific ation of analogous cases or n early identical cases and evi- dence for a dose-response effect are also consid ered as supportive of a proposed association. The proposed tiered approach provides a framework upon which to assess the level of evidence for associations between exposures to exogenous agents and autoimmune diseases. In relatively rare instances, there is epidem iological evidence for temporal associations between specific environmental exposures and the onset of autoimmunity. For example, the development of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrom e and toxic oil syndrome, autoimmune dis- orders similar to diffuse fasciitis with eosinophilia and systemic sclerosis, has been associated with the ingestion of impure L-tryptophan-co ntaining dietary supplements (eosinophilia- myalgia syndrome) and the consumption of contaminated rapeseed oil produced by a particular refinery (toxic oil syndrome; Kaufman & Krupp, 1995). A number of studies suggested that the degree of illness correlate d with the amount and frequency of intake (Tabuenca, 1981; Kamb et al., 1992; Back et al., 1993), suggesting a potential dose-response relationship. However, there is often a long latency period between exposure and the dev- elopment of disease, and for many compounds, the weight of eviden ce from human studies remains only suggestive. Laboratory animal mode ls of chemical-induced autoimmunity must then provide important information on the shape of the dose-response curve, effective dose range, sensitive end-points and biom arkers of exposure and effect. 7.12 Risk characterization process in which the hazard characterization, quantitative dose-response assessment and exposure assessment are combined to provide a s ynthesis of estimates of exposure levels and health risks. It also considers sources of un certainty in the scientific data (regarding both hazard characterization and exposur e), indicates the confidence in the risk assessment conclu- sions, suggests what additional data would be ne cessary to strengthen the risk assessment and provides the information used in making risk management decisions. The results of a risk assessment (as summarized in the risk characteri zation) are the basis for identifying levels of chemical exposure that are believ ed to represent those at which there are no significant risks to human health and those at which health effects may occur. Additionally, to the extent permitted by the available data, risk characteriza tion indicates how risk varies with exposure, describes the number of people exposed, disc usses whether levels are of public health concern and identifies susceptible subpopulations . It assists risk mana gement officials and decision-makers in identifying issues of concern for the allo cation of resources and reduction of risks (IPCS, 1999a). As is true for all forms of immunotoxicity , ideally, a quantitative risk assessment is performed for autoimmunity a ssociated with chemical expos ure. In the case where the available data do not allow for this, a quali tative risk assessment may be possible. Two examples of the conduct of a risk asse ssment for autoimmunity, including risk charac- terization, are given in the case-studies on merc ury and trichloroethylen e (see Case-studies 5 and 6, respectively). As summarized in chapter 3, risk characteri zation is the portion of the risk assessment Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 147 REFERENCES Abou-Raya A, Abou-Raya S (2006) Inflammation: a pivot al link between autoimmune diseases and athero- sclerosis.

Aggregate exposure: Exposure to a single chem ical from multiple sources and by all expo- sure routes over a given period of time. Allergen: An antigen that induces an alle rgic or hypersensitivity reaction, resulting in immune-mediated or non-immune-mediated damage; restricted mainly to immedi- ate hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions. Allergenicity: The capacity to induce allergy. Allergic contact dermatitis: An inflammatory sk in disease resulting from allergic sensitiza- tion. Allergic response: Adve rse response of to the speci fic allergen. Allergy: Hypersensitivity caused by exposure to an exogenous antigen (allergen) resulting in a marked increase in reactivity and responsiveness to that antigen on subsequent expo- sure, resulting in adverse health effects. Anaphylaxis: Local or systemic immediate hype rsensitivity reaction initiated by mediators released after immunol ogical stimulation. Antibody: Immunoglobulin molecule produced in response to immunization or sensitization, which specifically reacts with antigen. Antigen: Any substance that induces a specific immunological response. Antinuclear antibody: Anti body directed to a nuclear antigen; can have various specificities (e.g. to single- or double-strande d DNA or histone proteins). Antinucleolar antibody: Antibody specifica lly recognizing nucleolar elements. Apoptosis: Programmed cell death. Atopy: In general terms, \"unwante d reactivity\"; used mostly to describe the state of general systemic or local hypersensitivity reacti ons related to genetic predisposition. Autoantibody: Immunoglobulin anti- gens (autoantigens). Autoantigen: Antigen to which an autoimmune reaction is directed. Autoimmune disease: A disease involving immune responses against self-antigens, resulting in pathological change. Autoimmunity: Inappropriate reaction of the immune system against the organism's own antigens (autoantigens) that may be either destructive or non-dest ructive. Destructive autoimmunity is associated with the development of autoimmune diseases. 1 This glossary contains brief definitions of selected terms used in this guidance document. The definitions have been taken from the guidance document itself or from one of several WHO/IPCS documents (see end of glossary for sources). The reader should refer to these documents for expanded definitions or for definitions of terms not included here. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 182Biomarker: Indicator of changes or events in biological systems. Biological markers of exposure refer to cellular, biochemical, analytic al or molecular measures that are obtained from biological media such as tissues, cells or fluids and are indicat ive of exposure to an agent. Biomarkers of effect refer to biological changes th at represent an alteration in endogenous body constituents (e.g. de pression of cholinesterase levels as an indicator of exposure to pesticides). Chemical-specific adjustment factor: A modified default 10-fold uncertain ty factor that incor- porates appropriate data on species differences or human variability in either toxico- kinetics (fate of the chemical in the body) or toxicodynamics (actions of the chemical on the body). Cross-reactivity: Reactivity of antigen-specific elements towards antigens other than those used in original sensitization, owing to sh ared antigenic epitopes on different antigenic molecules; also used to describe reactions towards antigenic determinants other than those originally used in sensitization, due to similarities in structure. Delayed-type hypersensitivity: Inflammatory le sion mediated by effect or T lymphocytes or their products, with attraction mainly of macrophages towards the inflammatory lesion. Dose-response relationship: Relationship between the amount of an agent administered to, taken up by or absorbed by an organism, system or (sub)popula tion and the change developed in that organism, system or (s ub)population in reaction to the agent. Elicitation: Production of a cell- mediated or antibody-mediated allergic response by exposure of a sensitized individu al to an allergen. Exposure assessment: Evaluation of the exposure of an organism, system or (sub)population to an agent (and its derivatives ). Exposure assessment is the third step in the process of risk assessment. Hazard: The inherent property of an agent or situation having the potential to cause adverse effects when an organism, system or (s ub)population is exposed to that agent. Hazard characterization: The qua litative and, wherever possible, quantitative description of the inherent property of an ag ent or situation having the potential to cause adverse effects. This should, where possible, include a dose-response assessmen t and its attendant uncertainties. Hazard characterization is the s econd of four steps in risk assessment. Hazard identification: The identification of the type and nature of adverse effects that an agent has an inherent capacity to cause in an organism, system or (sub)population. Hazard identification is the first of f our steps in risk assessment. Health-based guidance value: A numerical valu e derived by dividing a point of departure (e.g. a no-observed-adverse-effect level or benchmark dose lower confidence limit) by a composite uncertainty factor to determine a level that can be ingested over a defined time period (e.g. lifetime or 24 hours) wi thout appreciable health risk. Hypersensitivity: Increased immunological reactions, often associ- ated with tissue destruction. Immunocompetence: Capacity of B or T lymp hocytes to specifically recognize antigen, resulting in a specifi c immunological reaction. Immunomodulation: Immunosuppression, immunostim ulation and markers of autoimmune disease. Immunostimulation: Unintended stimu lation of the immune system. Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 183 Immunosuppression: Dominant immunological tolerance, a phe nomenon that plays an active role in regulating T and B cell responses to both foreign antigens and autoantigens (sup- pressor T lymphocyte). The downregulation of responses to autoantigens is a major regulatory mechanism involved in the inducti on and maintenance of self-tolerance. Immunotoxicity: Any advers e effect on the immune system that can result from exposure to a range of environmental agents, including chemicals. Inflammation: Process whereby blood protei ns or leukocytes enter tissu e in response to or in association with infection or tissue injury. Margin of exposure: Ratio of the no-observed- adverse-effect level or benchmark dose lower confidence limit for the critical effect to the theoretical, pr edicted or estimated exposure dose or concentration. Mechanism of action: The specific biochemical interaction through which a substance pro- duces an effect on a living organism or in a biochemical system. Mode of action: A biologically plausible sequence of key events leading to an observed effect supported by robust experimental ob servations and mechanistic data. Non-threshold effect: An adverse effect for wh ich there is no dose or exposure concentration below which the stated effect is not observed or expected to occur. Risk: The probability of an adverse effect in an organism, system or (sub)population caused under specified circumstances by exposure to an agent. Risk analysis: A process for controlling situat ions where an organism, system or (sub)popu- lation could be exposed to a hazard. The risk analysis process consists of three compo- nents: risk assessment, risk ma nagement and risk communication. Risk assessment: A process intended to calculate or estimate the risk to a given target organism, system or (sub)population, including the identification of attendant uncertain- ties, following exposure to a particular ag ent, taking into account the inherent characteristics of the agent of concern as well as the characteristics of the specific target system. The risk assessment process include s four steps: hazard identification, hazard characterization (dose-response assessment), exposure assessment and risk characteri- zation. Risk characterization: The qualitative and, wh erever possible, quantit ative determination, including attendant uncertainti es, of the probability of o ccurrence of known and potential adverse effects of an agent in a given orga nism, system or (sub)population, under defined exposure conditions. Risk characterization is the fourth step in the risk assessment process. Risk management: The process of weighing po licy alternatives, decision-making and action taking. Self-tolerance: Specific i of speci alized immunological memory in an individual by exposure to antigen. Threshold: Dose or exposure concentration of an agent below which a stated effect is not observed or expected to occur. Threshold effect: An adverse effect for which there is a dose or exposure concentration below which the stated effect is not observed or expected to occur. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 184Tolerance: Persistent condition of specific immunological unresponsiveness, resulting from previous non-sensitizing exposure to the antigen. Uncertainty factor: Reductive f actor by which an observed or estimated no-observed-adverse- effect level or other reference point, su ch as the benchmark dose or benchmark dose lower confidence limit, is divided to arrive at a reference dose or standard that is considered safe or without appreciable risk.

Annex I of the regulation sets out the details of how to carry out a chemical safety assessment and document it in a chemical safety report. The annex has been s upplemented by a tec hnical guidance document on information requirements and chemical safety assessment. These guidance documents can be obtained via general, REACH regulations require that qua ntitative exposure estimates for relevant exposure scenarios are compared with the derive d no-effect level (DNEL), which in turn is obtained by application of assessment (o r uncertainty) factors to NOAEL (or LOAEL) values. The result is expressed as the risk char acterization ratio, which is then used to assess the safety of an exposure scenario. For skin se nsitizers, a qualitative ri sk characterization is usually required, but the guidance document also provides the possibility of performing a toxic effects on (parts of) the immune system, th e risk assessment steps are not different from those for other systemic toxic effects affec ting other organs and include derivation of a NOAEL, application of assessment factors to de rive a DNEL, quantitative exposure estimates for relevant exposure scenarios a nd derivation of the risk charac terization ratio. The reader is referred to the technical guidance document for further information. United States of America (USEPA) At the time of preparation of this WHO/IPCS guidance docu ment, the USEPA was in the process of developing guidance for immunosuppre ssion risk assessment. The development of guidance by the USEPA was intended to provide tools for USEPA scientists to objectively evaluate the potential for imm unosuppression in experimental and clinical models following exposure to environmental chemicals. Th e USEPA document under development focuses predominantly on unintended immunosuppression, b ecause there is wide acceptance of the relevance of immunosuppression end-points in humans and experimental animals for the determination of human risk. When completed, the USEPA guidance document will also supply basic information to the public about USEPA's risk assessment methods for immuno- suppression risk assessment. quantitative risk assessment, as discussed in chapter 6 of th is document.

Blood lead levels (BLLs) as low as 10-15 \u00b5g/dl have been associated with cognitive and behavioural deficits (Bellinger, 1995; Garavan et al., 2000). The United States Centers for Disease Control and Pr evention (CDC) define elevated BLLs, or the threshold for intervention, to be 10 \u00b5g/dl or grea ter in children 6 years of age or younger. The main sources of lead exposure in children are deteriorating paint and paint dust found in old homes, and differences in individual exposure levels are often asso- ciated with social and economic factors. Alt hough BLLs are decreasing in children due to efforts to restrict lead use, CDC estimates th at approximately 11% of children 6 years of age or younger in the USA still have BLLs in excess of 10 \u00b5g/dl (Binns et al., 2001). In adults, elevated BLLs that result from occupational exposure, although significantly reduced over the last several decades, are still a concern in almost all countries and regions, including Western Europe and the USA. The United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey indicates that 700 000 adults in the USA have BLLs greater than 5 \u00b5g/dl, with many thousands having BLLs great er than 25 \u00b5g/dl from occupational expo- sure. Health effects from lead exposure have been reported in multiple organ systems, including the nervous, haematological and repr oductive systems. Lead's effect on multiple organ systems may be due to its ability to co mpete for calcium, iron and zinc binding sites. Effects related to low-level lead exposure, including immunological effects, are not as well understood, but are still of concern. Several pu blished studies in which the immunological effects from lead exposure were studied, partic ularly in occupational settings, are available, but some ambiguity still exists regarding the e ffect of lead on the human immune system. The data available from laboratory animal studies using lead are more robust, more homogeneous and clearer regarding the effect of lead on the immune system. The present case-study was conducted to evalua te the guidance provided for the assessment case-study because it is typical of many putative immunotoxic chem icals, for which consider- able experimental and human data have been collected, in that only moderate effects have been reported in exposed humans. As with other areas of toxicology, human data are preferable for the risk assessment of lead immunotoxicity, because less extrapolation is needed, and thus the data provide a more accurate estimate of risk to the general population. Statistically significant differences in immune system end-points have been demonstrated between exposed and control popul ations, although in some cases laboratory values in the exposed populations are within normal referen ce ranges. Nevertheless, human health effects in exposed populations, including reduced resistance to infecti on, have been reported when laboratory values cluster at the lower end of the reference range (Luebke et al., 2004). Thus, there is evidence that statistically significan t changes in immune end-points may predict adverse health effects, alt hough acceptance of the evidence as predictiv e is not universal. Regarding lead, the vast majority of the human studies were collected from adults with occupational exposure, although some recent at tention has focused on environmental expo- sure in children. Nonetheless, data evaluated for the curren t lead case-study presented here support the conclusion that lead is immunotoxic. of immunosuppression, as presente d in chapter 4 of this documen t. Lead was selected for the Harmonization Project Document No. 10 190This case-study is not a formal risk assessment of lead as an immunotoxicant. Furthermore, toxicity (e.g. developmental neurotoxicity) we re not considered, even though adverse effects in other organ systems may occur at doses lo wer than those associated with lead immuno- toxicity. This exercise begins with a brief su mmary of the available evidence for lead-induced immunosuppression, followed by application of a weight of evidence ap proach for the assess- C1.2 Background: immunot oxicity data for lead Heavy metals, in general, exert a variety of effects on the immune system. Lead is one of the most studied environmental and occupational chemicals for effects on the immune system, with publications dating back to the 1950s (Belli & Giuliani, 1955). Both experimental publications, summarize results and serve as a focal point for all later discussions. These (Table C1.4), few of which have been done. It is important to note th at the tables do not include every published lead immunotoxicity st udy. Rather, the selected publications relating to immunosuppression were considered useful for illustrating the risk assessment framework presented in chapter 4. Public ations included in th ese tables generally included BLLs deter- mined at or proximal to the time at which im mune testing was conducted. This allows direct exposure comparisons to be made between human s and experimental animals by an internal dose metric, substantially incr easing confidence in the qua ntitative evaluation of immuno- suppressive effects. Mechanistic studies were not included in the tables unless they were useful in supporting the risk assessment. Experi mental animal studies that employed prenatal or early postnatal exposure were included to assess whether individuals exposed during immune system development might represent a uniquely su sceptible population. Experi- mental animal studies that failed to report BLLs or presented only negative findings were generally excluded from the tables, as they do no t contribute to the assessment process, given the number of studies that reported both BLLs and positive immunotoxicity findings. Human studies relevant to im munosuppression were exclusivel y epidemiological and retro- spective in nature. No case-studi es or prospective studies were identified. With the exception of several studies conducted in schoolchildre n, in which relatively low BLLs were reported from environmental exposure, human data were derived from o ccupationally exposed cohorts. These epidemiological studies generall y provided minimal exposu re histories, often limited to a mean or range of years on the job, but did include current BLLs. In addition, as a whole, the data in human stud ies are inconclusive as to the effect of lead on the immune system. It appears that lead may be immunot oxic; however, some huma n studies suggest an effect on the immune system, and others sugges t that lead has no effe ct. The lack of study reproducibility and the va riability of many of the data poi nts limit the utility of the human data in a risk assessmen t of lead's immunotoxicity. More recently, the spectrum of immunopathologie s potentially associated with lead exposure has expanded to include evidence that exposure may increase serum IgE and the incidence of atopic diseases. For example, experimental animal studies have demonstrat ed that lead affects CD4+ cells and B cells, resulting in increase d production of Th2 cytokines and IgE (Dietertment of immunosuppression (chapter 4, Figure 4.1). only immunotoxicity data were ev aluated as part of this exercise; therefore, other forms of tables include adult experimental animal studies (Table C1.1 ), prenatal and postnatal experi-animal and occupational worker studies, as well as several children's studies, exist in which immunological effects following lead exposure were observed. Tables C1.1-C1.4 list the key mental animal studies (Table C1.2), adult human studies (Table C1.3) and studies in children Table C1.1: Effects of lead exposure on the immune system of adult experimental animals.

Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 197 & Piepenbrink, 2006). Similarly, Boscolo et al. (1999) reported that el evated B cell numbers and serum IgE concentrations were associated with increased BLLs . Elevated serum IgE levels have also been detected in children exposed to enviro nmental lead (Lutz et al., 1999). In a prospective study of the children of 224 women in Poland recruited in the second tri- mester, maternal and cord BLLs below 2 \u00b5g/dl were significantly associated with the fre- quency of allergic sens itization in the children, determin ed by skin prick testing to common allergens at age 5 (Jedrychowsk i et al., 2011). The data are not further reviewed here, because the case-study is on the potenti al immunosuppression associated with lead. However, it is complete an evaluation of the data on i mmunosuppression following guidance presented in immunotoxicological data relevant to end-poi nts other than immunosupp ression in the appro- priate chapter and include that in a weight of evidence evaluation for immunotoxicity. Given the data described above, the risk assessor w ould evaluate the data on IgE and hypersensitiv- C1.3 Assessment of lead -induced immunosuppression C1.3.1 Exposure assessment for lead C1.3.1.1 Transience of immunotoxicity observed in adults Generally speaking, the immune system has a high capacity to adap t and rebound following an insult. Insufficient data ar e available to clearly establis h whether the immunotoxic effects of lead are transient or persistent; no adult human or experimental animal studies were identified that assessed immunot oxicity over time after lead exposure ceased. Circumstantial evidence, including the lack of effect on stem cells and B LLs decreasing upon cessation of exposure, suggests that the eff ects of lead are not persistent , particularly following adult exposure. The types of immune effects observed suggest altera tions in immune regulatory events (e.g. altered CD4/CD8 cells or regulatory cytokines), and there is little evidence that there are significant effects on haematopoietic stem cells, at leas t at relevant exposure levels that would result in permanent damage. On e should, however, note th at the human elimina- tion half-life of inorganic l ead is 30 days in blood and a pproximately 27 years in bone. Therefore, the potential exists for lead bio accumulation in soft tissues, such as liver and kidney, and bone over time. Furthermore, in adult humans, bone lead accounts for approx- imately 94% of the total body burden. Whereas lead in bone appears to serve as a source of bioavailable lead in blood long after exposur e has ceased and has been linked to non-immune end-points such as cardiovascular and renal effect s, it is currently not clear whether bone lead contributes to suppression of immunity over a long period of time. L ead exposure increases immature immune cell types (progenitor cells), indicating developmental inhibition, which may suggest that the effects will be longer lasting; however, ther e is no substantial evidence that this is the case. C1.3.1.2 Sensitivity of developing immune system to lead-induced immunotoxicity It is generally believed that the developing immune system is more susceptible than the mature immune system to chemicals. The deve loping immune system generally has a greater risk of toxicity than the adult system as a result of two factors\u2014lower doses can cause adverse effects and adverse effects may be longer lasting\u2014or a co mbination of the two (Luebke et al., 2006). However, available eviden ce indicates that imm une effects occur in ity following the guidance in chapter 6 on sensitization and allergic response. chapter 4 and Figure 4.1. Then, as directed in Figure 4.1, the risk assessor would evaluate useful to note that for a full evaluation of the immunotoxicity of lead, th e risk assessor would Harmonization Project Document No. 10 198children and adults at similar BLLs. BLLs at an d below 10 \u00b5g/dl prenatally or in infants can result in cognitive and behavioural deficits (Goyer, 1993; Bellinger 2006; Jedrychowski et al., 2008) , whereas studies across several animal species suggest that perinatal B LLs of approximately 10 \u00b5g/dl ar e also associated with juve- nile immunotoxicity (Dietert et al., 2004). In a large study conducted in children, Sarasua et al. (2000) found BLLs greater than 15 \u00b5g/dl to be positively associated with changes in serum IgG, IgA and IgM levels and peripheral B cell counts. In adults, ch anges observed in suggest age-related differences in immunosuppressive effects of lead in humans. In neonatal mice, immunotoxic changes can be observed at BLLs less than 20 \u00b5g/dl, whereas in adult rodents, immune alterations have been observed at similar BLLs ( 40 \u00b5g/dl) (Dietert et al., 2004). Experimental animal data do suggest th at there are windows of vulnerability during development in which lead-induced effects on th e immune system may be particularly detri- mental (Dietert et al., 2004). The developing fetus and child ma y also represent life stages with higher exposure because of physiological factors or behaviour , such as ingestion of dust and paint chips. The increased mobilization of l ead from bone during pregnancy is likely to represent an increas ed exposure for the developing fetus relative to lower maternal BLLs before and after pregnancy. C1.3.1.3 Persistence of immunotoxicity following developmental exposure In aggregate, published data suggest that i mmunotoxic effects are likely to persist longer when exposure occurs during development. There have been no immunotoxicity studies con- ducted in children following the removal of lead from their environment. In experimental animals, Bunn et al. (2001b) and Miller et al. (1998) administered lead in the drinking-water to female F344 rats either from days 2 to 21 of gestation or from 2 weeks preceding mating throughout pregnancy. Numerous immune alterations were obser ved, particularly in the female pups, including a pronounced reduction in the DTH response (LOEL = 250 mg/l) and IFN- production, whereas production of IL-4 and total serum IgE were elevated (LOEL = 100 mg/l). Bunn et al. (2001a) repo rted that suppression of th e DTH response was associated with a BLL of 38 g/dl (immediately post-exposure); the BLL for the 100 mg/l dose in females at birth was 7.6 g/dl. In both of these studies, BLLs at the time of immune assess- ment (5 and 13 weeks of age) were at back ground levels, suggesting that the lead-induced immunotoxicity may persist following exposure during development. C1.3.2 Application of the weight of evidence approach for assessment of immunosuppression\", that is intended to aid in or ganizing and character- izing immunotoxicity data from strong to weak evidence of significant immunosuppression. The questions are reproduced and answered below, followed by a discussion of the support- ing immunotoxicity data. C1.3.2.1 Are there epidemiological studies, clinical studies or case-studies available that provide human data on end-points relevant to immunosuppression (i.e. incidence of infections, response to vaccination, DTH, lymphocyte proliferation, other data)? Yes. There have been quite a few retrospective st udies in humans exposed to lead. The data are inconclusive as to whether lead is immunos uppressive due to the va riability of the data; however, a number of studies do suggest that lead has some effect on the immune system. A series of questions is presented in chapter 4, s ection 4.8.1, \"Weight of evidence approach immunoglobulin levels have been inconclusive (see Table C1.3). Thus, available data do not Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 199 Several studies suggest that lead exposure affect s resistance to infections in humans. Ewers et al. (1982) reported a \"slight tendency\" (no statistical analysis presented) for an increase in the annual incidence of colds and influenza in men exposed occupationally fo r at least 2 years. The range of BLLs was 21.3-85.2 \u00b5g/dl in expo sed workers and 6.6-20.8 \u00b5g/dl in controls. A study of Japanese lead workers determined that individuals with BLLs greater than 60 \u00b5g/dl were significantly more likely to have two or more colds annually compared with individuals with BLLs below 60 \u00b5g/dl (Horig uchi et al., 1992). Rabi nowitz et al. (1990) reported increased risk of respiratory tract illnes s, severe ear infections and illness other than colds or influenza (OR 1.2-1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1-2.4) in children of lead industry workers. Six human studies were identified in which functional testing was c onducted. The first study did not detect an association between BLLs and anti body responses to teta nus toxoid vaccina- tion in children (Reigart & Gr aber, 1976). However, in this study, only 7 children with BLLs below 30 \u00b5g/dl (group mean BLL = 22.6 \u00b5g/dl, ra nge = 14-30 \u00b5g/dl, considered \"normal\" at the time) were compared with a group of 12 children with \"eleva ted\" BLLs (mean = 45.3 \u00b5g/dl, range = 41-51 \u00b5g/dl). It should be noted that in this study, the BLLs in the control group exceeded the current CDC action limit. A series of five manuscripts reported inhibito ry effects of lead on PMNLs and macrophages. Governa et al. (1988) reported that chemotaxis of PMNLs was significantly impaired in Italian lead workers at a mean BLL of 63.2 \u00b5g /dl compared with 19.2 \u00b5g /dl in the reference population. In this study, haematological and me tabolic parameters were similar between controls and lead workers. Increased BLLs were also reported to be directly correlated with decreased PMNL chemotactic indices in lead workers (Valentino et al., 1991). Queiroz et al. (1993, 1994) reported decr eased PMNL chemotaxis and lytic activity in of 12-90 \u00b5g/dl. Bergeret et al. ( 1990) reported similar effects at BLLs of 71 \u00b5g/dl in workers compared with 9 \u00b5g/dl in the control group. Effects of lead on PMNLs and macrophages were also reported by Pineda-Zav aleta et al. (2004), in that an associat ion was found between BLLs in children (ranging from 4 to 50 \u00b5g/d l) and activation of macrophages and PMNLs. However, it appears that at least two studies reported results from the same test population, and in some studies the e ffects were not dose related. It does appear that PMNLs are one of the targets of lead's toxicity. One study assessed exposed to lead (Queiroz et al., 1994). Phagocytosis of both antigens an d phagocytic splenic function were normal in all worker s; however, the lytic activity of C. albicans was impaired. The average BLL of the 33 workers examined wa s 43.2 \u00b5g/dl. These data may be suitable for a quantitative risk assessment, as BLLs we re recorded and the effect on PMNLs seems should be applied as follows: The interspecies uncertainty factor would be 1, as this study was conducted in humans. The intraspecies uncertainty factor to account for interindividual variability would be 10 in the absence of more definitive data. In addition, this study did not examine dose-response relationships, so the mini mum dose at which an effect on PMNLs would be observed is not clear. The LOAEL to NOAEL uncertainty factor would be 10. intracellular killing of Candida albicans and C. pseudotropicalis by neutrophils in workers reproducible. Uncertainty factors as described in section 3.3.10 of chapter 3 of the guidance Harmonization Project Document No. 10 200 The subchronic to chronic unc ertainty factor would be 3. The mean exposure period in this study was 4 years, but some workers were exposed for only 6 months. The database for lead toxicity is compre hensive, and it includes a substantial number of data on the immune effects caused by lea d. Thus, the database uncertainty factor would be 1. To complete the derivation of an AEL, the guidance recommends consideration of groups at risk (i.e. children and elderly) and then dividing the POD by the total uncertainty factor. Using the above uncertainty factors for a ri sk assessment of imm unosuppression, the total uncertainty factor applied would be 300 (1 for interspecies, 10 for intraspecies, 10 for LOAEL to NOAEL, 3 for subchronic to chronic and 1 for database). Application of this uncertainty factor to the BLL obtained from the study (i.e . the POD) results in a BLL of 0.144 \u00b5g/dl (i.e. 43.2/300) as the AEL. There are a number of studies that report lead effects on gene ral immune assays in young and positively associated with serum immunoglobulin leve ls (i.e. IgG, IgM, IgA and IgE) as well as the number of CD8+ and B cells and negativ ely associated with CD4+ cell numbers (see numbers, C3 and C4 complement concentrations, and serum IgG, IgM and IgA levels. Two studies of occupational lead exposure reporte d reduced mitogen responses in lead-exposed individuals (Fischbein et al., 199 3; Mishra et al., 2003). Mishra et al. (2003) reported signifi- cantly reduced mitogen responses in workers with BLLs as low as 6.5 \u00b5g/dl, although non- specific mitogen stimulation, as a test for immune function, is rarely used due to an apparent lack of sensitivity. In adult humans, decreased monocytes were observed in a study of occu- pational exposure to lead over 5 year s in which BLLs ranged from 15 to 55 g/dl (Pinkerton et al., 1998). There were no hist opathological or organ weight data available for humans. Despite the seemingly large number of human st udies in lead-exposed individuals, most data in humans were considered inadequate to establish an accurate POD (see Tables C1.3-C1.4). None of the studies established a causal associat ion, and all were retrospective in nature. In addition, there is little information on immu ne functional end-points in humans with low BLLs. Furthermore, a biologically plausible immunotoxic profile coul d not be established, nor were the reported effects between populations with similar BLLs consistent. For example, several studies showed decrea sed immunoglobulin levels in l ead-exposed workers; however, several studies also showed no effect on immunoglobulin levels. Other studies suggested that lead may be immunostimulatory in children (see Table C1.4). Sarasua et al. (2000) found that in children under 3 years of age with BLLs great er than or equal to 15 \u00b5g/dl, IgA, IgG and IgM levels were increased. In addition, Lutz et al. (1999) found that IgE levels were increased in children with lead exposure greate r than or equal to 10 \u00b5g/dl; however, in this study, no effect was observed on other general im mune parameters. One study suggested that lead may cause a shift in the T cell responses (Li et al., 2005), but ye t another study sug- gested that lead has no effect on the immune system in chil dren (Reigart & Graber, 1976). The weight of evidence in humans suggests that lead exposure produces changes in the immune system, but there are not enough data to determine the precise effect and/or mech- anism of immunotoxicity; in fact , there appears to be evidence that lead acts (especially at lower levels) as an immunostim ulating agent rather than an immunosuppressive agent. The PMNL data described above were determined to be suitable for a quantitative risk assessment because of the number of studies in which an effect was observed. The AEL for these data was determined to be 0.144 \u00b5g /dl (see calculations above). Table C1.4). In adults, lead exposure has b een negatively associat ed with NK and B cell adult humans (see Tables C1.3-C1.4). In childre n, environmental exposure to lead has been Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 201 Note: The following questions from the weight of evidence appr oach refer to experimental animal data only. C1.3.2.2 Is there evidence that the chemical reduces resistance to infections and/or tumours? Yes. There is clear evidence from multiple animal studies that host resistance to bacterial infection is compromised following lead exposure as low as 82.9 mg/l or at a BLL as low as 20.5 \u00b5g/dl. A USEPA document on air quality criteria (USEPA, 20 06) reported multiple rodent host resistance studies in which mortality was increase d in animals exposed to lead and a variety of pathogens. A lead dose of 20 mg/kg body weight administered intravenously in rats led to 80-96% mortality from Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli , compared with 0% mortality in non-lead-exposed animals. In mice, lead exposures of 2000 mg/l orally for 2 weeks led to 100% mortal ity from EMC virus, compared with 19% mortality in non-lead-exposed mice. Multiple studies in adult mice reported increased susceptibility to bacterial challenge follow- bacterial counts in organs (e.g. the spleen). Th e results showed increas ed susceptibility to Listeria monocytogenes at drinking-water concen trations of greater than or equal to 82.9 mg/l for 4 weeks (Lawrence, 1981), Staphylococcus aureus by daily intraperitoneal lead injections of 10 mg/kg body weight for 15 days (Bishayi & Sengupta, 2003) and Salmonella typhimurium following exposure to drinking-water c ontaining lead at 1036 or 2072 mg/l for 16 weeks (Fernandez-Cabezudo et al., 2007). The mo st sensitive model appears to be reduced resistance to Listeria infection in mice, where increased bacterial counts in the spleen (at exposure of 2072 mg/l) and increased mortality (at exposure above 82.9 mg/l) were observed following exposure to lead in drinking-water for 4 weeks (L awrence, 1981). This exposure level could have been selected as the LOAEL. However, BLLs were not determined in this study, and direct exposure comparisons could not be made between humans and experimental animals using an internal dose metric, substant ially decreasing confidence in the quantitative evaluation of immunosuppressive effects. Lead exposure in animals leads to decreased host resistance to other pathogens. These data appear to contain strong evidence that lead may be immunosuppressive, in particular the Fernandez-Cabezudo et al. (2007) study, in whic h a dose-related decrease in survival was observed following lead exposure. These data also include BLL values for each dose group (20.5 and 106 \u00b5g/dl at 1036 and 2072 mg/l, respect ively), increasing the utility of the host resistance data in determining a POD. Host resistance assays, when designed and conducted well and related to immune system defects, pr ovide the most direct evidence of an adverse health effect. In addition, two epidemiological studies were identified that suggest decreased resistance to respiratory infection in lead workers, and changes were also observed in general immune assays in rodents. The combination of host resistance, functional immune measures and general immune assays makes the rodent immunotoxicity data for lead a very strong data set. The oral route of exposure in this st udy is extremely relevant to human exposure. In the Fernandez-Cabezudo et al. (2007) study, C3H/HeN mice we re exposed to a range of concentrations (0, 1036 and 2072 mg/l) of lead acetate in the drinking-water for approx- imately 16 weeks. The average BLLs were 2.9 \u00b1 1.1, 20.5 \u00b1 1.1 and 106.2 8.9 \u00b5g/dl in the 0, 1036 and 2072 mg/l exposure groups, respectively. Deliberate lead exposure increased susceptibility to Salmonella infection in mice, as demonstrated by increased bacterial burden ing exposure to lead (see Table C1.1). Susceptibility was monitored by either mortality or Harmonization Project Document No. 10 202in target organs at the higher dose and increased mortality at both doses; bacterial burdens were not assessed in the 1036 mg/l exposure gro up. No changes in numbers or function of B and T cells were observed in this study. Ex vivo-cultured splenocytes showed a marked decrease in IFN- and IL-12p40 production. Increased secr etion of IL-4 by splenocytes was observed in lead-exposed mice as well, suggesting a plausible explanation of the observed shift in the in vivo anti- Salmonella antibody response from the ith lead exposure in the 1036 and 2072 mg/l lead acetate groups, re spectively. The BLL in control mice was similar to background levels in the USA populati on. Mice were infected with a sublethal dose of a virulent strain of Salmonella typhimurium at week 16 of treatment and observed for mortality for up to 60 days. Overall survival in control mice was 80%, with a median survival time of 60 days. Mice exposed to lead acetate at a c oncentration of 1036 mg/l had a survival rate of 40%, with a median survival time of 26 days. None of the mice treated with lead acetate at 2072 mg/l survived the infection, w ith a median survival time of 16 days. The increased mortality at the high dose correlated with increased bacterial burden in mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and liver. Cyt okine production (IL-4, IL-12, TNF- and IFN- ) was assessed using ex vivo-culture d spleen cells. Reductions in levels of IL-12p40 of 22-25% without stimulation and 42-45% with stimula observed in lead-exposed spleno- cytes. Without stimulation, splenocytes did not secrete any detect able levels of TNF- , and levels of IFN- following stimulation were reduced 27-35% in the 1036 and 2072 mg/l groups, respectively. In contrast, levels of IL-4 we re increased in splenocyte cultures of lead- exposed mice. The LOAEL for lead acetate in this study was 1036 mg/l, with a corres-ponding BLL of 20.5 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b5g/dl. The use of this LOAEL is somewhat less than ideal owing to the lack of a no-effect level; however, this was one of the few host resistance studies that included BLLs, making these data more suitable for a lead risk assessment. This study was conducted in adult animals; therefore, it likel y underestimates the risk to children, whose immune system has yet to fully develop, as well as the elderly, whose immune systems are undergoing senescence. To continue the risk assessment using the Fe rnandez-Cabezudo et al . (2007) LOAEL, uncer- The interspecies uncertainty factor w ould be 3. This study was not conducted in humans; however, the metric being used is an internal concentration, not a dose level or dose concentration. Changes in host resist ance have also been observed in humans. The intraspecies uncertainty factor to account for interindividual variability would be 10 in the absence of more definitive data. The LOAEL to NOAEL uncertainty factor would be 10. The subchronic to chronic un certainty factor would be 10. The database for lead toxicity is compre hensive, and it includes a substantial number of data on the immune effects caused by lea d. Thus, the database uncertainty factor would be 1. To complete the derivation of an AEL, the guidance recommends consideration of groups at risk (i.e. children and elderly) and then dividi ng the POD by the total uncertainty factor. As discussed above, there is eviden ce that the immune systems in children and the elderly are more susceptible to toxicity. Using the above uncerta inty factors for a risk assessment of immunosuppression, the total uncertainty factor applied would be 3000 (3 for interspecies, 10 for intraspecies, 10 for LOAEL to NOAEL, 10 fo r subchronic to chronic and 1 for database). tainty factors as desc ribed in section 3.3.10 of chapter 3 of the guidance should be applied: Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 203 Application of this uncertainty factor to th e BLL obtained from the LOAEL (i.e. the POD) results in a BLL of 0.0068 \u00b5g/d l (i.e. 20.5/3000) as the AEL. C1.3.2.3 Is there evidence that the chemical reduces immune function (antibody production, NK cell function, DTH, MLR, CTL, phagocytosis or bacterial killing by monocytes, etc.)? Yes. Considerable evidence demonstr ates the effect of lead on functional immune responses in both the adult and developing experimental animals. Effects included both suppression of the antibody PFC response, an indicator of humoral immune functi on, and suppression of DTH, a classical measure of cell-mediated i mmunity. However, the effects on DTH appear much more consistent between investigations than the effects on the PFC response. For example, Luster et al. (1978) reported decrea sed PFC responses following prenatal/postnatal exposure at BLLs as low as 29 \u00b5g/dl in Spra gue-Dawley rats, and Blakley & Archer (1981) reported suppressed PFC responses in vitro at a BLL of 25 \u00b5g/dl. However, Mudzinski et al. (1986) and Lawrence (1981) failed to show effects on the PF C response following testing in rodents and under various exposure paradigms. The DTH response is dependent upon T cell priming and recruitment to a s ite of antigen localization, where interference with this Th1- mediated process would lead to a decreased immune response to pa thogenic challenge. In contrast to the PFC data, consistent suppres sion of the DTH response has been observed across multiple test species and at various e xposure paradigms, including prenatal, neonatal with suppression of the DTH response (Chen et al., 2004). A decreased DTH response was also observed in pups exposed to lead until pos tnatal day 45 (BLLs great er than or equal to 29.3 \u00b5g/dl), whose dams were exposed from pr emating to weaning (Faith et al., 1979). A study by McCabe et al. (1999) also include d BLL values for each dose group, making these data desirable for obtaining a POD. The route of exposure in this study, which was drinking- water, is extremely relevant to human exposur e. The weaknesses of the data are a lack of correlating human data. DTH testing is used in children to help diagnose primary T cell deficiencies; however, less is known about the correlation between minor/moderate changes in DTH responses and corresponding human hea lth. In this study, adu lt BALB/c mice were sensitized intrav enously with 108 SRBCs followed by a subcutaneous challenge 4 days later in the right foot pad with SRBCs. The DTH response (foot pad swelling) was measured by comparing the size of the challenged foot pad before and after (24 hour s) antigen challenge. In control mice, a 0.48 mm increase in foot pa d size occurred; however, in mice exposed to 512 mg/l lead orally, only a 0.11 mm increase in foot pad size occurred. The lowest effective dose in this study was 512 mg/l, with a co rresponding BLL of 87 \u00b5g/dl. This study was conducted in adult animals; therefore, it likel y underestimates the risk to children, whose immune system has yet to fully develop, as well as the elderly, whose immune systems are undergoing senescence. Lead has been shown to be immunotoxic to macrophages, not only by interfering with macro- phage development such as the response to colony stimulating fact or-1 (CSF-1) (Kowolenko et al., 1989), but also by altering mature tissu e macrophage function. Antigen presentation and T lymphocyte stimulation in mouse macropha ges are decreased following lead exposure as low as 82.9 mg/l for up to 4 weeks (Kowol enko et al., 1988). Nitric oxide production is decreased in macrophages from multiple speci es, and one in vitro study showed reduced nitric oxide production at BLLs equivalent to 10 \u00b5g/dl (Tian & Lawrence, 1996). Nitric oxide is important to the function of macrophages, as it is, in part, responsible for the antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity of this leukocyte. or adult exposure (Table C1.5).

(2001) Goats Outbred Adult Oral 50 mg/kg body weight per day 6 weeks NM Haneef et al. (1995) NM, not measured The data on macrophages appear to be consiste nt, in that macrophage function seems to be suppressed upon lead exposure. In addition, in vitro human data suggest that lead exposure leads to decreased chemotaxis of PMNLs, which may be relevant to the increased respiratory infections in humans. Both of these cell types are very important to innate as well as adaptive immunity. Cell-mediated immunity suppression da ta are consistently seen with lead expo- sure; however, the data on lead's effect on humoral immuni ty are less conclusive. The data on DTH suppression in animals may be the most complete and reproduci ble data set on lead as an immunosuppressant. Therefore, these data are suitable for a qua ntitative risk assess- ment. Although it is clear that the DTH re sponse was suppressed at 512 mg/l (BLL of 87 \u00b5g/dl), the McCabe et al. (1999) study also te sted lower doses to establish a dose-response Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 205 relationship. Mice were exposed to 0, 32, 128, 512 or 2048 mg/l; however, the authors do not report the statistics for individual comparisons of the DTH relative to control except for the 512 mg/l dose. It is unknown if mice exposed to lead doses of 128 and 32 mg/l with corresponding BLLs of 49 and 9 \u00b5g/dl had a s uppressed DTH response. Therefore, the 512 mg/l dose with the corresponding BLL of 87 \u00b5g/dl was used as a LOAEL. To continue the risk assessmen t using the McCabe et al. ( 1999) lowest effective dose or should be applied: The interspecies uncertainty factor w ould be 3. This study was not conducted in humans; however, the metric being used is an internal concentration, not a dose level or dose concentration. The intraspecies uncertainty factor to account for interindividual variability would be 10 in the absence of more definitive data. The LOAEL to NOAEL uncertainty factor would be 10. The subchronic to chronic un certainty factor would be 10. The database for lead toxicity is compre hensive, and it includes a substantial number of data on the immune effects caused by lea d. Thus, the database uncertainty factor would be 1. To complete the derivation of an AEL, the guidance recommends consideration of groups at risk (i.e. children and elderly) using the intraspecies uncertain ty factor and then dividing the POD by the total uncertainty factor. As discus sed above, there is evid ence that the immune systems in children and the elderly are more su sceptible to toxicity. Using the above uncer- tainty factors for a risk assessment of immunosuppression, th e total uncertainty factor applied would be 3000 (3 for interspecies, 10 for intraspecies, 10 for LOAEL to NOAEL, 10 for subchronic to chronic and 1 for database). When one applies this uncertainty factor to the BLL obtained from the LOAEL (i.e. the POD), the AEL is 0.029 \u00b5g/dl (i.e. 87/3000). C1.3.2.4 Is there evidence from observational immune assays (lymphocyte phenotyping, cytokines, complement, lymphocyte proliferation, etc.) that the chemical is immunosuppressive? Yes. There is evidence that lead affects general markers of immune system health in experi- mental animals. Lead exposure in animals cause s a shift in immune cells to immature cell types (progenitor cells) (Bur chiel et al., 1987). Whereas Fern andez-Cabezudo et al. (2007) reported no gross alteration in th e ratio of B to T lymphocytes in mice administered lead in drinking-water at 2072 mg/l for 16 weeks (BLL = concentrations of the cyto- kines IFN- and IL-12p40 were reduced and secreti on of IL-4 was increased in ex vivo- cultured splenocytes. This increased production of IL-4 correlated with a shift in the in vivo anti-Salmonella antibody response from the protective IgG2a isot ype to the Th2-induced IgG1 isotype. The authors suggested that rather than a cytotoxic proce ss, lead causes a shift in immune responsiveness to T h2-type reactions. Chen et al. (2004) also reported that mater- nal lead exposure (250 mg/l in drinking-wa ter) during early development reduced IFN- pro- duction in adult offspring. They also reported that offspring from lead-exposed dams fed a high-protein diet had elevated production of both IL-4 and TNF- compared with offspring from lead-exposed rats fed a normal diet, althou gh the relevance of thes e findings in terms of this risk assessment is unclear. LOAEL, uncertainty factors as desc ribed in section 3.3.10 of chapter 3 of the guidance Harmonization Project Document No. 10 206Decreases in temporal levels of cytokines are not necessarily reliable evidence of immuno- suppression, and the predictive value of i mmunophenotyping has not been established. Several studies demonstrated no difference in immune parameters. All of these factors call into question the use of these data in a quant itative or qualitative risk assessment; however, the observed immunosuppressive effects do add to the weight of eviden ce evaluation of lead and its suppression of the immune system. C1.3.2.5 Is there evidence that the chemical causes haematological changes (e.g. altered WBC counts) suggestive of immune effects? Yes. Very few immunotoxicological studies report ed significant haemat ological effects from lead exposure. Total periphera l WBC counts were significantly decreased in offspring of dams that received lead at either 250 or 500 mg/l (BLL = 70.8 and 112 g/dl) in their drinking-water during breeding and pregna ncy (Miller et al., 1998). Although peripheral WBCs were not enumerated, Snyder et al. (2000) reported similar decreases in splenic lymphoid cells in mice at 2-3 weeks of age exposed in utero and postnata lly to doses of lead acetate as low as 16.6 mg/l. At greater than or equal to 4 weeks of age, only the mice that were treated during gestation and lactation maintained this decrease in splenocytes. In these studies, dams were given lead at 16.6-207.2 mg/l in the drinking-water starting on day 15 of gestation. Bunn et al. (2001a) re ported decreased re lative and absolute peripheral monocyte numbers (74% decrease) and increased relative neutrophil numbers in 13-week-old female offspring of dams exposed to lead during ge station (100 mg/l in the drinking-water). Male offspring had increased relative neutrophil numbe rs and decreased relative lymphocytes at 5, but not 13, weeks of age . Associations between moderate changes in WBC counts of this nature and health effects are often difficult to establish and cannot be justified in view of the fact that both functional immune and host resistance data for lead are ava ilable. Many of these studies did not report BLLs, and the data are not consistent. A quant itative or qualitative risk assessment using these data would be of questionable utility. C1.3.2.6 Is there histopathological evidence (thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, etc.) that suggests that the chemical causes immunotoxicity? No. Faith et al. (1979) reported that prenatal/pos tnatal exposure to lead altered spleen and between the organs in the control and exposed groups. C1.3.2.7 Is there evidence that the chemical reduces immune organ weight (thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, etc.)? Yes. Although very few animal studies included examination of lymphoid organs, changes in lymphoid organ weights were noted primarily following prenatal/postn atal lead exposure. Faith et al. (1979) reported signifi cant decreases in thymus weight s in rats following prenatal and postnatal lead exposure (25 mg/l in drinking-water) at BLLs as low as 29 \u00b5g/dl; however, spleen weights increased, only in males, at a reported BLL of 52.8 \u00b5g/dl (50 determ ined relative splenic weights in male and female rats at 5 and 13 weeks of age following ge stational exposure, with the following results. Female off- spring of rats administered lead at 250 mg/l in drinking-water had significantly increased relative spleen weights at 13 weeks of age, but th is effect could not be detected at 5 weeks of age. The relative spleen weights of all female treatment groups were significantly higher than thymus weights (see section C1.3.2.7), but that there were no histopathological differences Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 207 those of all male treatment groups (except male s at 250 mg/l compared with female controls) at 13 weeks of age. In the study by Kim & La wrence (2000), adult mice had decreased spleen weights following lead exposure (B LL = 45 \u00b5g/dl) and infection with L. monocytogenes , further supporting a role of lead in the reduction of host resistance. As immune organ weight data are limited in an imals and contradictory for the spleen, these findings are equivocal towards the weight of evidence for lead-induced immunosuppression. C1.3.3 Weight of evidence review of risk assessments of lead as an immunosuppressant Lead is found in a myriad of environmental sources, includ ing landfills, hazardous waste sites, mining areas, older domestic structures and even soil around old fruit orchards. As such, normal human activity patterns present pote ntial exposures to this ubiquitous metal via ingestion of food and water, in halation of air or swallowing pa rticulate matter that contains lead. Furthermore, it should be noted that lead exists in several forms (e.g. lead salts, tetra- ethyl lead), and the physiological effects of lead and lead co mpounds via all possible routes of exposure are numerous. However, this case- study is not intended to be a comprehensive review of the toxic effects of lead in general; rather, the hazard characterization presented here is focused specifically on the immunosuppressi ve effects of inorgani c lead via the oral route. As noted in the studies highlighted in this case-study, the effects of lead on the immune system vary across similar internal dose range s (i.e. BLLs) and exposure durations/life stages between increased BLLs and alterations in immune phenotype. Results from these human studies, including occupationally exposed adult populations and environmental exposures in children, were almost always limited to non -functional tests of immunity. Lead-induced decreases in host resistance are a primary effect of concern for the immune system because of the public health implications, and there were few functional testing or incidence data available on infectious diseases in humans. Ew ers et al. (1982) report ed suggestive anecdotal evidence of reduced resistance to infection in lead workers with BLLs 2-fold or more greater than those considered \"normal\" at that tim e. The effects (when measured) most commonly observed in human epidemiological studies included changes in serum immunoglobulin levels, particularly IgG and IgA, and immunoph enotypic profiles; however, the changes were not consistent and varied greatly between a dults and children. There was little evidence of changes in standard haematological parameters , such as WBC counts or differentials. One major weakness of the human studies in worker s was that the epidemiological evaluations were retrospective in nature and contained minimal occ upational exposure histories. There was also evidence of data inconsistencies in human studies. For example, whereas decreased numbers of CD4+ cells and normal numbers of CD8+ cells were a common observation, several studies reported normal numbers of CD4+ cells but re duced numbers of CD8+ cells. Inconsistencies in the human epidemiological studies may be due to type 1 errors from multiple testing modalities, faulty study design or simply human variability. Furthermore, it should be noted that the test methods initia lly adopted by immunot oxicologists to assess immune function in humans (and experimental animals) prior to 1990 were not standardized. Some assays are still not standa rdized; therefore, the methods mu st be assessed fully, as well as the results. The tests that were commonly pe rformed and the experimental design by which they were conducted were established ad hoc , often resulting in inconsistent findings. (e.g. Tables C1.1-C1.4). Several human studies are available illust rating associations Harmonization Project Document No. 10 208Therefore, empirical observations of immunosup pressive effects of l ead in humans are not considered a reliable basi s for quantitative assessment. The immunosuppressive effects of lead exposure in adult and neonatal rodents include altera- tions in antigen presentation, decreased cy tokine production, decreased antibody and DTH responses and increased susceptibility following challenge with infectious agents. Host resis- tance data are available in animals following challenge with different infectious agents, tioned, however, that in several instances, increased susceptibil ity to infecti on occurred at BLLs below those reported to affect marker s of immune function (Lawrence, 1981). This may be due to variances in duration of e xposure or non-immunological mechanisms (Luster et al., 1978). It can be argued th at the host resistance data provide better in sight into immune the best animal data for a quantitative risk assessment, especially in those studies in which BLLs were measured. However, the POD should be considered in the context of the larger picture of all immune effects; that is, lead may not be strict ly immunosuppressive but rather immunomodulatory, in that its effects on the i mmune system are not always suppressive. One of the most consistent findings in animal s following lead exposure was a reduced DTH following immunization were commonly reported, th e effect was not consistent across studies or species. Human data on DTH seemed to s uggest an upregulation of the cell-mediated immune response in lead-exposed workers and ch ildren, contradictory to the effects seen in animals. A general weakness of the rodent st udies was that they represented subchronic exposures and were conducted in only one sex. Th e strengths of the animal database for lead- induced immunosuppression include broader covera ge of decreased host resistance, ample number of developmental immunotoxicity stud ies and greater confid ence in the exposure- Mechanistic data applicable to risk assessm ent are limited. For example, the MOA for lead- induced developmental effects is believed to be related to changes in regulatory events, most notably a shift in the balance of Th1/Th2 cell activ ity, evidenced by changes in regulatory cytokine incl uding IL-4 and IFN- (Dietert plausibility of persistent chemical-induced altered immunoregulation following develop- mental exposure to lead is supported by simila r outcomes following exposure to a variety of xenobiotics (Wang & Pinkerton, 2007). Dietert & Zelikoff (2009) suggested that lead expo- sure during immune system development causes a persistent shift in the ratio of Th1 to Th2 cytokine production, even after BLLs fall to control values. The shift results in a predomin- ance of an allergic phe notype, reducing Th1-driven response s that protect the host against infections. However, the data, while interestin g, are observational and are not discussed here in detail, because the underlying defect res ponsible for shifting Th1 and Th2 cytokine pro- duction has yet to be identified. C1.4 Conclusions The data in experimental animals and humans, although variable, suggest that lead suppresses defence mechanisms and induces hypersensitivi ty. Numerous studies in adult rodents have shown that oral lead exposur e induces changes in functional and general immune assays. Although comparative data are limited, it would a ppear that cell-mediated immunity, rather than humoral immunity, is the primary target , as evidenced by multiple studies revealing decreased host resistance to pathogens that are cleared by cell-mediated immune responses. and general health as a whole. As discussed in chapter 4, the host resistance assays present including both intracellular and extracellular b acteria (see Table C1.1). It should be cau- response (see Table C1.5). However, although significant decreases in the antibody response response relationships (see Tables C1.1 and C1.2). Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 209 Epidemiological studies in e nvironmentally exposed children and occupationally exposed adults also show immune effects, but in ma ny of the studies, only non-functional immune tests were conducted (e.g. serum immunoglobulin levels and immunoph enotypic analyses). Importantly, the immune effects seen in humans occur at BLLs similar to those associated with immunotoxicity in many animal studies . Although the effects of lead on infectious disease incidence were studied infrequently in humans, a number of susceptibility studies conducted in animals indicated that lead de creases resistance to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infection at lead concen trations similar to, if not lower than, levels that affected functional immunit y. Immune changes have also been repeatedly observed in developmental immunotoxicity studies in rodents as well as in studies of children with envi- ronmental exposure, although the latter are somewhat limited in number and scope. Immune effects in children occurred at BLLs similar to those associated with e ffects in occupationally exposed adults, with LOAELs in the range of 10-20 \u00b5g/dl. Although immune effects may be more persistent if exposure oc curs during immune system de velopment, supporting data are limited. PMNLs are critical cells in nonspecific immun ity and play a pivotal role in host defence against extracellular pat hogens. These cells usually act in concert with numerous humoral factors to increase the effectiv eness of a host's defence. In addition, the macrophage, another leukocyte important to innate im munity and pathogen clearance, is also negatively impacted by exposure to lead. Therefore, lead appears to inhibit chemotaxis of PMNLs, suppresses macrophage function and decreases overall cell-mediated imm unity; these effects may pos- sibly explain the increased incidence of inf ection in humans and experimental animals. The three most consistent findings are decreas ed PMNL function in occupationally exposed humans (AEL = 0.144 \u00b5g/dl), decreased host resistance in C3H/HeN mice following expo- sure to lead in drinking -water for 16 weeks (AEL = 0.0 068 \u00b5g/dl) and suppressed DTH responses in BALB/c mice following a 3-week exposure to lead in drinking-water (AEL = 0.029 \u00b5g/dl). All three of the guidance values are based on LOAELs, increasing the uncer- tainty in identifying th e lowest dose associated with im munosuppression. Furthermore, both animal studies employed subchronic exposure, re sulting in additional unc ertainty in extrapo- lating from these data to the development of a reference value for chronic human exposure. Thus, even though there is a rela tively large number of lead immunotoxicity studies, the reference values from the animal data incl ude total uncertainty adjustments of 3000, the largest total uncertainty factor allowed by many organizations th at conduct risk assessments. Total uncertainty factors greater than 3000 are not considered appropriate for derivation of a reference value due to the unaccepta ble level of uncertainty involved. The guidance states that suppression of huma n or rodent host resistance and functional immune measures are considered strong suppor t for immunosuppression. The data therefore provide very convincing evid ence that lead is immunos uppressive. Although human data (PMNL) were available to derive an AEL, f unctional data from exposed populations are rare tainty on effects in the lower dose range. Therefor e, the animal data should be considered for deriving the reference value, as they provi de considerable suppor t for immunosuppression, and reference values based on the animal data would be protective of lower dose ranges not covered by the human data. The reference value for host resistance was based on mortality (60% at a lead concentration of 1036 mg/l in drinking-water ; Fernandez-Cabezudo et al., 2007) , a crude, binary outcome and generally do not include a NOAEL (see Tabl es C1.3 and C1.4), contributing to uncer-Harmonization Project Document No. 10 210assessed in a single study. Increased bacterial counts were reported at the higher (2072 mg/l) exposure level. Although mortality is a dramatic outcome, the absence of bacterial counts at the lower exposure level prevents a conclusion that differences in mortality were due to colonization of lymphoid organs. There is a 4 -fold difference between the reference value derived from the host resistance data (AEL = 0.0068 \u00b5g/dl) and the reference value derived from the DTH data (AEL = 0.029 \u00b5g/dl). The c onservative approach for the risk assessor would be to use data that result in the lowest reference value. However, the absence of bacterial counts crea tes greater uncer tainty in the host resistance assay discussed above, and clos er consideration of the DT H data is recommended. The reference value based on the DTH data (AEL = 0.029 \u00b5g/dl) is well supported by multiple independent studies from different laboratorie s and investigators that report similar lead- associated suppression of the DTH response, in creasing confidence in th is end-point. Further- more, multiple investigator s reported reduced resistance to infection with Listeria mono- because BLLs were not determined. Nevertheless, resistance to this organism is correlated with DTH responses (North et al., 1997), incr easing confidence in the biological plausibility of altered DTH as an indication of immunosupp ression and our choice of DTH as the appro- priate AEL. Please note that this case-study on lead is provided to illus trate how the risk assessment guidance can be used for assessing the risk of immunosuppression. It does not represent a comprehensive risk assessment or a final regulatory position. C1.5 References Belli R, Giuliani V (1955) Lead effects on immunity. Folia Medica (Naples) , 38:1407-1409.

In the 1970s, such use was prohibit ed in most countries. However, HCB is still used as an industrial chemical and is an uni ntended by-product of se veral processes (Bailey, 2001). HCB exposure has been associated with se veral toxic effects in humans, rodents and other species. The toxicity of HCB became appa rent in Turkey during the 1950s, when a part of the population was accidentally exposed to high leve ls after seed grain treated with HCB was used to prepare bread. Approximately 3000-5000 people developed a syndrome that was called Porphyria Turcica, because the main fe ature was hepatic porphyria. Other symptoms observed in these victims, such as enlarged lymph nodes and ar thritis, could be indicative of effects on the immune system (C am, 1958). It was estimated that the people were exposed to 50-200 mg/day for a number of months, but the ba sis for this estimate was not presented, and therefore the exposure levels in all of the studies described below are unknown (IPCS, 1997). The immunotoxic effects of HCB have been ex tensively studied in r odents, with studies demonstrating immunostimulation as well as immunosuppression. Intere stingly, there is a strong species specificity of effects: in mice, HCB suppressed most parameters for immune function, whereas in rats, HCB stimulated most parameters for immune function (Vos, 1986; Michielsen et al., 1999b). In this case-study, immunostimulation induced by HCB will be assessed as described in the potential implications for risk assessment. As discussed in chapter 5, deliberate stimu-lation of the immune system is typically bene ficial and an intended therapeutic outcome, although unintended stimulation may signal changes in other immune system functions that may be deleterious. HCB was selected for this ca se-study because it has been shown that oral exposure can induce immunostimulation in certain species. Furthermore, data obtained in It is important to note that th is case-study is not in tended to be a full risk assessment of the health effects associated with exposure to HCB or a compre hensive assessment of all immune effects of HCB. This compound was selected to illustrate the applicati on of the weight of immunostimulatory effects induced by chemicals. C2.2 Background on immune effects induced by HCB HCB induces adverse immune effects in differe nt species. In humans, immunotoxic effects are seen among the victims of the poisoning in Turkey and also in workers exposed occupa- tionally to HCB in a chemical plant in Brazil. In these workers, impaired functions of neutro- philic granulocytes and increased serum IgM and IgG levels were observe d (Queiroz et al., 1998a,b). chapter 5. The focus of this ca se-study is unintended stimulation of the immune response and evidence approach depicted in Figure 5.1 of chapter 5 to performing a risk assessment on the humans also suggest that this chemi cal can stimulate the immune system. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 216Studies in laboratory animals revealed that HCB has opposite immunotoxic effects in mice and rats. HCB exposure in mice s uppresses the immune system (Loose et al., 1978; Barnett et al., 1987), whereas stimulation is observed in rats (Vos et al ., 1979a,b, 1983; Schielen et al., 1993; Michielsen et al., 1997). Oral exposure of Wistar rats to HCB results in a dose- dependent increase of the numbe r of peripheral neutrophilic a nd basophilic granulocytes and monocytes and of spleen and lymph node wei ghts. Histopathology shows increased marginal zones and follicles and extramedullary haemat opoiesis in the spleen and increased numbers of high endothelial venules in mesenteric lymph nodes and popliteal lymph nodes. The primary and secondary IgM and IgG responses to tetanus toxoid, a thymus-dependent anti- gen, are elevated in HCB-exposed rats (Vos et al., 1979a). Schielen et al. (1993) showed that HCB increases the number of CD3+ macrophages in the spleens of Wist ar rats. These macro- phages are associated with experimentally indu ced autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (Dijkstra et al., 1987, 1992) and are thought to be capable of activating B-1 cells (Damoiseaux et al., 1991). B-1 cells are known to pr oduce natural antibodies, such as anti- DNA antibodies. HCB exposure has been shown to increase the number of splenic B-1 cells and serum IgM levels against autoantigens (Schielen et al., 1993, 1995b), indicative of an autoimmune component in HCB-induced immunostimulation. A study comparing three different rat strains (Wis tar, Brown Norway and Lewis) showed that the Brown Norway rat appears to be the mo st susceptible strain for HCB-induced immuno- toxicity (Michielsen et al., 1997). Brown Norway rats are kn own to be more prone to develop type 2-dependent autoimmunity, whereas Lewis rats are more susceptible to developing type 1-mediated autoimmune diseases (Donker et al., 1984). Immune e ffects induced by HCB in Brown Norway rats are summarized in Table C2.1.

The table contains only significant changes. Dietary exposure to HCB was converted to dose in mg/kg body weight per day based on the standard assumption that rats consume 5% of their body weight per day; therefore, mg/kg body weight per day = mg/kg feed \u00d7 0.05. Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 217 The immunotoxic effects of HCB in Brown Norw ay rats were further investigated in a microarray study. Gene expressi on profiles were assessed in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) isolated from the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, blood, liver and kidney after 28 days of exposure to HCB at a dose of 7.5 or 22.5 mg/kg body weight per day. It was shown that after HCB exposure, upregulation of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines, antioxidants, acute-phase mast ce ll markers, complement, chemokines and cell adhesion molecules was induced. These gene expr ession data demonstrate that the innate immune system plays an important role and that HCB induces a systemic inflammatory response that was not confined only to the immune organs, but also occurred in liver and kidney (Ezendam et al., 2004b). C2.3 Assessment of immunos timulation induced by HCB C2.3.1 Application of the weight of evidence approach for assessment of immunostimulation for assessment of immunostimulation\", that is intended to aid in or ganizing and character- izing immunotoxicity data from strong to w eak evidence of signi ficant immunostimulation. The questions are reproduced and answered below, followed by a discussion of the support- ing immunotoxicity data. C2.3.1.1 Are there epidemiological studies, clinical studies or case-studies that provide human data on end-points relevant to immunostimulation (i.e. unintended stimulation of cellular or humoral immune function, autoimmunity or allergy)? Yes. There are indications that HCB has immunot oxic effects in humans exposed to high levels. The first evidence for toxic effects of HCB wa s noted during the 1950s, when a part of the population in Turkey was accidentally exposed to HCB. The most important toxic manifesta- tion was porphyria cutanea a, which developed predomin antly in children aged 4-14 years. In these victims, a few symptoms may be indicative of an effect on the immune sys- tem, such as the development of arthriti s in 50% of the cases (Dogramaci, 1964; Peters et al., 1982). Furthermore, lymph node enlargement was reported, which might be an indication of immunostimulation (Cam, 1958; Peters, 1976; Gocmen et al., 1986). In br eastfed children from mothers exposed to HCB, a different syndrome developed. These children did not develop hepatic porphyria, but in stead developed a very severe syndrome called pembe yara (pink sore), manifested as rose-red skin lesions . This disease was fata l in approximately 95% of the victims, and the cause of death in mo st cases was a secondary pulmonary infection, suggesting impaired host resistance (Cam, 1960). Additional human evidence for HCB-induced imm une effects was found in workers exposed to HCB in a Brazilian chemical plant that prod uced carbon tetrachlori de and perchloroethyl- ene (tetrachloroethylene). In the production pr ocess, solid residues we re generated, particu- larly HCB, which accounted for 55-85% of the resi dues, and HCB levels were in the range of 0.1-16.0 \u00b5g/dl in the workers (Queiroz et al., 1998a). Serum concen trations of IgM and IgG were elevated, compared with non-exposed heal thy controls, and there was a direct relation- ship between IgM concen trations and length of neutrophilic granulocytes isol ated from these expos ed workers were less A series of questions is presented in chapter 5, s ection 5.8.1, \"Weight of evidence approach Harmonization Project Document No. 10 218efficient in killing yeast, which was probably a result of interferen ce with oxidative burst (Queiroz et al., 1998b). A German study of subjects o ccupationally exposed to HCB or PCBs for more than 6 months evaluated dose-respons e relationships between blood levels of HCB or PCBs and cellular (numbers of lymphocyt e subpopulations, in vitro lymphocyte response) levels, imm unoglobulin autoantibodies) immunological dys- functions. A strong negative association was shown between high HCB blood levels and IFN- blood levels, suggesting that HCB may ha ve an impact on Th1 immunity (Daniel et al., 2001). However, in both the Brazilian and Ge rman studies, the study populations were exposed to other chemicals in addition to HCB, making it impossible to draw conclusions on the specific immune effects of HCB. Human data provide limited evidence for HCB-i nduced immune effects. Some effects, such as the enlarged lymph nodes and the development of arthritis identified in the Turkish inci- dent and the observed increase in serum IgM and IgG levels in the Brazilian plant workers, point towards immunostimulation caused by HCB. Other symptoms, however, such as im- paired host resistance in the Turkish food c ontamination incident and impaired function of neutrophilic granulocytes in the Brazilian workers, are i ndicative of immunosuppression. It could be argued that suppression of specific im mune resistance to infect ions could have been the result of a nonspecific immunostimulation indu ced by HCB. However, it is not possible to use the human data for a hazard characterizatio n of HCB; the lack of reliable quantitative exposure information and the likelihood of simultaneous e xposure to other immunotoxic chemicals preclude the derivation of a dose-res ponse relationship for any effect on the im- mune system. Note: The remaining questions refer to experime ntal animal data. Many of the animal studies employed dietary exposure to HCB instead of direct dosing, and HCB exposure levels were expressed as mg/kg feed in th e publications. For the sake of consistency across other case- studies, HCB exposures in this case-study ar e expressed as mg/kg body weight per day. Dietary concentrations were converted to mg /kg body weight per day based on the standard assumption that rats consume 5% of their body weight per day; theref ore, mg/kg body weight per day = mg/kg feed \u00d7 0.05. C2.3.1.2 Is there evidence that exposure to the chemical is associated with exacerbation of hypersensitivity responses or induction or exacerbation of autoimmune disease or alters the outcome of host resistance assays? Yes. HCB exposure in rodents has effects on experimental autoimmune diseases and host resistance. (a) Effects on autoimmune diseases The effects of HCB on experiment al autoimmunity have been studied in Lewis rats in two different models: adjuvant arthritis (AA) and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Male Lewis rats were orally exposed to diets containing HCB at 0, 50, 150 or 450 mg/kg diet (equivalent to 0, 2.5, 7.5 and 22.5 mg/kg body weight per day). After 6 weeks, AA or EAE was induced in these rats. A dose-dependent suppression of AA was observed in all exposure groups, and rats exposed to the highest dose of HCB did not develop AA. In contrast, the highest dose of HCB increased the severity of EAE. EAE is normally reversible, and clinical signs resolve within a few days after onset . However, rats receiving the 22.5 mg/kg body weight per day dose developed a progressive form of the di sease and died (Van Loveren et Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 219 al., 1990; Michielsen et al., 1999b). The differential effect s of HCB on these disease models could possibly be explained by specific eff ects of HCB on macrophage functioning (Ezendam et al., 2005). Macrophages are im portant effector cells in EA E, and activation by HCB might lead to a more progressive form of the disease. These data demonstrate that HCB can modulat e autoimmune diseases, but they do not dem- provided for the risk assessment of autoimmu nity. At the moment, there are no validated animal models to predict if a ch emical can cause autoimmunity. One assay that is used in this field is the PLNA with reporter antigens. In this animal model, which is used to screen the immunostimulatory effects of chemicals, the chemi cal of interest is inje cted in the foot pad together with a reporter antigen, and the respon se in the draining lymph node is used as a read-out. The assay does not evaluate the effect s of oral exposure, but simply assesses the intrinsic capacity of the injected chemical to induce an immune response in the draining popliteal lymph node. The addition of reporter antigens makes it possible to assess whether chemicals are capable of inducing neoantigens, which could lead to autoimmunity (Pieters, 2000). The effects of HCB and tw o of its oxidative metabolites (tetrachlorohydroquinone and tetrachlorobenzoquinone) were tested in the PL NA with reporter antigen s. HCB was negative in this assay, but its metabolites tetrach lorohydroquinone and tetrachlorobenzoquinone increased the number of cells an d increased the number of Ig M and IgG1 antibody secreting cells to the T cell-independent antigen TNP-Ficoll, indicative of formation of neoantigens and T cell activation (Ezendam et al., 2003). These data sugge st that in the PLNA, these oxidative metabolites of HCB are cap able of forming neoantigens. However, it is unclear if after oral exposure these metabol ites are involved in the i mmunotoxic effects of HCB. The finding of Schielen et al. (1995a) that the CYP pathwa y is not involved in HCB-induced effects argues against the involvement of th ese oxidative metabolites, calling into question the utility of these data for risk assessment. HCB exposure increased IgM levels against several autoantigens, including single- and double-stranded DNA, IgG and phosphatidylcholine. This wa s observed in Wistar rats exposed to HCB for 3 weeks at 25 or 50 mg/kg body weight per day; IgG antibodies recognizing these autoantigens we re not increased. It has been proposed that the increased levels of autoantibodies were the result of s timulatory effects of HC B on B-1 cells, which are committed to produce these autoantibodies (Schielen et al., 1993; Michielsen et al., 1997). In chapter 7, which deals with chemical-induced auto immunity, it is stated that increased levels of autoantibodies in non-autoi mmune disease-prone strains w ould be considered as some evidence that a chemical has the potential to modul ate autoimmune diseases, which is also for autoimmunity than are IgG autoantibodies. It is important to note that H CB behaves differently from other chemicals that are capable of inducing autoimmune diseases, such as D-penic illamine and mercury(II) chloride. The effects of these chemicals are strongly genetically dete rmined; for example, autoimmunity is induced in Brown Norway rats, whereas Lewis rats are resistant. For these chemicals, it has been shown that the disease could be adoptively transferred to naive recipients (Fourni\u00e9 et al., 2001, 2002). In the case of HCB, there is no stro ng strain dependency, and it was not possible to transfer the disease with cel ls, indicating a lack of specific T cell sensitization (Ezendam et al., 2005). onstrate that HCB itself is capable of induc ing autoimmunity. In chapter 7, guidance is described in section C2.3.1.2a. However, IgM autoantibodies are less compelling evidence Harmonization Project Document No. 10 220In summary, HCB exposure can worsen experi mental autoimmunity, apparently by stimu- lating the immune system, although aggravation of EAE was observed only at the highest dose (Van Loveren et al., 1990). The EAE data constitute evidence of exacerbated auto- immune disease, but confidence in the data as a predictor of disease is low given that the data come from a single study that was published as an abstract and therefore not subject to peer review, and effects were observed only at the highest dose tested. As a result, an AEL was not determined using these data. (b) Effects on host resistance As noted above, unintended stimulation may be accompanied by suppression of other func- tions, resulting in a net negativ e effect on immune system h ealth. For example, Vos et al. (1979b) assessed immune function and resistance to infection in rats exposed to HCB before and after birth. Dams and weaned offspring rece ived HCB at a dose equivalent to 2.5 or 7.5 mg/kg body weight per day, based on maternal or offspring body wei ghts; exposure spanned early gestation until 5 weeks of age. Expos ure to HCB at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg body weight per day increased the antibody response to Trichinella spiralis in deliberately infected rats and doubled the number of larvae present in host muscle tissue (albeit with P > 0.05). Anti- bodies do not play a significant role in elimin ating adult parasites during a primary infection, but have been implicated in reducing the numb er of migrating larvae (reviewed by Luebke, 2010). Thus, the increase in antibody titre was not pr otective, as the overall effect appeared to be reduced resistance to infection. HCB expos ure also resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in resistance to the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes . The LD 50 values were 14 \u00d7 105 bacteria in the control group, 7.1 \u00d7 105 bacteria in the 2.5 mg/kg body weight per day group and 5.0 \u00d7 105 bacteria in the 7.5 mg/kg body weight per day group ( P < 0.05). A separate prenatal/postnatal exposure study by this group found no significant effect on anti- body responses to T. spiralis or on the body burden of parasite larvae at doses equivalent to 0.2 or 1 mg/kg body weight per day (Vos et al., 1983). It can be concluded that HCB exposure did alter the outcome of the host resistance assay by stimulating the humoral immune response to Trichinella spiralis infection, but the increased response was not protective. In addition, resistance to Listeria monocytogenes infection, which depends on cell-mediated immunity, was re duced, illustrating the need to consider the entire data set when assessing evidence of imm unostimulation. In the case of HCB, there is no evidence to suggest that exposure increased resistan ce to infection. C2.3.1.3 Is there evidence that exposure to the chemical is associated with unintended stimulation of immune function (antibody production, DTH responses) or alters the balance of immunoregulatory cytokines? Yes. In rats, dietary HCB exposure stimulates several functional immune parameters. The primary IgM and early IgG responses to the thymus-dependent antigen tetanus toxoid were increased ( P < 0.1 and P < 0.05, respectively) in adult Wist ar rats exposed to a dietary HCB concentration equivalent to 50 mg/kg body weight per day for 3 weeks; the response was not assessed in ra ts exposed to the equivalent of 25 mg/kg body weight per day (Vos et al., 1979a). Increased humoral responses to tetanu s toxoid were also observed in two separate studies in which Wistar rats were exposed to HCB via maternal dosi ng during gestation and lactation and direct exposure after weaning. Exposure to 2. 5 or 7.5 mg/kg body weight per day increased the primary and recall IgG respon ses to tetanus toxoid (V os et al., 1979b). In Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 221 another study (Vos et al., 1983), dams and wean ed offspring were exposed to HCB at a dose of 0.2, 1 or 5 mg/kg body weight per day; ho wever, high offspri ng mortality (67% by postnatal day 21) precluded te sting all end-points at the hi ghest (5 mg/kg body weight per day) dose. IgM and IgG titres to tetanus toxoid we re increased in the 0.2 and 1 mg/kg body weight per day dose groups after one or two immunizations. In contrast, IgM and IgG titres to ovalbumin were not increased, but DTH responses were significantly increased in the 1 and 5 mg/kg body weight per day dose groups. It appears that the developing immune system is particularly susceptible to HCB-induced immune effects. However, it is difficult to compare the susceptibility after perinatal and adult exposures, as the lowest concentration used to assess immune function in the adult studies was 50 mg/kg body weight per day. In summary, HCB increased humoral responses to tetanus toxoid and DTH in the offspring of rats after perinatal exposure. This increase was dose dependen t, and the lowest dose was 0.2 mg/kg body weight per day. In adults, increase d humoral responses to tetanus toxoid were observed after exposure to 50 mg/kg body weight per day for 3 weeks. C2.3.1.4 Is there evidence from general immune assays (phenotyping, cytokines, total immunoglobulins, etc.) that the chemical stimulates immune function? Yes. In rats, dietary exposure to HCB stimul ates responses in general immune assays. Dietary exposure of adult Wistar rats to c oncentrations of HCB equivalent to 7.5 or 22.5 mg/kg body weight per day for 6 weeks increas ed concanavalin A-i nduced IL-2 levels, sugge sting that HCB may s timulate the expression of Th1 but not of Th2 cytokines (Vandebriel et al., 1998). Several studies have shown that oral exposure to HCB increased total serum levels of anti- bodies. In adult Wistar rats, oral expos ure to 22.5-100 mg/kg body weight per day for 3 weeks significantly increased total Ig M, but not IgG, concentrations (Vos et al., 1979a; Schielen et al., 1993; Michiels en et al., 1997). Longer exposur e (13 weeks) to 7.5 or 15 mg/kg body weight per day increased serum levels of IgM at both dose levels. Furthermore, in the high-dose group, IgA antibodies were in creased as well (Schiele n et al., 1995a). In another study in Wistar rats exposed for 4 week s to HCB, it was shown that exposure to 30 or 100 mg/kg body weight per day increased Ig M antibody levels, whereas 3 mg/kg body weight per day did not (Schulte et al., 2002). In Brown Norway rats, oral exposure to 22.5, but not 7.5, mg/kg body weight per day in the di et for 4 weeks increased IgM, IgG and IgE antibodies (Michielsen et al., 1997). Prenatal a nd postnatal exposure of Wistar rats to 7.5 mg/kg body weight per day increased total IgM, but not IgG, concentrations in the serum (Vos et al., 1979b). Another prenatal/postnatal study by this group on Wistar rats exposed to 0.2, 1 or 5 mg/kg body weight per day found that only total IgM c oncentrations were increased, and only at the highe st dose (Vos et al., 1983). It can be concluded that exposure to HCB in creased total serum immunoglobulin levels and expression of mRNA coding for Th1 cytokines. The lowest dose of HCB associated with increased responses in these studies was 7.5 mg /kg body weight per day. These results appear to be in conflict, because Th1 cytokine s are known to downregulate production of Th2 cytokines, and the latter are associated w ith antibody production, particularly IgG, IgA and IgE isotypes. Independent reports of increased total IgM by separate re search groups suggest that increased total IgM is independent of Th1/Th2 cytokine gene transcript profiles. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 222However, the latter may be functionally a ssociated with the in creased DTH responses C2.3.1.5 Is there histopathological evidence or are there haematological changes that suggest that the chemical causes immunostimulation or modulates autoimmunity or allergy? Yes. Oral HCB exposure induced histopathological and haematological changes in rats, monkeys and dogs suggestive of immunotoxicity. Oral exposure of Rhesus monkeys to HCB at 8, 32, 64 or 128 mg/day (equivalent to about 1.6, 6.4, 12.8 and 25.6 mg/kg body wei ght per day) for 60 days induced dose-dependent morphological changes in the thymus, which we re observed at all doses. The changes con- sisted of reduction or absence of individual lobules and hyperpl asia of reticular cells, macro- phages and plasma cells in the medulla (Iatropoulos et al., 1976). In Wistar rats, dietary HCB exposure for 3-13 weeks to doses equivalent to 25 and 50 mg/kg body weight per day increased extramedullary haematopoiesis in the red pulp of the spleen and induced hyper- plasia of B lymphocytes in spleni c marginal zones and follicles (Vos et al., 1979a; Schielen et al., 1993; Michielsen et al., 1997; Schulte et al., 2002). These stimulatory effects on B lymphocytes may be related to increased an tibody synthesis. In Wistar, Lewis and Brown Norway rats, HCB exposure for 3-4 weeks to dietary concentrati ons equivalent to 7.5-50 mg/kg body weight per day increased the number of high endothelial venules in lymph nodes (Vos et al., 1979a; Michielsen et al., 1997; Sc hulte et al., 2002), indicative of lymphocyte migration activity. Dietary exposure to HCB induced inflammatory skin and lung lesions in various rat strains (Vos et al., 1979a, 1983; Michielsen et al., 1997). The most susceptible strain was the Brown Norway rat, but skin lesions were also observe d in Lewis and Wistar rats. It has been shown that the onset and severity of these inflammatory skin and lung lesions are dependent on T cells and macrophages (Ezendam et al., 2004a, 2005). The lowest dose that induced skin lesions was 7.5 mg/kg body weight per day in Brown Norway and Lewis rats. The first lesions occu rred after 22 and 27 days in Brown Norway and Lewis rats, respectively. In Wistar rats, onl y rats dosed at 22.5 mg/kg body weight per day developed skin lesions after 24 days of exposure. The lesion s were morphologically charac- terized by dermal inflammatory infiltrates of mainly eosinophils in Brown Norway rats and mononuclear cells in Lewis and Wi star rats (Michielse n et al., 1997). Unlike the skin lesions observed in adults in Turkey, these skin lesions were not related to porphyria (Den Besten et al., 1993; Schielen et al ., and correlated w ith indicators of imm unostimulation, includ- ing enlarged lymph nodes, increased serum levels of IgM, IgG and IgE and increased levels of autoantibodies, suggesting an important role of the immune system in lesion development (Michielsen et al., 1997). The lesi ons were similar to those obse rved in the breastfed children unknown process. HCB also induced inflamma tory lung lesions in rats, which were characterized by accumulations of alveolar macr ophages and proliferation of the lung vessels. In contrast to the skin lesions, the inducti on of inflammatory lung lesions by HCB was not strain dependent; exposure to 7.5 mg/kg body we ight per day for 4 weeks induced the lung effects in all strains. Unlike the skin lesions , lung effects did not co rrelate with assessed immune parameters (Michielsen et al., 1997). The appearance of macrophages in the lungs after only 4 days of exposure to HCB suggests that these cells play an important role in the induction of the HCB-induced lung inflammation. reported in section C2.3.1.3. discussed in section C2.3.1.1 above, which were not related to porphyria but caused by an Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 223 Effects of HCB were studied in Beagle dogs using daily concentra tions of 1, 10, 100 or 1000 mg HCB in gelatine capsules (equivalent to 0.1, 1, 10 or 100 mg/kg body weight per day) for 1 year. In the highest-dose group, the number of neutrophils increa sed after 4 weeks of exposure and remained elevated during the c ourse of the study. In the group receiving 10 mg/kg body weight per day, an el evation of total ne utrophil counts was measured from 16 weeks onward. In the lowest-dose groups, the nu mber of neutrophils was not affected by HCB treatment. Histopathology showed that after 1 year of HCB exposur e, hyperplasia of the gastric lymphoid tissue, indicative of lymphocyt e proliferation, was observed in 41% of the dogs in the 100 mg/kg body weight per day gr oup, 83% of the dogs in the 10 mg/kg body weight per day group, 92% of the dogs in th e 1 mg/kg body weight per day group and 41% of the dogs in the 0.1 mg/kg body weight per day group (Gralla et al., 1977). In Wistar rats, dietary exposure to an HC B dose equivalent to 100 mg/kg body weight per day for 3 weeks increased the number of pe ripheral blood leukocytes and monocytes. Fur- thermore, at an exposure of 50 mg/kg body weight per day, the numbers of basophils and neutrophils increased (Vos et al., 1979a). In Wistar rats, HCB exposure to 30 and 100 mg/kg body weight per day for 4 weeks induced a dos e-dependent increase in the numbers of neutrophils. In the high-dose group, absolute numbers of lymphocytes and monocytes were increased as well (Schulte et al., 2002). Increased numbers of eosinophils were reported in Wistar rats exposed to HCB at a dietary conc entration equivalent to 7.5 mg/kg body weight per day during gestation and lactation and for the first 5 weeks after birth (Vos et al., 1979b). In contrast, this group reported that only basoph il numbers were increased in Wistar offspring exposed prenatally and postnatally to 20 mg/ kg body weight per day, a dose that was associ- ated with 67% mortality by postnatal day 21. It can be concluded that HCB induced histological and haemat ological changes indicative of immunostimulation in rats, monkeys and dogs. A dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight per day administered to dogs in gelatine capsules for a period of 1 year was the lowest dose showing effects on the histopathology of the gastric ly mphoid tissue. In Rhesus monkeys, histopatho- logical changes were observed in the thymus at concentratio ns of 1.6 mg/kg body weight per day administered for 60 days. In adult rats, the lowest dose that i nduced histopathological changes in the lymph nodes was 7.5 mg/kg body we ight per day administered for 3-4 weeks. The lowest dose inducing macroscopic and micr oscopic skin and lung lesions was 7.5 mg/kg body weight per day. The lowest dose that induced haematological changes was 30 mg/kg body weight per day administered for 4 weeks. C2.3.1.6 Is there evidence that the chemical increases immune organ weight (thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, etc.)? Yes. In rats, oral exposure to HCB dose-dependently increased the weight of the spleen and lymph nodes, but did not affect the weight of the thymus. Dietary exposure of adult Wistar rats to 7.5-100 mg/kg body weight per day for 3 or 13 weeks increased the weights of spleen a nd popliteal and mesenteric lymph nodes (Vos et al., 1979a; Schielen et al., 1993, 1995a). In Wistar rats, exposure to HCB at 30 or 100 mg/kg body weight per day for 4 weeks increased the weights of spleen and popliteal lymph nodes, but not of mesenteric lymph nodes (Schulte et al., 2002). Lo wer doses (22.5 and 7.5 mg/kg body weight per day) were requi red to increase spleen and ly mph node weights in Lewis and Brown Norway rats (Michielsen et al., 1997). Pren atal and postnatal expos ure of Wistar rats to 1 or 5 mg/kg body weight pe r day during gestation and lactation and after weaning Harmonization Project Document No. 10 224increased popliteal lymph node we ights at 5 weeks of age; only the high dose increased node weight at 7 months of age (Vos et al., 1983). In summary, oral exposure of adult rats to HCB for 3 or 13 weeks dose-dependently increased the weights of the spleen and lymp h nodes. The lowest dose showing effects was 7.5 mg/kg body weight per day. Th e lowest prenatal and postna tal dose to increase lymph node weights in 5-week-old animals was 1 mg/kg body weight per day. C2.3.2 Hazard characterization This case-study was performed to illustrate th e application of the weight of evidence effects or immunotoxicity that takes into accoun t all immunotoxic effect s of HCB. However, risk assessors should be aware that stimula tion of some types of immune function and suppression of others may be induced by a single compound and occur simultaneously. For this case-study, we will use only those paramete rs that are linked to immunostimulation in the hazard characterization of HCB. Studies in rats exposed to H CB during pregnancy and lactatio n (Vos et al., 1979b) and in adult dogs chronically exposed to HCB orally for 1 year (Gralla et al., 1977) provide the lowest exposure levels sugge stive of immunostimulation indu ced by HCB. Gralla (1977) reported hyperplasia of gastric lymphoid ti ssue after 1 year in dogs, with a relatively high incidence at all dose levels without a clear dose-response relationship. Therefore, it can be questioned whether the effects are treatmen t related. No functional immune parameters were assessed in this study. In the rat studi es (Vos et al., 1979b, 1983), the antibody response rats exposed to HCB at 0.2 mg/kg body weight per day during gestation and lactation and after weaning. These functional end-points are good predictors of immune system modulation because they reflect the dynamic response of the immune system to novel antigens. Therefore, a LOAEL of 0.2 mg/ kg body weight per day in rats following perinatal exposure was chosen as the POD for the derivation of an AEL. Uncertainty factors as described in The default uncertainty factor for interspeci es (extrapolation from laboratory animals to humans) differences is 10. Currently, th ere are no arguments to support considera- tion of a different uncertainty factor. The intraspecies uncertainty factor (to acc ount for interindividual differences) is 10. Exposure occurred during immune system development and maturation (gestation, lactation, early juvenile phases) and thus spanned the most vulnerable life stages. Fur- thermore, the dose of HCB associated with an unintended stimulation of the antibody response in Wistar rats was approximate ly 250 times lower if exposure occurred during development than if it occurred in adulthood (HCB equivalents of 0.2 and 50 mg/kg body weight per day, respectively), and stimulation of the DTH response was observed following developmental exposur e (Vos et al., 1979b, 1983), but not in exposed adults (Vos et al., 1979a). Although it could be ar gued that an intraspecies uncertainty factor for toxicodynamic differenc es is not necessary because a sensitive uncertainty factor of 10 should be applie d unless the POD is based on human develop- mental immunotoxicity data. approach presented in chapter 5, rather than as a comprehensive risk assessment for health to immunization with tetanus toxoid and the DT H response to ovalbumin were increased in section 3.3.10 of chapter 3 of the gui dance were applied as follows: subpopulation was assessed, guidance provide d in section 3.3.10.1 suggests that an Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 225 The subchronic to chronic uncertainty fact or would not be applied to this study because it is a developmental exposure study. The uncertainty factor for LOA EL to NOAEL extrapolation is 10. The database uncertainty factor is 1. A va riety of immune system end-points were assessed in adults and in developing animals. The overall uncertainty f actor is therefore 1000 (10 for inters pecies \u00d7 10 for intraspecies \u00d7 10 NOAEL). The AEL based on immunos timulation can be calculated as follows: 0.2 mg/kg body weight per day/1000 = 0.2 g/kg body weight per day. C2.4 Conclusion This case-study describes the use of a weight of evidence approach for immunostimulation induced by HCB. The immunotoxic effects of H CB are very complex, differ within species and encompass both immunostimulation and imm unosuppression. The goal of this case-study therefore we have focused only on parameters associated with immunostimulation. Further- more, this exercise does not represent a compre hensive risk assessment of or regulatory posi- tion on HCB. Although the case-study was limited to unintended immune system stimulation, when performing an assessment of data that suggest immunostimulatio n, other consequences of exposure (immunosuppressi on, allergy, autoimmunity) must also be considered. The weight of evidence approach determined that HCB can be considered as an immuno- stimulatory chemical that affects many end-poin ts that are described in chapter 5. The AEL for these immune effects is much lower for de velopmental exposure than for adult exposure. This shows that the developing immune system is particularly vulnerable to HCB-induced immune effects. It could be argued that immunostimulation should not be considered as an unwanted, adverse human health effect, because in some cases st imulation is a desirable, intended effect (e.g. inclusion of adjuvants in vaccines). Howe ver, uncontrolled and unintended immunostimu- lation caused by exposure of humans to chemical s should be considered as unwanted and thus adverse. Therefore, HCB should be considered as an immunostimulatory compound that at certain concentrations could lead to unwanted adverse effects in humans.

Platinum-specific sensitization is supported by numerous case reports and occupational studies of workers who develop allergic sensitization to halogenated platinum salts. The sensitizing potential of haloge nated platinum salts is also supported by experimental animal data. Sensitization appears to be restricted to halogenated platinum salts, as the available evidence does not support allergic sensitization to insolubl e forms of platinum (e.g. platinum oxide or platinum metal) or non-halogenated soluble platin um compounds. Therefore, the following analysis is restricted to halogenated platinum salts. This case-study illustrates the use of the risk assessment guidance provided for the assess- as a case-study because it is well established th at halogenated platinum salts are potent sensi- tizers, and available data includ e both occupational exposure and health effects data for plati- num. The case-study for halogenated platinum salts highlights a databa se with strong support The risk assessment of halogenated platinum sa lts begins with a brief summary of the avail- able evidence for sensitization associated with halogenated platinum salts, followed by an application of the decision-trees for the asse ssment of sensitization and allergic response assessment of the health effects associated with exposure to ha logenated platinum salts nor a comprehensive risk assessment of sensitizatio n associated with exposure to halogenated platinum salts. Rather, the following assessment was developed to illustrate the process for conducting a risk assessment of sensitization an d allergic response by considering the avail- able human, laboratory animal and mechanistic data for sensitization associated with expo- sure to halogenated platinum salts. C3.2 Background: sensitization dat a for halogenated platinum salts There are numerous case reports and occupationa l studies of workers who develop allergic sensitization to halogenated platinum salts; ho wever, most studies do not include adequate exposure assessment. Of the available studies with exposure estimates, several occupational studies report increased prevalences of worker s with allergic sensitization in halogenated platinum salt-contaminated workplaces with es timated air concentrations below the threshold limit value of 2 g of soluble platinum per cubic metre (Merget et al., 1988, 2000; Baker et al., 1990; Brooks et al., 1990; Bolm-Audorff et al., 1992; Linnett & Hughes, 1999). Although available data from experimental animal studies are inadequate to ch aracterize the exposure- response relationship for induction of allergic sensitization to halogenated platinum salts in experimental animals exposed to platinum co mpounds via inhalation, the sensitizing potential of halogenated platinum salts in humans is supported by several inha lation exposure studies in primates (Biagini et al., 1983, 1985b, 1986) and a larger number of de rmal and parenteral ment of sensitization and allerg ic response as presented in ch apter 6. Platinum was selected (Figures 6.2A, 6.2B and 6.2C in chapter 6). The analysis is not intended to be a full risk for respiratory sensitization and pr ovides limited information on elicitation. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 230exposure studies in rodents (Murdoch & Pepys, 1984a,b, 1985, 1986; Schuppe et al., 1992, 1997a,b; Dearman et al., 1998). There are six epidemiological studies that in form the effect level for platinum-specific sensitization (Merget et al., 1988, 2000; Baker et al., et al., 1990; Bolm- Audorff et al., 1992; Linnett & Hughes, 1999). E ffect levels based on these studies are presented in Table C3.1. Baker et al. (1990) and Brooks et al. (1990) report sensitization in 11% of workers down to the lowest so luble platinum level (LOAEL = 400 ng/m 3); however, they reported a higher concentration (600 ng/m3 soluble platinum) in an area associated with no positive SPTs (0/15 in the offices) than in other work areas associated with positive SPT (e.g. 2/19 at 400 ng/m3 soluble platinum in the analyt ical laboratories). Linnett & Hughes (1999) identified sensitization in 51% of workers, and exposu re data from the study support an effect level for soluble pl atinum of less than 500 ng/m3. Absolute platinum concentrations were not reported in Linnett & Hughes (1999), and a clear LOAEL is no t identified, because the data are reported as relative frequency of exposure levels above and below 2 \u00b5g/m3 of soluble platinum. Bolm-Audorff et al. (1992) re ported sensitization in 19% of workers in a study that included exposure data down to 80 ng/m3 in stationary samples and below the limit of detection (50 ng/m3) in personal samples. Merget et al . (1988) reported sensitization in 20% of workers with exposure below 80 ng/m3. The WHO (2000) report on platinum in air quality guidelines for Europe reported a LOAEL based on these studies of 50 ng/m3 for platinum allergic sensitization.

(2000) provided the best exposure assessment da ta with sufficient documentation of health effects to establish a dose-response relationship. The Merget et al. ( 2000) prospective cohort study among German catalyst production workers te sted baseline allergic sensitivity to halo- genated platinum salts among 275 new and current workers with reassessment after 5 years of follow-up. Conversion to a positive SPT to the ha logenated platinum salt hexachloroplatinic acid was used as an indicator of allergic sensitization to halogenated platinum salts. For the exposure assessment, workers were assigned to different exposure cat egories (high, low, no exposure) based on job title and location within the plant. The study analyses excluded atopic individuals and workers with a positive SPT at the start of th e study. Of the 115 workers in the high-exposure category, 13 (11.3%) devel oped a positive SPT response by the end of the 5-year follow-up period. No positive SPT respon ses were reported in the other exposure cate- gories. Air monitoring samples were available to quan tify platinum exposure in terms of soluble 1 high-exposure group. Concentrations for the sta tionary air samples are reported as the arith- from the high-, low- and no-exposure ca talyst production areas were 52.9 \u00b1 19.7, 3.37 3 et al. (1992), Merget et al. ( 1988) and the WHO (2000) report. Personal air monitoring data were limited to 1993 and collected only from the high-exposure group; however, the limited personal air sampling data suggest that stat ionary air sampling may have underestimated exposure in work areas by up to 10-fold. C3.3 Assessment of sensitization and allergic response to halogenated platinum salts in organizing and evaluating im munotoxicity data for a given chemical in the process of performing a risk assessment for sensitization an d allergic response asso ciated with exposure to that chemical. The weight of evidence c onclusions developed by an swering the questions in these decision-trees summarize the hazard identification for sensitization and allergic response and should describe the database in te rms of consistency and biological plausibility, including strengths, weaknesses, uncertainties and data gaps. When a chemical is charac- terized as a sensitizer as indi cated by the weight of evidence , the data are brought forward for dose-response assessment beginning with sele ction of the most a ppropriate end-point(s) (critical effects) and developing PODs. The ques tions in those decision -trees are reproduced and answered below, followed by a discussion of the supporting data. 1 Although exposure data in available occupational stud ies are characterized only to the extent that soluble platinum concentrations are reported , the specificity of the SPT used to identify platinum-specific allergic response demonstrates that occupational allergic se nsitization from exposure to platinum compounds is to chlorinated platinum salts. Furthermore, the data from Cleare et al. (1976) demonstrated that the SPT among occupationally exposed workers may also result in a positive response to other halogenated platinum salts, such as brominated platinum salts. The decision-trees presented in Figures 6.2A, 6.2B and 6.2C in chapter 6 are intended to aid metic mean in Table C3.2. The pooled arithmetic mean \u00b1 0.773 and \u00b1 0.005 ng of soluble platinum per cubic metre. As demonstrated in Table platinum for each category, and limited personal m onitoring samples were available for the C3.1, the LOAEL of 52.9 ng/m based on these data is supported by data from Bolm-Audorff Harmonization Project Document No. 10 232Table C3.2: Air concentrations of soluble platinum and incidence of positive SPT for three exposure groups of German catalyst production workers in Merget et al.

(2000) as provided by the lead author. C3.3.1 Is there evidence that the substance is a skin sensitizer (e.g. data from LLNA, GPMT, Yes. There is evidence that halogenated platinum salts are skin sensitizers. Urticaria and contact dermatitis are reported as symptoms of platinum-specific allergic sensitization in numerous case reports and occupational studie s that identify health effects in workers exposed to halogenated platinum salts (Hunter et al., 1945; Marsha ll, 1952; Pepys et 1972; Pepys, 1984; 1991; Bolm- 2000; WH O, 2000; Cristaudo et al., 2005). Experimental animal data also pr ovide some support for skin sensitization. Schuppe et al. (1997a) reported si gnificant positive reaction in BALB/c mice to 5% sodium hexachloroplatinate (Na 2PtCl 6) in an LLNA adapted to avoid radioactive labels as well as a modified mouse ear swelling test . Data from Dearman et al. ( 1998) support sensitization from topical application of several hal ogenated platinum salts (e.g. (NH 4)2PtCl 6 or (NH 4)2PtCl 4) to the ears of BALB/c mice based on induction of cytokines from auricular lymph nodes. Dearman et al. (1998) reported substantial production of interl eukin (IL-10) for all of the halogenated platinum salts tested at expos ure concentrations of 1%, 0.5% and 0.25%; how- ever, they did not develop EC 3 values using radiolabel inco rporation or using alternative methods. Although Dearman et al. (1998) concluded that the cytokines ar e characteristic of respiratory sensitizers (i.e. a ty pe 2 cytokine response pattern with vigorous secretion of IL-4 and IL-10), the use of cytokine profiling to di scriminate between dermal and respiratory sen- sitizers has not been fully supported, and recent studies suggest that the use of cytokine pro- filing for hazard identification may be premature (Selgr ade et al., 2006). C3.3.1.1 Is information on skin sensitizing potency available as LLNA EC 3 or human NOEL to derive a quantitative POD? (see Figure 6.2A) No. Most of the case reports and occupational st udies with health effects data on platinum- specific allergic sensitization do not include exposure data. In addition, the database of case reports and occupational studies does not provide adequate inform ation on the role of dermal HRIPT, human experience, QSAR, in vitro tests)? (see Figure 6.2A) Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 233 versus inhalation exposure to halogenated plat inum salts to enable quantification of the dose-response relationship, as a single dose wa s used in the Schuppe et al. (1997a) study. C3.3.1.2 Is sufficient information on skin sensitizing potency available to group the No. As discussed previously, dermal exposure data from the occupational studies are lacking, and the laboratory animal data are from studies that utilized a single dose. Conclusions from this single dose could underestim ate the potency category for halogenated platinum salts. Therefore, a qualitative risk assessment of i nduction of skin sensit ization is recommended, including the collection of use and exposure information, as well as a description of use and exposure scenarios that may pose a skin sensitization risk. Although the SPT is the most common diagnostic te st for platinum-speci fic allergic sensitiza- tion, data from patch tests on halogenated platinum salts are sometimes reported as part of the occupational platinum literatur e (e.g. Linnett & Hughes, 1999; Cristaudo et al., 2005). One example comes from a study of 153 workers in a catalyst manufactur ing and recycling fac- tory reported by Cristaudo et al . (2005). The report indicates that 2 of the 153 workers had a positive patch test to the halogenated platinum salt (H 2PtCl 6), and 22 workers had a positive SPT to the same compound. The patch te st was performed with 15 \u00b5l of H 2PtCl 6 at a single concentration (102 mol/l). Although the patch test in th ese previously sens itized individuals may inform an evaluation of elicitation associ ated with halogenated platinum salts, no expo- sure data were reported in Cr istaudo et al. (2005), and theref ore these data provide no infor- mation with which to evaluate sensitization. Qu alitative evaluation for the low exposure to halogenated platinum salts associated with sens itization (e.g. the asso ciation of the exposure would suggest that halogenated platinum salts are potent or strong sens itizers, but there are no dermal exposure measurements in any of the available occupational studies. In addition to the lack of human dermal exposur e data, there are data ga ps that increase the uncertainty for developing a qual itative risk assessment of skin sensitization from the experi- mental animal data on halogenated platinum sa lts. Two experimental animal studies (Schuppe et al., 1997a; Dearman et al., 1998) provide evidence that severa l halogenated pl atinum salts are dermal sensitizers. Schuppe et al. (1997a) developed an auricular lymph node index of 22.8 for Na 2PtCl 6 administered at 5% in acetone usin g an LLNA adapted to avoid the use of radioactive labels. At that single test concentration, the SI ex ceeds 3. If that va lue were to be used as the EC 3, then the potency category for this hal ogenated platinum salt would be in the lower doses were tested, the potency categor y of strong or extrem e cannot be excluded. Dearman et al. (1998) reported substa ntial production of IL-10 for both (NH 4)2PtCl 6 and (NH 4)2PtCl 4 at exposure concentrations down to 0.25% , an exposure that would represent a potency category of strong. However, Dearman et al. (1998) evaluated cy tokine release only, and the experiment did not include LLNA or development of EC 3 values. The available laboratory animal data suggest that the potency category for some hal ogenated platinum salts would be moderate or strong. However, there are significant data gaps, and data are not available at lower exposure levels to evaluate the po ssibility that some halogenated platinum salts may be classified as st rong or extreme sensitizers. substance into a skin sensitizing potency category? (see Figure 6.2A) dermal exposure. The laboratory animal data were also insufficient to allow evaluation of a moderate range (see Figure 6.1 in chapter 6 for potency categor ies). However, given that no measurements in Merget et al. [2000] and pos itive SPT described in section C3.2 above) Harmonization Project Document No. 10 234 No. Data suggest that non-occ upationally exposed in dividuals are not al ready sensitized to halogenated platinum salts (e.g. none of the 800 consecutive subjects with contact dermatitis or urticaria tested by Santucci et al. [2000] had a positive patch test or SPT to halogenated platinum salts). Data are not available to eval uate the elicitation potency of halogenated plati- num salts in humans or experimental animals by the dermal or inhalatio n route. Therefore, a qualitative risk assessment of elicitation of skin sensitization is recommended, including the collection of use and exposure information, as well as a descriptio n of use and exposure scenarios that may pose a risk of elicitation in the allergic subpopulat ion. The lack of dose- response data on both elicitation and the limited exposure data relating to sensitization from individuals sensitized to hal ogenated platinum salts present a challenge to developing an informative qualitative risk assessment of e licitation. There is information, however, with which to make some conclusions about elicitatio n potency. For example, there is considerable evidence from other chemicals of a relationshi p between the exposure doses associated with sensitization and the subsequent doses required fo r elicitation. In general, as the sensitization dose of an allergen increases, the dose needed to elicit a response on rechallenge decreases (Scott et al., 2002; Hostynek & Maibach, 2004). Mu ltiple exposure factors are likely to affect this relationship, including frequency of expos ure and single versus multiple exposures (Scott et al., 2002). The strength of se nsitization also affects the elicita tion dose such that there is a clear inverse correlation between the strength of the sensitization and the subsequent dose required to elicit a contact hypersensitiv ity response in humans (Friedmann, 2007). In one of the few examples where the results of a patch test for a halogenated platinum salt were reported, two workers in a catalyst manufac turing and recycling factory were positive to H2PtCl 6 by the patch test (Cristaudo et al., 2005). Although the Cristaudo et al. (2005) study did not report exposure information, the pa tch test was performed with 15 \u00b5l of H 2PtCl 6 at a 2 mol/l, and this provides a single concentration that is associated with elicitation. The clin ical symptoms reported (rhinitis, asthma, urticaria and eczema) for individuals positive by SPT or patch test suggest that the positive patch test may have been related to eczema. Among work ers with a positive response , the only two workers with eczema had positive patch test results (Cristaudo et al., 2005). Although data from patch tests are limited, there are some occupational data on challenge doses associated with a positive SPT response to halogenated platinum salts. For example, Brooks et al. (1990) and Biagini et al. (1985a) reported that the lo west exposure concentration of halogenated platinum salts required to elicit a posi tive SPT ranged from 109 to 103 g/ml (6 orders of magnitude) among individuals previously sensiti zed to halogenated platinum sa lts. Conclusions for the elicita- tion dose for halogenated platinum salts base d on the occupational ex posure data and SPT data would suggest that haloge nated platinum salts are at th e higher end of sensitizers (see potent or strong associated elic itation. However, the SPT involve s placing a drop of the test substance on the surface of the skin and then pricking the skin with a needle inserted to penetrate the skin and then drawn up through that test drop. The SPT is not equivalent to a patch test. There are insufficien t data on dermal exposure to fu lly evaluate the elicitation dose for halogenated platinum salts and little info rmation to inform a qualitative evaluation. The low doses and large variation (6 orders of magn itude) for elicitation in the SPT suggest that halogenated platinum salts may have a strong dermal elicitation potency. or ROAT) available to derive a quantitative (see Figure 6.2A) C3.3.1.3 Is information on elicitation potency (e.g. a BMD or NOEL from human patch tests Figure 6.1 in chapter 6 for potency categories)\u2014that is, potent or strong sensitizers with single concentration of 10Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 235 Yes. Halogenated platinum salts are known respiratory sensit izers (IPCS, 1991; WHO, 2000). Among the various symptoms of allergic sensit ization, asthma, rhinitis and conjunctivitis are reported in numerous case reports and occupationa l studies that identify health effects in workers exposed to halogenated platinum salts (Hunter et al., 1945; Marshall, 1952; Pepys et al., Pepys, 1984; Merget 1990; IPCS, 1991; WHO, 2000; Cristaudo et al., 2005). Additional reports prov ide support for one or more of the above 1991, 1994, 1995, 1996), respiratory difficulties (K arasek & Karasek, 1911), inflammatory changes in the respiratory tr act (Roberts, 1951; Merget et al., 1996), bronchospasms (Calverley et al., 1999) and bronchial hyperactiv ity (Biagini et al., 1985a; Brooks et al., 1990; Merget et al., 1991). C3.3.2.1 Is information on sensitization potency (e.g. BMD or NOEL from an epidemiological or laboratory animal study) available? (see Figure 6.2B) Yes. Therefore, a quantitative risk assessment of induction of re spiratory sensitization using SAFs to derive acceptable non-sensitizing air concentrations is recommended, as well as a quantitative exposure assessment including a risk characteriza tion. A comprehensive risk assessment is beyond the scope of this case-st udy; however, the preliminary steps in the analysis will be presented below to illustr ate the approach suggested by the guidance. prevalence of workers with alle rgic sensitization in halogenated platinum salt-contaminated workplaces with estimated air concentrati ons below the threshold limit value of 2 g of soluble platinum per cubic metre (Merget et al., 1988, 2000; Baker et al., 1990; Audorff et al., 1992; Linnett & Hughes, 1999). Merget et al. (2000) provided the best exposure assessment data with sufficient document ation of health effects to establish a dose- response relationship and is the only study to provide a NOAEL for allergic sensitization to halogenated platinum salts. No workers in th e low-exposure category converted to a positive SPT during the 5-year study; ther efore, the \u00b1 0.773 ng of soluble platinum per cubic metre) re presents a NOAEL. The exposure level in the high-exposure group (52.9 \u00b1 19.7 ng of soluble platinum per cubic metre) represents a LOAEL, as 13 out of 115 workers in this group developed allergic sensitization as deter- mined by a conversion to a positive SPT during th e 5 years of the study. As demonstrated in 3 Audorff et al. (1992), Merget et al. (1988) and the WHO (2000) report. The NOAEL can be used to derive BMCs. However, it is useful to no te that the data are of marginal adequacy for BMC modelling, because only three exposure groups (high, low and no exposure) are available, and only one of these groups has a non-zero response. A large degree of uncer- tainty exists when modelling data sets that do not contai n at least two non-zero response levels, because a wide range of curves can be drawn through a single point and a control value (Barnes et al., 1995). It is also useful to point out th at reliance on a NOAEL for risk assessment has its own set of lim itations (e.g. the number and sp acing of doses represented in a given study will influence the dose that is identified as the NOAEL) (Filipsson et al., 2003). As described in section C3.2 a bove, several epidemiological st udies have found an increased epidemiological studies, human experience or laboratory animal studies)? (see Figure effects consistent with respirat ory sensitizers: asthma (Brooks et al., 1990; Merget et al., 6.2B) C3.3.2 Is there evidence that the substance is a respiratory sensitizer (e.g. data from Table C3.1, the LOAEL of 52.9 ng/m based on these data is supported by data from Bolm- used as a POD for risk assessment, or the e xposure data presented in Table C3.2 could be Harmonization Project Document No. 10 236To continue the illustration in this case-study, the Merget et al. (2000) NOAEL has been selected as the POD because of the uncertainty associated with BMC modelling of these data, as described above. The next step in the risk assessment proce ss would be the application of for assessment of sensitization and allergic response and referring to the general guidance The interspecies uncertainty factor would be 1, as human data from Merget et al. (2000) are used. The intraspecies uncertainty factor to account for interindividual variability would be 10 in the absence of more definitive data. The LOAEL to NOAEL uncertainty factor w ould be 1, as the human data from Merget et al. (2000) represent a NOAEL. The matrix factor would be 1; however, the matrix factor of 1 may be replaced by a factor of 3 or 10 for exposure situations that involve ozone (discussed below). The use and time factor would be 10 for a chronic exposure assessment, as the study length was 5 years; applicatio n of this uncertainty factor depends on the scope defined in the problem formulation stage of the ri sk assessment (e.g. lifetime/chronic, sub- chronic); a use and time factor of 1 would be applied for a subchronic risk assessment. The database uncertainty factor would be 1 fo r a risk assessment that was designed to evaluate sensitization, as there are numerous studies to demonstrate sensitization risk, As a comparison, the LOAEL from Merget et al. (2000) of 52.9 ng/m3 could also be used as a POD to illustrate the support for the NOAEL in this study, give n the range of platinum expo- 3 et al. (1992), Merget et al. (1988) and the WHO (2000) report, which present LOAELs of 50- 80 ng/m3. The derivation of health -based guidance values from LOAELs rather than NOAELs requires the application of an additional 10-fold uncerta inty factor to extrapolate from a LOAEL to a NOAEL. Reference valu es based on the LOAELs would differ by less than a factor of 3 (1.48-2.37) from the reference value based on the NOAEL of 3.37 ng/m3 from Merget et al. (2000). The following calculation is presented to illust rate the derivation of a reference value for halogenated platinum salts us ing the NOAEL (3.37 \u00b1 platinum per cubic metre; 3.37 \u00d7 106 mg of soluble platinum per cubic metre used in the calculation) from Merget et al. (2000) as the POD and the uncerta inty factors described above. Adjustments to occupational exposure data are required to develo p a reference value applicable to continuous lifetime exposure. The adjusted NOAEL (or NOAEL ADJ) presented below is developed using standard practice (USEPA, 1994) to compensa te for differences between occupational 8 hours/day, 5 days/week exposures and non-o ccupational 24 hours/day, \u00d7 (VE ho/VE 5 days / 7 days where the NOAEL is the TWA occupational expos ure level at which no adverse effect was observed; VE ho is the human occupational default minute volume (10 m3/day); and VE h is the human ambient default minute volume (20 m3/day). Using this conversion, the NOAEL ADJ is calculated as follows: extrapolation, uncertainty or asse ssment factors, as described in section 6.5 of the guidance, presented on uncertainty factors in secti on 3.3.10 of chapter 3. Following the guidance: sure data available and the limited number of exposure groups. As demonstrated in Table and data are available with which to perform a dose-response assessment. C3.1, the LOAEL of 52.9 ng/m based on these data is supported by data from Bolm-Audorff Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 237 = 20 m3/day) \u00d7 5 days / 7 days = 1.20 \u00d7 106 mg of soluble platinum per cubic metre To complete the derivation of a health-based guidance value (e.g. RfC or AEL), the guidance recommends consideration of groups at risk (i .e. children, elderly, etc.) and then dividing the POD by the total sensitization uncertainty factor (the sensitization asse ssment factor, or SAF) described above. For this case-study, relevant considerations would include the possibility that asthmatics or individuals with changes in airway integrity would ha ve an increased risk of developing respiratory sensit ization to halogenated platin um respiratory sensitization. For halogenated platinum salts, there is evidence that smoking is a risk factor in the development of platinum-specific allergic sensitization in several occupational studies of workers in platinum refineries and catalyst production plants (Venables et al ., 1989; Baker et al., 1990; et & Hughes, 1999; Merget et al., 2000; Cristaudo et al., 2005). Although no data are available on co-exposure to other relevant irri tants or adjuvants in the epidemiological studies, results of the laboratory animal study by Biagini et al. ( 1986) suggest that ozone promotes development of allergic sensitization to platinum. In mo nkeys, inhalation of high concentrations of (NH 4)2PtCl 6 (200 \u00b5g/m3, 4 hours/day, 5 days/week, for up to 12 weeks) produced minimal evidence of sensitization (e.g. one of eight monkeys was positive in hexachloroplatinate SPTs). In contrast, four out of eight monkeys exposed to ozone at 2.14 mg/m3 with hexa- chloroplatinate at 200 g/m3 had positive SPTs to Na 2PtCl 6, compared with none of seven monkeys exposed to ozone alone at the same c oncentration. These resu lts provide support for the hypothesis that airway damage from exposure to adjuvants or irritant materials in combin- ation with exposure to halogenated platinum sa lts may promote the development of allergic sensitization. To complete the derivation of a health-based guidance value, the final step is to divide the POD by the total SAF described above. Using the SAF mentioned above, for a risk asse ssment designed to evalua te sensitization, the total SAF applied would be 100 (1 for interspecies, 10 for in traspecies, 1 for matrix, 10 for use and time and 1 for database). A chronic re ference value for haloge nated platinum salts can be calculated by dividing the POD by the total SAF, as follows: For the sensitization-specific risk assessment of soluble platinum: Reference value = 1.20 \u00d7 10 6 mg/m3 \u00f7 100 = 1.20 \u00d7 108 mg/m3 The exposure assessment for this case-study woul d comprise the qualita tive and quantitative description of the contact of an individual with halogenated pl atinum salts for specific dura- tions of time (IPCS, 2009). The expo sure in the Merget et al. ( 2000) study was determined by stationary air samplers using sampling periods of 12-17 hours. Thus, the reported air concen- trations from the stationary air samples represent 12- to 17-hour TWA concentrations. Although data from personal air samplers would be preferred (particularly in a heterogeneous exposure scenario), the Merget et al. (2000) st udy included personal ai r sampler data only in the high-exposure group and for a single year of the study. The personal air sampler data were approximately 10-fold higher than the sta tionary data, suggesting that the stationary samplers may underestimate exposure. However, the personal air sampler data cannot be used to derive a NOAEL because there are no data from workers in the low-exposure group. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 238Application of the data from Merget et al. (2000) to a continuous subchronic or lifetime exposure would require dosimetric adjustments. One of the additional challenges illustrated in this case-study is the lack of specificity of the exposure measurements. Although exposure data in available occupational studies are charac terized only to the extent that soluble plat- inum concentrations are reported, the specificity of the SPT used to identify platinum-specific allergic response demonstrates that occupational alle rgic sensitization from exposure to platinum compounds is to chlori nated platinum salts. Furthermor e, the wider application of platinum-specific allergic sensit ization to halogenated platinum salts rather than chlorinated platinum salts is suggested by the data from Cleare et al. (1976) and Cristaudo et al. (2005) demonstrating that workers with platinum-speci fic allergic sensitization may have a positive SPT to chlorinated or brominated platinum sa lts. Therefore, exposure measurements that are limited to soluble platinum concentrations have direct implications for development of sensi- tization to halogenated platinum salts. The WH O (2000) report also de scribes sensitization associated with exposure to ha logenated platinum complexes in terms of exposure to soluble platinum salts. Data are not available to fu rther characterize exposur e levels or speciate measurements of soluble platinum to concentrat ions of individual halogenated platinum salts. The completion of the risk assessment for resp iratory sensitization to halogenated platinum salts involves the risk characterization stage, in which the summary and integration of the information in the hazard characterization, qua litative and quantitative dose-response assess- ment and exposure assessment are combined, along with a critical apprai sal of the toxicity information. A principal example of strength in the risk assessment that would be highlighted in this case-study is the relative strength of the database of case reports and occupational studies supporting allergic sens itization resulting from inha lation exposure. Conversely, the consideration of data gaps a nd uncertainties would include se veral aspects of the exposure data: lack of data on levels of exposure to specific halogenated platinum salts, lack of personal air sampler data and variation in the st ationary air sampler data. Standard consider- ations include the uncertainty associated with extrapolating from oc cupational exposure to non-occupational exposure and the potential \"hea lthy worker\" effect that may be further exacerbated by self-selection agai nst atopics in a work enviro nment where allergic sensitiza- tion is of concern. Finally, the discussion abov e focuses on the use of a positive response in the SPT to hexachloroplatinic acid as a meas ure of allergic sensiti zation resulting from exposure to halogenated platinum salts. This repr esents another source of uncertainty, as the SPT detects IgE-mediated, type 1 allergic responses. The potential for a second, non-IgE- mediated mechanism to be responsible for allerg ic sensitization in so me individuals is sug- gested by the existence of both IgE-mediat ed and non-IgE-mediated hypersensitivity responses to known sensitizers, such as di isocyanate (Kimber et al., 1998; Kimber & mechanism may play a role in platinum sensitiz ation. For example, close to 10% (10 out of 110) of workers identified as having allergic se nsitization to halogenate d platinum salts had a negative SPT in the retrospect ive study of 406 United Kingdom refinery workers reported by Linnett & Hughes (1999). C3.3.2.2 Is information on elicitation potency (e.g. a NOEC from an epidemiological or No. There are no human provocation studies that determine a range of airborne concentra- tions of halogenated platinum salts associated with development of respiratory sensitization. There are, however, several studies that demonstr ate the range of doses in the SPT required to produce a positive SPT in individuals previously sensitized to halogenated platinum salts. human provocation study) available? (see Figure 6.2B) Dearman, 2002; Redlich & Karol, 2002). Ig E-mediated and a second, non-IgE-mediated Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 239 Data from other refinery worker s with allergic sensitization to platinum demonstrate that the elicitation doses required to produce a positive SPT to (NH 4)2PtCl 6 range from 109 to 103 g/ml (Biagini et al., 1985a), whereas doses of either (NH 4)2PtCl 6 or Na 2PtCl 6 range from 108 to 103 g/ml (Brooks et al., 1990). Th erefore, a qualitative risk a ssessment of elicitation of respiratory sensitization is recommended, including the collection of use and exposure information, as well as a description of use a nd exposure scenarios that may pose a risk of elicitation in the allergic subpopulation. The la ck of dose-response data on elicitation from individuals sensitized to hal ogenated platinum salts presents a challenge to developing an informative qualitative risk assessment of elicitation. As described for dermal elicitation, there is an accepted general inverse relations hip between the sensi tization dose and the elicitation dose (Scott et al., 2002; Hostynek & Maibach, 2004). The data for this relationship are primarily based on dermal sensitization rather than respiratory sensi tization. Nevertheless, there are multiple exposure factors that are likely to affect this relationship for either route of sensitization, including frequency of exposure and single versus multiple exposures (Scott et al., 2002). The strength of sensitization is also exp ected to affect the elic itation dose, resulting in an additional inverse correlation between th e strength of the sensitization and the subse- quent elicitation dose (Friedmann, 2007). Merget et al. (1996) reported the results of specific bronch ial challenge to halogenated platinum salts in 57 workers in a platinum refinery and catalyst production. Although the Merget et al. (1996) study did not report expo sure information, evaluation included bronchial provocation to methacholine, bronc hial challenge to halogenate d platinum salts, SPTs, serum causing a 50% fall in specific airway conductance varied widely (from 2 \u00d7 10 7 to 102 mol/l) (Merget et al., 1991, 1996). Conclu sions for the respiratory elic itation dose for halogenated platinum salts based on the occupational exposure data and SPT data would suggest that potency categories for skin sensitizers for an analogous scale)\u2014that is, potent or strong sensitizers with potent or strong associated elicitation. Although data from specific bronchial challenge to halogenated plat inum salts are limited, there are some occupational data on challenge doses associated with a positive SPT response to halogenated platinum salts. The concentration of halogenated pl atinum salts required to elic it a positive SPT varies by 6 orders of magnitude (ranging from 109 to 103 g/ml) among individuals previously sensitized to halogenated platinum salts (Biagini et al., 1985a; Brooks et al., 1990). As described previously, the SPT is not equivale nt to an elicitation test for respiratory sensi tizers (i.e. the specific bronchial challenge or test), but SPT data may be indicative of the elicitation response for respiratory sensitization for hal ogenated platinum salts. Merget et al. (1996) reported a clear correlation between specific br onchial responsiveness to halogenated plat- inum salts and the SPT to ha logenated platinum salts ( r = 0.6; P < 0.0001). In conclusion, there are limited data with which to evaluate the elicit ation potency of halo- genated platinum salts; however, based on the low doses associated with sensitization and the huge variation (5-6 orders of magnitude) for el icitation response, haloge nated platinum salts are likely to have a st rong elicitation potency. halogenated platinum salts are at the higher end of sensitizers (see Figure 6.1 in chapter 6 on IgE level, lung function and othe r measures. The concentration of halogenated platinum salts Harmonization Project Document No. 10 240 (e.g. data from epidemiological studies, human experience or laboratory animal Yes. The halogenated platinum salts considered for skin and respiratory sensitization were evaluated separately from the platinum anti cancer drugs, because the platinum anticancer drugs are not expected to represent a signific ant source of environmental exposure to plat- inum. The platinum anticancer drugs currently a pproved for clinical use are cisplatin, carbo- platin and oxaliplatin, although a large number of carboplatin analogues have been developed and tested to various degrees in clinical trials (Sanderson et al., 1996). The extensive clinical experience with platinum anti cancer drugs provides a large body of information regarding adverse effects of those plat inum compounds in humans at hi gh doses and ge nerally after acute or short-term parenteral exposure. Alt hough a comprehensive review of the systemic sensitization properties of pla tinum anticancer drugs is beyond the scope of this document, numerous reports indicate that hypersensitivity reactions to platinum anticancer drugs occur (e.g. Markman, 2003; Navo et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2009). Evidence suggests that although there is some cross-reactivity in the hypersensitivi ty reactions to plati- num anticancer drugs, there is predominance of sp ecificity of the response for the individual drugs (Leguy-Seguin et al., 2007). Treatment can often be resumed with a different platinum anticancer drug without further complication from hypersensitivity reactions (Leguy-Seguin et al., 2007). Therefore, a qualita tive (or semiquantitative) risk assessment of systemic sensi- tization is recommended, including the collection of use and expos ure information, as well as a description of use and exposur e scenarios that may pose a syst emic sensitizati on risk. It is important to note that the exposure to platinum anticancer therapeutics is dictated by the exposure necessary to treat the cancer, and a qua litative risk assessment may not be possible or appropriate, as treatment -related exposure to platinum an ticancer therapeu tics would be based on medical decisions. A limit ed qualitative evalua tion of the risks of systemic sensi- tization may be possible for platinum antican cer drugs, by summarizing studies that examine particular risk factors or exposure/treatment conditions for platinum anticancer drugs that may be associated with a grea ter risk of hypersensitivity reactions. For example, in patients treated with carboplatin for recu rrent ovarian cancer, the hyperse nsitivity reaction rate was 4 times higher in patients with retreatment interv als approaching 2 years compared with those with shorter intervals (Gadducci et al., 2008). Further discussion of a potential qua litative risk assessment for sensitization via oral or parenter al exposure to platinum is beyond the scope of this document. C3.4 Conclusions The halogenated platinum salts case-study is an illustration of the use of the risk assessment guidance for the assessment of sensitization and allergic res ponse. Platinum was selected because of the strong database for halogenate d platinum salts as a respiratory sensitizer. However, the example serves to illustrate that chemical sensitizers often have properties of skin, respiratory and systemic se nsitization. The case-study also illustrates an example of the kind of variation often seen in occupational exposure measurements. It should be noted that this case-study on platin um is provided with the purpose of illustrating how the risk assessment guidance can be used for sensitization, but it does not represent a comprehensive risk assessment, nor doe s it represent a fina l regulatory position. studies)?

This case-study illustrates the use of the risk assessment guidance provided for the assess- case-study because it represents an example from a group of fragrance ingredients that are well established as skin sensitizers. The case-study for citral highlights a database with strong support for skin sensitization and provides limited information on an elicitation dose- response relationship. The risk assessment of citral follows the appl ication of the decision-trees for the assessment of sensitization and allergic response provided in chapter 6. This case-study is not intended to be a full risk assessment of the health effects as sociated with exposure to citral or a compre- hensive risk assessment of sensitization associated with citral. Rather, the following assess-ment was developed to illustrat e the process for conducting a risk assessment of sensitization and allergic response by consid ering the available human, A number of allergenic substan ces have been identif ied in a wide range of food and consumer products. Substances in products that come in c ontact with skin play an important role as exogenous factors in the triggering of allergic contact eczemas at work, but also at home. Respiratory allergy can be induced by substanc es in consumer products, but information on this is very scarce. For consumer products, most information is ava ilable on allergenic substances in cosmetic products, although data indicate the presence of such substances in other products, including detergents, toys, textiles and do-it-yourself products. The pr esence of a substance as such is not always a problem: a substance can exert its sensitizing action only as it is available for dermal contact, can be released from its matr ix or can enter the l ungs (Wijnhoven et al., 2008). Fragrances represent one of the five main cate gories of allergenic substances that can be distinguished in consumer products (W ijnhoven et al., 2008). Today, more than 5000 fragrance substances are frequently used as mi xtures, particularly in cosmetics (perfumes, shampoos, creams, shower gels, toothpastes), household products (r oom fresheners and carpet shampoos), textiles, shoes and toys. Frag rances have been identified as the most frequent cause of allergic contact dermatitis from cosmetic products (reviewed in SCCNFP, 1999). In 1999, the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products Intended for Consumers (SCCNFP, now re-established as th e Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety) identified 24 fragrance chemicals potentially resulting in contact alle rgy and divided them ment of sensitization and allergic response as presented in chapter 6. Citral was selected as a Harmonization Project Document No. 10 246into two different lists. Table C4.1 is a list of fragrances most frequently reported and well recognized as contact a llergens, and Table C4.2 is a list of fragrances less frequently docu- mented as consumer allergens. Table C4.1: Fragrances most frequently reported as consumer allergens. Common name CAS No. SCCNFP (1999) Table C4.2: Fragrances less frequently reported as consumer allergens. Common name 127-51-5 CAS, Chemical Abstracts Service Source SCCNFP (1999) It has to be emphasized that fragrance chem icals in these lists ar e not the only compounds that can elicit allergic reactions. Other fragran ce chemicals have also been reported to cause cases of skin sensitization or ma y be allergenic but have not b een identified as such owing to a lack of data. When allergic contact dermatitis is suspected in a patient, the dermatologist lGuidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 247 will usually apply two different fragrance mixtures (fragrance mixture I and II) to the patient's skin in a patch test to screen for skin sensitization to fragrances. Components of fragrance mixture I cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, -amyl-cinnamaldehyde, hydroxycitronellal, one the characteristic odours related to the citrus family. Citral occurs widely in varying component is omer ratios in many natural products, including citrus oils, such as lemon oil and orange oil, lemongrass oil, Litsea cubeba oil, black pepper oil, verbena oil, melissa oil and ginger oil. Mo st people are exposed to citral in their daily lives when citrus fruits are peel ed and cut by hand. Al so, citral is regularly found in the diet as a natural or synthetic fla vouring component of some spices and in fruit-based or fruit- flavoured soft drinks (Lalko & Api, 2008). Citr al is generally recognized as a safe food additive and has been approved by the USFDA (2009) for use in foods. In 2003, Directive 2003/15/EC, the 7th amendmen t of the European Cosmetic Directive 76/768/EEC, was published based on the reco mmendations of the SCCNFP (EC, 2003). Within the EU, the directive requi res that citral be listed on the ingredient label of consumer products when present in concen trations greater than or equa l to 10 mg/kg (0.001%) in leave- on cosmetic products and greater than or equal to 100 mg/kg (0.01%) in rinse-off cosmetics.

Citral is therefore also known as geranial (or citral a) and neral (or citral b) (Figure Citral is a mixture of two acyclic monoterpenoid s, neral and geranial, which can be regarded C4.1). It is common in lemongrass, lemon and other citrus fruits. Next to limonene, citral is chloroatranol). Fragrance mi presented in Figures 6.2A, 6.2B and 6.2C in chapter 6 that are intended as Citral is commonly used as a fragrance material in consumer products, and it belongs to the group of most frequently reported allergens, according to the SCCNFP (see Table C4.1).

Harmonization Project Document No. 10 248C4.3.1 Is there evidence that the substance is a skin sensitizer (e.g. data from LLNA, Yes. There is sufficient evidence that citral is a skin sensitizer fr om both human data and experimental animal studies. such as sensitization (Ford et al., 2000). Appl ication of the rule-based DEREK (Deductive Estimation of Risk from Existing Knowledge) syst em also identifies citral as a potential contact allergen, as it has a relative molecular weight of 154.24 and a calculated octanol/ water partition coefficient (log Kow) of 3.45. This suggests that it would fairly readily permeate human skin. As citral is a volatile orga nic chemical, it can be expected that (under non-occlusive conditions) evaporation of citral is competing with de rmal absorption, which would result in an exposure lowe r than the applied dose. Quanti tative information on dermal absorption of citral is limited; however, citral has been demonstrated to penetrate readily through both human and experimental animal skin (Meyer & Meyer, 1959; Barbier & Benezra, 1983; citral r eactive (Gerberick et al., 2004). Citral is irritating to skin but not irritating to the eyes of rabbits. In humans, this chemical was marginally irritating to skin, at 8% (Lalko & Api, 2008). In the past, citral has been tested extensivel y for skin sensitization in guinea-pigs, mice and humans. In all species, citral has tested positive for skin sens itization. Whereas the results in guinea-pigs and in humans are predominantly us eful for identifying a skin sensitizer, the LLNA test can provide input for both hazard id entification and dose-response relationship. irritating concentration, test performed before publication of the OECD test guideline) (OECD, 2001). Lalko & Api (2008) reported ex tensively on guinea-pig test results using different test methods (e.g. GPMT, Buehler assa y, Draize test, Maguire test). An overview of this case-study. A survey of sensitization data from tests on materials containing c itral was conducted under the auspices of the Soap and Detergent As sociation (OECD, 2001). This survey was restricted to skin patch tests on human subj ects conducted in the USA by member companies of the Soap and Detergent Association and by pe rfume suppliers. None of the personal care or household products containing citral induced hype rsensitivity attributed to citral in 10 660 patch tests, and there were no confirmed reactio ns to citral in 2098 pa tch tests on fragrance blends containing the substance. In various HRIPTs and HMTs, sensitization was induced in a total of 105 of 405 subjects when concentrations of 2-8% ci tral in ethanol or petrolatum were used, whereas no induction occurred at 1.2% or lower in 182 tested subjects .

Results of 11 different LLNA tests (as summarized by Lalko & Api, 2008) LLNAs. C4.3.1.1 Is information on skin sensitizing potency available as LLNA EC 3 or human NOEL Yes. Both LLNA data as well as human HRIPT data are available for citral. To derive a POD for the induction of skin se nsitization, Lalko & Api (2008) used the LLNA data, because these results provide data on the dose-response relationship of induction of skin sensitization. From the 11 EC 3 values, ranging from 300 to 3250 \u00b5g/cm2 32 however, the weighting procedure was not explained in the paper. Therefore, for the purposes of this case-study, a new mean vehicle-based mean EC 3 was calculated. If more than one EC 3 was available for a particular vehicle, a mean value for that vehicle was calculated first, and weighted mean, rather than the lowest EC 3 value, is justified, becau se OECD Test Guideline 429 gives acetone:olive oil (4:1) vehicle priority when testin g, provided the test substance is sufficiently soluble in it. This preferred standard vehicle resu lted in the highest EC 3. Diethyl phthalate and ethanol are not am ong the standard vehicles listed in the OECD test guideline and may in fact act as penetration e nhancers and thus result in lower EC 3 values. Use of a vehicle-based mean is also justified because LLNA EC 3 values, when tested repeatedly, tend to vary within a factor of 2-3 from the mean value, and the variability of the EC 3 value caused by different vehicles lead s to uncertainty in the risk assessment that is taken into Table C4.3: Calculation of vehicle-based mean EC 3 value from LLNA results (as Vehicle group Vehicle EC 3 (\u00b5g/cm2) Vehicle mean EC 3 (\u00b5g/cm2) A (3:1) + antioxidant vehicles were lumped together. account in setting the matrix fact or (see section 6.5.3 and below). to derive a quantitative POD?

Harmonization Project Document No. 10 250Human data from sensitization test s also provide relevant data for derivation of the threshold \u00b5g/cm2 and the LOEL was 3876 \u00b5g/cm2. Generally, the induction phase in the HRIPT com- prises a total of nine 24-hour occluded patch applications, and the applicati on skin site is changed if moderate or str onger skin reactions are observe d upon removal of a patch. In contrast, the HMT induction phase typically consists of five alternate 48-hour patches made on sodium lauryl sulfate-irritated skin if the te st substance is not irritating itself. These con- goal. Also, the HMT is no longer perfomed for ethical reasons. Therefore, the HRIPT data were given precedence over the HMT data (Api et al., 2008). The study from which the POD is derived was conducted relatively recently acco rding to a standardized protocol and in a sufficient number of subjects (Politano & Api, 2008). The derived human NOEL of 1400 \u00b5g/cm2 from the HRIPT data is well supported by the vehicle-weighted mean LLNA EC 3 of 1609 \u00b5g/cm2 and was therefore set as the POD for the assessment of induction of skin sensitization (a lso referred to as no expected sensitization induction level [NESIL] in the methodology de veloped by IFRA/RIFM) (Api & Vey, 2008). 3 citral can be classified in the weak to modera te potency range of skin sensitizers (ECETOC, C4.3.1.2 Do quantitative risk assessment of elicit ation of skin allergy using SAFs to derive an acceptable non-eliciting skin area dose; do quantitative exposure assessment, describe risk (a) Exposure * Presence in cons umer products Citral is found in several consumer products, as shown in the inventory report of Wijnhoven et al. (2008), which is the so urce of the information given in the following. Citral was identified by the Danish Environmental Prot ection Agency in 26.1% ( 23 out of 88) of the cosmetic products containing a fragrance substa nce, with concentrations ranging from 38.8 to 553.9 mg/l. In children's cosmetics, it was pres ent in 8.2% (17 out of 208) of products in concentrations between 4.0 and 73 mg/l. In th e Netherlands, the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority determined the presence of citr al in 8.7% (2 out of 23 ) of children's cosmet- ic products in a concentration range of 109-168 mg/l. Citral is also used in cleaning products and detergents. The Danish Environmental Prot ection Agency investigat ed 43 cleaning prod- ucts, of which 7 products (16.3%) contained citral in concentrations up to 0.0501% by weight. Similarly, the Food and Consumer Produc t Safety Authority measured fragrances in 52 products and found citral in 1 product at a concentration of 8 mg/l. In air fresheners, the Danish Environmental Protection Agency determined citral to be present in 36.8% (7 out of 19) of the products tested in a concentra tion range of 200-26 000 mg/l. The European Con- sumers' Organisation measured emissions from 74 different air freshene rs. Citral could be detected in 2 (2.6%) air fresheners, resulti ng in airborne concentrations of 2.0-48 \u00b5g/m3. Furthermore, citral was found in a toy at a c oncentration of 27 mg/kg by the Danish Environ- mental Protection Agency. This overview shows that citral is present in a number of consumer products at concentrations ranging from 4 to 26 000 mg/l. For the exposur e estimation in the next section, upper bounds 2003) (see chapter 6, Figure 6.1). ditions are considered unsuitable when characterization of the skin sensitizing potency is the characterization for elicitation in allergic subpopulation.

In the HRIPT, the NOEL was 1400 Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 251 of citral concentrations in cosmetic produc ts and household cleaning products of 0.06% and 0.05%, respectively, will be assumed. * Quantitative exposure assessment As mentioned above, citral has been demonstrated to be present in several different consumer products varying from cosmetics to detergents to air fresheners. Because of this wide variety of potential sources of exposure, it is conceivable that ag gregate exposure (defined here as the total area dose of citral to one skin site from different consumer products over 1 day) should be used for exposure estimation. In th is case, the relevant route of concern was restricted to the dermal rout e. Therefore, for this quantita tive exposure assessment example, an exposure scenario has been chosen in wh ich several consumer products are applied onto the same skin site within a rela tively short time frame. Three diffe rent products that are likely to contain citral\u2014two cosmetic products (shower gel and hand cream) in combination with a household cleaner\u2014were selected. The aggregate e xposure estimate did not take into account the fact that only a fraction of the products on the market contain citral (worst-case scenario). Furthermore, for reasons of simplicity, it was decided not to estimate population exposure or to apply probabilistic techniques to scale the variability and uncertainty in the assessment. Also, exposure from other sources, such as ci tral in food, was not taken into account here, although it is known that in highly allergic individuals, oral uptake of a sensitizer may lead to manifestation of allergic symptoms in the ski n. It is acknowledged that these aspects could be considered in a full-blown risk assessment, but they are beyond the scope of this case-study testing the applicability of the decision-trees. The following exposure scenario has been chos en: an individual uses a hand cream, cleans the kitchen, takes a shower and uses the hand cr eam again. It is anticipated that these expo- sures would lead to an aggreg ate exposure in which the exposu re estimates for the individual products are added. * Exposure parameters The WHO guidance/decision-tr ees give no clear preference for the exposure assessment method. Therefore, the proposed approach by IF RA/RIFM (Api et al., 2008; IFRA, 2008) and exposure modelling using the ConsExpo comput er model were used in this case-study. A) Using the ConsExpo 4.1 computer model (dev eloped by the Dutch National Institute for ConsExpo fact sheets on cosmetics (i.e. hand cream and shower gel) and cleaning products (i.e. cleaning agent) (develope d by RIVM; Bremmer et al., 2006; Prud'homme de Lodder et al., 2006). Weight fractions of ci tral in cosmetic and cleani ng products were obtained from Wijnhoven et al. (2008), and upper limits of 0.06% and 0.05%, respectivel y, were chosen for products as well as the aggregate exposure, derived by simple addition, for the chosen scenario. off) of the product.

In this met hod, all consumer products containing fragrances are categorized into 1 of 11 different product ca tegories (Api et al., 2008 ). Categorical expo- sure estimates are used to determine the \"surrogate\" exposure for a product within that cate- gory. Generally, a combination of a relatively high use amount and small exposed skin area was selected, rendering a high ar ea dose exposure estimate for that specific category. (Com- ment: The consumer exposure levels [CELs] posed as defaults are mainly based on unpub- lished data gathered by industry.) Quantitative exposure assessment using the IFRA/R IFM method is relatively straightforward. The estimate of exposure for a specific product is based on the exposure estimate for the category to which that product belongs. The products hand cream, shower gel and household cleaner belong to categories 5, 9 and 10, respec tively (for details, see Api & Vey, 2008, and Appendix C4.2), with corresponding product e xposure estimates of 4.2, 0.2 and 0.1 mg/cm 2 per day. The corresponding expo sure estimates for these pr oducts are calculated and C) In addition to the upper bounds of measured citral concentr ations in products, the IFRA estimation (right-hand column of Table C4.5).

For this, the risk per product is determined by comparing the AEL (= NESIL/ SAF) with the CEL. The CEL is determined per product category (Api et al., 2008). If the ra tio AEL/CEL is greater than 1, the product is not considered to pose a risk for skin sensitization. To extrapolate from the experimental (defined and controlled exposure conditions) to real-life consumer exposure (variable exposure controlle d by the consumer), SAFs are applied in dermal sensitization risk assessment. These SA Fs take account of th ree parameters: inter- matrix effects and use considera tions (specific for dermal sens itization) (Api et al., 2008). The interspecies parameter in th is IFRA/RIFM method is determin ed to be 1 and is incorpor- ated in the NESIL, because of the use of huma n data as the POD (i.e. no interspecies extrapo- lation). Using the methodology for deriving a skin sensiti zation assessment factor proposed by Griem et al. (2003) would also lead to a total factor of 100, composed of 1 fo r interspecies extrapo- lation (not applicable because human data as st arting point), 10 for intr aspecies (interindivid- ual) extrapolation and 10 fo r more frequent exposure. The total SAF, according to the IFRA/RIFM method, for the different products of this individual variability (same as in general toxicology, with a default of 10) , vehicle/product example\u2014including the rationale for the matrix and use factors\u2014is given in Table C4.6.

Therefore, in this example, the sensitization ri sk was also determined for the aggregate expo- sure estimation for an exposure scenario incl uding three products cont aining citral: two cos- metic products as well as a household cleaner. Again, exposure estimations A, B and C were evaluated (Table C4.8).

Using the maximum concentration limits for citr al according to the IFRA standards, the AEL/ CEL ratio for the aggregate exposure in this ex ample is less than 1 and thus cannot be con- sidered safe. Exposure estimates resulting from the categor y approach following the IFRA/RIFM method might give an overestimation when used in an aggregate assessment. The exposure level within each category is a wors t-case estimate based on one sentin el product. Relevant aggre- gation (taking into acco unt time and location of exposure) possibly uses exposure parameters from a product for which aggregation would not have been relevant. Although it cannot be excluded that some market ed products contain ci tral at the maximum use concentration limit according to the IFRA standards, it is obviously an overly conserva- tive approach to assume that citral is presen t at the maximum concentr ation limit in all prod- ucts of all product categories when doing a ggregate exposure estimation. Here, an adapta- tion\u2014for example, by using a probabilistic popula tion-based approach (requiring more habits and use data input)\u2014would be necessary in orde r to derive realistic worst-case estimations. This is, however, beyond the scope of this case-study. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 256The risk of dermal sensitization for citral in this case-study has been determined following exposure to different consumer pr oducts. As shown in the case-study, it is possible to derive a safe concentration limit of citral for indivi dual consumer products. However, when taking into account the aggregate exposur e of certain skin sites, as done here for the hands, from several different cosmetic products and other co nsumer products, such as air fresheners or household detergents, a further development of the methodology for both concerted establish- C4.3.1.3 Is information on elicitation potency (e.g. a BMD or NOEL from human patch tests No. There are no quantitative data on th e elicitation potency of citral. There are some human patch test studies (dia gnostic patch tests in patients) with citral available, in which test concentrations va ried between 0.5% and 5% (Frosch et al., 2005; ever, these studies give only an impression of the number of individuals who scored positive in the test after a second exposur e to a certain co ncentration of citral. No elicitation threshold can be derived from these data. In summary, th e available data are insufficient to derive a POD (elicitation NOEL in individuals with ac ute contact dermatitis) for quantitative risk assessment. C4.3.1.4 Do qualitative risk assessment of elicitation of skin allergy, collect use and exposure information\u2014if available, compare with dermal elicitation threshold\u2014and describe use and exposure scenarios that may pose a risk of elicitation in allergic subpopulation. (see Figure 6.2A) A qualitative risk assessment of elicitation is difficult to explore. The only information avail-able is that thresholds for elicitation are lower when compar ed with sensitization induction for the same chemical. In other words, higher levels are needed for sensitization of naive individuals than for elicitation of sensitized subjects. Griem et al. (2003) reported that in humans, no correlation could be shown between sensitization and e licitation thresholds; hence, thresholds for induction of sensitization cannot currently be used to predict elicitation thresholds. Furthermore, specific exposure information for citr al is not available. Sensitized patients who are allergic to a specific allergen should be a dvised to avoid exposure to that allergen. In the EU, this is achieved with the help of legislation (i.e. by setting concentr ation limits above which declaration on the labels of preparations and cosmetics is required). In this way, con- sumers can make an informed choice of thei r products and can avoi d products in which a specific allergen is declared. However, it should be noted that the curr ent EU declaration lim- its are not based on a quantitative risk assess ment (neither for induction nor for elicitation) and that the 26 fragrance ingredie nts that have to be labelled were considered the most rele- vant at that time, taking into account sensitization test data and prevalence of clinical allergy. As the relevant dose metric for both induction and elicitation is the skin area dose (i.e. amount of sensitizer applied pe r square centimetre of skin), it may be expected that\u2014assum- ing the same citral concentration in the pr oducts\u2014cosmetic product categories resulting in the highest area dose confer a higher relative risk of eliciting allergic reactions in sensitized patients.

C4.3.2 Is there evidence that the substance is a respiratory sensitizer (e.g. data from No. There is no evidence of citral being a respirat ory sensitizer based on the very limited data available. Usually, dose-response data on th is end-point are derived from clinical studies (prospective or retrospective). However, for fragrances in general, there are only limited human data available on the effects of i nhalation exposure. There are tw o case reports that have shown that occupational exposure to fragrances could lead to asthma and rhinitis (Baur et al., 1999; Quirce et al., 2008). These and other recent studies of Schnuch et al. (2010) on isoeugenol or Lyral indicate that inhalation of fragrances could lead to respiratory allergies. Nevertheless, no public human data on respirat ory sensitization following expos ure to citral are available. No case reports of respiratory sensitization to citral (or its constituents neral and geranial) have been reported in publicly available da ta banks (PubMed, Toxline). There are some experimental animal data available for citral . Ezendam et al. (2009a) described results on citral in a respiratory LLNA. A lthough a relatively high concentra tion of citral has been used and citral is known as a weak to moderate skin sensitizer, no significant induction of cell proliferation could be demonstrated in th is short-term assay (Ezendam et al., 2009a). C4.3.2.1 Is the substance a (likely) skin sensitizer or a high molecular weight compound containing or being a protein? (see Figure 6.2B) Human data on respiratory expos ure to citral (occupational or consumer) are very limited. C4.3.2.2 Collect use and exposure information and describe use and exposure scenarios if relevant inhalation exposure occurs. (see Figure 6.2B) It has been described in a recent RIVM lette r report (Ezendam et al., 2009b) that citral is present in various scented products that can be inhaled by the consumer. The database of the Dutch National Poison Control Centre shows that citral is present in 32.7% of all scented products with a potential respiratory exposure ( n = 113, with 48 air fresheners and 65 prod- ucts intended for steam baths and saunas) (E zendam et al., 2009b). The same trend is found been demonstrated to be present in 36.7% of 49 scented products (mostly electrical room perfumes and scented car products) (Ezenda m et al., 2009b). The European Consumers' Organisation performed a study in which emission levels of 11 fragrances in 74 air fresheners were reported. Citral was present in 2.6% of all tested air fresheners, resulting in airborne emission levels of 2-48 \u00b5g/m3. An additional study of the Danish Environmental Protection Agency showed not only that citral was pr esent in 36.8% of the scented products Yes. There is evidence that citral is a skin sensitizer (see section C4.3.1). epidemiological studies, human experience or laboratory animal studies)? (see Figure facial cream/masks/makeup) > Categories 3 and 4 (2.2 mg/cm per day, hydroalcoholics, eye 6.2B) Category 9 (0.2 mg/cm per day, rinse-off hair products , liquid soap, shaving creams) > on the publicly available web site of Sara Lee (http://www.saralee-int.info/), where citral has Harmonization Project Document No. 10 258investigated, but also that it was one of the five fragrances used in the highest concentrations (up to 2.6% of the product by weight). For the workplace, monitoring data in a citral manufacturing plant indicated workplace air concentrations between 0.31 and 0.56 mg/m 3 (OECD, 2001). In conclusion, these data indicate that there is potential respiratory exposure of consumers to citral. Owing to its skin sensit izing properties and vol atility, a potential for respiratory sensiti- zation of citral cannot be ruled out. Definitive data in the form of case reports or epidemio- logical evidence in humans or experimental an imal studies evaluating respiratory sensitiza- inhalation exposures at the workplace and from consumer products are unlikely to pose a sig- nificant respiratory se nsitization hazard. C4.3.3 Is there evidence that the substance causes oral or parenteral sensitization (e.g. data from epidemiological studies, human experience or laboratory animal No. There is no evidence that citral is an oral or parenteral sensitizer. No case reports of oral or parenteral sensitization to citral (or its constituents neral and geranial), for example, in the form of food a llergy, have been reporte d in publicly available data banks (PubMed, Toxline). Likewise, no e xperimental animal studies evaluating the potential of citral to cause oral or parenteral sensi tization could be located. C4.3.3.1 Does the substance have uses with significant intentional or foreseeable exposure via the oral or parenteral route (e.g. in food, parenteral medicinal uses)? (see Figure 6.2C) Yes. There is evidence that citral is used as a food additive and in some foods is a naturally occurring substance. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food A dditives has evaluated citral as a food additive and has derived a gr oup ADI of 0-0.5 mg/kg body weight (expressed as citral) for applications of citral are not known. C4.3.3.2 Collect use and exposure information, evaluate available information indicating interaction with the immune system (e.g. from repeated-dose toxicity studies, other sensitization studies, QSAR, in vitro tests, human experience) and decide whether further data (e.g. from hazard identification tests) have to be collected or generated. Fill information gaps, and restart if necessary. (see Figure 6.2C) Citral occurs naturally in several fruits and spices and their essential oils (e.g. Melissa officinalis , lemongrass, myrtle trees, African basil, lemons, limes, oranges and tomatoes) (Ress et al., 2003). Synthetic citr al is used primarily as lem on flavouring in foods, beverages and candies because of its strong lemon flavour and odour. Citral is a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) list chemical (USFDA, 2009). Citral concentrations have been reported for several foods: for example, chewing gum (~170 mg/kg), ba ked studies)? (see Figure 6.2C) tion are lacking. From the lack of any case re ports, it may be conclu ded that the current Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 259 daily per capita intake s of citral in Europe and the USA are 6.85 mg and 6.99 mg, respec- tively (FAO/WHO, 2004). From the lack of any case repor ts of food allergy, it may be concluded that the current exposure to citral via food is unlikely to pose a significant oral sensitization hazard. There are no data to suggest that oral expos ure to citral from natural or flavoured food induces immunological tolerance in the gastrointestinal tract-a ssociated immune system. Oral tolerance could modify the respon siveness to citral as a skin sensitizer. However, no evidence for this has been reported to date. C4.4 Conclusion The citral case-study illu strates the use of the risk assessm ent guidance for the assessment of example of the group of fragrance ingredients th at are well established as skin sensitizers. The example was intended to illustrate the point that exposure to chemical sensitizers often results from several consumer products, which can make exposure assessment quite complex. Risk assessment does not include decisions on whether and how risks can or should be controlled. Consequently, risk management measur es were not discussed in this case-study. It would be the task of risk managers to decide , on the basis of the risk assessment outcome, whether and which measures of protection a nd communication are nece ssary to adequately control risk. Possible measures could include, for example, labe ls and use instructions on consumer products, bans or concentration lim its for certain uses, and personal protection measures at the workplace. It should be noted that this case-study on citr al is provided with the purpose of illustrating how the risk assessment guidance can be used for assessing the risk of sensitization, but it does not represent a comprehensive risk assess ment, nor does it represent a final regulatory position.

Depending on the chemical form, th e dose, the route of administration and the immunological status of the host, mercury ca n modulate immune mechanisms, resulting in either immunosuppression or autoimmune dysfunction (Moszczy ski, 1997; Silber geld et al., has lent itself to experimental inquiry th rough human population-base d studies, animal mod- els of disease, as well as cellu lar molecular mechanistic resear ch. Indeed, merc ury is viewed to be an example of an importa nt ubiquitous environmental c ontaminant that has been linked to human autoimmune disease and for which well-established animal model systems have been developed. In this regar d, mercury serves as a construc tive candidate toxicant to illus- to perform a risk assessment of au toimmunity induced by chemicals. In this case-study, the ev idence that mercury induces autoimm unity or autoimmune disease is evaluated by following the guidance presented in chapter 7 for the assessment of autoimmun- ity. The case-study is not meant to be a full risk assessment of the health effects associated with exposure to mercury or a detailed risk assessment of autoimmune disease-inducing potential associated with human exposure to mercury compounds. Rather, the following assessment is provided to illu strate the process for conducting a risk analysis of mercury- induced autoimmunity by considering the availa ble human, experimental animal and mechan- istic data required to do so. C5.2 Background: data on the pot ential for mercury to induce autoimmunity Mercury is a natural component of Earth's crust and atmosphere . It is found in three main chemical forms: elemental mercury (Hg0), organic mercury (e.g. me thyl, ethyl) and inorganic mercury (e.g. Hg2+). Humans are mainly exposed to th ree sources of mercury: two organic compounds\u2014namely, methylmercury through consumption of fish and thimerosal as a com- ponent of some vaccines\u2014and the elemental fo rm of mercury inhaled as mercury vapour from amalgam dental fillings (Clarkson, 2002). E ach of these chemical forms of mercury has different toxicokinetic properties, although they are all conver ted to inorganic Hg2+ within the body. The toxicity of mercury compounds to th e nervous and renal systems following acute high-level exposure has been well documented. Ho wever, the current public health concern has largely centred on the effects of low-level mercury exposure, which are relevant to large segments of the population as a result of ubiqu itous environmental contamination. Much of this interest and scrutiny for adverse health effects associated with low-level mercury expo- sure has focused on the immune system. A growing body of literature is providing evidence that exposure to mercury, particularly in the context of specific genetic variants, may in crease the risk for disrupting immune system homeostasis and promote or induce autoimmunit y. Epidemiological studies and case reports have suggested that exposure to occupationa l and environmental mercury levels may be a trate the application of the wei ght of evidence schematic depi cted in Figure 7.1 in chapter 7 2005). The potential for mercury to induce or ex acerbate autoimmune disease, in particular, Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 269 factor that contributes to idiosyncratic auto immune disease in humans. Generally speaking, however, these studies are underpow ered and of limited value in predicting the risk of human autoimmune disease from mercury exposure. Rode nt studies have provided the best direct evidence that exposure to mercury in its variou s forms gives rise to or exacerbates auto- immune disease. There are essent ially four categories of rodent studies dealing with mercury exposure and its effects on the autoimmune dis ease process. The first category is known as mercury-induced autoimmune disease (HgIA). In this model, a de novo lupus-like systemic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphopr oliferation, hyperglobuli naemia, antinuclear antibody production and systemic immune comple x deposition leading to glomerulonephritis is produced following the administration of me rcury to mice with a certain MHC haplotype. Induction of disease in HgIA depends on define d genetic elements within the murine H-2 locus and their interaction with mercury or the aftermath of mercury-mediated cellular toxicity. The second ca tegory involves de novo induction of autoimmune disease in rats following administration of mercury. As with mu rine HgIA, the rat model of disease involves interactions between mercury and genetic elements of th e rat MHC. Although there are general similarities between the mouse and rat models of HgIA, the two are mechanistically distinct, and the clinical featur es of disease presentation diffe r between the two species. The third category involves spontan eously or genetica lly autoimmune disease-prone strains of mice in which exposure to mercury appears to exacer bate the onset or seve rity of features of the disease. The distinction between this thir d category and the previ ous two may simply be that interaction between mercury and the genetic elements of disease is more defined in the first two categories (i.e. MHC). Op erationally, another important di stinction is that mercury is clearly required for disease i nduction in the first two categorie s but not the third. The fourth and final category involves studies where ag ain mercury exacerbates rather than induces disease. In these studies, the mouse strain s are not spontaneously genetically autoimmune disease prone, but the disease is induced upon exposure to a defined environmental trigger other than mercury. Coll ectively, the relatively large database of rodent studies indicates that, depending on the circumstances, mercury can act as an inducer of de novo autoimmune disease, as a modifier of an existing genetic predisposition to autoimmune disease or as a cofactor with other non-genetic inducers that trigger autoi mmune diseases. C5.3 Assessment of the potent ial for mercury to induce or exacerbate autoimmunity C5.3.1 Application of the weight of evidence approach to assessment of risk for autoimmunity\", that is intended to aid in organizing and character- izing immunotoxicity data for a given chemical from the strongest and most predictive data through the least predictive evidence supporting human risk for autoimmunity and auto- immune disease. The weight of evidence conc lusions developed by answering these questions summarize the hazard identification for autoimmunity and should describe the database in terms of consistency and biological plausibility , including strengths, weaknesses, uncertain- ties and data gaps. When autoimmunity is indi cated by the weight of evidence, the data are brought forward for dose-response assessment be ginning with selection of the most appro- priate end-point(s) (critical effects) and de veloping PODs. The questions are reproduced and answered below, followed by a discussi on of the supporting immunotoxicity data. A series of questions is presented in chapter 7, s ection 7.7.1, \"Weight of evidence approach Harmonization Project Document No. 10 270C5.3.1.1 Are epidemiological studies, clinical studies or case-studies available that provide human data on end-points relevant to chemical-induced autoimmunity (i.e. increased incidence of all or specific autoimmune diseases, changes in immune parameters indicative of autoimmunity, increased levels of autoant ibodies, decreased regulatory T cell function, evidence of nonspecific stimulation of the immune system, increased levels of markers of inflammation)? Yes. Human exposure to mercury from various sour ces has been implicated as a trigger for autoimmune disease; however, no large-scale, properly powered epidemiological studies have been conducted in which mercury exposur e has been evaluated and associated with elements of autoimmune disease. As such, the availability of human data to apply to the risk assessment of mercury and autoimmune disease is limited. A few small-scale population studies provide so me support for an association between mer- cury exposure and manifestation of autoimmune disease in humans. For example, in a small case-control study in patients with systemic scle rosis, the authors repo rted an association between elevated urinary mercury levels and the severity of the c onnective tissue autoim- mune disease, scleroderma. In this report, urinary mercury leve ls correlated with heightened serum antibody levels to fibrilla rin, an autoantibody specificity associated with scleroderma, and more severe features of the disease (Arn ett et al., 2000). In another example, a commun- ity comparison study examining people living near an oil field waste site showed significant associations between presumed toxicant expo sure (petroleum products and mercury) and prevalence of rheumatic diseases (OR = 10.78) and lupus (OR = 19.33) (Dahlgren et al., 2007). However, as is the case with many epidemio logical studies, resident s near the oil field waste site were exposed to a mixture of compounds in addition to mercury, including elevated levels of compounds with the poten tial to induce autoimmunity (pristane and phytane). Therefore, the Dahlgren et al. (2007) study cannot attribute the observed increase in autoimmune diseases to the eff ects of mercury alone. In a separa te study, statistically signifi- cant correlations (OR = 3.6) were seen in self-re ported occupational exposures to mercury and the prevalence of systemic lupus erythe matosus among dental workers (Cooper et al., 2004). Although these human studies are conceptually informativ e with respect to linking mercury exposure to human autoimmune disease, the lack of adequate assessment and docu- mentation of the mercury exposures limits thei r utility for risk assessment and analysis. Another approach has been to test for elements of autoimmune disease (e .g. presence of auto- antibodies above normal levels and increased T cell subpopulations) in mercury-exposed populations. Elevated levels of circulating antilaminin antibodies were found in a subset of chloralkali workers who were occupationally exposed to merc ury vapour (Lauwerys et al., 1983). However, the increased levels of antilami nin antibodies in that cohort were not pre- dictive of glomerulonephritis. An additional cross-sectional study of chloralkali workers showed no statistically significant association between elevated blood mercury levels and any indices of autoimmune disease (Barreg\u00e5rd et al., 1997). Moszczy ski et al. (1995) reported that quantitative changes in T cell numbers (ranging from 40% to 96%, depending on T cell subset analysed and mercury vapour expos ure group) were an immunological index of occupational exposure to mercury. Male work ers stratified by mercury vapour exposure group (median TWA concentration = 0.036 mg/m3) with duration of exposure either up to 10 years or above 10 years showed increased nu mbers of CD3+ T cells by 45% and 55%, of CD4+ T cells by 42% and 60%, and of CD8+ T cells by 80% and 96%, respectively. A follow-up study in a second cohort by the same i nvestigators more extensively documented the mercury exposure assessment, where merc ury vapour exposure (TWA concentration = 0.028 mg/m3) resulting in urine (range = 10-240 \u00b5g /l) and blood (range = 4-30 \u00b5g/l) mercury Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 271 burdens correlated with increased numbers of to tal T cells by 35% and 38%, of CD4+ T cells by 42% and 60%, and of CD8+ T cells by 85% and 96%, with th e magnitude of the increase in each T cell subpopulation correlating with th e duration of exposure\u2014either up to 10 years or more than 10 years, respectively (Moszczy ski et al., 1996). Although diagnoses of autoimmune disease and more direct markers of autoimmunity (e.g. autoantibody titres) were not studied in these cohorts, the increased num ber of T cells associat ed with occupational exposure to mercury vapour was proposed as a f actor contributing to autoimmune disease. This, generally, is in keeping with rodent studi es in which mercury promotes T cell expansion and T cell-dependent autoimmune disease. In contrast, He rrstr\u00f6m et al. (1994) found no significant change relative to controls in tota l T cells or T cell subsets in a population of Swedish teenagers with amalgam fillings who had average plasma mercury burdens of 3.2 \u00b5g/l. Moreover, Park et al. (2000) reported decreases in T lymphocyte subpopulations and NK cells in 20 fluorescent lamp makers who ha d urinary inorganic me rcury concentrations ranging from 1.8 to 163 \u00b5g/l. These studies dem onstrate alterations in immune measures associated with autoimmunity as well as data from general immune assays that provide some support for mercury-induced autoimmunity in humans. However, the above examples also demonstrate the inconsistencies characteristic of the literature investigating the incidence of human autoimmune disease associated with mercury exposure. Additional evidence of mercury-associated chan ges in general immune end-points is provided by changes in serum immunoglobulin levels report ed in various worker cohorts exposed to mercury. Here, again, the effects of mercury exposure on markers of humoral immunity are variable, but there is evidence of an effect at higher doses. For example, Herrstr\u00f6m et al. (1994) found no correlation betwee n mercury burden and levels of IgG, IgM, IgA or IgE. Similarly, no significant changes in plasma levels of IgG, Ig M or IgA were found in workers exposed to inorganic mercury resulting in a mean urinary mercury concentration of approx- imately 25 \u00b5g/g creatinine (Langworth et al., 1992). However, increases in serum IgG, IgA and IgM levels were found to be elevated in a cohort of 44 male workers exposed in a mercury-producing plant (Queiroz et al., 1994). These workers had ur inary mercury levels ranging from 3.5 to 68 \u00b5g/g creatinine (mean = 24.7 \u00b5g/g). Another study reported increased serum IgA and IgM levels in mercury-exposed workers with urinary me rcury concentrations of 29-545 \u00b5g/l (Benc ko et al., 1990). There are also a number of particularly contr oversial topics that surround the issue of mer- cury and human autoimmune disease. For exampl e, the potential contribution of dental amal- gam as a continuous source of mercury exposure to human diseases, including autoimmunity, remains a controversial topic. Th e fact that the vast majority of individuals with mercury- containing amalgam do not display an associ ation with any autoimmune disease argues strongly against amalgam as a source of mercur y contributing to diseas e incidence. Indeed, a large-scale retrospective c ohort study showed no associati ons between the number of mercury-containing fillings and adverse health effects, including autoimmunity (Bates et al., 2004), and no evidence of anti-glomerular base ment membrane IgG was found in individuals with mercury dental amalgam fillings relative to controls (Guzzi et al., 2008). However, another report provided a meta -analysis of dental amalgam exposure and development of multiple sclerosis, an organ- specific autoimmune disease (Aminzadeh & Etminan, 2007). In keeping with this, clinical benefit has b een reported following replacement of amalgam fillings in patients with systemic lupus eryt hematosus, thyroiditis or multiple sclerosis (Prochazkova et al., 2004; Sterzl et al., 2006). A second controversia l topic involves the potential for adverse health effects following ex posure to mercury as thimerosal in vaccines. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 272However, there are no human data that demonstrate frank autoimmunity or elements of auto- immune disease following exposure to thimerosal. In summary, as described above, the epidemio logical data provide some evidence that mercury exposure induces or exacerbates autoi mmune disease in humans. In particular, an association between mercury e xposure and autoimmune diseas e is supported by some case- control studies, aspects of autoimmune diseas e observed in mercury-exposed populations and reduced symptoms of systemic lupus erythemato sus, thyroiditis or multiple sclerosis follow- ing replacement of amalgam fillings. However, the database is notably lacking a definitive, large-scale epidemiological study evaluating me rcury exposure and elements of autoimmune disease. Human studies in which exposure cannot be definitively linked to mercury provide limited support because of the considerable unc ertainty in the relatio nship between mercury and the observed effect when there is co-exposur e to other chemicals linked to autoimmunity, as is the case with co-exposur e to pristane in the Dahlgren et al . (2007) study. The risk assessor has to determine whether the exposure questions for individual studies result in equivocal data. The available epidemiological data for mercury provide little information on autoimmune disease in humans and do not su pport a quantitative ri sk assessment. These human data add to the weight of evidence pr esented by substantial data supporting mercury- C5.3.1.2 Is there evidence that the chemical causes changes in disease incidence or progression in animal models of autoimmune disease? Yes. The case for a connection between mercury exposure and autoimmune disease has been solidified through extensive research using a va riety of rodent models. There is a large body of literature that supports a connection between mercury exposure and the induction of auto- immune disease as well as the pathogenesi s and progression of au toimmune disease in a variety of rodent models. Mercury induces de novo autoimmune disease in certain mouse and rat strains (Druet, 1995; Vas & Monestier, 2008; Schiraldi & et al., 2010). The features of HgIA differ between ra ts and mice, but both models share genetic susceptibility factors and an au toimmune etiology. Th e rat and mouse models of HgIA show that, in the context of susceptible MHC backgrounds (H-2 locus in mouse, RT-1 locus in rat), exposure to low doses of mercury in its vari ous forms is sufficient to induce autoimmune disease. In addition, mercury exposure in the context of non-mercury-susceptible MHC back- grounds, which may more closely approximate most human exposures, as a mercury- susceptible MHC haplotype in humans has not b een discovered, still app ears to contribute to autoimmune disease by acting with other intrinsi c and extrinsic cofactors, thereby increasing the risk of clinical disease progression. Numerous studies support the concept that merc ury exposure synergizes with other intrinsic (e.g. genetic) and extrinsic (e.g. immunogen) f actors to influence di sease pathogenesis and progression in susceptible mouse models. For example, lupus-pr one strains such as NZBWF1 or MRL+/+ injected subcutaneously with mercury(II) chloride (1.6 mg/kg body weight 3 times a week for 10 weeks) show accelerated age of onset of disease, including increased systemic autoantibody titres and renal immune complex deposition (Al-Balaghi et al., 1996; Pollard et al., 1999). An additiona l study (Pollard et al., 2001) examined the influence of mercury exposure and dosage on the expression of autoimmunity in lupus-prone BXSB mice. As with the findings with other lupus-prone mice, subcutaneous injection of mercury(II) chloride at doses of 0.04-40 \u00b5g/0.1 ml twice pe r week for 4 weeks increased the polyclonal a potential dose-response relati onship between mercury exposure and reported symptoms of induced autoimmunity in animal models, wh ich will be discussed below in section C5.3.1.2. Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 273 immunoglobulin levels and autoantibody titres to antinuclear and antichromatin antigens and accelerated pathological changes in the kidney attributable to the di sease in BXSB mice. Exposure assessment of the kidney mercury burden (range = ~76-3600 ng/g wet weight) showed that the mercury levels in the kidneys of these animals fell within the normal range found in non-occupationally exposed humans. Co llectively, these studies are useful in demonstrating mercury exacerbation of disease progression in animal models of autoimmune disease, but the risk a ssessor should note that the route of exposure (i njection) and form of mercury (inorganic mercury(II) chloride) utilized in these studies generally differ from the most prevalent human exposure scenario (oral exposure to organic mercury). Low levels of mercury have also been found to exacerbate disease in several models of acquired autoimmunity. For example, the parent into F 1 model of chronic graft-versus-host disease is a murine model of acq uired lupus-like autoimmune dise ase. The transfer of parent donor CD4+ T cells into the F 1 hosts results in the responsiven ess of the donor T cells to the host allo-antigens, thereby driving the autoreac tive immune response, resulting in polyclonal host B cell activation, auto antibody production, immune co mplex formation and renal deposition followed by glomerulonephritis . The parent (DBA/2) into B6D2F 1 pairing produces a severe and chronic disease, where morb idity and mortality are related to the extent of glomerulonephritis, which corre lates directly with the numb er of activated donor T cells transferred to the host. Donor T cells derived from mice administered inorganic mercury in low doses (defined as non-nephrotoxic doses of 20 or 200 \u00b5g/kg body weight injected every other day for 15 days) worsened the graft-vers us-host disease course, as characterized by histological evidence of more severe glomerulonephritis, accele rated appearance of protein- uria, elevated anti-single-stranded DNA autoanti bodies and accelerated mo rtality (Via et al., 2003). The implication of these findings is that exposure to inorganic me rcury might interact with other genetic and environmental risk fa ctors, thereby lowering the threshold for activated T cell autoreactivity and autoimmune dis ease in susceptible indi viduals (Via et al., 2003). In the collagen-induced arthritis disease model, another murine model of acquired auto- immunity, arthritis is induced by sensitization followed by chal lenge (typically 3 weeks later) with type II collagen injection. The arthritic disease is char acterized by joint swelling, syno- vial inflammation and infiltrati on of mononuclear cells, and th ese features are accompanied by elevated production of proinflammatory cyt okines and collagen-specific pathogenic anti- bodies of the IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses. The la ter stages of the disease involve overt and severe attributes of morbidit y, such as cartilage and bone er osion. The influence of mercury on the development and progression of collage n-induced arthritis was assessed through an experimental design that involve d injecting mercury(I I) chloride subcutan eously into DBA/1 mice at 1.6 mg/kg body weight every third day for a period of 4 weeks at various time points before, during and after the induction of colla gen-induced arthritis. When administered during and after collagen but not before, mercur y increased the severity of collagen-induced arthritis as scored observati onally, histologically and sero logically (Hansson et al., 2005). Analogous to the collagen-induced arthritis mode l, mercury(II) chloride injection has been shown to increase the severity and prevalence of autoimmune myocarditis in an animal model where injection with cardiac myosin peptide in adjuvant induces an inflammatory auto- immune disease (Nyland et al., 2004; Silbergeld et al., 2005). Taken toge ther, these studies suggest that mercury exposure functions as an environmental cofactor in autoimmune disease that promotes disease progression by acting du ring the induction and e ffector phases of the disease, thereby increasing the ri sks and severity of clinical disease in the presence of other genetic and immunological triggering events. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 274As mentioned above, mercury-induced autoimmune disease represents specialized and exper- imentally contrived models where exposure to mercury alone induces de novo systemic auto- immune disease in susceptible strains of mice and rats. Susceptibility to HgIA is mainly determined by the MHC genotype (i.e. the H-2 locus in the mouse and the RT-1 locus in the rat). Not surprisingly, the infl uence of genotype on HgIA has b een most studied in the mouse model, as the tools necessary for thorough immunogenetic analysis exist for this species. In susceptible strains of mice, HgIA is characterized by elevated levels of serum IgG1 and IgE as well as the generation and persistence of serum antinucleolar au toantibodies with high specificity to fibrillarin, a 34 kDa ribonuc leoprotein (Hultman et al., 1989, 1992, 1993). The antifibrillarin autoantibody response is under the control of the H-2 I-A locus; mice with H-2 haplotypes - s and -q develop strong antifibrillarin auto antibody titres and immune complexes accompanied by heavy granular IgG deposits in the renal mesangium and glomerulonephritis (Enestrom & Hultman, 1984; Hultman et al., ity to the develop- ment of antinucleolar autoantibodies clearly lies within the H-2 I-A locus, the magnitude, persistence and specific ity of the autoantibody response a ppear to be under the control of non-H-2 loci (Hultman et al., 1996). These non-H -2 genes contribute to the disease by con- trolling immunological factors (J ohansson et al., 1997; H\u00e4ggqvi st & Hultman, 2003), as as mercury toxicokinetics (Hultman & Niel sen, 1998; Ekstrand et al., 2010) and splenic mercury burden (Griem et al., 1997). The auto immune kidney damage associated with murine HgIA reportedly occurs at mercury body burdens similar to those reported in some occupationally exposed humans (Hultman & Enestrom, 1992). Although having a susceptible H-2 haplotype is a prerequisite for induction of antifibrillarin autoantibodies, there are properties of the merc ury dose-response relatio nship and thresholds that influence the development and progression of disease in HgIA. Certain attributes of the disease appear to show differential sensitivity to mercury dose. For example, the threshold for elevated IgE levels appears to be higher than that required for induc tion of antifibrillarin autoantibodies (Nielsen & Hultman, 2002). Thus, whereas IgE and antifibrillarin autoanti- bodies are characteristic marker s of development of autoimmune reactions following mercury exposure in susceptible strains, the mechanis ms underlying elevated IgE levels and produc- tion of antifibrillarin autoantibodies are likely to be distinct. Elevated IgE level appears to be induced by relatively short exposures to merc ury (e.g. 1-week exposure of 1 mg/l via the drinking-water), whereas prol onged exposure to mercury (i.e. 10-week exposure to 0.5 mg/l via the drinking-water resulting in renal merc ury burden as low as 1.1 \u00b5g/g wet weight in susceptible strains) favours indu ction of antifib rillarin autoantibodies. The interplay between genetics and exposure is also revealed in experiments comparing renal mercury burdens following various dosing regimens in mice with H-2 susceptible and non-susceptible strains of mice. These experiments demonstrate that th e toxicokinetics of inorganic mercury varies among mouse strains. Increasing the body and target organ burden of mercury does not supersede the prerequisite for having a suscep tible haplotype for induc tion of HgIA. Further- more, despite the presence of a susceptible ha plotype, there are thresholds below which no autoimmune reactions develop. Intraspecies vari ability in this threshold value is seen among different mouse strains with susceptible H- 2 haplotypes, which highlights the additional complexity of mercury burden interacting with genetic determinants outside the H-2 locus as well as other intrinsic or extrinsic factors. One complication for risk assessment is that ex posure for the bulk of the research performed with these animal models has been via subcut aneous injection of me rcury(II) chloride; how- ever, administration of mercury in forms and r outes that are more re levant to human expo- sures has also been shown to induce HgIA. Fo r example, mice with the MHC haplotype H-2 s Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 275 develop antinucleolar autoantibodi es targeting fibrillarin follow ing injection with methylmer- cury (Hultman & Hansson-Georgiadis, 1999) or exposure to methylmercury via the drinking- water (Havarinasab et al., 2007). In comparison with HgIA disease features following injec- tion with inorganic mercury, methylmercury i nduces a B cell response, a lower antinucleolar autoantibody titre and no systemic immune complex deposits. The weaker autoimmune response e licited by methylmercury app ears to be due to its immuno- suppressive activities; however, the immunos uppressive phase not preclude subsequent immunostimulation and deve lopment of autoimmune disease in suscep- tible strains of mice (H\u00e4ggqvist et al., 2005) . The demethylation of methylmercury by macrophage enzymatic activities is believed to le ad to the accumulation of inorganic mercury in lymphoid tissues (Havarinasab & Hultman, 2 005; Havarinasab et al., 2007). The role of transformation from an organic mercurial to the autoimmune dise ase-inducing inorganic form is also seen with the thimerosol, which is rapidly metabo- lized to ethylmercury. As an organomercuria l compound, thimerosal shares some of the immunosuppressive activities of methylmercury; however, perhaps because of the more rapid conversion of ethylmercury to inorganic mercur y, exposure of susceptible mice to thimerosal produces HgIA that more closely resembles th at induced by inorganic mercury (Havarinasab et al., 2004, 2005). Thimerosal treatment also accelerates the development of antinuclear antibodies and renal glomerul ar and systemic vessel wall immune complex deposits in autoimmune disease-prone NZBWF1 mice at lower doses of thimerosal than are required for HgIA in H-2s mice and within a theoretical dose range encountered through vaccination (Havarinasab & Hultman, 2006). HgIA, complete with high-titre antifibrillarin autoanti- bodies, immune complex deposition and glomerulonephritis, has been reported in H-2s mice exposed to mercury vapour under conditions wher e the exposure reportedly produced kidney mercury burdens relevant to occupationally exposed humans (Warfvinge et al., 1995). Finally, as another example where exposure pro duces HgIA, intraperitoneal implantation of dental amalgam into H-2s mice in a time- an d systemic immune complex deposits (Hultman et al., 1994). A human counterpart to murine HgIA has not been described. That is, no human HLA loci appear to impart susceptibility to mercury-indu ced frank autoimmune di sease, as MHC loci do in susceptible rodents. However, features of HgIA in mice may be relevant to low-level mercury exposure in humans. As in HgIA in rodents, autoantibodies to fibrillarin occur in some patients with systemic sclerosis and ot her autoimmune connective tissue diseases. As discussed above, a human epidemiological study has reported higher ur inary mercury excre- tion in antifibrillarin auto- antibody-negative subjects with systemic sclero sis and healthy contro ls. All subjects and controls in this report were within the \"nor mal\" range for urinary mercury excretion; how- ever, the findings suggest that exposure to merc ury might be a contributing factor in systemic sclerosis (Arnett et al., 2000). The first demonstration of HgIA in an animal model was repor ted in 1978 with the observa- tion that injection with mercury(II) chloride induced immune-type glomerulonephritis in Brown Norway rats (Druet et al., 1978). As w ith the murine model of HgIA, the induction of autoimmune disease in rats is strain specific, with susceptibility mapping to the rat RT-1 locus of the MHC class II comp lex. Brown Norway rats (RT-1 n) are highly susceptible, whereas Lewis strain rats (RT-1l) are resistant (Aten et al., 1991). Similar to the mouse model, mercury(II) chloride leads to polyclonal T and B cell activation, increased serum immunoglobulin levels, in cluding IgE, autoantibody prod uction and immune complex Harmonization Project Document No. 10 276deposition, accompanied by a biphasic glomerulonephr itis and proteinuria (Druet et al., 1977; Hirsch et al., 1982; Sapin et al ., 1984). Despite these similarities , the rat model is distinct in that the autoantibody specificities differ and ra ts spontaneously recover and develop resist- ance to further mercury-induced disease (Dubey et al., 1993; et al ., In the rat, autoantibody to phospholipids, DNA, glomerular basement membrane and lam- inin are found. The early phase of the diseas e manifests with linear deposition of anti- glomerular basement membrane autoantibodies. Later, immune complex granular IgG de- posits form, leading to the de velopment of nephritis (Druet et al., 1982). HgIA can be induced in Brown Norway rats by exposure to mercury vapour as well as by injection with mercury(II) chloride (Hua et al., 1993). Both vapour and injection pr oduce similar disease features and demonstrate autoimmune disease manifestation that is mercury dose dependent; however, the kidney content of mercury was sim ilar in all exposed gro ups. Rabbits injected with mercury(II) chloride reportedly develop au toimmune disease with features similar to those observed in Brown Norway rats (Roman-Franco et al., 1978). From a risk assessment perspective, the data set described above constitutes a large body of evidence supporting a connection between merc ury exposure and the induction of auto- immune disease as well as the pathogenesi s and progression of au toimmune disease in a variety of rodent models. Mercury induces de novo autoimmune disease in certain susceptible rodent strains, exacerbates the onset and/or sever ity of disease in severa l strains of genetically autoimmune disease-prone mi ce and exacerbates disease in several mouse models of acquired autoimmunity. These animal data presen t clear evidence of an effect of mercury on autoimmunity and support a do se-response relationship. In rode nt models, an increasing dose of mercury results in a greater autoimmune response as well as a greater accumulation of whole-body mercury levels and mercury deposition in target organs such as the kidney. Data support a threshold below which mercury exposure will not i nduce autoimmunity, even in susceptible rodent strains, and indicate that prolonged exposures to low doses of mercury are associated with accumulation of mercury in ta rget tissues prior to developing autoimmune responses (Nielsen & Hultman, 2002). Along with the limited human data described above in ated increase in autoimmune di sease incidence and progression. As described above in section C5.3.1.1, the huma n data contain considerable uncertainty owing to the general lack of e xposure data and the lack of a de finitive, large-scale epidemio- logical study evaluating mercury exposure and el ements of autoimmune disease. Therefore, human data are not available to evaluate a potential dose-response relationship between mercury exposure and reported symptoms of autoimmune disease in humans, and the available animal data should be used to deve lop a quantitative risk evaluation. The database of animal studies for mercury autoimmunity has tw o characteristics that need to be discussed in the context of developing a qua ntitative risk evaluation for human risk. First, as with other risk assessments, the use of data from the most relevant exposure route in humans is preferred, and therefore experi mental animal data from studi es involving oral exposure to mercury should be selected for the risk asse ssment over data from subcutaneous exposure studies. This is a particular issue for mercur y, because so many of the animal studies of mercury-induced autoimmunity involve parenter al exposure. Second, the use of animal data from autoimmune disease-prone rodent models needs to be considered explicitly in the uncertainty factors applied to the animal data in estimating human risk of mercury-induced autoimmunity. The application of these uncertainty factors will be discussed in detail below, good models of susceptible humans rather than the general population, and therefore the but as described in chapter 7 of the guidance document, these animal models are considered section C5.3.1.1, the animal data present a strong weight of evidence for a mercury-associ-Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 277 intraspecies uncertainty factor should generally be re duced from 10 to 1 when human risk is estimated from data obtained in au toimmune disease-prone rodents. The oral drinking-water study by Hultman an d Nielsen (study results reported in two publications: Hultman & Nielsen, 2001; Nielsen & Hultman, 2002) provides the lowest effect level from animal data by a relevant route of exposure with a clear dose-response rela- tionship (see Table C5.1 for a summary of ex posure and effects data) and therefore was selected for the quantitative risk assessment. The LOAEL from the studies was 0.5 mg/l for mercury(II) chloride in drinking-water for 10 w eeks in male and female A.SW mice, and the effect was increased titre of antifibrillarin autoantibodies. The 0.25 mg/l dose of mercury(II) chloride represented a NOAEL in female A.SW mice, and a no-effect level was not deter- mined in males, because the lowest dose test ed in males was 0.5 mg/l (Hultman & Nielsen, 2001). It is important to note that the end-point selected (incr eased antifibrillarin autoanti- bodies) is an end-point that represents a rela tively early effect in the etiology of mercury- induced or mercury-exacerbated autoimmunity in these mice. Antifibrillarin autoantibodies are considered an adverse effect, although there are other effects, such as immune complex deposition, that are more closely related to a clearly adverse outcome (i.e. renal damage). Table C5.1: Mercury accumulation in male and female A.SW mice after drinking-water exposure to mercury(II) chloride for 10 weeks. Sex Dose (mg/l) AFA positive/ total AFA reciprocal titre Renal mercury accumulation (\u00b5g/g wet weight) Splenic mercury accumulation (\u00b5g/g wet weight) Whole- 0.25 mg/l was the NOAEL for autoantibodies to nuclear protein fibrillarin in females. b 0.5 mg/l was the LOAEL for autoantibodies to nucl ear protein fibrillarin in males and females. c The authors reported that one male mouse had an extremely high AFA titre (10 240) that was not observed in any other mouse, regar dless of dose level. Sources: Hultman & Nielsen (200 1); Nielsen & Hultman (2002) The duration of dosing had an effect on the obser vation of an autoimmune response, with the 0.5 mg/l dose of mercury producin g antifibrillarin autoantibodi es only after 10 weeks of exposure and having no effect in males or females following 2.5 weeks of mercury exposure (Hultman & Nielsen, 2001; Nielsen & Hultma n, 2002). The incidence of autoantibodies in each exposure group increased with increasing dose from two of eight individuals of each sex at 0.5 mg/l to eight out of eight of each sex at higher doses (see Tabl e C5.1). The increase in Harmonization Project Document No. 10 278antifibrillarin autoantibody titre also displaye d a dose-response relationship females; however, the data for antifibrillarin autoantibody titre did not display a dose-response rela- tionship in male mice. The auth ors explained the lack of a dos e-response relationship in the male mice as an exception caused by one male mouse at the 0.5 mg/l dose exhibiting an extremely high antifibrillarin autoantibody titre that was not observed in any other mouse, regardless of dose level (Nielsen & Hultman, 2002). The study utilized mercury(II) chloride labelled with a gamma-emitting isotope and therefore provided direct data on the admin-istered dose (mg/l drinking-wate r) as well as internal dose reflecting the steady-state 1 whole- body retention of mercury, splenic mercury ac cumulation and renal mercury accumulation Although various authors (e.g. Nielsen & Hultman, 1999; Pollard et al., 2001) have used the principal organ of mercury accumula tion as well as a principal site for toxic effects, the most appropriate dose metric for induction of autoi mmunity or specific effects such as anti- fibrillarin autoantibody is unknown. Griem et al. (1997) hypothesized that splenic mercury may be the best dose metric for induction of mercury-induced autoimmunity because they found a higher correlation betw een splenic mercury accumulation and susceptibility to mer- cury(II) chloride-induced autoim munity across mouse strains co mpared with other measures, including blood, liver and kidney levels of mercury. Use of a PBTK model would help estimate human risk from an internal dose metric such as blood or tissue levels of mercury from the animal data if the model had validat ed toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic parameters. Although there are toxicokinetic models for merc ury distribution and elimination in humans and rodents (Nordberg & Skerfving, 1972; Be rnard & Purdue, 1984; Ca rrier et al., 2001a,b; Berlin et al., 2007), there is no accepted model at present (Berlin et al., 2007; Ekstrand et al., 2010). A more comprehensive risk assessment shoul d carefully reconsider the utility of the available toxicokinetic models to inform a hu man health risk assessment and extrapolate relevant human internal and external doses a ssociated with increased risk of autoimmunity from the available animal data. However, th at is beyond the scope of this case-study; therefore, this example is ba sed on oral exposure and provid es a brief discussion of the internal dose data on the spleen, kidney and w hole-body retention that should be considered by the risk assessor. The data on internal dose are only useful for quantification with a validated PBTK model. The 0.5 mg/l LOAEL needs to be converted to units of mg/kg body weight for standard calculations of a POD and the estimation of th e reference value. The mg/kg body weight dose can be calculated from the drinking-water dos e by multiplying the mercury concentration in drinking-water by the average water intake and dividing by the average body weight, as follows: Female LOAEL = 0.5 mg/l \u00d7 (0.0029 2 (0.018 35 kg body weight) = 0.079 mg/kg body weight per day 1 Steady-state levels of mercury in mice are reached in 3-5 weeks of exposure (N ielsen & Hultman, 2002). 2 The following dose information for the A.SW mouse is from personal correspondence with J.B. Nielsen: Average water intake = 2.9 ml (female) and 3.3 ml (male). Mean body weight of 17.1-19.6 g (female) at start of experiment and after last dose; mean body weight of 19.8-24.4 g (male) at start of experiment and after last dose (10-20 weeks). Therefore, the average weight of females = 18.35 g ((17.1 + 19.6)/2) and of males = 22.1 ((19.8 + 24.4)/2). (see Table C5.1). kidney dose as a potential dose metric for merc ury-induced autoimmunity because kidney is a Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 279 Male LOAEL = 0.5 mg/l \u00d7 (0.0033 l/day) / (0.0221 kg weight) body weight per day LOAEL = 0.08 mg/kg body weight per da y in both sexes, rounded to one significant digit Female NOAEL = 0.25 mg/l \u00d7 (0.0029 l/day) / (0.018 35 kg body weight) = 0.0395 mg/kg body weight per day NOAEL = 0.04 mg/kg body weight per day, rounded to one significant digit To continue the illustrati on of this case-study, the ad justed NOAEL of 0.04 mg/kg body weight per day for mercury(II) chloride fr om the Hultman and Nielsen study (Hultman & Nielsen, 2001; Nielsen & Hultman, 2002) will be used to derive the health-based guidance apply BMD modelling to the data to derive a POD near the low end of the available data. For the purposes of this case-study, the NOAEL will be used as the POD rather than selecting a model and performing the calculations, but th e BMD is generally the preferred method. The next step in the risk assessment process is the application of uncertainty factors, as The intraspecies uncertainty factor would be 1, because the data used to determine human risk were from an autoimmune di sease-prone rodent model. These animal models are considered good models of sus ceptible humans rather than the general population. Therefore, the intras pecies uncertainty factor should generally be reduced from 10 to 1 when human risk is estima ted from data obtained in autoimmune mercury induction or exacerbation of autoim munity are from susceptible strains, because the interplay between genetic susceptibility, exposure and other environ-mental factors appears to be particularly important for mercury-induced autoimmunity (Fourni\u00e9 et al., 2001). As de scribed above, researchers have begun to identify the genetic and mechanistic bases for some of the susceptible rodent strains, which include toxicokinetic differences that resu lt in higher organ burdens of mercury in these strains. Furthermore, because animal data suggest that accumulation of mercury (whole body or levels in targ et organs such as the kidney) is directly related to autoimmune response, toxicoki netic variation in humans is likely to be associated with susceptibility. Although similar gene-e nvironment interactions are expected for human susceptibility to mercury, there are no data on potential variations in human susceptibility to mercury immunotoxi city (Silbergeld et al., 2005). The interspecies uncertainty factor would be 10 to extrapolate from experimental animal data to human risk. The use and time factor would be 10 for a chronic exposure assessment, as the study length was 10 weeks, below the 2-year study generally considered chronic. Applica- tion of this uncertainty factor depends on the scope defined in the problem formula- tion stage of the risk assessment (e.g. chr onic, subchronic, acute); an uncertainty factor of 1 would be applied for a subc hronic risk assessment. The animal data suggest that mercury reaches a steady state internally with con tinuous exposure in 3-5 weeks (Nielsen & Hultman, 2002), and droppi ng or reducing the chronic uncertainty factor should be considered. However, the data utilized for the risk assessment are disease-prone rodents (see chapter 7 for furt her discussion). Most animal data on value or reference value. As described in chapter 3 (section 3.3.7.3), the risk assessor should described in section 3.3.10 in general and section 7.10 with reference to autoimmunity: Harmonization Project Document No. 10 280from a 10-week exposure period, and there are no chronic exposure data on animals of this strain and examining these end-point s (antifibrillarin autoantibody) to confirm that the subchronic uncertainty factor could be reduced. The database uncertainty factor would be 1, because the database for mercury induction or exacerbation of au toimmunity is extensive. There is some weakness to the database in regards to relevant routes of exposure, as the majority of the data are from parenteral studies, and therefore the e ffects of oral exposure to mercury are less well studied. However, sufficient studies ar e available for oral exposure to mercury that include low doses and establish no-e ffect levels for mercury-induced auto- immunity. To complete the derivation of a health-based gui dance value or reference value, the guidance recommends consideration of groups at risk (i .e. children, elderly and genetically susceptible individuals) and then dividing the POD by the total uncertainty factor described above. For this autoimmunity and autoimmune disease case-study, the consideration of susceptible disease-prone rodents are considered a good model of humans susceptible to mercury- induced autoimmunity. Therefore, the use of add itional adjustments for susceptible life stages or human populations is genera lly not warranted unless chemi cal-specific data indicate an increased risk for a particular population. An additional consideration may be warranted for susceptible life stages because there may be a general increased risk for autoimmunity in older individuals linked to a modulation in adaptive immunity (see Hakim & Gress, 2007, potential susceptibility for me rcury-induced autoimmunity. The use of data from the auto- immune disease-prone mice is assumed to acc ount for the full range of susceptible human life stages and populations. In light of the observation that most autoimmu ne diseases are sex-biased towards females, sex is another important intrinsic factor to consider in association with environmental exposures, including to mercury. In the murine HgIA model, although males and females are both susceptible (given appropria te H-2 haplotype), females exhi bit higher sensitivity, which manifests as a lower threshold for induction of antifibrillarin autoantibodies as well as higher responsivity. Therefore, the possibility of a gr eater sensitivity to mercury-induced auto- immunity in women is supported by data from anim al models in the abse nce of human data to inform this potential sex bias in susceptibility. Ho wever, in this case, the data are from female mice and the LOAEL was identical for male and female A.SW mice, so the consideration of sex differences is not warranted. The data above apply to mercury(II) chloride, because the animal data used in the quanti- fication are from experiments in which the an imals were exposed to mercury(II) chloride. These data can be used to deve lop reference values for exposure to mercury(II) chloride, or they can be adjusted to derive a referen ce value for inorganic mercury based on certain assumptions. For example, the USEPA (1995) and California Environmental Protection Agency (2000) derive oral refe rence values for inorganic merc ury based on animal data from mercury(II) chloride exposure studies. The dose conversion applied for the USEPA and California Environmental Protection Agency a ssessments is to multiply by 0.739 to convert from the mercury in merc ury(II) chloride to Hg 2+ by weight. populations is particularly important. As desc ribed above and in chapter 7, the autoimmune and discussion in section 7.8 of chapter 7), bu t there are no human data to inform this Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 281 Using the above values, the to tal uncertainty fact or applied for a risk assessment for derivation of a chronic reference value for me rcury would be 100 (1 for intraspecies, 10 for interspecies, 10 for subchronic to chronic and 1 for database). For the chronic risk assessment of autoimmunity associated with mercury(II) chloride: Reference value = 0.04 mg of mercury(II) chloride per kilogram body weight per day \u00f7 100 = 0.0004 mg of mercury(II) chlo ride per kilogram body weight per day For the chronic risk assessment of autoimm unity associated with inorganic mercury: Reference value = 0.04 mg of mercury(II) chloride per kilogram body weight per day = 0.0003 mg of inorganic mercur y per kilogram body weight per day The reference values derived from the LOAEL of 0.5 mg of mercury(II ) chloride per litre (0.08 mg/kg body weight per day) in male and female A.SW mice and the NOAEL of 0.25 mg of mercury(II) chloride per litre (0.04 mg /kg body weight per day) in female A.SW mice for antifibrillarin autoantibodies are supporte d by a number of studie s in the l iterature presented previously. In particular, the LOAEL is slightly lower than, but consistent with, a LOAEL of 1.25 mg of mercury(II) chloride per litre cury(II) chloride per litre in dr inking-water for 10 weeks in fe male SJL mice for induction of antinucleolar antibodies reported by Hultman & Enestrom (1992). The Hultman and Nielsen study (Hultman & Nielsen, 2001; Nielsen & Hultman, 2002) al so reported antinucleolar antibody data with a LOAEL of 1.0 mg of me rcury(II) chloride per litre and a NOAEL of 0.5 mg of mercury(II) chloride per litre in drinking-water for 10 weeks in male and female A.SW mice as well as female B10.S mice. Ther efore, the mercury-induced antifibrillarin autoantibodies represent the most sensitive end-point for autoimmunity in the most sensitive strain and are supported by other animal data. The inductions of antifibrillarin and antinucleol ar antibodies by mercury are end-points that represent relatively early effects in the etiol ogy of mercury-induced or mercury-exacerbated autoimmunity in these mice. Data are also av ailable on end-points more closely related to clearly adverse outcomes. In general, these effect s are associated with a slightly higher level of mercury exposure. For example, the LOAEL fo r increased renal deposits of IgG in female SJL mice given mercury(II) chloride in dri nking-water for 10 weeks was 5 mg/l, with a NOAEL of 2.5 mg/l (Hultman & Enestrom, 1992). The 5 mg/l dose was also associated with glomerular llary cell hyperplasia and tubular atrophy. Data from Hultman & Nielsen (2001) and Nielse n & Hultman (2002) also support the same LOAEL for renal IgG deposits in female A.SW mice under the same 10-week drinking-water exposure regimen. As described previously, many of the animal data on mercury-induced autoimmunity are from experiments in which mercury was admini stered subcutaneously. Data from subcutane- ous exposure studies in rodents can be used to support the risk asse ssment qualitatively, but they are generally not used for quantitative ri sk evaluations because of the failure of the parenteral exposure route to pass through the di gestive tract or lung, as with the relevant Harmonization Project Document No. 10 282human oral or inhalation exposur e. The potential utility of pare nteral studies to support the risk assessment is illustrated by the following consideration of the autoantibody data in BXSB mice. Pollard et al. (2001) demonstrated in BXSB mice th at subcutaneous exposure at doses down to 0.4 \u00b5g of mercury(II) chloride given twice per week for 40 weeks increased autoantibody titres to antichromatin antigens (from 3.74 \u00b1 2.02 in controls to 10.70 \u00b1 4.10 in treated mice) and increased prot einuria by more than 2-fold. Higher doses resulted in a more rapid increase in autoantibody titr es over the 40 weeks of exposur e, but resulted in similar titres. Obviously, these subcutaneous data canno t readily be converted to an estimated daily oral exposure, because compounds administered via the parenteral route do not enter the digestive tract or lung, as with the relevant hum an oral or inhalation exposure, and therefore parenteral exposure has unknown effects on the toxicokinetics, includ ing absorption, excre- tion and biotransformation. Noting these differences and the abse nce of an appropriate PBTK model, comparison of the internal dose at th e LOAEL between oral and parenteral exposures may provide some insight for a relevant intern al dose metric. The subcutaneous exposure in Pollard et al. (2001) resulted in a mean mercury level in the kidney of 0.0762 \u00b1 0.006 \u00b5g/g wet weight at the chlo ride \u00b5g of mercury(II) chloride in female BXSB mice. The kidney level of mercury in the female BXSB mice at the LOAEL (0.66 \u00b5g/g wet weight) is compar- able to the concentration reported in fema le A.SW mice at the LOAEL (0.71 \u00b5g/g wet weight) and suggests the potential utility of this dose metric. As described above, there is some support for the use of the kidney concentration as a dose metric, but the most appropriate dose metric for induction of autoimmunity or specific effects such as antifibrillarin autoan tibodies is unknown. Theref ore, the risk assesso r is left to com- pare the animal data on oral dos e and internal metrics from the above quantitative risk evalu- ation with known human exposure levels to develop a margin of exposure and evaluate human risk. The internal dose metrics such as ki dney levels of mercury can also be used for comparisons with human exposure. Most notabl e in these comparisons is that the kidney levels of mercury in A.SW mice associated with induction of an tifibrillarin autoantibodies of 0.71-27.3 \u00b5g/g wet kidney tissue are within the ra nge of those in non-occupationally exposed humans (i.e. non-detectable to 2.1 \u00b5g/g wet ki dney tissue) (Nylander et al., 1987; Barreg\u00e5rd et al., 1999). C5.3.1.3 Is there evidence that the chemical alters immune measures associated with autoimmunity (i.e. autoantibody levels, inflammatory markers, regulatory T cells, lymph node proliferation, etc.) in animal models of autoimmune disease? Yes. There are many examples of mercury modula tion of immune end-points associated with autoimmunity. Numerous studies present data on autoantibody production associated with mercury exposure. Although the majority of auto antibody data are from rodent strains that are susceptible to HgIA, a few st udies also reported induction of antinucleolar autoantibodies following mercury exposure in outbred strains (e.g. ICR, NMRI and Black Swiss mice; Abedi-Valugerdi, 2009). The PLNA provides additional evidence of an autoimmune- associated end-point. Mercury produces a we ll-characterized positive response in the PLNA in a number of mouse strains (Stiller-Winkler et al., 1988), such that mercury has been used as a control in evaluating the potential for ot her metals to induce autoimmunity and hyper- sensitivity (Carey et al., 2006). There is al so limited evidence that mercury exposure is associated with proinflammatory cytokine re lease; however, there is no clear pattern of cytokine production across sus ceptible or outbred rodent strains (reviewed in Vas & Monestier, 2008). In the mercury model of auto immunity in rodents, the polyclonal B cell Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 283 activation ultimately responsible for the immunopa thology is widely believed to be due to a selective stimulation of Th2 cells (Badou et al., 1997). In this model, upregulation of IL-4 expression has been shown in response to mercury treatmen t both in vivo and in vitro in rodents (Gillespie et al., 1995; Badou et al., 1997; H\u00e4ggqvist & Hultman, 2001) and following in vitro treatment of human periphe ral blood mononuclear cells (De Vos et al., 2007; Hemdan et al., 2007). However, the importa nce of an imbalance of Th1 and Th2 in the susceptibility to mercury-mediated autoimmun ity has been called into question (Kono et al., 1998), and mercury-induced autoimmune disease and IL-4 production have been dissociated from each other (Bagenstose et al., 1998). Hen ce, despite a well-esta blished literature supporting the syst emic autoimmunity is a prototypic Th2- mediated disease, the cellular immune mech anisms underlying the disease process are not understood as clearly as they previously were thought to be . Furthermore, although some progress has been made in understanding the biochemical signalling mechanisms mediating the effects of mercury on Th2 cells (Badou et al., 1997), many of the details concerning the molecular components directly or indirectly targeted by mercury are essentially unknown. Irrespective of the data showing that IL-4 is not required for the antifibrillarin autoantibody response, IL-4 is required for the elevated Ig E and IgG1 response characteristic of mercury- susceptible mouse strains (Ochel et al., 1991). As described above, there are many examples of mercury-related changes in immune measures associated with autoimmunity, in cluding increased auto antibody levels in non- autoimmune disease-prone mice and a positive response in the PLNA. These data alone present some evidence of an effect of mercury on autoimmun ity. For the purposes of illus- tration, a risk assessor faced wi th evaluating a data set restricted to these immune measures associated with autoimmunity could conclude that there was a potential for mercury to induce or exacerbate autoimmunity. However, even as an exercise, it is difficult to separate these data from the larger database of mercury e ffects and mercury-induced changes in immune measures reported in animal models of autoimm une disease, because so many of the data on mercury immunotoxicity are from susceptible rodent strains. The indication that mercury alters immune measures associat ed with autoimmunity contribut es to the weight of evidence C5.3.1.2 above. Considered together, these data support the human epidemiological data and the large database from rodent models of autoi mmune disease, resulting in a solid weight of evidence for a mercury-associated increase in autoimmune disease incidence and progression. C5.3.1.4 Is there evidence from general or observational immune assays (lymphocyte phenotyping, cytokines, complement, lymphocyte proliferation, etc.) that the chemical has the potential to modulate autoimmune disease? Yes. There are examples of mercury-induced ch anges in general immune assays; however, the data provide limited direct support to th e hypothesis that mercury has the potential to modulate autoimmunity. Numerous rodent studies demonstrat e that exposure to mercury induces changes in immune cell populations, cytokine secretion, selective T cell proliferation (generally CD4+ and, to a lesser extent, CD 8+ T cells), polyclonal B cell activation, hyper- gammaglobulinaemia and other end-points (revi ewed in Vas & Monestier, 2008). These effects are consistent with a role in autoimm unity, because they are supported by mechanistic studies in autoimmune disease-prone rodents and illustrate how mercury exposure affects self-tolerance, thereby promoting autoimmunit y. For example, Laiosa et al. (2007) showed that in BALB/cJ mice exposed to mercury(II) chloride at 10 mg/l ad libitum via drinking- water for 2 weeks, attenuation of pro-apoptotic signalling due to merc ury exposure may be a that mercury induces and exacerbates auto immunity, outlined in sections C5.3.1.1 and Harmonization Project Document No. 10 284factor contributing to autoreac tive T cell activation. However, th e predictive value of changes in lymphocyte cell subpopulations, cytokines or signalling pathways for chemically induced autoimmunity is unclear, and these data woul d provide equivocal s upport for autoimmunity without the larger database of mercury-indu ced changes in immune measures reported in animal models of autoimmune disease. The da ta set of mercury-associated changes from general immune assays does support and inform ot her aspects of the risk assessment, such as susceptible populations or life stages (i.e. grea ter sensitivity of females and the developing animal). Pilones et al. (2009) showed that in utero exposure to mercury(II) chloride (drinking-water at 10 mg/l ad libitum for the duration of ge station) induced phenotypic changes in the immune cells of F 1 progeny. Thymic and splenic tissues harvested at 10 weeks of age to assess T cell phenotypes and functio n showed a significant reduction in splenic CD4+CD25+ cells in mercury-exposed fema le, but not male, mice. Concanavalin A- stimulated splenocytes from mercury-exposed mi ce showed significant in creases in prolifera- tive responses relative to cells from control mice, regardless of sex. Cytokine secretion was also modulated, with concanavalin A-stimulated being in creased in splenocytes from mercury-exposed mice. The potential for li fe stage-related and sex-associated sensitiv- ity to mercury-induced autoimmunity is discusse d in greater detail abov e in the quantitative Although the database of mercur y-associated immune changes includes a number of general immune assays, these data alone provide eq uivocal evidence for mercury-induced auto- immunity. In the absence of the considerable database of mercury-induced changes in end- points associated with autoimmunity from animal models of autoimmune disease, this type of immune data would suggest immunomodulatio n and would not be definitive for auto- immunity. Lymphocyte proliferation or cytoki ne data alone would identify a data gap suggesting the need for more conclusive au toimmunity and functional immune assays. As such, the data could be used to support the need for additional studies in animal models of autoimmune disease to determine autoimmune pot ential as well as func tional immune assays to test for immunosuppression or immunostimula tion. Of course, the equivocal nature of out of context and for purposes of illustration. In fact, some of the data on these general immune assays were collected as part of m echanistic studies to characterize the MOA for autoimmune effects induced by mercury exposure. The reality is that the database supporting mercury-associated autoimmunity includes a la rge database of autoimmune-related effects immune assays add to the considerable we ight of evidence for mercury-induced auto- immunity. C5.3.1.5 Is there histopathological evidence (t hymus, etc.) or are there changes in immune organ weights or haematological changes that suggest that the chemical causes an immune response against self (i.e. immune complex deposition, inflammatory cell infiltrates)? Yes. The main histopathological evidence from the mercury immunotoxicity database that supports autoimmunity comes from studies that investigated and reported immune complex deposition. Direct immunostaining for same-speci es IgG (i.e. staining for rat IgG along renal capillary walls and basement membranes in merc ury-exposed rats) has been used to detect autoimmune response to mercury in autoimmu ne disease-prone rats such as the Brown Norway and MAXX strains (Henry et al., 1988). Mercury exposure is associated with risk assessment presen ted in section C5.3.1.2. reported in animal models of autoimmune di sease (see section C5.3.1.2) , numerous examples these data is largely due to the fact that we are evaluating th e lymphocyte proliferation data of immune measures associated with auto immune disease (see section C5.3.1.3) and limited evidence from human epidemiological studies (see section C5.3.1.1). The data from general Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 285 development of autoantibodies that result in immunoglobulin deposits in the renal basement membranes of rabbits, mice and rats. Similar deposits of IgG have been observed in the basement membranes of the spleen, liver, adrena l glands, heart and intest ine in rats (reviewed in Bigazzi, 1999). Granular de posits of IgM, IgG1, IgG2a and Ig3 antibodies have been identified in the renal mesangi um of mercury-injected NZBW F1 mice (Abedi-Valugerdi et al., 1997). Data that demonstrate the accumulati on of immune complexes in various tissues rise to the level of providing some evidence of autoimmunity if the immune complexes are chemical-induced autoimmunity. Among the many histopathological studies reporting mercury-induced immune deposits, there are nume rous examples that identify autoantibodies. Therefore, in this case, the histopathology data set includes specific support for auto- immunity. This level of specificity is unlikely to be obtained from routine haematoxylin and eosin staining of paraffin-fixed tissue, and ther efore it is unlikely that the risk assessor would be provided with this level of support from routine histopathological observations. The identification and characterization of antibodi es in immune deposits would require more targeted techniques, including immunohistochemi stry on appropriately fixed and prepared tissues. As discussed above, the data set of histopat hological evidence in immune tissues following mercury exposure includes specif ic demonstration of autoantibod ies; therefore, these data alone provide some evidence for mercury-induced autoimmunity. The da ta set also provides mechanistic data suggesting an MOA. The da tabase supporting mercury-associated auto- immunity includes a large number of studies reporting autoimmune-rela ted effects observed immune-related histopathological evidence describe d above adds to the considerable weight of evidence for mercury- induced autoimmunity. C5.3.2 Weight of evidence conclusions for hazard characterization The individual discussions of different types of autoimmune data for mercury in sections toxicity, but rather provide an illustrative example to outline the process for conducting an The weight of evidence conclusions for autoimm unity should also describe the database in terms of consistency and biological plausibility , including strengths, weaknesses, uncertain- ties and data gaps. Studies in autoimmune diseas e-prone A.SW mice exposed to mercury(II) chloride weeks (Hultman & Ni elsen, 2001; Nielsen & Hultman, 2002) provide the lowest mercury exposure levels associated with autoimmunity. Ther efore, because they represent the lowest effect levels, these data would be used to derive a POD in the quanti- tative risk assessment of mercury-induced au toimmunity. The procedur es and calculations necessary to develop a reference value from the Hultman & Nielsen (2001) and Nielsen & Hultman (2002) data are presented above in section C5.3.1.2, includin g the application of assessment of autoimmunity following the guidance from chapter 7.

As discussed in section C5.3.1.3 above and section 7.7.1 of chapter 7, th e presence of autoantibodies provides some evidence of in animal models of autoimmune disease (see section C5.3.1.2), numerous examples of immune measures associated with autoimmune disease (s ee section C5.3.1.3) and limited evidence from human epidemiological studies (see section C5.3.1.1).

Calculations from the NOA EL are used to illustrate the process, although BMD modelling would probably be used for a fu ll risk assessment, as it is the preferred assessment, such as a discussion of groups at risk, MOA and the selection of the appropriate brief discussion of the consistency and stre ngths of the database for mercury-induced autoimmunity. A full risk assessment would ge nerally include an expanded discussion of these points, data gaps and the associated unc ertainties. For example, the human data do support the relevance of the experimental anim al data, because the epidemiological data provide evidence that mercury exposure induces or exacerbates autoimmune disease in humans. The full risk assessment would detail these effects and the potential relationship between the laboratory animal data and effects in humans, such as symptoms of systemic large-scale epidemiological study evaluating me rcury exposure and elements of autoimmune The weight of evidence discussion would reflec t the relatively strong c onfidence in the data set described above and highlight the support from autoimmune-related effects observed in induced autoimmunity and support the drinking-w ater studies in autoimmune disease-prone mice (Hultman & Nielsen, 2001; Niel sen & Hultman, 2002) as principal studies appropriate for derivation of PODs and dose-response assessment of autoimmunity associ- ated with mercury. C5.4 Conclusions This case-study of mercury-rela ted autoimmunity and autoimmune disease is a demonstration of the application of the risk assessment guidance for the assessment of autoimmunity and of the strong database of the effects of mercury exposure in animal models of autoimmune disease as well as the epidemiological data re lating to potential effects in humans. The case- study illustrates the limitations often encountered in evalua ting epidemiological data (e.g. small sample sizes or co-exposure issues) and important issues in relating experimental animal data to human risk. The use of animal data from an autoimmune disease-prone rodent model required particular consid eration in the quantitative risk assessment. These animal models of autoimmunity are c onsidered good models of sensit ive subpopulations of humans rather than the general populati on, and therefore the intrasp ecies uncertainty factor was reduced in the quantitative risk assessment of mercury-related autoim munity and autoimmune disease. It should be noted that this cas e-study on mercury is provided w ith the purpose of illustrating how the risk assessment guidance can be used fo r assessing the risk of autoimmunity, but it does not represent a comprehensive risk assess ment, nor does it represent a final regulatory position. autoimmune disease presented in chapter 7 of this document.

Toxicology and C6.1 Introduction Exposure to trichloroethylene (TCE) has been associated with multiple forms of immuno- toxicity, including suppression, hypersensitivity and auto immunity. The overwhelming majority of immune studies on TCE have exam ined autoimmune-related end-points. A large number of epidemiological studi es have suggested that TCE, or at least organic solvent exposure in workers, is associ ated with systemic sclerosis and seve ral other autoimmune diseases. This is balanced by an equally large number of experimental studies reporting that TCE exposure is associated w ith stimulation or exacerbation of end-points linked to auto- immunity in animal models of autoimmune disease. This case-study illustrates the use of the risk assessment guidance provided for the assess- as a case-study because there is a relatively large database of studies in both humans and animals that have explored the relationship between TCE and autoimmunity. The case-study for TCE illustrates a risk assessment that relies on animal data for quantification because the epidemiological data supporting the relations hip between TCE and au toimmune disease lack good exposure data (as is often the case for human studies). The risk assessment of TCE begins with a brie f summary of the available evidence for auto- immunity associated with TCE. The weight of evidence conclusions that TCE exposure is associated with autoimmunity or autoimmune disease are then developed by following the guidance presented in chapter 7 for the assess ment of autoimmunity. The case-study is not meant to be a full risk assessment of the health effects associated with exposure to TCE. Rather, the following assessment is provided to illustrate the process for conducting a risk analysis of TCE-associated autoimmunity by considering the available human, experimental animal and mechanistic data required to do so. C6.2 Background: data on the pot ential for trichloroethylene to induce or exacerbate autoimmunity TCE has been used extensively as an industria l degreasing agent and is commonly detected as a pollutant in ambient air, water supplies and soil (USEPA, 2011). Studies dating back to the late 1970s have reported an association between human e xposure to organic solvents, including TCE, and development of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic sclerosis, con- nective tissue disease, multiple sclerosis, va sculitis (with increased antineutrophil cyto- plasmic antibodies) and rheumatoid arthritis. The human data demonstrating the strongest association between TCE exposure (or general so lvent exposure) and autoimmune disease are for systemic sclerosis. For animal models, the ma jority of data are in the MRL+/+ mouse, an autoimmune disease-prone strain. Khan et al. (1995) published the first studies of TCE- associated autoimmunity in an animal model (female MRL+/+ mice) to clarify the role of TCE in autoimmune responses. High doses (10 mmol/kg body weight) of TCE via intra- peritoneal injections were associated with autoantibody formation in the Khan et al. (1995) study. A number of subsequent st udies have examined mechanisms of action and, to a lesser extent, dose levels for TCE-associated au toimmune effects in the MRL+/+ mouse. ment of autoimmunity and autoimmune disease as presented in chapter 7. TCE was selected Harmonization Project Document No. 10 294The underlying mechanism of TCE-stimulated autoimmune phenomena remains elusive, but specific T cell stimulation or inhibition of i nduction of apoptosis in these cells may be involved (Gilbert et al., 2006). This is undersco red by findings in autoimmune disease-prone MLR+/+ mice, in which TCE exposure stimulat es Th1 cells and exac erbates the lupus-like symptoms that these mice express (Khan et al ., 1995; Griffin et al ., 2000b; Wang et al., 2009). In addition, experimental animal studies have demonstrated that TCE is metabolized into reactive intermediates that form protein adducts and can also induce inducible nitric oxide synthase-dependent oxidation of proteins. Each event may give rise to neoantigens, culminating in autoimmunity as well as in allergic phenomena (Buben & O'Flaherty, 1985; Griffin et al., 2000a; Wang et al., 2009). C6.3 Assessment of the potentia l for trichloroethylene to induce autoimmunity C6.3.1 Application of the weight of evidence approach to assessment of risk for autoimmunity\", that is intended to aid in or ganizing and evaluating immunotoxicity data from strong to weak evid ence of significant risk for autoimmunity and autoimmune disease. The wei ght of evidence c onclusions developed by answering these questions summarize the hazard identification for autoimmunity and should describe the database in terms of consistency and biologic al plausibility, includi ng strengths, weaknesses, uncertainties and data gaps. When autoimmunity is indicated by the weight of evidence, the data are brought forward for dose-response asse ssment beginning with selection of the most appropriate end-point(s) (critica l effects) and developing PODs. The questions from chapter 7 are reproduced and answered below, follo wed by a discussion of the supporting immuno- toxicity data. C6.3.1.1 Are epidemiological studies, clinical studies or case-studies available that provide human data on end-points relevant to chemical-induced autoimmunity (i.e. increased incidence of all or specific autoimmune diseases, changes in immune parameters indicative of autoimmunity, increased levels of autoant ibodies, decreased regulatory T cell function, evidence of nonspecific stimulation of the immune system, increased levels of markers of inflammation)? Yes. Cross-sectional case-control studies are ava ilable suggesting that TCE induces clinical disorders similar to idiosyncratic drug hypersensitiv ity reactions, as well as clinical disorders that may be linked to autoimmunity, with the strongest data on autoimmunity in humans supporting an association between TCE and sy stemic sclerosis (scleroderma) (NRC, 2006; Cooper et al., 2009). Adverse effects reminiscent of idiosyncratic drug reactions that have been described in TCE- exposed individuals range from rash, itching an d fever to hepatic dys function (e.g. hepatitis) and severe generalized hypersensitivity derma titis (Kamijima et al., 2008). As is the case with other idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reactions, the incidence of TC E-related adverse effects is usually low (1 case per 100) and displays a strong link to specific HLA loci, HLA-B*1301 and HLA-B*44 (OR = 36.8; 95% CI = 17.8-76.1) (Li et al., 2007). In addition, the dose- response relationship for TCE-re lated hypersensitivity disord ers and reactiv ation of human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) has been found in TCE-affected individuals (Nak ajima et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2006; Kamijima A series of questions is presented in chapter 7, s ection 7.7.1, \"Weight of evidence approach Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 295 et al., 2007). HHV and other in fections are also linked to certain drug hypersensitivity reactions and may be susceptibi lity factors in TCE-induced adverse reactions, autoimmune or allergic, as well. Cytokine levels found in serum of workers expo sed to environmental TCE levels of 35 \u00b1 14 mg/m 3 suggest a proinflammatory stat us (increased levels of IFN- and IL-2 and decreased levels of IL-4) (Iavicoli et al., 2005). A simila r pattern was reported for newborns in a study in which increasing TCE concentrations in indoo r air samples from the child's bedroom were associated with increased levels of IFN- and decreased levels of IL-4; IL-2 was unchanged (Lehmann et al., 2002). Although thes e changes in cytokine levels as such are not indicative of autoimmunity, they may i ndicate alterations in immune homeostasis that favour auto- immune disease development. In a recent study, Kamijima et al . (2008) showed that the skin disorders (DTH reactions) observed among wo rkers exposed to TCE were not due to impurities or stabilizers and that they appeared to be associated with the extent of metabolism of TCE. The researchers compar ed affected workers in six f actories with healthy exposed workers in two other (control) factories. Analysis of the urine from all workers detected levels of trichloroacetic acid (TCA), one of th e major metabolites of TCE, at concentrations ranging from 318 to 1617 mg/l. The maximum TWA personal exposure of the healthy workers to TCE was between 164 and 2330 mg/m3. Concentration ranges of TCE (from personal exposure measurements or determined by urinary TCA) overl ap between healthy workers and patients with hype rsensitivity. Available exposur e data are not sufficient to explore a dose-response rela tionship for TCE-induced hypersensitivity disorders. There are a number of epidemiological studies that support an association between solvent exposure, including TCE, and autoimmune diseases , such as systemic sclerosis, connective tissue disease, multiple sclerosis, vasculiti s (with increased antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) and rheumatoid arthritis. There ar e enough studies of solv ent exposure and auto- immunity that meta-analyses have been performed for some autoimmune diseases. These meta-analyses found an association between solv ent exposure and relative risk (RR) of systemic sclerosis (RR = 3.14; 95% CI = 1.56-6.33) and multiple sclerosis (RR = 95% CI = 2.0-3.3) (Landtblom et al., 1996; Aryal et al., 2001). However, the data supporting an association between TCE exposure and autoimmunity are not as strong as the data on general solvent exposure. For example, Lacey et al. (1999) reported an association between self- reported solvent exposure (OR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.5-3.0) and undifferentiated connective tissue case-control study involvi ng 205 female patients; TCE alone was not associated with increased risk of conn ective tissue disease in these women. Systemic sclerosis is the autoimmune disease that is most consistently associated with either TCE or general solvent exposure. Case-control studies in France and South Carolina, USA, both found an association between occupational e xposure to TCE, or general solvents, and a 2- to 4-fold increased risk of systemic sclerosis (Nietert et al ., 1998; Diot et al., 2002). Nietert et al. (1998) reported that the presence of an ti-Scl-70 (DNA topoisomerase I) was an effect modifier that may be relate d to HLA genotypes. Workers wi th anti-Scl-70 (DNA topoisomer- ase I) autoantibodies and higher maximum or cumulative TCE intensity judged by a job exposure matrix had a 4-fold grea ter risk for systemic sclerosis. In a larger case-control study of women only, an associati on with solvent exposure was found (OR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.7- 2.6), but the OR for systemic sclerosis was not significant for self-reported TCE exposure (Garabrant et al., 2003). Harmonization Project Document No. 10 296Kilburn & Warshaw (1992) reported that sympto ms of systemic lupus erythematosus or connective tissue disease and an tinuclear autoantibodies were elevated in a population exposed to solvents including TCE and hea vy metals through groundwater contamination. Cooper et al. (2009) suggested that the use of rheumatic disease as part of the selection criteria for the exposed populati on makes it difficult to attribut e symptoms to exposure in the Kilburn & Warshaw (1992) study. More recent case-control studies addressing systemic lupus erythematosus have failed to show an association with solv ents or TCE (Cooper & Parks, 2004; Parks & Cooper, 2006). In summary, the human data provide some evidence that TCE exposure induces or exacer-bates autoimmune disease in humans. The asso ciation between TCE a nd autoimmune disease is supported by a number of case-control studies linking TC E exposure and autoimmune disease (primarily systemic sclerosis), occ upational studies demonstrating that TCE causes severe generalized hypersensitivity dermatitis several epidemiol ogical studies relating TCE and proinflammatory cytokine status. The strongest evidence to support this conclusion comes from the consistency of TCE-related effects observed across multiple case-control studies of TCE and systemic sclerosis. Al though numerous case-cont rol studies support a relationship between autoimmune diseases a nd exposure to solvents, including TCE, these studies provide limited support for TCE-induced au toimmunity because there is considerable uncertainty that the observed au toimmune-related effect is related to TCE exposure and not to the other solvents. The majority of the exposure data from the available studies are from job exposure matrices and involve multiple chemicals. The risk assessor has to determine whether the exposure questions fo r individual studies result in supporting or equivocal data for TCE-induced autoimmunity. Although Iavico li et al. (2005) and Le hmann et al. (2002) provided some exposure data relating TCE to in flammatory cytokines, dose-response data on a potential association between TCE and autoimm une disease are not available. The database would benefit substantially from a well-conducted cross-sectional or prospective cohort study of autoimmune disease inciden ce with exposure data. The availa ble epidemiological data for TCE provide little information on a potential dose-response relationship between TCE exposure and reported symptoms of autoimmune disease in humans and therefore do not support a quantitative risk assessment. The human data also do not provide much information on potential susceptible populations by age or sex. There is some evidence that TCE exposure is associated with a greater relative risk fo r systemic sclerosis for men than for women; however, this may reflect a greater ability to detect the disease due to the 10-fold lower background incidence of systemic sclerosis in men compared with women. Thus, human data add to the weight of evidence that TCE is asso ciated with autoimmune disease, but, as a result of limitations in exposure data, canno t be used to perform a quantitative risk assessment. C6.3.1.2 Is there evidence that the chemical causes changes in disease incidence or progression in animal models of autoimmune disease? Yes. Most (Khan et al., 1995; Griffin et al., 2000a,b,c; Blossom et al., 2006, 2007, 2008; Gilbert et al., 2006, 2009; Blossom & Doss, 2007) , but not all (Peden-Adams et al., 2008; Keil et al., 2009), studies using autoimmune dis ease-prone strains of mice suggest that TCE promotes pathogenesis and progression of autoi mmune disease in several mouse models of autoimmune disease and induces biomarkers of autoimmune disease in wild-type mice (Keil et al., 2009). However, studies to date have not demonstrated that TCE induces autoimmune disease. Hence, the studies performed so far suggest that the appearance of autoimmune phenomena is accelerated, but not induced, by exposure to TCE. Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 297 A study using the autoimmune disease-prone MR L+/+ mouse demonstrated that TCE (10 mmol/kg body weight intraperitoneally ) itself moderately stimulat ed the level of antinuclear antibodies (doubled optical density value in ELISA) and anti-single-stranded DNA antibodies (50% increase of optical density in ELISA), but not of anticardio lipin, anti-Sm, antihistone, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies or circulating immune complexes (Khan et al., 1995). In addition, increases in relative spleen weight ( 36%) and total serum IgG level (45%) were detected. In the same study (Khan et al., 1995), one of the metabolites of TCE, dichloroacetyl chloride (DCAC) (at 0.2 mmol/ kg body weight intraperitoneally), was tested and appeared to induce a higher (i.e. more than 300%) increase of IgG antibodies that were also affected by TCE. Notably, DCAC also induced DCAC-specific antibodies, giving 20-30 times higher optical density values. The dis ease- and autoantibody-promoting effect of DCAC (also using 0.2 mmol/kg body weight intr aperitoneally) was c onfirmed by a more recent study by the same group (Cai et al., 2006) . This study suggested that covalent adduct formation of proteins by the acylating agent DCAC may be the initial step in generating DCAC-specific immunity and possibly also in promoting autoantigen-specific antibody responses. Covalent binding of TCE, possibly as DCAC, to an array of macromolecules has been found in a number of tissues, including live r, lungs, kidneys and stomach. Interestingly, TCE also covalently binds to CYP2E1, th e enzyme primarily responsible for TCE metabolism. Other metabolites of TCE have al so been demonstrated to become immunogenic if adducted to albumin (Cai et al., 2007). In co ncordance with these studies, another oxidative metabolite of TCE, trichloroacetaldehyde hyd rate (TCAH), has been shown to promote various autoimmune parameters in autoimmune disease-prone MRL+/+ mice (Gilbert et al., 2006; Blossom et al., 2007). Similar studies provide evidence for the au toimmunogenic potential of TCE based on modu- lation of a range of immune parameters. Gri ffin et al. (2000a,b) exposed MRL+/+ mice to concentrations of TCE in the drinking-water resulting in doses of 21, 100 or 400 mg/kg body weight per day for 4 or 32 weeks. Only dos es of 100 or 400 mg/ kg body weight per day resulted in mononuclear infilt ration (of both CD3+ and CD3 lymphocytes), adduct formation in the liver, activation of CD4+ T cells (increased activation markers and IFN- production) and increases in serum levels of antinuclear antibodies. Notably, compared with untreated mice, antinuclear antibodies were in creased only at 4 weeks (at doses of 21 and 100 mg/kg body weight per day) but equalized to contro l at 32 weeks, whereas histological changes observed in the liver at 32 weeks (at doses of 100 and 400 mg/kg body weight per day) were not found after only 4 weeks of ex posure. In a follow-up study (Griffin et al., 2000c), higher daily TCE doses of 455 a nd 734 mg/kg body weight per day resulted in increased levels of antinuclear antibodies after 6-8 weeks, which again normalized after longer exposure (22 weeks). Th ese findings suggest that TCE may accelerate the onset of autoimmune responses in autoimmune diseas e-prone mice and that at a later time point, when spontaneous development of autoimmu ne disease has occurred in controls, the differences are no longer obviou s. As liver pathology occurs only in TCE-treated MRL+/+ mice, this phenomenon is not likely due to autoreactivity, but rather is the result of a compound-specific, hypersensitivity -like process. The finding of increased levels of IgE in DCAC-treated MLR+/+ mice (Cai et al., 2007) may support this idea, although increased IgE levels point to a Th2-mediated hypersensitivity response. More recently, Cai et al. (2008) also showed that TCE (60 mg/kg body weight per day for up to 48 weeks) induced a slightly, but not significantly, enhanced level of serum an tinuclear antibodies. In line with the above- mentioned study by Griffin et al. (2000b), path ological changes (CD3+ cell influx in liver, lungs and kidney and glomerular immunoglobulin deposits) were demonstrated only in TCE- exposed mice. Harmonization Project Document No. 10 298Other autoimmune disease-prone mouse strain s\u2014i.e. NZBWF1 (Keil et al., 2009) and well as the B6C3F1 strain (Keil et al., 2009)\u2014have used to study the autoimmune-promoting effects of TCE. TCE did not induce autoimmu ne phenomena in C3H/HeJ (susceptible to autoimmune alopecia) and produced only minor changes in NZBWF1 mice (prone to systemic lupus erythematosus), as evidenced by autoantibodies. Keil et al. (2009) concluded that the transient incr ease in autoantibodies to glomerular antigen and double-stranded DNA at the low dose did not support a role for chroni c exposure to TCE in the progression of auto- immune disease in NZBWF1 mice at 1.4 and 14 mg/l. In contrast to the findings in the NZBWF1 strain, non-autoimmune disease-prone B6C3F1 mice evaluated in the same experiment had consistently elevated serum levels of anti-single-st randed DNA after about 30 weeks of exposure to TCE (1.4 and 14 mg /l in drinking-water). A dose-response relationship for increased number of activated T cells (CD4+/CD44+) in the spleen was observed in the B6C3F1 mice that was significan t at the 14 mg/l dose of TCE. Kidneys were analysed for pathological changes, and an in crease of kidney score (based on inflammation, proliferation, etc.) was observed only in the B6C3 F1 mice. It should be noted that because of their genetic predisposition to kidney disease, the basal kidney score was 3-9 times higher in NZBWF1 mice. Nonetheless, while the evidence is limited and has not been reproduced, this study suggests that TCE may have the ability to induce autoimmune di sease spontaneously. In three recent studies, the e ffects of TCE in MRL+/+ mice were examined following lifetime (developmental and early life) drinking-water exposure starting from the premating period (Peden-Adams et al., 2006, 2008; Blossom & Doss, 2007). The study by Blossom & Doss (2007), resulting in doses of up to 684 mg/kg body weight per day in dams, showed slight increases in IgG2a and antihistone levels (bot h parameters only at middle dose of 122 mg/kg body weight per day). Peden-Adams et al. ( 2006, 2008) exposed MRL+/+ and B6C3F1 mice to TCE at concentrations of 1.4 and 14 mg /l in the drinking-water (from mating until 12 months of age in MRL+/+ mice and until 8 weeks of age in B6C3F1 mice) and found no alterations in levels of anti-double-st randed DNA or antiglomerular antibodies. Although other assays of immune function were not performed in MRL+/+ mice, a significant decrease in thymus cellularity was observed in male MRL+/+ mice at TCE concentrations of 1.4 and 14 mg/l; this decrease was also reflected in a d ecrease in all thymic T cell subpopulations at 14 mg/l (Peden-Adams et al., 2008). In contrast, a TCE concen- tration of 14 mg/l was associated with an increa se in thymus cellularity in B6C3F1 mice of both sexes (Peden-Adams et al., 2006). Additiona l functional immune assays were performed in B6C3F1 mice. The primary antibody response to SRBCs (by PFC) was decreased in B6C3F1 of both sexes and both TCE dose gr oups, but an increase in SRBC-elicited DTH responses was observed in female B6C3F1 mi ce at a TCE concentra tion of 1.4 mg/l and both male and female B6C3F1 mice at 14 mg/l. In summary, for purposes of a ri sk assessment, there is a rela tively large body of animal data supporting the connection between TCE exposure and increased progression or pathogenesis of autoimmune disease in severa l rodent models. The majority of animal data indicating that TCE promotes autoimmune disease are from st udies demonstrating th at high doses of TCE (e.g. 100-2500 mg/l) exacerbate the onset and/or severity of symptoms of autoimmune disease in MRL+/+ mice, a ge netically autoimmune disease-pr one strain. There are also several studies demonstrating immunom odulation (immunosuppression, immunostimulation and promotion of markers of autoimmune dis ease) in non-genetically autoimmune disease- prone B6C3F1 mice. Data from the MRL+/+ mice support a dose-response relationship Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 299 without clear evidence of a threshold. Many of th e studies use one or two doses because they are designed to determine mechanisms rather than for use in establishing a dose-response relationship or effect levels. The rodent data, together with the strong human data described in autoimmune disease se verity and progression. As described above in section C6.3.1.1, the huma n data contain considerable uncertainty owing to the general lack of exposure data and the lack of a well-conduct ed cross-sectional or prospective cohort study of au toimmune disease incidence w ith TCE exposure data. There- fore, human data are not available to evaluate a potential dose-response relationship between TCE exposure and systemic sclerosis or other reported symptoms of autoimmune disease in humans, and the available animal data should be used to develop a qu antitative risk evalua- tion. Consideration of the database of animal studies should begin by evaluating studies that identify the lowest effect leve l with support for biologi cal plausibility of the observed effects. First, as with other risk assessments, the use of data from the most re levant exposure route in humans is preferred, and theref ore experimental animal data from studies involving oral exposure to TCE should be selected for the ri sk assessment over data from intraperitoneal exposure studies. Second, the use of animal da ta from autoimmune disease-prone rodent models needs to be considered explicitly in the uncertainty factors applied to the animal data in estimating human risk of TCE-induced auto immunity. The application of these uncertainty than the general population, and therefore the intraspecies uncertainty factor should generally be reduced from 10 to 1 when human risk is estimated from data obtained in autoimmune disease-prone rodents. When considering the database of available studie s, it is readily apparent that many of the earlier studies use high doses of TCE (e.g. 100-2500 mg/l intrap eritoneally or in drinking- water, resulting in an effective dose of 60-100 mg/kg body weight per day). More recent have extended the dose range down to 14 and 1.4 mg/l in drinking-water for a 0.14- with a focus on autoimmune-related end-points. Most of these studies were designed to elucidate mechanisms of action of TCE at dos es known to be toxic, and therefore the dose range does not extend below TCE doses of 1.4 mg /l in drinking-water. Ev en the lowest doses tested are higher than mean gr oundwater levels in the USA, but they are similar to levels found at sites on the United States National Pr iority List (Peden-Adams et al., 2008). It should also be noted that many of these stud ies point towards a complicated (at least two- step) mechanism of action, including phenomena related to both hypersen sitivity (protein conjugation, metabolite-specific immune response s) and autoimmunity (increases of auto- antibodies). Hazard identification studies have demonstrated the potential of TCE to induce inflammation in various organs, but none of the studies established an autoimmune nature for the inflammation. factors will be discussed in detail below, but , as described in chapter 7 of this guidance above in section C6.3.1.1, present a strong weight of evidence for a TCE-associated increase 0.35 mg/kg body weight per day dose based on body weights from individual studies.

(2009) concluded that TCE did not cont ribute to the progression of autoimmune disease in MRL+/+ mice in their study. Source: Table adapted from Peden-Adams et al. (2006, 2008) The Keil et al. (2009) data on B6C3F1 mice provid e the lowest dose from animal data for an autoimmune-related effect by a relevant route of e xposure with evidence of a dose-response relationship and therefore were selected for the quantitative risk assessment. There are no data to identify a NOAEL for autoimmune eff ects associated with TCE. The autoimmune- related effects at the lowest dose (1.4 mg/l) represent a LOAEL for the study and include increased levels of autoantibod ies to double- and single-strande d DNA and an increase in the Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 301 graded score indicating renal pathology. At th e higher dose (14 mg/l), there was also an increase in activated (CD4+/ CD44+) T cells. There is some evidence of a dose-response relationship for these end-points, but it is lim ited. For example, the increase in activated T cells supports a dose-response re lationship, as the increase is not significant at the low dose (1.4 mg/l), but is significantly increased at 14 mg/l. The increa se in autoantibodies to double- stranded DNA also supports a dose- response relationship, as the e ffect is observed sooner at the high dose (i.e. at 26 weeks at 14 mg/l TCE, wh ereas it is not significant until 32 weeks at 1.4 mg/l). There is no such difference in th e autoantibodies to single-stranded DNA, and there are time points (e.g. 34 weeks) when th e low dose (1.4 mg/l) is associated with increased autoantibody levels and the high dose is not. The Keil et al. (2009) study is part of a series of studies on TCE-related autoimmunity in several mouse strains involving the 1.4 and 14 mg/l dose level in drinking-water. Using data from multiple studies, the importance of longe r TCE exposure periods can be observed in the development of autoimmune-related effects at these dose levels. The developmental study reported in Peden-Adams et al. (2006) exposed B6C3F1 mice from gestation to 8 weeks of age and did not observe the elev ation in autoan tibodies reported by Keil et al. (2009) at 30+ weeks of age. This suggests that short-term or subchronic exposure to TC E is not sufficient to promote progression of autoimmune disease, and longer TCE exposure may be required to increase the expression of markers associated with autoimmune disease in the non-genetically prone B6C3F1 mice. The high-dose TCE studie s in MRL+/+ mice described previously provide additional evidence that the duration of exposure influences the observed effects. Autoantibodies and T cell activation are genera lly observed with high doses of TCE, and short, 4-week exposures (e.g. Griffin et al., 2000b,c) and hist opathological changes such as inflammatory and lymphocytic infiltrations in the liver are associated with exposures of 32- 48 weeks (e.g. Griffin et al., 2000c; Cai et al., 2008). Data from these high-dose TCE studies also provide support for a dose-response relationship between TCE exposure and exacerbation of autoimmunity. Although the autoi mmune effects at lower dose levels (i.e. 1.4 and 14 mg/l) do support a dose-response relations hip, the lack of clear evidence for a dose- response relationship represents a sour ce of uncertainty in the evaluation. The LOAEL of 1.4 mg/l for TCE data in B63CF1 mice from Keil et al. (2009) is for several autoimmune-related end-points in a non-autoimmune disease-pr one mouse strain. There are two additional oral drinking- water studies (Peden-Adams et al., 2006, 2008) that support a 1.4 mg/l TCE dose level as a LOAEL and two mouse strains (B6C3F1 and NZBWF1) that support autoimmune effects at the LOAEL. The same labor atory found limited evidence for TCE-related autoimmunity in autoimmune dis ease-prone NZBWF1 mice in the identical protocol and concluded that th e evidence did not support a role for chronic expo sure to TCE in the progression of autoimmune disease in NZBWF1 mice at 1.4 and 14 mg/l (Keil et al., 2009). Therefore, the NZBWF1 data from Keil et al. (2009) provide some support for the B6C3F1 data, but were not used to derive the POD. The Peden-Adams et al. (2008) data were also excluded from this analysis because the thymic cellular changes in MRL+/+ mice suggest a histopathological change that is not clearly related to au toimmunity. Keil et al. (2009) and Peden-Adams et al. (2006) also reported evidence of immunosuppression and immunostimulation (increased DTH and decr eased PFC) at the 1.4 mg/l TCE dose in B6C3F1 mice in the developmental exposure study with exposure through 8 weeks of age. In a full risk assessment, these end-points (dec reased PFC supporting suppression and increased DTH supporting stimulation) would be considered excellent candi date effects and support the same dose level for the LOAEL. Although the increase in DTH suggests immunostimulation and may be related to promotion of autoimmun ity, the derivation of PODs or effect levels Harmonization Project Document No. 10 302from the DTH or PFC data is not included here, because this case-study is restricted to auto- immune-related effects. Therefore, the lowest dose (1.4 mg/l) at which the autoimmune-related end-points of increased levels of autoantibod ies to double- and single-strande d DNA and an increase in the graded score indicating renal pathology in B6C3F1 mice were observed represents a LOAEL for TCE-related exacerbation of autoimmunity from Keil et al. ( 2009). A NOAEL cannot be determined from the available data. Some of th e end-points at the LOAEL, such as increased autoantibodies to single- and double-stranded DNA, represent a relatively early effect in the autoantibodies alone are not necessarily consid ered an adverse effect, as many individuals demonstrate these without clinical symptoms and they also may occur during normal ageing. However, there are other effects at 1.4 mg/l, su ch as renal score, which are more closely related to a clearly adverse outcome (i.e. rena l pathology). The fact that there are multiple effects at 1.4 mg/l and higher dose levels incr eases the weight of evidence for TCE-related modulation of autoimmunity. The risk assessor can consider the redu ction of uncertainty factors to account for LOAEL to NOAEL extr apolation when the end-point data being presumably approaching a NOA EL. Internal dose metrics a ssociated with autoimmune effects, such as liver or kidney levels of TCE or metabolites, are not available for these studies. A more comprehensive risk assessment should carefully consider the utility of the available toxicokinetic models to inform a hu man health risk assessment and extrapolate relevant human internal and external doses of TCE associated with increased risk of autoimmunity from the available animal data. However, that is beyond the scope of this case- study; therefore, this example is based on th e LOAEL from oral exposure data in B6C3F1 mice from Keil et al. (2009). The 1.4 mg/l LOAEL needs to be converted to units of mg/kg body weight for standard calculations of a POD and the estimation of th e reference value. The mg/kg body weight dose can be calculated from the drinking-water dose by multiplying the TCE concentration in drinking-water by the average water intake an d dividing by the average body weight. Using calculations are as follows: LOAEL = 1.4 mg/l \u00d7 (0.004 kg body weight) = 0.187 mg/kg body weight per day = 0.19 mg/kg body weight per day in both sexes To continue the illustration of this cas e-study, the converted LOAEL of 0.19 mg/kg body weight per day for TCE from the Keil et al. ( 2009) study will be used to derive the health- assessor should apply BMD modelling to the data to derive a POD near the low end of the available data. For the purposes of this ca se-study, the LOAEL will be used as the POD rather than selecting a model and performi ng BMD calculations, but the BMD is generally the preferred method. The next step in the risk assessment process is the application of uncertainty factors, as etiology of TCE-exacerbated auto immunity in these mice. As discussed in chapter 7, DNA based guidance value or reference value. As described in chapter 3 (section 3.3.7.3), the risk described in section 3.3.10 in general and section 7.10 with reference to autoimmunity: an average body weight of 30 g from Table 1 in Keil et al. (2009) and assumptions of 4 ml considered are for effects that are early in the etiology of dis ease and therefore the LOAEL is drinking-water consumed per day from Ta ble 5 of Peden-Adams et al. (2008), the Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 303 The intraspecies uncertainty factor would be 10, to account for interhuman variability in the absence of more definitive data . Although the database contains multiple studies from autoimmune disease-prone mice, the data used to determine human risk were from a non-autoimmune disease-prone rodent model, and so a standard 10-fold uncertainty factor is used fo r this case-study. When animal data are from a model that is considered to represent susceptible humans, rather than the general human population, the risk assessor should consider reducing or eliminating the intraspecies uncertainty factor. This is the case for autoimmune disease-prone rodent models, discussion). The interspecies uncertainty factor would be 10 to extrapolate from experimental animal data to human risk. The LOAEL to NOAEL uncertainty factor would be 10 because a NOAEL is not available. The risk assessor could cons ider reducing the LOAEL to NOAEL uncer- tainty factor because some of the data at the LOAEL (i.e. increased autoantibodies to single- and double-stranded DNA) represent a relatively early effect in the etiology of TCE-exacerbated autoimmunity and therefore the LOAEL is presumably approaching a NOAEL. For the purposes of this case-study, the uncertainty factor was not reduced. It was considered collectively with the data base uncertainty fact or and the lack of studies in the lower dose ra nge. Reducing both of these un certainty factors to 1 or raising both of these uncertainty factors to 10 was considered to underestimate and overestimate the uncertainty, respectively. A default approach for the LOAEL to NOAEL was instead selected. The subchronic to chronic uncertainty factor , or use and time factor, would be 1 for a chronic exposure assessment, as the study length was 30 weeks. The application of this uncertainty factor depends on policy, a nd some institutions, such as the USEPA, are hesitant to reduce the uncertainty factor if the exposure is less than the 2-year study generally considered chronic. Applic ation of this uncertainty factor also depends on the scope defined in the problem formulation st age of the risk assessment (i.e. chronic, subchronic or acute). The an imal data suggest that exposure length increases the severity of effects observed and that increasing duration is associated with a lower effect level (e .g. the autoimmune effects in B6C3F1 mice at 30+ weeks were not observed in the 8-week Peden-Adams et al. [2006] study). The database uncertainty factor would be 1, because there is a relatively large database for TCE exacerbation of autoimmun ity. The lack of studi es at lower dose levels could be used to justify a larger database uncertainty factor; however, for the purposes of this assessment, the availability of several studies in multiple rodent strains at 1.4 mg/l (0.19 mg/kg body weight per day) is considered sufficient. As discussed previously, the effects observed at 1.4 mg/l can be considered early markers of autoimmunity and therefore suggest th at the dose is approaching a NOAEL. The lack of clear effects in NZ BWF1 mice at this level sugge sts that researchers have provided data on a sufficientl y low dose in autoimmune di sease-prone mice as well. The LOAEL to NOAEL uncertainty factor addr esses the uncertainty associated with the lack of a NOAEL. To complete the derivation of a health-based gui dance value or reference value, the guidance recommends consideration of groups at risk (i .e. children, elderly and genetically susceptible individuals) and then dividing the POD by the total uncertainty factor described above. An additional consideration may be warranted for su sceptible life stages because there may be a general increased risk for autoimmunity in older individuals linked to a modulation in which are considered good models of susceptible humans (see chapter 7 for further Harmonization Project Document No. 10 304there are no animal or human data to inform this potential susceptibility for TCE-induced autoimmunity. In light of the observation that most autoimmune diseases are sex-biased towards females, sex is another important intrin sic factor to consider in association with environmental exposures, including TCE. Th e animal data on TCE-exacerbated auto- immunity do not suggest a strong sex-related su sceptibility, but only female B6C3F1 mice were utilized in the experiment used to derive the reference value. The human data discussed age or sex. There is some evidence that TCE e xposure is associated w ith a greater relative risk for systemic sclerosis for men than for women; however, as discussed previously, this may reflect a greater ability to detect the disease as a result of the 10-fold lower background incidence of systemic sclerosis in men compared with women. Using the above values, the to tal uncertainty fact or applied for a risk assessment for derivation of a chronic reference value for TC E would be 1000 (10 for intraspecies, 10 for interspecies, 1 for subchronic to chronic, 10 for LOAEL to NOAEL and 1 for database). For the chronic risk assessment of au toimmunity associated with TCE: Reference value = 0.19 mg/kg body weight per day \u00f7 1000 = 0.000 19 mg/kg body weight per day The reference value derived from the LOA EL of 1.4 mg TCE per litre (0.19 mg/kg body weight per day) in female B6C3F1 mice is ba sed on increased levels of autoantibodies to double- and single-stranded DNA and an increas e in the graded score indicating renal pathology. This reference valu e is supported by data sugges ting a transient increase in autoantibodies to DNA and glomerular antigen in autoimmune disease-prone NZBWF1 mice at the same TCE dose level in drinking-water. The increase in DTH in B6C3F1 mice, also at 1.4 mg/l (Peden-Adams et al., 2006), supports an elevated immune response that may be related to autoimmunity. Nume rous studies in MRL+/+ mice support TCE-associated stimu- lation of autoimmunity at higher doses (Kha n et al., 1995; Griffin et al., 2000a,b,c; Blossom et al., 2006, 2007, 2008; Gilbert et al., 2006, 2009; Blossom & Doss, 2007). Therefore, the TCE-induced autoantibodies to DNA and increased renal pa thology in B6C3F1 mice represent the most sensitive end- point for autoimmunity in the most sensitive strain and are supported by other animal data. C6.3.1.3 Is there evidence that the chemical alters immune measures associated with autoimmunity (i.e. autoantibody levels, inflammatory markers, regulatory T cells, lymph node proliferation, etc.) in animal models of autoimmune disease? Yes. There are a number of studies that demons trate TCE modulation of immune measures associated with autoimmunity in mouse models of autoimmune disease. Numerous studies present data on autoantibody production in autoimmune disease-prone MRL+/+ mice associated with TCE exposure, and there are some examples in other strains. Multiple studies (Griffin et al., 2000b,c; Blossom et al., 2006, 20 07, 2008; Blossom & Doss, 2007) also report TCE-related increases cytokines (primarily IFN- ) consistent with a Th1- type inflammatory response in MRL+/+ mice. Many of these data have been described in adaptive immunity (see Hakim & Gress, 2007, and di scussion in section 7.8 of chapter 7), but in section C6.3.1.1 provide limited information on potential TCE-susceptible populations by section C6.3.1.2 above, and therefore the data will be covered only briefly here. Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 305 The TCE data in MRL+/+ mice include reports of increased antinuclear antibodies (Khan et al., 1995; Griffin et al., 2000b,c; Ca i et al., 2008), an ti-histone antibodies (Blossom & Doss, 2007) and antibodies to double- and single- stranded DNA (Khan et al., 1995). Direct exposure to several TCE metabolites is also associated with increa sed autoantibodies in MRL+/+ mice. TCAH increased antinuclear and anti-histone antibodies 2006); DCAC an tibodies, anti-single-st randed DNA antibodies and anti-cardiolipin antibodies (Khan et al., 1995; Cai et al., 2006). A transient increase in autoantibodies to glomerular antigen was al so observed in autoimmune disease-prone NZBWF1 mice (Keil et al., 2009 ). The increase in antibodies to glomerular antigen was significant at both TCE doses tested at 11 and 19 weeks (not at 16 or 23-36 weeks of age); the increase in antibodies to double-stranded DNA was significant at 19 weeks of age, and at the low dose, only at 32 and 34 weeks of age. The authors concluded that the evidence did not support a role for chronic exposure to TCE in the progression of autoimmune disease in NZBWF1 mice at 1.4 and 14 mg/l. In the sa me experiment, researchers used a non- genetically prone mouse strain (B6C3F1) to examine the role of TCE in expression of markers associated with autoimmune disease in a strain that does not spontaneously develop autoimmune disease. TCE exposure was associat ed with a significant increase in antibodies to single- and double-stranded DNA in B6C3F1 mice (Keil et al., 2009) . The increases in autoantibodies to DNA in B6C3F1 mice were one of several effects th at were collectively identified at the LOAEL for TCE of 1.4 mg/l in drinking-water. Along with kidney pathology, these markers of autoimmunity were us ed to derive the POD and reference dose in evaluation presented previously and is not presented here. As described above, there are many examples of TCE-related increases in autoantibody levels in autoimmune disease-prone mice as well as some data from non-autoimmune disease- prone B6C3F1 mice. There is also evidence th at TCE exposure results in a proinflammatory status characterized by increased secretion of IFN- by T cells. The autoantibody data alone present some evidence of an effect of TCE on autoimmunity. For the purposes of illustration, a risk assessor faced with evaluating a data set restricted to incr eased autoantibody levels could conclude that there was a potential for TCE to exacerbate or acce lerate autoimmunity. However, increased autoantibodie s represent a relatively early effect in the etiology of TCE- exacerbated autoimmunity. DNA autoantibodies, an tinuclear antibodies, etc. are considered adverse effects, and they are generally asso ciated with pathology at higher doses (renal deposits of IgG, lymphocyte inf iltration, hepatocyte proliferati on or necrosis). Without data on TCE-related effects such as renal score that are more closely related to these clearly adverse outcomes (i.e. renal path ology), there is greater uncertain ty in deriving an effect level on autoantibodies alone. However, even as an exercise, it is difficult to separate these data from the larger database of TCE-related eff ects reported in animal models of autoimmune disease. Considered in the c ontext of the wider database, th e autoantibody data support the strong weight of evidence for a TCE-associated increase in autoimmune disease progression. C6.3.1.4 Is there evidence from general or observational immune assays (lymphocyte phenotyping, cytokines, complement, lymphocyte proliferation, etc.) that the chemical has the potential to modulate autoimmune disease? Yes. TCE as well as its metabolit es TCAH and TCA have been demonstrated to activate CD4+ T cells in autoimmune disease-prone MRL+/+ mice. This was evidenced by increased section C6.3.1.2, and therefore a quantitative ri sk assessment would be a duplicate of the human case-study data outlined in section C 6.3.1.1 and the relatively strong database from mouse models of autoimmune disease outlined in section C6.3.1.2. Together, this adds to a Harmonization Project Document No. 10 306expression of activation markers and elevat ed cytokine levels (in particular IFN- ) at CD54 along with downregulation of CD45RB in CD4+ cells as indicators of activation in T cells from the spleen or lymph nodes of TCE-e xposed MRL+/+ mice. Interestingly, Keil et al. (2009) T cell activat ion in non-autoimmune disease-prone B6C3F1 mice, suggesting a general mechanism of TCE ac tion that is not restri cted to susceptible strains. A similar pattern of TCE-associated activation of T cells was observed following exposure to TCE metabolites TCAH and TCA using the activation marker CD62Llo in MRL+/+ mice (Blossom et al., 2006, 2007). At si milar doses, both compounds also resulted in increased resistance to act ivation-induced cell death (Gilb ert et al., 2006). A series of studies by Griffin and colle agues (Griffin et al., 2000b,c; Blossom et al., 2006, 2008; Blossom & Doss, 2007) reported increased IFN- secretion by splenic or peripheral T cells following stimulation by anti-CD3 or phor bol myristate acetate in MRL+/+ mice. The increase in IFN- was consistently observed after 4 weeks of TCE e xposure in adults (Griffin et al., 2000b) and following developmental ex posure to 4 weeks of age (Blossom & Doss, 2007). An increase in IFN- was not consistently associated with longer-term exposure (22- 32 weeks) in adults or following developmenta l exposure to TCE (up to 7-8 weeks of age) (Griffin et al., 2000b,c; Blossom & Doss, 2007). Decreased IL-4 secretion by anti-CD3 activated T cells in MRL+/+ mice was reported after 4 and 22 weeks of exposure to TCE at 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml in drinking-water (Griffin et al., 2000b); however, IL-4 was not altered in follow-up studies of TCE or the metabolites TCAH or TCA (Griffin et al., 2000c; Blossom et al., 2006, 2007). Increase s in IL-2 and TNF- have also been obs erved following develop- mental exposure to TCE at con centrations as low as 0.1 mg/ml in drinking-water (Blossom et al., 2008). The database of TCE-associated immune change s includes two types of data from general immune assays: lymphocyte phenotyping and cyt okine production. By themselves, these provide equivocal evidence for TC E-related autoimmunity and woul d not be used to derive a ity of different assays for autoimmunity). In th e absence of the relatively strong database of TCE-induced expression of ma rkers associated with autoimm une disease (primarily from MRL+/+ mice), inflammatory cytokines and markers of T cell activation would suggest immunomodulation, but woul d not be definitive for autoimm unity. These data would identify a data gap suggesting the need for more conc lusive autoimmune-related end-points (e.g. early markers such as increased autoantibodies, and clearly adverse markers such as renal or liver pathology). As such, the data could be used to support the n eed for additional studies in animal models of autoimmune disease to dete rmine autoimmune potential as well as func- tional immune assays to test for immunosuppression or imm unostimulation. Of course, the equivocal nature of these data is largely due to the fact that we are evaluating the cytokine data out of context and for purposes of illustration. In reality, the cytokine data and evidence for T cell activation are related to the autoimmune end-points, and the da ta were collected as part of mechanistic studies to characterize th e MOA for autoimmune effects associated with TCE exposure. Therefore, consideration of the data on the TCE-associated increase in IFN- cytokine and T cell activation is warranted in the context of the full database. The lowest TCE dose evaluated in the MRL+/+ mice wa s 0.1 mg/ml, or 100 mg/l. Although cytokine levels were not reported in the B6C3F1 mous e studies by Keil and co lleagues (Peden-Adams 2006, 2008; Keil et al., 2009), the au thors did report a si gnificant increase in activation of T cells at the TCE dose of 14 mg/l. This effect can be used to suppo rt the other data for autoimmune-associated effects at 1.4 mg/l, but th e T cell activation data are not at the lowest dose level. The data from general immune assays add to the considerable weight of evidence POD (see section 7.7 of chapter 7 for a full disc ussion of the relative strength and predictabil-Guidance for Immunotoxicity Risk Assessment for Chemicals 307 for TCE-associated exacerbati on or acceleration of autoimm unity. The database supporting TCE-associated autoimmunity includes a relati vely large number of studies on autoimmune- number of studies reporting autoantibodies and some other immune measures associated with C6.3.1.5 Is there histopathological evidence (t hymus, etc.) or are there changes in immune organ weights or haematological changes that suggest that the chemical causes an immune response against self (i.e. immune complex deposition, inflammatory cell infiltrates)? Yes. The main histopathological ev idence of TCE-associated autoimmunity is from studies infiltration. In particular, in MRL+/+ mi ce, TCE has been shown to induce inflammatory cell infiltrates in various organs\u2014i.e. liver, lungs, skin and kidneys at doses of 0.1-2.5 mg/ml in drinking-water (Griffin et al., 2000b; Cai et al., 2008; Gilbert et al., 2009). TCE-associated hepatic changes also included ne crosis and evidence for increased hepatocyte proliferation (Cai et al., 2008) at a TCE concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in drinking-water for 48 weeks. Griffin et al. (2000c) reported lympho cyte portal infiltration in the liver at TCE concentrations as low as 0.5 mg/ml and increas ed hepatocyte reactiv e changes at concen- trations as low as 0.1 mg/ml for 32 weeks. In kidneys, immune complex deposition was demonstrated in the glomeruli of MRL+/+ mice exposed to TCE for 48 weeks (Cai et al., 2008). Although all of the histopat hological changes cited above were reported as part of specific studies of autoimmunity, the inflammatory cell infiltrates may have been detected as part of routine haematoxylin and eosin staining of paraffin-fixed tissue. For the purposes of illustration in this case-study, routine haematoxylin and eosin staining of liver, lung, skin and kidney may have been available to the risk assessor without the data base of autoimmune studies described in previous sections. In such a case, the inflammatory cell infiltration data could be used to support the n eed for additional studies in animal models of autoimmune disease to determine autoimmune potential. In reality, the histopathol ogical data provide support for other autoimmune end-points. As discussed above, the data set of histopat hological evidence in immune tissues following TCE exposure includes inflammatory infiltrates in liver, kidn ey, lung and skin, hepatocyte proliferation and immune complex deposition in the kidney. The immune complex deposition data alone provide some evidence for TCE-asso ciated autoimmunity. In the context of the larger database, the histopathology data pr ovide mechanistic information suggesting an MOA. The database supporting TCE-associated exacerbation of autoimmunity includes a relatively large body of animal data supportin g the connection between TCE exposure and increased progression or pathogenesis of autoi mmune disease from several mouse models of autoimmune disease (see section C6.3.1.2), a nu mber of studies reporting modulation of immune measures associated with autoimmunity in animal models of autoimmune disease (see section C6.3.1.3), including general immune a ssays such as proinflammatory cytokine human case-control studies (see section C6.3.1.1). The specific, autoimmune-related histopathological evidence descri bed above adds to the considerable weight of evidence for TCE-associated autoimmunity. autoimmune disease (see section C6.3.1.3) an d strong evidence from human case-control related effects reported in animal models of autoimmune disease (see section C6.3.1.2), a studies (see section C6.3.1.1). levels that may support autoimmunity (see section C6.3.1.4), and strong evidence from Harmonization Project Document No. 10 308 conducting an assessment of autoimmunity following the guidance from chapter 7. The discussions were written individually to aid the risk assessor in evaluating different levels of evidence for each type of data in the absenc e of additional evidence. Other than for the purpose of this illustration, the data should not be evaluated separately; rather, the data should assessor should develop the we ight of evidence conclusions for TCE-associated auto- immunity based on the answers to all of the we ight of evidence questions in chapter 7. The weight of evidence conclusions for autoimmunity should also describe the database in terms data gaps. It is also important to note that the discussions of differe nt types of TCE auto- assessment does not represent a comprehensive ri sk assessment for TCE-associated health effects or other types of immunotoxicity. For example, a general evaluation of immuno- toxicity may have used the PFC and DTH data from Peden-Adams et al. (2006) to develop additional PODs. Human data would be preferred for the risk assessment because fewer assumptions are are very few TCE exposure data with which to ev aluate the potential qu antitative relationship between TCE exposure and reported symptoms of autoimmune disease in humans. The limited human data are from the Iavicoli et al. (2005) study, which reported an association between occupational exposure to TCE and increased inflammatory cytokines. On average, the exposure levels in th e occupational epidemiology studies were 35 mg/m 3 or higher. Assuming an 8-hour working day, this corres ponds to approximately 5 mg/kg body weight per day or higher. In these st udies, NOAELs were not establis hed. As lower effect levels were observed in the repeated oral dose studies in mice, the latter studies should be con- sidered the most appropri ate starting point for de veloping reference values. The increased levels of autoantibodies to doub le- and single-stranded DNA and an increase in the graded score indicating renal pathology in non-autoimmune disease-prone B6C3F1 mice exposed to TCE in drinking-water at concen tration of 1.4 mg/l for 30 weeks (Keil et al., 2009) were observed at the lowest TCE expos ure level associated with acceleration or these data would be used to derive a POD in the quantitative risk asse ssment of TCE-induced autoimmunity. The procedures and calculations necessary to develop a reference value from of uncertainty factors. Calculations from th e LOAEL are used to illustrate the process, although the BMD modelling approach is pref erred for a full risk assessment. Section C6.3.1.2 includes other consideratio ns that would be included in a more comprehensive risk assessment, such as a discussion of groups at risk and support for the LOAEL provided by additional studies. Each s ection on individual data types (sections C6.3.1.1-C6.3.1.5) includes a brief discussion of the consistency an d strengths of the data base for TCE-induced autoimmunity. The discussion provided in the i ndividual sections woul d be expanded in a more comprehensive risk assessment. As an ex ample, the risk assessor would go into greater The previous sections were written following th e weight of evidence questions in chapter 7 considers the database for a given chemical as a whole. As described in chapters 3-7, the risk immune-related data in sections C6.3.1.1-C 6.3.1.5 (including the quan titative assessment be integrated into a single evaluation that br ings together the answers to each question and presented above in section C6.3.1.2) are restrict ed to autoimmune-related effects, and the of consistency and biological plausibility, in cluding strengths, weaknesses, uncertainties and required to derive a reference value from hu man data.

Many studies have been reported on effects of TCE on immune(-associated) parameters. Although unequivocal evidence that TCE can indu ce or potentiate autoimmune diseases in humans is lacking, most of thes e effects can be considered i ndicative of a potential auto- immune disease-inducing or autoimmune disease-stimulating property of TCE. A risk assessment for an autoimmune disease-inducing or autoimmune disease-stimulating property of TCE is therefore indicated. This risk asse ssment is focused on the risk for long-term (chronic or lifetime) exposure. The goal is to derive a reference value (expressed in mg/kg body weight per day) for comparison with (past, current or expected ) exposure estimates. C6.4 Conclusions This assessment of TCE-related autoimmunity and autoimmune disease is a demonstration of the application of the risk assessment guida nce for the assessment of autoimmunity and the relatively strong database of autoimmune-related effects in animal models of autoimmune disease as well as the case-control studies ex ploring the relationship between TCE exposure and clinical disorders linked to autoimmunity. The case-study illustrates the limitations often encountered in evaluating human data (i.e. the number of studies of general solvent exposure in which co-exposure issues a nd the lack of quantitative exposure measurements limit the conclusions for risk assessment purposes). As wi th most chemicals for which there are data on the potential association with autoimmunity, th e majority of data for TCE are from auto- immune disease-prone rodent models (in this case, the MRL+/+ mouse). However, the POD and reference value were derived from a non-genetically prone mouse strain. It should be noted that this case-study on TC E is provided with th e purpose of illustrating how the risk assessment guidance can be used fo r assessing the risk of autoimmunity, but it does not represent a comprehensive risk assess ment, nor does it represent a final regulatory position. autoimmune disease presented in chapter 7 of this document.
