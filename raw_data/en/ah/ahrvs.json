For millennia, people have used Frankincense for its deep, relaxing aroma and perceived spiritual benefits. Cedarwood Atlas is a deeply grounding and relaxing oil. The fresh, herbal aroma of Clary Sage is uplifting and a little euphoric. Elemi is an ancient aromatic with a lemony-balsamic scent. Ancient Egyptians used Elemi during the embalming process. Elemi takes its name from the Arabic phrase for the ancient Hermetic maxim 'as above, so below'. Whether in quest of greater spiritual wholeness and enlightenment or simply for relaxation and recharging the vital energies, people are increasingly choosing to incorporate a regular meditation practice in their daily routine. While our favourite place for meditation may be a quiet corner at home where we can light a candle or diffuse oils, it is also possible to meditate on a train journey, during your lunch hour, or in a waiting room. This portable Meditation Aromatherapy Inhaler can help you to relax and enter a meditative frame of mind even away from home, where it is not possible to diffuse oils or incense. How to Use your Aromatherapy Inhaler Aromatherapy inhalers offer an easy, convenient way to enjoy the benefits of essential oils wherever you are. Simply unscrew the cap, hold the inhaler to your nose and inhale. You can help prolong the life of the inhaler by keeping the lid screwed on when not in use. It should then last you a good few months. This inhaler is not a medicine and no result can be guaranteed from its use. It is not a replacement for any medical treatment. If you are pregnant or have a medical condition such as epilepsy or high blood pressure, please do not use this or any other essential oil-based product without medical advice. "}
