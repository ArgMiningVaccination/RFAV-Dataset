These forms of medicine vary greatly and often take a vastly different approach when compared to other types. Countless studies and research have found that taking a more comprehensive and inclusive approach to medicine yields very promising results. Wellness and holistic medicine do just that and take into consideration all aspects of a whole person\u2014body, mind, and soul\u2014to care for the patient physically, mentally, and emotionally. This ensures that all of the patient's needs are taken care of, especially when compared to a more limited, symptoms-based approach, which is the basis for allopathic medicine. When discussing holistic health and wellness, there are two common definitions that are used. The first defines holistic as the healing of the entire person, which is made up of interdependent parts, such as the body, mind, and spirit. The second label holistic as synonymous with alternative therapies (versus Western medicine practices). In reality, there is no universal definition for holistic wellness. However, having a basic understanding of how this type of medicine is used may help patients decide if its approach to wellness is the right path forward on their journey to better health. Typically, western medicine treats the disease. Holistic medicine is about treating the person. When an individual gets sick, they go to the doctor and tell them what is wrong. The doctor may then run tests, tell the patient what sort of ailments they have, and subsequently treat them. With [holistic doctors](/columbus-holistic-doctor), they take a look at the larger picture; discussing the patient's diet, what stressors they have in their life, as well as any other factor that might affect health. A holistic doctor can treat anything that a traditional doctor can, however, the approach used differs greatly. Holistic health is often synonymous with natural healing, as this type of wellness journey can include certain lifestyle changes that influence: Diet Physical surroundings Behavior Personal and social relationships Exercise routine Approach to treatment To help relax the body and focus on positivity, a holistic doctor may develop a treatment plan that often includes relaxation or meditation. Being mindful of what foods and drinks are consumed is to be an expected element of a holistic treatment plan. Avoiding toxins and unhealthy foods is universally regarded as enhancing general health, treating illnesses, and recovering from injuries. The terms holistic medicine and alternative medicine have often been used interchangeably. In fact, alternative medicine is very different from holistic medicine; holistic medicine is a term that tends to embrace the larger definition of a system of treatment and practitioners and may even refer to practitioners who do not work within the system of conventional medicine. A more precise definition of holistic medicine is that it is a philosophy that focuses on treating the person as a whole and on the integration of mind, body, and spirit. Rather than simply treating a person for a specific illness or injury, holism promotes the belief that these three elements of a human being must be treated together in order to achieve any notion of healing. Holistic wellness is important because it takes into account the different aspects of health that contribute to overall wellness, including Physical Health; Emotional Health; Social Health; Spiritual Health; and Mental Health. It has the potential to heal a person by taking into account the many different facets of life that affect health, from physical well-being to social and interpersonal relationships.
