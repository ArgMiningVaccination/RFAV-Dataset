Bad Advice from Health Food Store Employees Doctor's Note This is the second of a four-part series on the quality of advice given by employees of natural food stores. For part one, see [Health Food Store Supplement Advice](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/health-food-store-supplement-advice/). Parts three and four are, respectively, [Dangerous Advice from Health Food Store Employees](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/dangerous-advice-from-health-food-store-employees/), and [Pharmacists Versus Health Food Store Employees: Who Gives Better Advice?](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/pharmacists-versus-health-food-store-employees-who-gives-better-advice/) Of course, doctors also know precious little about what people should be putting in their mouths. See, for example, [Do Doctors Make the Grade?](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/do-doctors-make-the-grade/); [Medical School Nutrition Education](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/medical-school-nutrition-education/); and [Doctors Know Less Than They Think About Nutrition](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/doctors-know-less-than-they-think-about-nutrition/). Even worse than just getting inadequate training, the medical profession has actively lobbied against doctors getting more education on the topic of nutrition. See [Nutrition Education Mandate Introduced for Doctors](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-education-mandate-introduced-for-doctors/); [Medical Associations Oppose Bill to Mandate Nutrition Training](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/medical-associations-oppose-bill-to-mandate-nutrition-training/); [California Medical Association Tries to Kill Nutrition Bill](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/california-medical-association-tries-to-kill-nutrition-bill/); and [Nutrition Bill Doctored in the California Senate](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/nutrition-bill-doctored-in-the-california-senate/).
