The British Journal of General Practice, April 2000 337viewpoint Patenting genes: a dangerous EU directive Advances in genetics have the potential to provide better health for all. The WHO estimatesthat mortality, disability and reproductive fitness can be ameliorated in just under one-thirdof single gene disorders. About 50% of congenital abnormalities, 10% of inherited diseases,and 2% of chromosomal disorders can be treated or corrected. 1Prevention or cure of common cancers is among the prime objectives of gene technology. Obstacles to research collaborationand free exchange of knowledge in this field are therefore to be deplored. An EU directive 2is to be implemented by 30 July 2000. One of its main purposes is to harmonise European patent laws with those of the US and Japan. Article 5 reads: 1. The human body, at the various stages of its formation and development, and the simple discovery of one of its elements, including the sequence or partial sequence of a gene, cannotconstitute patentable inventions.2. An element isolated from the human body or otherwise produced by means of technicalprocesses, including the sequence or partial sequence of a gene, may constitute a patentableinvention, even if the structure of that element is identical to that of a natural element.3. The industrial application of a sequence or partial sequence of a gene must be disclosedin the patent application. The key conflict is between the first and second paragraphs. The latter effectively creates a loophole whereby, if any technical process (such as a diagnostic test) can be based upon aspecific discovered gene sequence, then not only can the process be patented but so can thegene itself, effectively conferring upon the patent-holder ownership and control of allsubsequent developments that may stem from knowledge of its sequence. Within the medical profession there is fundamental opposition to the patenting of basic scientific knowledge, such as human gene sequences, because of the consequences for thefuture development and application of that knowledge. Traditionally, much medical researchhas been conducted through collaboration and the sharing of information. It is vital that thisshould not be compromised by commercial interests. One American laboratory 3has obtained patents for two breast cancer genes and claims exclusive rights to commercialise laboratory testing services, diagnostic kits and therapeuticproducts dependent upon these DNA sequences. Institutions must, in future, send theirsamples to this company for testing. If knowledge is patentable in this way then the patent-holder may gain a monopoly position for development and the costs of health care. They may even decide to block both clinicalservices and the development of new treatments. The monopoly would extend even toapplications of the gene sequence totally unforseen by the patent holder. If, for example, theRET gene had been patented for papillary thyroid cancer then the owner would have thepatent on multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and Hirschsprung s disease. 4 We maintain that human genes should not be considered the property of any one scientist orinstitution. The knowledge of our common heritage should be open to allresearchers/scientists and clinicians for the benefit of mankind. A clear distinction can and must be drawn between technical processes/inventions that exploit gene sequences and thesequences themselves. Then it should not be beyond the wit of legislators to find acceptableways to protect the legitimate commercial interests of high tech companies.

It has been developedin association with The BritishDiabetic Association, TheRoyal College of Physicians,The Royal College of Nursing,and a range of otherprofessional organisations. The guidelines have been produced following a review ofall current internationalevidence, with Professor AllenHutchinson FRCGP heading theteam. The guidelines makerecommendations on casemanagement for people withType 2 diabetes and are set outwith sections on various stagesof foot problems. Each sectiongives a synopsis of the currentevidence and providesrecommendations andmanagement for each stage ofthe foot problem. The leaflet is available on request from the RCGP atPrinces Gate.Primary health care increasingly takes placeamong a diverse and heterogeneous patientpopulation, with a wide range of beliefsystems and health practices. In thecommunity, patients now come from avariety of social, cultural, religious, ethnic,regional, and educational backgrounds, aswell as different lifestyles and choice ofself-treatment. In many cases this has led toproblems in communication betweenpatients and health professionals, as well asinequalities in health care. Aims of the course To equip those working in primary healthcare with the skills necessary to understand the health beliefs and practices of different patients and communities and how these may differ from their own To help increase communication between providers and clients in primary health care To provide the opportunity for developing a more reflective and self-aware primary care To understand the roles of participants own culture, social class, gender, age, andeducation in communication problems inprimary care. To provide participants with an opportunity to understand their own experiences of cross-cultural issues in primary health care To integrate this experience with the concepts and research evidence from medical anthropology and other social and behavioural sciences using a multi-disciplinary approach To help design culturally appropriate intervention, health promotion strategies,and patient participation in primary care Course structure Each session will consist of a lecture on therelevant topic, followed by a discussion ofkey texts. It will provide participants withthe opportunity to integrate social sciencetheories with their own clinical oradministrative experience, and the problemsthat they have encountered in the delivery ofprimary health care. Topics covered in the course include cross- cultural aspects of: Patients explanatory models of illness Body image and interpretation of symptomsFamily structure and family healthPregnancy, childbirth, fertility, and infertilityDeath, dying, and bereavementAlcohol, tobacco, and drug abuseUse of non-medical health careCross-cultural psychiatryNutrition, malnutrition, and dietary taboosMigration, refugees, stress, and diseaseHIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases Other information The course is open to all those working inprimary health care settings, whether in theUK or abroad, including GPs, nurses, healthvisitors, counsellors, pharmacists,administrators, and health planners, as wellas those working in community paediatrics,psychiatry, social services, and the voluntarysector. The course will be taught by Dr Cecil Helman, senior lecturer in the TheDepartment of Primary Care and PopulationSciences, Royal Free and UniversityCollege Medical School, and associateprofessor, Department of Human Sciences,Brunel University. Some sessions will begiven by guest lecturers. The course will take place in the Archway Campus of the Royal Free and UniversityCollege Medical School, Holborn UnionBuilding, Highgate Hill, London N19 5UA. The first course will start in May 2000. It will consist of five full-day sessions, from10.00am to 4.00pm, on consecutiveTuesdays. For dates of subsequent courses,please contact the Course Office. The cost of the course is \u00a3600 per participant. Partial bursaries may beavailable. For details, please contact theCourse Office. Postgraduate Education Allowance A certificate of attendance will be given toall participants. PGEA approval has beenapplied for.

I had known the man a 31-year -old patient for over five years; his English was not perfect but more than adequate forordinary daily conversations and consultations. The first time I saw him with his painful limp I made sure he was well; he could move his joints and I advised that he should use some painkillers since I thought the work-related fall had resulted in a pulled muscle . I mentally noted his ethnic group and suggested that he had baseline blood tests nothing fancy just a full-blood count and ESR and basic electrolytes. I think I evenasked what he thought it was and yes, he agreed, it was a pulled muscle . The onedifficult and distracting sign was his limp as he pointed out to me many times an old ankle injury on the same side from his days in a country south of the Equator.Not easily forgotten, but this was the first sign that all was not well; almost a type ofMurphy s law in w aiting: If it can go wrong, it will. Well, I saw him again and yes, the ESR was raised (to 61), so I did what all good academic physicians advise: reassess, repeat, and review. Two weeks later I saw himagain; the ESR had fallen to 31 but he said that things were the same . He then toldme he had private cover through work and I took full advantage of this; he was seen the following day by an eminent local consultant. I needn t have worried the orthopaedic sur geon agreed with everything I had suggested and fairly swiftly discharged him from the clinic. And anyway, the patientappeared better he was not back to his best, but then how could he with aseemingly chronic limp? You can imagine my surprise when, two months after last seeing him, my partner, who has a well-known, instinctive nose for those types of rare and glorious diagnoses,saw him with a hard, tender lump mid-way down his left thigh. The rest, as they say,is history. TB osteomyelitis. What are the lessons here? I am unsure except it seems banal to talk about high index of suspicion, and equally banal to acknowledge that TB is very common in the non-indigenous population. I thought I had done enough to consider and attempt diagnoses after all, why else would I bother to repeat blood tests, order X-rays (yes, these were all normal), and arrange follow-up. The concept that patients in general practiceare seen early in their disease is worth noting, so arrange follow-up where necessaryis a vital lesson for would-be GPs. Perhaps, despite a patient s wellness, we are supposed to continue to search out disease where there is no illness or signs of sickness (what would anthropologiststhink of this approach?). Who knows? Or perhaps it is simply that no matter howcompetent, professional, or on guard we are, medicine is at times genuinely difficultand occasions like this are designed to deter a natural, time-dependent complacency. Interestingly, I have only seen him once since the diagnosis but he appeared to harbour no ill-feeling towards me more a wariness of tests in general and hospitals.His wife sees me fairly regularly and hardly ever mentions the episode. I won t forget the family in a very long time.(Patient consent received.)GOV! The PCG clinical governance board gameThe PCG Resource Unit is a smallunit, working in the Public HealthResource Unit in Oxford. It is fundedby a grant from South East RegionR&D. The unit has been looking at anumber of aspects of PCGdevelopment, in particular the supportof clinical governance in primarycare. More information about theirwork can be found on their web site atwww.phru.org/pcgru . As a spin-off from their recent work they havedeveloped Gov! . Designed as an educational tool, Gov is proving to be an extremely popular and successful way ofdeveloping multi-professionalunderstanding of the issues of clinicalgovernance in primary care. It hasbeen used at a series of primary careworkshops to promote anunderstanding of clinical governanceThe evaluation by participants hasbeen very positive ... \"very thought provoking\" \"good fun but with a serious message\"\"needs to be sent to all PCGs and Health Authorities\" Anyone with a need to understand clinical governance issues better willwant to play this game, e.g. membersof PCG Boards and practice teams,GP registrars, and organisationsworking with primary care. Object of the game: Players work in teams to construct outline solutions tohypothetical problems or strategicissues. Each game pack includes two laminated A3 size boards with twofull sets of cards, dice, and counters,full instructions, and crib sheets forgame facilitators. The game could be readily adapted to other settings or to cover issuesparticular to one profession (e.g.dentists).

Themodern approach to anthropology has threeimportant features. First, anthropology neednot (and should not) be applied only to thestudy of other people(s) . Rather, it is animportant tool for revealing the basicassumptions and unwritten rules of thegroups, organisations, and societies in whichwe ourselves operate. The study of one s own cultural norms and expectationsrequires a dispassionate, distancingapproach, which has been described as making the familiar strange . Second, the customs and ideologies that make up a particular culture are not static.All societies, and all organisations, areconstantly evolving and changing. Acustom, ideology, or belief that is readilydemonstrated in 2000 may be less evident in2005 and hardly detectable in 2010 though the time course of major culturalchange is generally measured in decades orcenturies. Third, while culture is animportant influence on the beliefs andbehaviour of individuals, it should not bethought of as determining those beliefs orbehaviour. To a greater or lesser extent, theindividuals within a society, organisation orgroup choose to conform to, or resist, itsagreed frame of reference and unwrittenrules of behaviour. Organisational culture Anthropological analysis accepts that thereare three levels of cultural behaviour: whatpeople say they do (for example, during an interview), what they areactually observed to do, andthe underlying belief systemwhich drives that behaviour(Hall s primary levelculture ). 1Furthermore, the behaviour of any individual iscrucially influenced by thewider context in which thebehaviour takes place. EdgarSchein, Professor ofManagement at theMassachusetts Institute ofTechnology, applied Hall s framework to the culture oforganisations, as shown inFigure 1. 2Hunt has argued that an or ganisation s culture is essentially determined by fourvariables: people (who worksthere), strategy (theorganisation s broad goals and how it plans to achieve them),structure (how the organisationis made up and what technicalfacilities are available), andexternal pressures (Box 1). 3theories of change 4 340 The British Journal of General Practice, April 2000Change and the organisation: culture and context Handy's taxonomy of organisations Charles Handy, drawing on the work ofRoger Harrison, suggested that allorganisations can be broadly divided intofour cultural types: 4 1. Power culture , in which the organisation holds entrepreneurial values and is builtaround a charismatic leader (e.g. Microsoft,Virgin). Control is exercised mainly by theselection and deployment of keyindividuals; and influence is achievedmainly through person power .2. Role culture , which most of us would call bureaucracy and identify with large healthcare organisations (e.g. traditional NHShospitals), is characterised by a logical andvisible structure. Roles, and lines ofaccountability, are tightly defined by writtenjob descriptions. The role culture isessentially designed for programmed workand operates well in stable, predictable andcontrollable environment. 4 3. Task culture , in which the organisation, and the individuals and groups within it, areoriented towards doing a job or completing aproject. This organisation tends to beextremely flexible, group-oriented, andhighly responsive to change. However, itruns into problems when money and peoplehave to be rationed, whereupon individualsbecome demoralised, teams within theorganisation are forced to compete forresources, and top managers find themselvesimposing control through old-fashionedmeans. In short, and of crucial importance intoday s NHS, the task culture is inherently unstable and tends to change to a role orpower culture where resources are limited. 5 4. Person culture , in which the organisation itself is barely visible and exists only toserve the individuals within it classicallyillustrated by the hippy commune in whichthe organisation is no more than a place forthe individual to do their own thing . Theidiosyncratic senior partner who refuses toadapt to new rules typifies the person-oriented individual operating within a roleculture and, Handy warns, such peoplecan be extremely difficult to manage. In general, an increase in size pushes an organisation towards a role culture, as manyof us have found when a singlehanded ortwo-partner practice expands to three ormore. Rapidly changing technologiesrequire a task or power culture, but routineand programmable tasks (such as many aspects of monitoring, audit and qualitycontrol) may be better suited to a roleculture. Culture clashes within and between organisationsStarting a new job, coping with a change ofmanagement, or attempting to work acrossan interprofessional or inter-organisationalinterface, can often be unsettling andfrustrating. 6,7Discordance in aspects of organisational culture listed in Box 1,perhaps particularly the unspoken values,assumptions, and systems of meaning thatReferences 1.

Artefacts Espoused 1: Schein's three levels of organisational cultureThe British Journal of General Practice, April 2000 341underpin behaviour and decision-making, leads to a feeling that they areirreconcilably dif ferent from us and that progress cannot be made (at least, not until they c ome to their senses or are coerced into acquiescence). Perhaps the most frequently encountered clash in today s NHS is that between professional and management cultures(Boxes 2 and 3). Another, frequently playedout in the arena of evidence-based practice(see case study), is between academicculture (with its emphasis on controlled andmeasured interventions, rigour, precision,and reproducibility) and service culture(with its emphasis on making the best of thematerials and information available,maintaining harmony and job fulfilmentamong staff, responding flexibly toindividual needs, and keeping the customersatisfied). Finally, there is the clash betweenthe care culture of traditional nursing (which values support, empathy, effectivecommunication, and time) and the cureculture of acute medicine (which values accurate diagnosis, active intervention, andrapid and measurable changes in themarkers of disease). Case study: Introducing evidence-based medicine in a traditional general practice Dr Tessa Myers, 32, is a part-time lecturer in an academic department and a new partner in general practice. She is keen on evidence-based medicine and is already attempting to introduce majorchanges to her practice, including a computer upgrade, a link to the Internet, routine use ofevidence-based guidelines, generic prescribing from a practice formulary, and a weekly clinicalmeeting in which the management of particular cases is reviewed against best research evidenceobtained on-line from the MEDLINE or Cochrane database. Tessa's three partners (aged 63, 55, and 39) cannot seem to take this activity seriously. Denis Higgs, the senior partner, has begun to make jokes about whether the coffee is evidence-based.He reminds Tessa that he gets specialist advice whenever he asks for it from the appropriateconsultant, that no bureaucrat with an MBA is going to tell him what to prescribe for his patients,and that the practice as a whole \"has a policy of binning guidelines\". Clinical meetings alreadyhappen once a fortnight in partners' houses, and cases are discussed in congenial surroundingsover a meal. Tessa has prepared a written case for the changes she proposes, including a detailedcalculation of how many premature deaths might be prevented if their management ofhypertension became evidence-based. 12She is furious that her background paper has not even been considered by her partners. This case scenario demonstrates the very common clash in values and perspective between traditional clinical practice and the 'evidence-based' approach. In proposing what she sees assimple changes to 'the way things are done around here', Tessa is in reality mounting afundamental challenge to the other partners' basic assumptions and values. For example, her'solution' devalues the experience and expertise of senior colleagues, removes 'clinical freedom'(the GP's right to prescribe what he or she feels is the best medication for the patient), introducesan entirely new framework for decision-making, requires adjustment to new technologies, andundermines long-standing internal and external hierarchies and networks. 13 If she is to succeed in her quest to make the practice more evidence-based, Tessa must adopt arealistic strategy and time frame for addressing cultural change. 8She should begin with an achievable and non-threatening change that is more in step with the existing practice culture \u2014such as offering summaries of relevant research reviews as part of clinical case discussions inexisting partners' meetings. She might also ask her consultant colleagues to explain that theadvice they offer is from the same evidence-based sources that she wishes to install in the surgery.Finally, she might challenge her partners' protectionist attitude to clinical freedom obliquely ratherthan head-on \u2014 for example, by offering to help them all 'get on top of' the forthcomingrevalidation agenda. 9In this way, a proactive approach to evidence-based practice might be seen as a potential tool for protecting the GPs' clinical autonomy rather than as a threat to their corevalues.Box 1: Components of organisational culture (adapted from Hunt3and Bate8) The 'atmosphere' of the organisation; a system of meanings and interpretations; The code for 'how things are done around here'; Unspoken values and assumptions that underliehow things are done (see Figure 1); Standards used to define good or badperformance; Ways in which individuals are recruited, trained,promoted, controlled and rewarded; Stories and myths about what happened toparticular individuals or teams that behaved in acertain way; Organisational rituals such as journal clubs,ceremonies, social events, and so on; Subcultures and countercultures that exist inparallel with the 'official' version of the above. Box 2: Features of professionals (adapted from Simon11) Professions possess a body of knowledge and skills based on long periods of training anddemanded by society. They share a code of ethicsthat indicates how patients or clients should beserved and the social attitudes that should beaccepted. A profession is defined in terms of sixkey features:1.A body of knowledge or skill held as a common possession and united by extended effort.2.An educational process based on this body of knowledge for which the professional group as awhole has a recognised responsibility.3.A standard of qualification for admission to the professional group based on character, trainingand proved competence.4.A standard of conduct on courtesy, honour and ethics, which guides the practitioner in his or herrelationships with clients, colleagues and thepublic.5.A more or less formal recognition of status by colleagues and by the state as a basis of goodstanding.6.A professional organisation or group devoted to its common advancement and its social duty ratherthan the maintenance of an economic policy. Box 3: Features of managers (adapted from Simon)11 Managers' first allegiance is to their organisation. The knowledge they possess is derived from on-the-job training and experience within theorganisation. Management is characterised by:1.A broad body of expertise that is specific to a particular organisation and transferable withinthat organisation.2.A training process based on organisation- specific knowledge for which the organisationgenerally takes responsibility.3.A programme of career advancement focused on the internal labour market (i.e. withinthe organisation).4.An internal system of discipline implemented via line managers.5.A standard of conduct and code of ethics oriented to the advancement (usually economic)of the organisation.Acknowledgement I am grateful to Fraser MacFarlane and AlecLogan for helpful comments on earlier drafts ofthis paper.Conclusion Both organisational and professionalcultures are deep seated, pervasive,complex, and resistant to change. As Box 1shows, one important feature oforganisational culture is the collection ofwords, interpretations, stories, and mythswith which we construct the social world inwhich we work. 8The palpable sense of panic in many medical circles is partlyowing to the prevailing discourse on clinicalgovernance , riskmanagement language and value system ofmanagers rather than health professionals.There is no quick fix to this culturaldissonance, but an important start must be toconstruct and disseminate a narrative thatgives professional meaning to the changesrequired of us all a task that some writershave, thankfully, already begun. 9,10The next article in this series considers additionalstrategies for change. Trish Greenhalghfuturology 4 342 The British Journal of General Practice, April 2000Only one thing is certain, my biology teacher used to say: that nothing is certain. Havingworked for over a decade in clinical practice,the implication of this view is coming hometo roost as patients have more to say aboutthe decisions that affect their health care. Buta difficult tension exists between aconsumer s demand for informedparticipation and a patient s need to feelsupported in illness, directed towards bestsolutions and shielded from the anxiety ofambiguity. This gives uncerta inty a central position in many consultations and can createdifficulties when practitioners try to sharedata (if available) about an intervention sharms and benefits. This uncomfortable faceof professional honesty is part of a largerpattern of course, a shift towards more equalpartnerships within clinical exchanges. It is within this general trend that we can also observe professions being graduallydemystified. In 1972, Johnson published ashort monograph which ascribed three broadphases occurring within professionalorganisations, namely, patronage, collegiate,and mediated. 1These three phases can be easily seen within medicine. It was patronagethat largely supported physicians in theseventeenth century, when the wealthysought their advice. By the eighteenthcentury, physicians had engineered a collegiate profession . This trend was accompanied, indeed fuelled, by the rise ofhospitals, colleges and medical schools aprocess that had been spectacularlysuccessful at generati ng a cl ub attitude to the way medicine is practised and governed.The third phase is only just becoming visibleand involves a third-party mediation of theprocesses involved. Some see this phase asone of de-professionalisation. Doctors areincreasingly managed, appraised, directed byguidelines, and the basis of their expertise access to a unique bank of knowledge isbeing rapidly undermined as the Internetturns the tables on the difficulty of obtainingspecialist information. Add to theseaccelerating trends the move to investigateprofessional activities (as in Bristol forexample) and it becomes obvious thatclinicians face a situation where the profession of medicine (like others) is being re-defined into an accountable discipline thatcontains tightly monitored and regulatedprocesses. Acting as additional fuel, it iswidely recognised that the influence ofinformation networks, now accelerating aswireless access increases, will accelerate theshift of power within clinical consultations. 2 A third trend that requires clinicians to graspthe nettle of risk communication is theincreased availability of technologies that predict and prevent . 3The last few decades have been notable for their emphasis onanticipatory activities such as cervicalscreening, estimating cholesterol levels,providing breast mammography, undertakingblood pressure monitoring and so on. The new genetics heralds another wave of potential predictive interventions, andalthough the ethical and practicalimplications are not yet fully realised inmany of these areas, consumers naturallyhope for reassurance by pursuing negativetests. This trend inevitably drives both thedevelopment of investigations, such as theBRCA1 gene identification kits, and theconsequent demand for them, despite theirshortcomings, to the point that many suchgenetic tests are now commercially availableonline. There are signs, however, that the looming issue of informed co nsent may yet raise the importance of explaining risks into anotherdimension. A patient in the United States hassuccessfully prosecuted a case claiming thatshe was not fully informed about the chancesof a false-negative result. It is already knownthat patients are becoming more aware of theReferences 1. Johnson TJ. Professions and Power . 1972, London: Macmillan. 2. Jadad Times 30 December 1999): 14. 4. Schneider CE.

The spectre of medico-legalsurveillance for false-negative or false-positive outcomes may well be the signal thatpushes clinicians to take more time to ensurethat patients become fully informed about thelack of precision of both investigations, andthe possible harms that attend most medicalinterventions. The case for needing to explain risks and arrive at shared decisions becomes moreimperative when such issues are raised, evenif this is contrary to the level of support,guidance, and transfer or responsibility fordecision-making that patients often prefer,especially when ill or anxious. 4How then should practitioners go about it? There arethree essential components. Time,communication skills, 5and accurate data clearly presented so that both clinicians andpatients alike feel that they understand boththe relative and absolute risks of the possibleoutcomes, and have taken into account thebiases that the framing of information canintroduce (i.e. the difference between tellingsomeone that they have a one-in-ten chanceof dying as opposed to nine-in-ten chance ofliving). 6Clinicians will need to engage with patients to carefully distinguish between twofundamental concepts, which Adams hasreferred to as objective risk the risks that experts talk about, and perceived risk the lay person s o ften very different anticipation of future outcomes. 7Within this context, there is also a need for both government andconsumer groups to be realistic about risklevels. The extremely low risk of contractingnew variant CJD by eating beef hascompletely obscured debate about other morecommon and dangerous exposures ( E coli transmission by food handlers or routineantibiotic dosing of livestock). The risks ofmedical interventions need to be consideredwithin our broader societal context andcompared with the range of risks we face ona daily basis. 8 This process takes time. Decision-boards,interactive computer packages, andinstructional videotapes have been usedextensively as a means of enhancing (andoften substituting) the normal face-to-faceexchanges. 9They will become even more commonplace as technological access pointsto the Internet become as commonplace astelephones are today. The challenge forclinicians will be to adapt and use thesetechnologies and be prepared to undertakesearches for and appraise primary sources ofevidence when no readily available digestedpackages of data exist. 10In short, to adopt an evidence-based patient choice approach toclinical practice. 11The fact that the current health service finds it impossible to match theGetting personal The Internet may have shrunk the world but communication with inanimate objects in the here and now remainsfrustratingly obdurate.

Paul Hodgkin speed of advances in information technology will need to be tackled by policy makers.Clinicians faced with knowledgeable patientsand increasingly aware of their medico-legalresponsibilities will yearn for much morethan simplistic guidelines. They will need tobe able to have immaculate data retrievalsystems so that information about the harmsand benefits of hormone replacementtreatment are at their fingertips. The relativerisk of developing breast cancer may increaseby 30% or so after taking HRT but theabsolute risk levels are low, and consist of thedifference between 10% and 13%. Is thislevel of risk acceptable to achieve thecardiovascular and bone preservation benefitsportrayed in Figure 1, bearing in mind that atleast five years of therapy would be required? A simple histogram may be relevant to a clinician who is conversant with visualdisplays of numerical information but manypatients will find the concepts difficult tocomprehend. Tailoring these broadpopulation risks into more personal riskassessments (using family history and, in thisscenario, even genetic screening tests) willrequire some decisions to be structured into aseries of consultations, broadly based on theskills and stages of shared decision-making. 12 Achieving informed decision-making (robustenough to withstand legal scrutiny) willchange the way clinicians handle complexconsultations. Clinicians will probably needto be conversant with a range of decision-aidsso that they can either use them at the desktopor ask the patient to spend time in the practiceinformation room. This room is equippedwith interactive screens where validateddecision pathways can be explored. Thesemultimedia simulations of potential futureswill intersect clinical interactions and patientswill co-produce their management plans, inmuch the same way that consumers nowcollaborate in the design of a computerordered within an interactive web-site. 13 For most practitioners, even those who havedeveloped a patient-centred consulting style,this elaboration of decision-making will bechallenging. For many practitioners it willmean abandoning their assumptions aboutprofessional status and behaviour. Thegreatest dilemma will be to remain flexible aspatients develop these skills of assessing risksand benefits. There is no doubt that manypeople are ambivalent, even resistant to thedifficult tasks of becoming involved indecisions. But the ethical climate is changingand clinicians should learn to be alert andflexible to the preferred role of individualpatients in their health care management.What is difficult to comprehend, however, ishow this new information age fits into apublicly-funded health service that is audiblycreaking under the weight of the demandsplaced upon it. Glyn Elwynessay 344 The British Journal of General Practice, April 2000Until the twentieth century the history of making a living out of other people s baddays wasn t an especially edifying one. Now that medicine seems to be limited only by itsmeans, perhaps it s the vestigial memory of quackery, barber-shops, and that oddbusiness with leeches which makes theprofession unwilling to admit there arethings about the body that leave its observer,if not its tenant, nonplussed. Doctors, who,with the blessing of society at large, nowinstinctively think of themselves asprogressive people at the cutting edge of thepossible, get embarrassed and hot under thecollar about such nonplussing, particularlywhen it comes from the patient who mayhappen to be speaking a foreign language. When I started up my own practice in Strasbourg, where many of my patients doindeed speak in strange tongues, I sufferedsuch a double embarrassment; not merelyone over commonplace terms, but about thekind of bodily reality those terms expressed. The embarrassment was due to the fact that I didn t know what a crise de foie was or how to deal with it. In all my experience inmedicine, from the mother-country toseveral of its English-speaking daughters,I d never come across hepatic storm, anacute liver, bile acid build-up or anythingelse resembling this liverish state of being.Even my own sister, who wrote her PhDthesis on one of the major detoxificationpathways in the liver, the cytochrome P450system, had never heard of it. Somethingrare, such as acute intermittent porphyria,about which there s a film ( The Madness of King George ), but a crise de foie ? It was all the odder that such an alarmist dare I sayPascalian label be given to a conditionthat clearly wasn t in the least life- threatening or physically incapacitating:hadn t the patient just walked through the door unaided? So I did some reading. It s what Cecil Helman, in his book Culture, Health and Illness , calls a folk illness , a configuration of symptoms with no expression inbiomedicine, and for which a cultureprovides both an explanation and a methodof healing. There are other similarlytenacious folk illnesses across the world:amok in Malaysia, windigo in north-eastern America, dil ghirda hai ( sinking heart ) in the Punjab, brain fag in parts of Africa, nervios in Latin America, and even colds and chills in the English-speaking world. Bydefinition, each is embedded in its ownuniqueness; and I was still no closer tounderstanding what a crise de foie might be. It certainly had its polypharmacy, like everyother medical complaint in France: strangeelixirs containing oligoelem ents in snap- open glass capsules and eupepticgranulates to be taken ante cibum that were unknown to chemists in neighbouringcountries. That a symptom might be trivialCrise de Foie Illustration reproduced with kind permission from Impact Quotidien Mythic medicine: Iain Bamforth looks back on threeyears of practice in France, and theweight of the liver in Frenchculture. Amateur etymologists (andthose who can still rememberschool French) may be interested toknow that the French word for theliver ( le foie), which is allegedly derived from the Greek termsykoton meaning stuffed with figs , is homophonic with something inshort supply these days: faith ( la foi).The British Journal of General Practice, April 2000 345is a value judgement not permitted to a nation of amateur body theorists. But whatsymbolic weight did the liver have for theFrench? Why was being liverish the mal national ? Come to think of it, being liverish sounded too literary, too poetic, to be muchof a symptom; in fact, it suggested port andportly gentlemen in one of Cruickshank s orRowlandson s m erciless copperplate etchings of quacks and society characters inthe eighteenth century, when the cure wasalmost always worse than the disease. One thing about reading, it takes you places where people don t even speak French. A patient with a crise de foie always seems to have the following symptoms: he feelsbloated, has a thick head (but not necessarilyheadache), waterbrash (a bad taste in themouth), lassitude, and a general feeling ofwhat Kafka once told his diary was sea-sickness on dry land . It seems to resemblewhat most stolid folk would call a hangover(gueule de bois in French) and doctor s dyspepsia, arriving like bad weather themorning after social occasions withoutnecessarily having had anything to do withrapid induction of mixed-function oxidases.Hitherto, my examinations of such peoplehave usually been as the phrase goes unrevealing. My response is usually tosound sympathetic and tell him (nearlyalways a him) to take a couple ofparacetamol and change his diet. Primum non nocere . Some doctors even stick more out of curiosity than conviction,presumably an acupuncture needle intothe cure-all Liv 3 point which is on thedorsal side of the foot between the first twotoes. The once famous moral tract Trait\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine G\u00e9n\u00e9rale (still in print) recommends water only for 24 hours,vegetable broths, herbal teas, light meals, noalcohol and sleep , a regimen not likely tooffend anybody s common sense. But I often have the impression that such a pragmaticresponse falls short of expectations,especially when the liver can excite suchpurple passages as this: Her Shen was low.This could be seen in the bronze colour ofher face, the slightly rolled-back position ofher eyeballs and her fatigued demeanour.Her pulse was wiry and rapid, indicatingUprising of Liver Fire syndrome(Acupuncture in Medicine 11.96). True enough, Chinese meridians make a big deal out of the liver. But what turns this littleoutpouch of endoderm, tucked above theyolk sac stalk, into the seat of humanity? Inphysiological terms, the liver is the body s(extremely efficient) sewage-plant, proteinproducer, and sugar and fat regulator. It salso the biggest organ, and its right-regalsize may well explain its preponderance incultural affairs. A critical liver is a leftover from Galenic medicine and medievaltheories of the spirits (in fact, Galenbelieved that the liver was the receptacle ofthe natural spirit, as opposed to the vital and mental sp irits lurking in the heart andbrain respectively); but while a recent evening-long search through Rabelaisprovided me with lots of extravagantremedies and nostrums, and the splendidline for I love you with all my liver ,nothing very clearly emerged which mightexplain the quintessential liver in all itsmajesty, nor all the sublime hot air it hasgiven rise to in French medicine. I thereforeconcluded that, French or otherwise, theliver is a signal instance of how we all thinkmagically about our bodies. Not that ourbodies are magical, but nobody, not even themost brick-headed enzymologist, is likely toview his liver in terms which exclude itsmiraculous ability to exempt him from toxiclapses. My own explanation therefore errstowards the Promethean. Everyone remembers one thing about Prometheus ( forethinker ): he had such arush of feeling for early man (in mythologyman always starts out as just man) that hegave him a spark of fire he d stolen fromZeus as it slowly smouldered in a tube offennel (a penis substitute according toFreud, though such a conflation would seemto overlook the dampening effect of thepenis s other emanation). The myth is more intricate. Prometheus had been one of theassistants at the headbirth of Athene; latershe d taught him all the applied artsincluding architecture, astronomy, andnavigation. Decently enough he passed themon to his creatures. But a piece ofexpediency led to his eventual downfall: heshowed Homo sapiens how to leave Zeus the bones and gristle when the sacrificedanimals were apportioned. Asked toadjudicate in a dispute at Sicyon, in thenorth-eastern Peloponnese, Prometheusflayed an ox and made two bags of its skin;one containing all the prime cuts with thetripe on top (in the hierarchy of organs thestomach was always the least favoured part),the other the bones hidden under a layer offat. What the easily duped Zeus chosebecame the divine portion. According toHesiod, in what is the first historical accountwe have of the myth, Zeus, very touchyabout his status as top god, and notappreciating Prometheus s dupery, thendecided as a punishment that humans wouldhave to eat their meat raw. It wasPrometheus s next act stealing an ember from the sun-chariot and wrapping it in afennel stalk so that dads could forever afterpreside at the ceremony of the barbeque which brought out Zeus s really inventiveside, his vindictiveness: he made thebeautiful but simpering Pandora ( all-gifts ) a gift being, as the German language reminds us, nothing other than poison and sent her to Prometheus s brother,Epimetheus, who specialised inafterthoughts. Her receptacle, as we know toour cost, contained all the spites and evils,like Vice, Labour, Bipolar Disorders, andGeriatric Infirmity, that have subsequentlyplagued the world, and made lesser evils likedoctors necessary in order to distract thespites from their original mission.And once the spites had flown the jar andnearly caused Pandora and Afterthinker todie from anaphylactic shock, what was left?A booby-prize called Hope, which musthave been heavier than air to get stuckinside; it was the only thing left whichprevented their descendants, driven out oftheir minds by the spites, from doing awaywith themselves. Prometheus theFire-Carrier, ended up inthe Caucasus, his liver being pecked outdaily by an eagle and then regeneratingovernight. Which sounds like the modernbiomedical concept of the liver. Only therock, insisted Kafka in his minuscule fableabout Prometheus, is the really inexplicablepart of the legend. So much for Prometheus and the longwindedness of evolution, since thedescendants of the eagle stopped pecking hisliver and started nesting in his rib-cage, andPandora s gift, it became clear in time, was a black box to tell us what had happened tothe heroic days when the gods mixed it withhumankind. But the myth made me think of the French again, confused as only a deeplyconservative people can be by their self-appointed role, for the last few hundredyears, as the fire-carriers of modernity.Progress is no less an exhausting idea thanits opposite: to think our bodies a metaphorfor the decrepitude of the world. A crise de foie must therefore be a kind of chronological vertigo a morning sretributive visitation for sitting down thenight before to sup nectar, in that sense ofcomplete and utter well-being the Frenchexude only at the dinner table, as ifmagically ushered back from the state ruledby Reason to those lands of gastronomicabandon Cockaigne and Schlaraf fia where the day s only order is the tripartite call to table. Botanising with their palates, asit were, in a world sealed against phasaleating stations, buns on the run , and thegolden M sign. Yet cuisine and apocalypse come together rather neatly in Frenchconsumptive habits, as seen to good effect inMarco Ferreri s painful film La Grande Bouffe (1973), in which three men asphyxiate themselves to death on everygastroglobal delicacy money can buy.Diagnosis? Fast food, slow food: myths arestratagems which enclose their opposites.And livers follow a cannibal logic. We haveto sleep on them and they have to processthose terrifying opposites, faith and doubt,which they do without fuss until dawncomes out, not rosy-fingered as Homer hasit, but with a grey hair or two. Now you know the answer to the biliously rhetorical question once posed as a title bythe sociologist of man at the end of histether, Jean Baudrillard. What are you doingafter the orgy? Going to see the doctor, ofcourse. Iain Bamforthdigest 346 The British Journal of General Practice, April 2000Having been searching for several years for a suitable text to guide genetics services inprimary care, it is a pleasure at last torecognise this book as amply fulfilling therequirements. Rose is a general practitioner and Lucassen a consultant in clinical genetics. Althoughbilled as joint authors this is really a multi-author book. Each is responsible for his/herown chapters and there are two otherauthors. The text is clear and the emphasis is on the practical problems likely to be encountered.There is a generous quotation of casehistories, often accompanied bycorresponding family pedigrees. Excellentpatient information sheets are reproduced.There are numerous tables supplementingand summarising the text. The appendicesinclude information on all the regionalgenetics centres, genetic sites on the internetand a glossary of genetic terms. The section on what is called Basic Genetics is less inspiring than it might be. The mechanisms which control thereplication of chromosomes and their DNAare fascinatingly complex yet molecularlylogical. Lucassen provides all the necessaryinformation but if you seek a true insight Irecommend reading The Book of Man by Walter Bodmer and Robin McKie. From then on it is admiration all the way. I can mention only a few important examples.We are guided through taking a familyhistory, including the construction of afamily pedigree. Peter Rose emphasises thatthe counselling skills required by all generalpractitioners need only minor modificationto accommodate the requirements ofgenetics. There is a very fine chapter onfamilial cancers by Anneke Lucassen. Thediscussion of breast cancer is outstanding,making it clear that the majority of patientsand their doctors, worried by the patient sfamily history, greatly exaggerate the risk tothe patient. Because this is such a commonlypresenting problem, the potential forreducing unnecessary anxiety and theavoidance of unnecessary referrals is vast. Iwould like to see this section published as aseparate booklet and distributed to allpractices. There is a useful chapter on ethical issues. The problem unique to genetics, that any teston an individual almost always hasimportant implications for other familymembers, is rightly emphasised. This isparticularly difficult, indeed probablyinsoluble, if relatives have explicitly statedthat they do not want to know. There is a finechapter on the patient s perspective contributed by Aamra Darr, a member of thelay Genetic Interest Group. And of coursethere is much more. I can enthusiasticallyrecommend this book. While the authors are to be highly congratulated, the publishers deserve a sharprap over the knuckles. There are manyincorrect word substitutions which are thehallmark of too great a reliance on computerspell checkers. Fetus is spelled in two different ways on two successive pages.There are many summary boxes, which isfine, but not if they are poorly placed so thatthey spread over more than one page.Understandably, there are many crossreferences in the text to other chapters. Yetthe chapter number is not carried forward asa running heading to each page so that thereader has to go back to the contents page tofind the desired chapter. Finally the ultimate disgrace in my copy of the book30 pages were duplicated and 30 pages weremissing. Clifford Kay As an architect, I have spent my career working on Urban Renewal Projects inGlasgow. As I gained experience it becameclear to me that the improvements takingplace will only be successful, when theresidents are involved at all levels in thedecision-making process. Redevelopingcommunities blossomed when the localresidents were allowed to become involvedas partners in the process. Ruth Chambers,comes to similar conclusions from a GPperspective, quoting communitydevelopment work in Newcastle upon Tyne.She demonstrates how primary carepractitioners came to regard the communityas key asset in creating solutions andbecame responsive to the community sview . The question on the mind of the NHS and my Local Health Co-ops (LHCC) is howto Achieve a meaningful dialogue withpatients and the general public . Thispaperback is topical and, as I am workingwith my LHCC on a method to involve thepublic, I read it looking for real answers andsolutions.

It is to the credit ofHollywood that it has made soremarkable a film, one thatpaints so grim a picture of thehidden horrors of the suburbandream. As fast as the film debunks the traditional bourgeois life, itapplauds alternatives theonly happy couple in the filmare gay, and the dope-pushingvoyeur next door is the onlycharacter who knows what hewants and knows how to get it.Kevin Spacey s deci sion to get out of the corporate life byblackmailing his bosses isclearly pointed up as the rightone, and his life is transformedfor the better. This liberalismseems rather hard to reconcilewith some pretty brutal viewsof women. The most obvioustarget is the female lead(Annette Bening), an estateagent who has an affair with acommercial rival whose onlyattraction is his financialsuccess. Their scenes togetherare always comic, especially thesex. For its acting, its look, and above all its writing, this is anexceptional film. Its success isillustrated by the extent towhich whole scenes live in thememory, and like a great play itonly improves with repeatedviewing.

The variousexercises have associated examples of howthe technique proposed was useful inparticular circumstances, with the necessaryreferences at the end of each chapter. Ratherthan reinventing the wheel , it is essential tobe able to choose a method of consultationappropriate to the purpose and availableresources. To avoid tokenism the patients orcommunity group should be carefullytargeted and appropriate methods used toobtain the information or to enablepartnership working. Ruth Chambersadvises at the start: T ake stock why do it at all? I consider this to be good advice as it is fundamental to know why theinvolvement exercise proposed is to becarried out and a strategy plannedaccordingly. Greater patient involvement inthe choices and planning of their healthcarewill be demanded in the future, health careprofessionals have a duty to examine theappropriate techniques to make patientinvolvement central and meaningful. I have found the book very valuable and informative and will use the methodsdescribed to involve the public in theexciting prospect of improving the NHS,and providing health gain. Ruth Chambers states: There is some evidence that well-informed patients whoactively share in decisions about treatmenthave more favourable health outcomessurely this prospect is worth pursuing. Tom Reilly The question mark in the title of this book sets the tone for a far-ranging discussionwhich problematises the concept of patient demands in other words, it casts a criticaleye over both professional views (includingclinical models of need) and social sciencemodels which seek to explain the gapbetween symptoms and service use. Rogerset al employ a broad definition of primary care, that includes community pharmacistsand complementary therapies, as well asinformal, or lay, networks, thus reflectingthe everyday concerns and contexts ofpeople s involvement in health and health care (page 26). One of the important achievements of this volume is its capacity to speak to GPspersonal experience, acknowledging theresonance of the heartsink patient , whileexamining GPs own role in creating demand. I particularly liked the section thatexamines the prominence accorded to symptoms (pages 55 59). The distinction between clinical icebergs and icebergs ofmorbidity is clearly explained and is helpful in explaining apparently conflicting arguments. This chapter also presents a thoughtful discussion of the role of co- morbidity and the chronic illness careerwhich may involve patients accommodating to symptoms with a resultant decrease in consultations. The ensuing discussion, which draws usefully on the authors own empirical research, provides compelling evidence of the importance of patient action and viewsin understanding the complexities involved in help-seeking and health care utilisation. The authors call for a reappraisal of policyand practice responses, arguing that we need to move on from analysing need to developing strategies to deal with it which take account of the diversity and complexity of patient action (for different groups and atdifferent points in people s lives); the importance of organisational factors and social resources (including patientscircumstances and the availability of both lay and professional networks). While Rogers et al are optimistic about the potential of PCGs and Trusts, NHS Direct and Health Action Zones to develop moreresponsive services, they acknowledge the challenges associated with such changes to the culture of health care and recognise theprofessional and organisational barriers that are likely to constrain new developments. The authors provide very useful summaries of research findings in a number of important areas, such as patterns of GP consultations and use of community pharmacies, and the book will thus alsoserve as a valuable resource for those involved in teaching and research. Nevertheless, the layout of the book, inplaces, strikes me as somewhat arbitrary; for example, the separation of the chapter on Lay action and the formulation of demand into sections on how the experience of illness and service use shapes help-seeking ; the influence of individuals action and social networks on help-seeking ; and self- and lay-care in managing illness . There is adetailed breakdown of contents that somehow manages not to be self- explanatory; this could prove to be a difficult book to dip into. Although, as a fellow sociologist, I was comfortable with the terminology used, I suspect that the use of terms such as discourses and the description of definitions of need as contested might irritate or confuse practitioners in equal measure.

At overthree hours long it is certainly anaccomplished film, as anticipated by thepundits on the basis of the director sprevious film, Boogie Nights . In essence there are several story-lines, each intersected by another a l\u00e0John Altman in Short Cuts . The setting is 24 hours in Los Angeles and the lives of twodying men and their families, the membersof which are either seemingly close orestranged. The human condition isportrayed in various states of emotionalturmoil. At the centre is Earl Partridge(Jason Robards), a once-famous televisionproducer, now literally on his death-bedand struggling against pain, regret , andthoughts of his son, whom he has not seenfor five years. The latter is Frank Mackey(an unlikely Tom Cuise), a lecherous,combative, evangelical misogynist whoalmost gets his comeuppance with a femaleTV interviewer. He is sheer magic a malevolent Southern State preacher on heatwould be a fair description in hisattempts to persuade the male audience on how to fake being nice and caring and more. Frightening stuff. In addition, Partridge s wife (Julianne Moore), who freely admits that she cheatedon him and married for money, nowrealises she loves him. Her self-loathing isreal and immediate and sends her to theedge. Another TV man, Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall), a compre of child-versus-adult knowledge game-shows, faces hisimpending death alone. His misdemeanouris in possibly molesting his own daughter(Melora Walters). She is addicted tococaine and, in yet another portion of film,agrees to go out on a date with a Christiancop from the LAPD (John C Reilly). Hehas a heart of gold but is apt to lose important equipment like his gun during a chase. Other characters includeWilliam Macey as a down-and-outsalesman and closet homosexual who needsto keep working for corrective oral surgerythat he doesn t need (wasn t he brilliant in Fargo ?). The film does not have the overall coherence of Short Cuts and is surreal in places especially the singing episode. But the denouement is absolutely unique and one leaves the cinema in a state of uttershock. Anderson s use of a film-score that almost drowns out the dialogue as in hisprevious film is odd since the dialogueis key. Three Oscar nominations? Go see,and judge for yourself. Surinder Singh348 The British Journal of General Practice, April 2000 reflectionGratitude Enjoying work depends on its rewards. It may be rewarding because of its intrinsicinterest, or because it is well paid, but themost important reward is being valued. AsJames Le Fanu and others have recentlypointed out, morale among doctors in theUnited Kingdom has been falling, as isevidenced by recruitment to generalpractice, early retirement, and failure topursue a career in medicine. 1The chief reason for this, according to my thesis, isthat is that doctors no longer feel valued,often by management, sometimes by theirseniors, but most importantly by theirpatients. For those from an older generation, like myself, what made general practice arewarding career was not being overpaid,not dramatic or life-saving diagnoses, butbeing thanked. When I started in generalpractice I was almost without usefultherapies but my efforts, useless as most ofthem were by the criteria of evidence-basedmedicine, were appreciated and people weregrateful for my concern. This appreciationhad something to do with the sense that Iwas a personal doctor and a lot to do withthe self-limiting natural history of many ofthe illnesses about which I was consulted.Christmas was enriched by presents ofwhiskey and wine, a hand knitted jersey, andmuch else. After death, relatives often gavepieces, furniture or pictures, as somethingby which the deceased would beremembered. I am sure that today many ofmy colleagues are still being so recognised.However, much more important than thesephysical tokens were the daily rewards ofnon-verbally expressed gratitude. How has it come about that doctors are more fearful of being sued than confident thattheir efforts will be appreciated, especiallysince modern therapeutics has so much tooffer? I am sure that the doctor in a certainfamous painting was thanked for his uselessvigil. What is certain is that being thankedhas little to do with technical competence orskill. Indeed, it is part of experience thateffusive thanks are more likely from thosewhich we have mismanaged than from thosewhom we have managed well. The need to be appreciated is universal and being appreciated is the key to a happychildhood. At the moment, junior hospitaldoctors in the NHS are unhappy and arevociferously seeking shorter working hoursand more pay. The underlying reason is thatthey do not feel that their efforts areappreciated, either by patients, bymanagement, or, at least to some extent, bytheir seniors. In hospital, patients seldom have a personal relationship with their junior doctors. Fromthe patient s perspective the doctors simply ask questions, make notes, take blood, putup drips and disappear. From the doctor sperspective the demands of the job, the longhours, and simple fatigue do not allow thepossibility of sitting and holding hands. The lack of appreciation has much to do with the near death of the personal doctor. 2It has been shown that patients prefer single-handed practices despite the relative lack ofancillary staff, less expensive premises, andsometimes the absence of appointmentsystems. Such practices are preferredbecause people are able to identify with asingle other person whom they feel iscommitted to their interest. One of the happyconsequences is loyalty. There is an increasing tendency to believe that transmuting patients into clients or users will make a contribution to reducing the inequality which exists between doctorand patient. This is nonsense because itdenies the reality of the subjectiveexperience of illness. Consumers shoparound and clients look for value. Highstreet medicine providing impersonalservice and convenience fails to meet theneeds of those who are ill and fearful. Beingill demands that we find somebody in whomwe may place our trust and if we aresuccessful we will, in due course andregardless of the outcome, return. Gratitude is a gut feeling, satisfaction is intellectual. The unprecedented growth ofalternative or complementary therapies mayreflect the frequent lack of a personalrelationship between physician and patient.The laying on of hands has symbolicmeaning and creates intimacy. In so muchthat many such therapies involve touch,people are comforted by their experience. Illness and the accompanying inevitable move towards dependency demands morethan accurate diagnosis and evidence-basedmedicine. Physicians are not judged by their acumen or their intellect, they are judged by theirhumanity. By relative neglect of the personas a unique and suffering individual theprofession is in danger of forfeiting the rightto appreciation. Technical competence and evidence-based medicine are an inadequate response to thehuman predicament. We are paying a pricefor the death of the personal doctor. Trustand compassion may stink of paternalism (ormaternalism) but without them medicinestinks. 3 James McCormick References 1. Le Fanu J. The rise and fall of modern medicine.

Tony AveryThe British Journal of General Practice, April 2000 349Negative and bitter emotions such as anger, hatred, jealousy, rage, fear, and frustration arecommonly encountered in clinical work. Butso too are expressions of positive andpleasurable feelings. Joy, happiness, and lovecan be spontaneously revealed in facialexpression and in posture, laughter, gestureand, touch. 1Patients sometimes assert they are in love or that their partner does not know what love is . They fall in love ,become lovesick , and may perceive theeffects of love as a drug or pain . T hese emotional states may even underlie thepresenting problem. A recent book, Love Stories , has been recommended for anyone with even a passing interest in humanity. 2 But what is love? The question is importantsince, in the clinical consultation, rational andemotional elements are interwoven; 3without emotions, we are nothing4 The Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines love as: that state of feeling with regard to aperson which arises from recognition ofattractive qualities, from sympathy, or fromnatural ties, and manifests itself in warmaffection and attachment . But does thisdefinition adequately describe personalexperience? To explore this question weundertook a MEDLINE and PsychLITsearch. The passionate, romantic, andbehavioural aspects of love, its pathologies,love needs, and expressions and treatment ofthe lovesick have been examined. Theapproaches are, however, disappointinglyprosaic and objective. More enticingly, in thetimes of the ancient Greeks, Platodistinguished physical from sexual love andintroduced his ladder of love in which the love of beauty and truth supersedes physicallove. Aristophanes went further and believedlove to be the desire to reunite with the losthalf of the world and return to the originalstate of unified joy. Honor\u00d8 de Balzac believed it to be the poetry of the senses .The Bible, Corinthians 13, speaks poeticallyof the qualities love has and what it is not.Shakespeare says: Love looks not witheeyes, but with the mind , but later adds Norhath Love s mind any judgement taste (Midsummer Night's Dream , Act I, Scene 1). The evidence of the poets is, however, asconflicting as it is voluminous. Their versesreport for example that: Love is heaven andheaven is love ; Love is a sickness full ofwoes ; Love is a growing or full constantlight ; Love is more cruel than lust ; Love isnot love which alters when it alteration finds ;or, more cynically, love begins when yousink in his arms and ends with your arms inthe sink ! Children, like adults, can be equally affected by its impact. We sought their views as thespontaneous, imaginative, enthusiastic, andhonest expression of children up to the age of10 years is recognised. 5Sarah, aged six years, reported that it is something nice inside you ;her brother Michael, being a year older, addedknowledgeably that it jumps out as a heart .Tom, aged nine years, suggested we were barking mad to even consider the subjectand informed us that football was his first and only love. Lauren, aged 10 years, describedlove to us as a great big red hot fire insideyou that can make you very happy . Ourinquiries also revealed that Laura, aged nineyears, when asked by her mother how theschool day had been, excitedly announcedthat it had been wonderful, as being there andseeing Johnny, aged 11, had: made mytummy go all funny . To explore possible sexdifferences, a class of eight- to nine-year oldschoolchildren were invited by their teacherto write down comments, thoughts, feelings,and impressions about love girls rose happily to the challenge and wrote one ormore pages; the boys looked blankly back atthe teacher for a full 10 minutes beforelabouring over one or two sentences, pausingevery few minutes to ask: Do I have to dothis? Yet a mong adults it has been reasoned that most of our complex emotional needs canbe summarised as the need for love and thatmen and women each have six unique loveneeds that are all equally important: menprimarily need trust, acceptance,appreciation, admiration, approval, andencouragement; women primarily needcaring, understanding, respect, devotion,validation, and reassurance. 6 So what can we conclude? It seems that thedelight, excitement, wonder, pain, pleasure,and enigma of love is intensely personal,highly subjective, and individuallymanifested. When experienced, adequatedefinition defies objective expression. Yet lifedepends on it. Nevertheless, much as they aresought in life, positive, pleasurable feelingsand states of being often remain elusive. AsEpictetus, a first century Greek philosophernoted: men are disturbed not by things, butthe views they take of them . In our times ithas been reported that: we clinicians canlove our patients and the populations they arepart of only when we can comprehend theneeds of both, in emotional as well as clinicaland epidemiological terms . 7For these needs, empathy, intuition, support, and directivethinking are important skills to help ourpatients derive more pleasure from life. 3,8 They are particularly appreciated by patients.9 Application of these skills can also lead togreater professional pleasure and our love ofclinical practice. 10,11 They are encompassed within the RCGP motto: Cum scientiacaritas science with humanity and feeling.However, humanity is a longed for and oftenelusive quality in medicine . 12A recent Nuffield Trust Working Group defined it as: the study of human nature and the practice of concern for the advancement of mankind swelfare . 13Yet it has been reasoned that no medical school can teach a young person howto be understanding and caring. This cancome only from the experience of life . 14 It seems, therefore, that as love can enhanceall our lives, it should in all its dimensions befully explored, appreciated, and enjoyed withour patients.

Also, guidelines ondiscretionary duties of the President havebeen approved, in respect of the issue ofawards/fellowships in exceptionalcircumstances, such as a terminally illcandidate who might not live in time forhis/her award to be ratified at the AGM.Council has agreed that the President cantake Chairman s action to award Fellowship or a high award to those doctors whosenames have been approved by Council forFellowship but who are seriously ill. Improved guidelines on Honorary Fellowship, Membership under Ordinance 3(c) (previously known as Ordinance 3(d))and the Kuenssberg Award were alsoapproved by Council during the year. Forinformation on these and any other Collegeawards, please contact Princes Gate. Council s paper on Tackling Racial Discrimination was supported by the Committee. Most College awards bycompetition are now anonymised to preventdiscrimination. It is hoped the increasedopenness and transparency with procedureswill also help achieve this. The Committee conducted a survey during the year of the range of awards within thefaculties. There is now a full analysis fromall replies received and it is hoped this willeventually be published in College Awards.Also, the Committee has prepared a grid ofall senior College individuals, other seniornational figures, and award winners toensure that no particular individual isoverlooked when considering nominationsfor awards. The Fellowship Committee was joined by Dr Patricia W ilkie, Chairman, Patients' Liaison Group as an ex officio member; this is the first time in the history of the Collegethat a lay member has joined the FellowshipCommittee. During the year, the Committee concentrated on producing new guidelinesfor Fellowship by Nomination these arethe biggest changes since Fellowship of theCollege was first established and have beenput into effect for the first time with thisyear s recommendations for Fellowship.These were drawn up following concernexpressed in previous years about lack ofequity between faculties, secrecy about theprocess, and an absence of systems to ensureavoidance of discrimination. The newguidelines are based on the principle thatcriteria and their interpretation forFellowship should be as objective,measurable, and as transparent as possibleand that there should be patient involvementin the process. The Committee supported therecommendations of the Council reportTackling Racial Discrimination and will bemonitoring the ethnic status of new Fellowsfrom this year. The Committee, with the Awards Committee, considered a survey of otherCollege s procedures regarding posthumous Awards. It has now produced someprocedures for future Chairmen aboutdiscretionary duties of the President in therare case of a terminally ill candidate forFellowship by nomination. Council hasagreed that the College should adopt acompassionate approach to Fellowship andAwards and that it was undesirable fordistinguished members to be deniedFellowship or a high award through illnessor death after Council had approved theirname. Following its discussion on the new Fellowship procedures, Council has askedthe Committee to look at the possibility ofseparating the awards of Fellowship byNomination and Fellowship by Assessment.The Committee is reviewing this in relationto the increasing need for patients to haveexplicit information about the meaning ofdoctor s qualifications, includingFellowship.Awards and Fellowship Committees: activities during 1999The British Journal of General Practice, April 2000 351neville goodman Cynicism People wonder why I m cynical. One ofour trainees asked me, Is there anythingyou ve actually liked in the variouschanges to the NHS? The answer is thatI can t remember any. That s not because there haven t been any good changes, but because there s no point wasting mental energy on good things. I m a columnist: Iprickle; therefore I am. I was shown anewspaper headline, Stop moaning! ,with the suggestion I should take notice.No chance! Take last year s government strategy to cut waiting lists. The Waiting ListWorking Group, a Department of Health-funded body, produced a reportcontaining facts and figures, descriptionsand strategies, graphs and flowcharts: acomprehensive document on how waitinglists arise, where blocks occur in thesystem, and how these blocks can becircumvented or removed. As anexample: look at your clinic activity, lookfor no-shows, look for seasonalvariations in these data is thereanything that can be done to increaseactivity? The report was a ring-bound, glossy, multi-coloured, A4-sized volume, 21 mmthick and weighing 1.46 kg. Parcel Force,who delivered it, charge \u00a33.55 for thatweight. Parcel Force may charge theDoH less than they charge your averagepunter, but the cost of just publishing,printing, and delivering this tome mustbe considerable quite a few hipreplacements or cataract removalsanyway. For reasons that escape me, the binding was bottom to top rather than side toside, which made this already large bookdifficult to handle. To give an idea of thesolidity of the contents, page 15 had justtwo short sentences printed on it, in acoloured box in the centre of a pageotherwise blank except for the header andfooter. The first sentence read: Treatment of patients is a core function of the NHS. The government has imposed all sorts of untested grand schemes which they try toconvince us will turn the dear oldordinary NHS into something it calls theNew NHS. Conspicuous to their ideas isthat all this will happen within availableresources (give or take a flu epidemic or two). Yet something that couldreasonably be produced in a smallpamphlet without in any way being cheap is inflated to fill many times the necessary space. What are doctorsexpected to think of this? Especiallywhen some of the statements madewithin its pages are either an insult to ourintelligence or an indication of theirs. Red Shoes I 'Wear these shoes,my love,and dance for your Daddy.' She laughed then, clapped her hands. II She wielded so many knivesin each hand, she became a blurof steel, catching and sparkingblades of light to chop out laughter, singing,dancingcut by mummy's voice'Stop That - Now.'It'll end in Tears'; to ward off daddy's hand slippersgnaw 'Dance to Daddy's tune, my love, dance.' She knows the only way for a girlto be safe is to slice her selffrom her body. Only an axe at the anklecan remove slippersbuckled to flesh;even then, her butchered feetin scarlet silkwill pirouette before herevery time she tries to laugh. Now, though she's hobbled on wooden feetinto marriage, motherhood:the meat cleaver's still theredancing,ready. IV She watches the hammerjig on the anvilto beat that living glowright out of the steel:takes the tempered blades, pares Daddy out of her mind,and hurls the knives up and away,a blue brightness winking in the sunso she can jive -feel herself in heart, brain and toes;her skirt is a bellunder outstretched hands,her laugh a bannerof scarlet silk. Gillie Bolton g.bolton@sheffield.ac.ukbruce charlton Philosophical Confessions Philosophy: a good or bad thing? Discuss.Sometimes I see myself as essentially a philosopher at others I see philosophy as an essentially bogus activity. Perhaps these statements are mutually reinforcing? Take Ludwig Wittgenstein (please). He created an amazing mystique around his own personality and work by continually accusing other people of misunderstanding ormisrepresenting him. The few people who gave an accurate account of his views wereaccused of having stolen them. I spent four years trying to understand why I was not supposed to be able to understand Wittgenstein. Trying to understand why something that seemed obvious (but mistaken) wassupposed to be beyond my comprehension (but true). Once you get enmeshed in this world,it is pretty difficult to find your way out again. Banal utterances are interpreted as profunditieswhich the reader is simply too crass to appreciate, statements that appear idiotic are reframedas further evidence of the reader s lack of moral seriousness. False statements are not wrong,they are deep. * * * Philosophy started with aspirations to be the Queen of Sciences the one route to eternal and objective truth. W ell, it hasn t worked out th at way. What remains of philosophy , as we stand on the cusp of the twenty-first century, is a mere rump of what has been left behind afterthe successful disciplines have been subtracted. Stunningly successful branches ofknowledge, such as Mathematics, the Natural Sciences, and History, were once parts ofphilosophy but have now set up shop in their own right. Indeed, as soon as any branch ofphilosophy starts to make any serious progress, it stops being philosophy. No wonder thatphilosophy never provides any answers and seems to be going nowhere. And yet, and yet I still keep reading philosophy. Albe it, the philosophers whom I admire tend to be dismissed by professional philosophers as not doing philosophy : Nietzsche, forexample. But then, professional philosophers are just a bunch of people who have a salariedjob with the title of philosopher . So who cares what they think? But, in a way, the professional philosophers are probably right. The best philosophy is not a subject in its own right, not a set of doctrines or assumptions, not a method, nor even anagreed canon of au thors. The best philosophy is nothing other than theoretical reflection which springs from practice: thinking about something you care about for longer and harderthan other people typically do. (And, to be fair which he never was W ittgenstein said something of this sort somewhere.) Somewhere in The Lord of the Rings JRR Tolkien describes the innkeeper, Barleyman Butterbur, as someone who could see through a wall, if he stared at it long enough. I amcontinually amazed by the progress that can be made in medicine, in psychology, in politics by carrying on worrying at a problem long after other people have wandered away to do something more useful. Most philosophers have a sustained power of attention which greatly exceeds that of most doctors or scientists. This sustained attention is supported by the structures of philosophicaldiscourse, that allow much more time, more conversation, longer articles, longer books. Allthis may enable philosophers to make progress when they apply their attention to subjectsabout which they also have substan tive knowledge: as with Alasdair MacIntyre s reflections on the ethical basis of managerialism (or rather, the lack of it), David Hull s work in evolutionary theory, or Geor ge Elder Davie s books on Universities. * * * So, in the end, I like philosophy because it is the antithesis of busyness . Most of the best work I have done (such as it is) was achieved by staring at a problem until I could see throughit even when this process took 20 years, as in the case of understanding psychiatricdepression. Research is not confined to the lab or the clinic but necessarily involves sittingin armchairs, lying in the bath, and jotting notes as I walk. Philosophy is the child of idleness. Which explains why I am a philosopher, after all. 352 The British Journal of General Practice, April 2000our contributors Tony Avery is a GP in Nottingham Iain Bamforth has recently completed a new English translation of Knock orthe Triumph of Medicine , by Jules Romains (1923), about the medicalisation of a little town in France.
