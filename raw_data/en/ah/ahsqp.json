Staff in this program respond to citizen complaints, inspect sites and facilities, and enforce the environmental ordinances in the Chicago Municipal Code. Our work also includes permitting - approximately 8,000 permits are issued each year for operations and activities that have an impact on the environment. For example, permits are issued for work involving above ground and underground storage tanks, recycling facilities, waste handling facilities, construction site rock crushers, sandblasting, grinding, chemical washing, and the installation and operation of any equipment that has the potential to create or control air pollution. Our team of environmental inspectors visit permitted facilities across the city every day, routinely monitoring to make sure they comply with the conditions of their permits. We partner with businesses to help them understand and meet our rules, and we hold them accountable by issuing citations when necessary. We've expanded public engagement for consequential large recycling, reprocessable construction/demolition material and waste handling facilities! All current permit materials are posted on our [Community Environment Information](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/environmental_health/svcs/community-environment-information.html) page. To learn how you can get involved in the permit process, review our [CDPH Permit Process flowchart](/content/dam/city/depts/cdph/environment/env-permit-inspection/PermitProcess_Flyer__09.19.22.pdf). To apply for a permit, please follow the instructions beneath the applicable permit type below. A permit is required to install or remove an Above Ground Storage Tank (AST) for dispensing and non-dispensing with a volume greater than 110 gallons. City ordinance allows two dispensing tanks per site for a maximum capacity of 1000 gallons each, for a total of 2000 gallons on any one site. According to [AST Installation Guidelines](https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/doe/general/PermittingAndEnforcement_PDFs/ASTpermits/AboveGroundTankInstallationGuidelines.pdf), tanks must be enclosed within a two-hour fire-rated assembly. Tank assembly must provide 100-percent secondary containment of the flammable liquid. Refer to Chapter 15-24 of the Municipal Code of the City of Chicago for above-ground storage tank requirements. Please call [312.745.8295](tel:312.745.8295) with any questions about requirements for Above Ground Storage Tank permits. Preventing and Reporting Leaks Owners and operators of ASTs are responsible for ensuring their ASTs do not leak. Anyone who suspects that an AST is leaking should call the Illinois Emergency Management Agency at [800.782.7860](tel:800.782.7860) within 24 hours of the suspected leak.

A six-month extension is available when the permit is valid for an additional $200 fee. Resources The Environmental Permitting & Inspection Program aims to protect public health and the environment by reducing the risk of exposure to dust and debris during demolition and renovation activities. Many buildings in Chicago, especially those built before 1978, were constructed or decorated with materials that may contain lead-based paint or asbestos. It is imperative that such materials be properly handled during demolition, renovation, alteration, repair, cleaning and maintenance activities to protect anyone who might come into contact with the debris, from the workers and waste haulers to the general public. Therefore, contractors doing such work must comply with certain requirements set forth in the Chicago Municipal Code, including Sections [11-4-2150](https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/chicago/latest/chicago_il/0-0-0-2655626) - [11-4-2190](https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/chicago/latest/chicago_il/0-0-0-2655722), and must provide certain notifications to CDPH. Please note, CDPH does not accept permit applications or payments by mail or walk-in at any location. All notices and applications must be submitted online. To apply online, visit the [City of Chicago Permit Portal](https://ipi.cityofchicago.org/Profile/). If you have never used the website before, you will need to create an account, sign in and then choose Apply For New Permit. Starting September 1, 2021, demolition contractors will need to comply with new requirements from the Department of Buildings. Visit the [Department of Buildings website](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/bldgs/provdrs/permits/svcs/demo-permits.html) for more information. All demolition permit applicants must submit a Demolition Notice of Intent Form to CDPH. The form has been updated to include requirements for more detailed reporting to ensure the protection of public health and the environment, such as planned measures to control dust and abate asbestos and other hazardous materials, as applicable. The updated form is a first step to strengthening the CDPH demolition review process. There will eventually be new rules that include further details on additional reports and controls that may be required under certain circumstances. After filing the Demolition Notice of Intent through the online permit portal and paying the environmental review fee, email your DOB demolition permit application number, CDPH ENVGEN to [CDPHPermits@cityofchicago.org](mailto:CDPHPermits@cityofchicago.org) with Approval Request\" in the subject line to obtain CDPH email approval for your demolition permit. Questions? Contact [CDPHPermits@cityofchicago.org](mailto:CDPHPermits@cityofchicago.org).

Thorium-contaminated materials may exist in some portions of the Streeterville Area. If subsurface thorium wastes are uncovered without proper environmental controls, workers and the public may be exposed to unhealthy radiation levels. An applicant seeking a permit for any underground work in the Streeterville Area must ensure proper monitoring takes place any time excavation or ground breaking occurs. Please note that permits which involve work in the Thorium Monitoring Area will have a hold in the City Permit System and the applicant must schedule an appointment with CDPH before the hold can be released and a permit can be issued. Radiation monitoring is required for ground breaking work on private property or in the Right-of-Way in the Thorium Monitoring Area. If CDPH determines that radiation monitoring is required, the applicant must then complete a form agreeing to conduct proper radiation monitoring. This form must be completed and submitted to CDPH prior to each instance of scheduled soil excavation or ground exposure. Failure to complete this form may result in the delay of permits. Please call (312) 745-8332 to schedule an appointment. Please view the [aerial map](https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/cdph/food_env/lindsay-light-streeterville-map-201510.pdf) to see if the proposed work might be located in the Thorium Monitoring Area. Note: this map is for informational purposes only. For more information regarding thorium contamination in Streeterville, please visit the [USEPA's website](https://www.epa.gov/lindsay-light) and see the fact sheets available below. For underground work in the Right-of-Way please complete the form [CDPH.ROW.03](https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/cdph/environmental_health_and_food/DOE2ROW0310252012.pdf) and bring the original to the CDPH Office, 333 S. State Street, Room 200, Chicago, Illinois 60604.

An Underground Storage Tank system (UST) is a tank or combination of tanks and connected piping with at least 10% of its combined volume located underground. The tank system includes the tank, underground connected piping, underground ancillary equipment and any containment system. Over time, USTs may corrode, leaking their contents into the surrounding soil and eventually our groundwater supply. For this reason, any UST with a capacity for storing petroleum products of 110-gallons or greater is regulated under the Municipal Code of Chicago by CDPH. Preventing and Reporting Leaks Owners and operators of USTs are responsible for ensuring that their USTs do not leak. To assist them, CDPH has developed the [UST Operation and Maintenance Manual for Owners and Operators](https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/doe/general/PermittingAndEnforcement_PDFs/USTpermits/USTManual_1.pdf). Anyone who suspects that a UST is leaking should call the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) at [800.782.7860](tel:800.782.7860) within 24 hours of the suspected leak. Permits To install, upgrade, repair, remove, abandon or to conduct interior lining inspection, you must first obtain a permit from CDPH. Underground Storage Tank Permit Fee: $200/activity Apply for a Permit CDPH will no longer accept UST permits or payments for processing. Any permits or payment to this address will be returned and may delay the permit issuance. Currently, the UST applications are available online to all active UST contractors at the OSFM Contractor Portal: [Office of the Illinois State Fire Marshal - Underground Storage Tank Fees Payment - Division of Petroleum & Chemical Safety](https://webapps.sfm.illinois.gov/USTPortal/Facility/Tank/TankFeesPublicSearch) [Help Manual](https://webapps.sfm.illinois.gov/USTPortal/HelpDocs/USTContractorPortalUserManual.pdf) [Guidelines for Marinas](https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/cdph/food_env/GuidlinesforMarinas.pdf) Read through the instructions in the Help Manual, look closely at all the information on the permit application screens, take your time getting used to the new process, and call if you need help to the following: - OSFM: [217.785.7812](tel:217.785.7812)or [217.785.7809](tel:217.785.7809) - CDPH: [312.745.8295](tel:312.745.8295) Notification for Underground Storage Tank Activity Contractors must notify CDPH in writing of any UST activity. Notice of the removal of a UST must be given at least 30 days prior, unless the removal is in response to a known or suspected release, which has been assigned an incident number by Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA). In the event of a known or suspected release, CDPH may waive the 30-day waiting period; however, a permit is still required. No UST activity or portion thereof is to be performed without a UST inspector from CDPH. Temporary Closure: USTs may be temporarily closed for up to five years. During this period, the UST must continue to be monitored for leaks and corrosion. If a release is detected, it must be quickly abated and reported to the IEMA 800.782.7860 within 24 hours. If the UST is temporarily closed for longer than three months, all lines, pumps, manways, and ancillary equipment must be capped and secured except for vent lines, which may remain open. After five years, the UST system must be removed. Permanent Closure: Contractors may either remove a UST from the ground or fill it with inert solid material. In both cases, the tank must be emptied and cleaned by removing all liquids, dangerous vapor levels, and accumulated sludge. Tank Installation: The proper design and installation of a UST is necessary to ensure that normal operational loads will not cause the tank to deform and rupture. The most common cause of structural failure is improper installation. The environment surrounding an underground tank must be adequately characterized before a tank is installed. Environmental factors that can affect sitting and installation decisions include: bedding and backfill characteristics; high water level, requiring a tank to be anchored; location and magnitude of soil loads over a tank.

Tank Removal: All personnel involved in this recommended practice should be familiar with the potential hazards and be knowledgeable in the appropriate health and safety measures needed to ensure a safe working environment. USTs should be handled with extreme care during removal and disposal off-site.

Tank Abandonment In Place: Tank abandonment in place is granted due to the loss of adjacent or subjacent support of nearby structures, railroad tracks, streets, or other USTs or in unusual situations where removal is not feasible. Contractors seeking a waiver must provide documentation including four copies of a completed permit application, statement of need and site plans.
