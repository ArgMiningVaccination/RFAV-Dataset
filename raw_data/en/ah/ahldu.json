Doesn't it depend on which part of it he \"sees\" with his hands? How different is the challenge of describing You, Lord, when the person \"looking\" is spiritually-blind? Does he inevitably \"see\" his \"reality\" without realizing he is missing Reality? Like the word Serendipity. It popped into my head today and I had to look it up. Good luck in finding valuable things unintentionally. The faculty of making fortunate discoveries by accident. The occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way. Ahhh... The great myths of Chance and Accident. How \"lucky\" can we get, Lord??? \"A man's heart plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps.\" (Proverbs 16:9) Like being the \"right person\" at the \"right place\" at the \"right time.\" Places we had never planned nor expected to be. Meeting total strangers we had never imagined meeting. Sometimes the teacher, sometimes the student... because the student was ready and the teacher appeared. \"The Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.\" (John 14:26) I'd be up for a megadose of Spirit-dipity, Lord... six days a week and twice on Sunday! How about it? \"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.\" (Matthew 7:7) Luckily, I know Who to ask... right, Lord?
