The immunogenicity of SARS-CoV2 vaccination is still largely unknown in adolescents or young adults affected by IBD (pIBD). We investigated the safety and immunogenicity of the BNT162B2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in 27 pIBD, as compared to 30 healthy controls (HC). Immunogenicity was measured by anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG (anti-S and anti-trim Ab) before vaccination, after 21 days (T21) and 7 days after the second dose (T28). The safety profile was investigated by close monitoring and self-reported adverse events. Vaccination was well tolerated, and short-term adverse events reported were only mild to moderate. Three out of twenty-seven patients showed IBD flare after vaccination, but no causal relationship could be established. Overall, pIBD showed a good humoral response upon vaccination compared to HC; however, pIBD on anti-TNF treatment showed lower anti-S Ab titers compared to patients receiving other immune-suppressive regimens (p = 0.0413 at first dose and p = 0.0301 at second dose). These data show that pIBD present a good safety and immunogenicity profile following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. Additional studies on the impact of specific immune-suppressive regimens, such as anti TNF, on immunogenicity should be further investigated on larger cohorts.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-07-11", "cleaned_text": "Evaluation of Safety and Immunogenicity of BNT162B2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine in IBD Pediatric Distinct Immune Suppressive Regimens 20-30% of cases presenting before the age of 20 [ [2](#B2-vaccines-10-01109)]. Whereas the safety of several vaccinations was proved in IBD patients [ [3](#B3-vaccines-10-01109)], immunogenicity toward hepatitis B, hepatitis A, pneumococcal, and influenza vaccination was variably affected according vaccination immunogenicity revealed that IBD adult patients treated with the anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drugs (Infliximab (Janssen, Horsham, PA, USA), or Adalimumab (Abbvie, North Chicago, IL, USA)) developed a reduced immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, either BNT162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech, Mainz, Germany) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna, Cambridge, MA, healthy controls (HC). [20](#B20-vaccines-10-01109)]. However, despite the increasing extent of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among children, little is known about safety and efficacy in children and adolescents with IBD (pIBD) [ [21](#B21-vaccines-10-01109), [22](#B22-vaccines-10-01109)] who are at increased risk SARS-CoV-2 infection and SARS-CoV-2-induced disease relapses [ [23](#B23-vaccines-10-01109)]. [24](#B24-vaccines-10-01109)]. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Participants [25](#B25-vaccines-10-01109)]. Health-care workers who received BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were used as control group (HC). All participants received a questionnaire about the adverse events and side effects following each dose of vaccine. All procedures performed in the study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments. Local ethical committee approved the study and written informed consent was obtained from all participants or legal guardians. Age, gender, and clinical characteristics of the cohorts are described in [Table 1](#vaccines-10-01109-t001). 2.2. Safety [26](#B26-vaccines-10-01109)] were reported to the unit of occupational medicine by the employees enrolled. 2.3. Sample Collection and Storage 2.4. Humoral Response [27](#B27-vaccines-10-01109)] at T0, T21 and T28. In particular, we measured Ab against the S1-receptor-binding-domain (RBD) (Roche (Basel, Switzerland) 2.5. Quantification and Statistical Analysis [28](#B28-vaccines-10-01109)]. All variables included in the analysis were not normally distributed. Statistical tests were chosen according to data distribution in terms of normality, skewness, and dysomogeneity of variances. In line with this, as indicated in the figure legends, non-parametric paired test (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test) was used to assess differences between Ab load at the different time points, whereas non-parametric unpaired test (Mann-Whitney test) was used for comparison between pIBD and HC and also between pIBD on therapy with anti-TNF and patients receiving other treatments. 3. Results 3.1. Patient Characteristics [Table 1](#vaccines-10-01109-t001). At every follow-up visit (every 2-3 months) during the course of the pandemics, all patients performed nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) screening for SARS-CoV2 infection. No infections were detected during the follow-up period. Among the pIBD, 14 patients out of 27 were on therapy with anti-TNF (mean age 15.6 years with agerange 12.5-20.2 years, and with 4 patients older than 18). No differences in terms of age were found between patients on anti-TNF compared to the other group (data not shown). As shown in [Table 1](#vaccines-10-01109-t001), age at vaccination was significantly higher in HC (p = 0.0001). No differences related to gender were found between the groups. 3.2. Safety of 2 Doses of BNT162B2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine [Table 2](#vaccines-10-01109-t002)). The majority of patients reported mild-to-moderate systemic reactions; however, only one patient reported severe cold-like symptoms and asthenia after the second dose. The most commonly reported systemic reactions after the first dose were cold-like symptoms and myalgia, described, respectively, in 22.2% and 25.9% of the patients. Instead, the most frequent systemic reaction after the second dose was asthenia, reported in 33.3% of the patients, and myalgia and headache, reported in 22.2% of the patients. Only one patient after the first and the second dose reported the self-administration of anti-inflammatory treatments. No patients were hospitalized due to adverse reactions. 3.3. Serologic Response [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-01109-f001)both the pIBD and HC groups experienced a statistically significant increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 Abs after both the first and second vaccination dose (p < 0.0001). [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-01109-f001)). [Figure 2](#vaccines-10-01109-f002)). 4. Discussion [23](#B23-vaccines-10-01109)]. Through a long-term follow-up after vaccination, we here investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 vaccination could impact on the rate of IBD flares over time. According to what was previously found in adults, who showed no increased risk of short-term adverse effects [ vaccination, only patients out of 27 (18.5%) showed an IBD exacerbation after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. However, among these patients, two already had a clinical history of recurrent disease relapse. Thus, no causal correlation between primary disease exacerbation and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination could be established in our cohort, highlighting the critical importance of additional studies characterized by a larger sample size of pIBD and longer follow-up. [23](#B23-vaccines-10-01109), [34](#B34-vaccines-10-01109)]. The advent of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination represents a crucial milestone in the history of pandemics, especially for patients with acquired immune deficiencies, due to ongoing immune-suppressive treatments. However, large hesitation from the IBD adult community towards the vaccine intervention for both safety and immunogenicity reasons was noted at the beginning of the vaccination campaign [ [29](#B29-vaccines-10-01109), [35](#B35-vaccines-10-01109)]. [36](#B36-vaccines-10-01109)]. The independent impact of age on immunogenicity was also confirmed in multiple adult IBD cohorts [ [15](#B15-vaccines-10-01109), [17](#B17-vaccines-10-01109)] and by our group in another cohort [ [37](#B37-vaccines-10-01109)]. [13](#B13-vaccines-10-01109), [14](#B14-vaccines-10-01109), [15](#B15-vaccines-10-01109), [16](#B16-vaccines-10-01109), [17](#B17-vaccines-10-01109), [18](#B18-vaccines-10-01109)]. For the first time in the pediatric context, we confirmed such findings, showing that pIBD on therapy with anti-TNF (Infliximab or Adalimumab) developed a lower response in terms of Anti-S ab compared to patients receiving Azathioprine or Mesalazine. In contrast with these results, showing no effect of azathioprine on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination immunogenicity, the negative influence of another antimetabolite, the mycophenolate, was recently shown in a cohort of solid-organ-transplanted adolescents and young adults [ [38](#B38-vaccines-10-01109)]. A separate analysis by Spencer et al. [ [22](#B22-vaccines-10-01109)] showed a similar serologic response after vaccination or infection in IBD young adults treated with distinct biological treatments, such as adalimumab, ustekinumab, and tofacitinib.
