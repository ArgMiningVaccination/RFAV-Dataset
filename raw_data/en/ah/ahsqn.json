effective wa y. They also enhance the competitiveness of Switzerland's agricultural sector and make a po sitive contribution to- wards the maintenance of public health. For these reasons, animal health is monitored on a continual basis and in comparison to other countries, Switzerland has already achiev ed a high standard in that regard. The surveillance of animal health is carried out in a number of different ways. These include the screen- ing programmes organised and financed by the Federation and by the cantons. These are undertaken in collaboration with practising veterinarians and meat inspections carried out at t he point of slaughter, as well as with accredited laboratories. In addition, general surveillance of animal health is also carried out on the basis of a duty to report by animal keepers and all individuals who co me into contact with animals. The examinations carried out upon imported animals and aborted foetuses in ungulates (hooved animals) form important pillars of this surveillance. This report sets out to provide an overview of animal health surveillance as it exists in 2014, explaining the signi ficance of animal health surveillance and placing it in the context of previous years. For a number of years now, a process of structural change has been underway with in Switzerland's agricultural sector, involving a shift towards fewer farms with larger numbers of stock. In 2014, the pop- ulation of many types of livestock changed in line with that trend. According to the statistics produced by the Meat Inspectorate, the total number of slaughtered animals, together with the proportion of ined- ible animal carcases, remained largely unchanged. The diagnosis of animal diseases in S witzerland is carried out by 25 accredited laboratories, which are either operated by th e State or are privately run. In 2014, they carried out almost 20% fewer tests for animal diseases than in the preceding year (the rea- son: fewer examinations were carried out in connection with the programme to combat bov ine viral diarrhoea). The largest number of investigations in the context of national disease -prevention and ran- dom sampling carried out by state authorities was carried out upon cattle. A s a result of this, Switzerland was successfully certified as free of 6 animal diseases in 2014, namely inf ectious bovine rhinotracheitis, enzootic bovine leukosis, bluetongue in sheep and goats, Aujeszky's dis- ease and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome in pigs. This certificat ion must be renewed each year by carrying out random sampling. The reason for this is that previousl y eradicated animal diseases could be brought back into the country again at any time. A great many animal diseases are also zoonoses and are therefore potentially harmful to human health. The most frequently recorded of these is campylobacteriosis. In 2014, the number of cases of this diar- rhoeal illness continued to be high (7,565 cases). Prior to this, numbers had pea ked during the period between 2005 and 2012 (from around 5,000 to around 8,500 cases). As a large number of sufferers do not visit their doctor and stool samples are not always investigated, the actual figure may be a lot higher. As a result of this development, researchers, the poultry sector (poultry forms the primary source of infection in humans) and representatives of government authorities got together in l ate 2008 to form the Campylobacter Platform. The aim of the platform is to make a contribution towards the conta inment of this diarrhoeal pathogen, by means of the transfer of knowledge, by carrying ou t coordinated measures and by initialising research projects. Another frequently occurring type of zoo nosis involves infection by Salmonella bacteria. In humans, this can give rise to gastro-intestinal complaints, amongs t other things. In many cases, animals merely act as a carrier and do not suffer any symptoms thems elves. In 2014, the number of cases of salmonellosis in humans was at the same level as in the previous year (1,238 cases). Active measures are underway to combat Salmonella infection in poultry. At no point during the past few years was the number of Salmonella infections recorded in poultry ever greater than 11. In Switzerland, cases in which entire groups of people are infected with a pathogen as a result of eating certain foods are extremely rare indeed. Only 11 such outbreaks were recorded in 2014. Thes e involved infections with Listeria, Salmonella, Campylobacter and toxin-producing pathogens such as Staphylo- coccus aureus and Bacillus cereus . A programme is also underway to monitor the development of anti- biotic resistance in zoonotic pathogens and indicator bacteria in commercial l ivestock. During the year 7 under review, this was adapted in line with the latest EU requirements. Among the zoonotic pathogens, the rate of resistance of C. jejuni to ciprofloxacin increased further, as did the occurrence of Methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus in slaughtered pigs. 8 3 Principles of monitoring epizootics and zoonoses The aim of animal health monitoring is to establish the current situation with regard to epidem- ics, development trends and the regional distribution of outbreaks. In the case of epizootics that have been eradicated, freedom from disease is documented with the aid of inspection pro- grammes. The general public, the EU and the World Organisation fo r Animal Health (OIE) are kept informed regularly. State monitoring of animal health focuses on the monitoring of epizootics. Transmissibl e diseases are referred to as epizootics if they can be transmitted to humans (zoonoses); if they cannot be averted by an individual animal keeper with any prospect of success without the involv ement of other animal pop- ulations; if they could threaten indigenous wild animal species; if they c ould have significant economic consequences or if they are of significance to international trade in animals and an imal products (Swiss Animal Health Act of 1 July 1966 (TSG, SR 916.40), Art. 1). Accordingly, around 80 diseases are classed as epizootics (Swiss Animal Health Ordinance of 27 June 1995 (TSV, SR 916.401) Art. 2-5). Zoonoses are thus treated in the same way as epizootics in principle, even if there are additional regulations that apply to zoonoses, as listed below. All epizootics must be reported t o the authorities. Highly infectious epizootics are eradicated as quickly as possible, while many other epizootics are combated with the aim of eradicating them or at least reducing their effects on health or economic consequenc es. Monitoring of animal health involves a variety of measures ( Figure 3.a ). The term 'National Monitoring Programme' brackets together individual disease-specific inspection programmes, whi ch are planned and implemented on a coordinated basis. For each inspection programme, the aim of the inspecti ons is stipulated and, based on this, the procedure for sampling and laboratory diagnosti cs. Other monitoring measures include the obligation to report epidemics to the authorities, which applies to all epizootics, the obligation to investigate and examine abortions in ungulates, as well as inspe ctions ordered by the official veterinarian in connection with the importing of animals and the inspec tion of carcasses and organs by the meat inspectorate when animals are slaughtered. 9 Figure 3.a: The monitoring of animal health includes the national monitoring programme as well as the reporting of epidemics, the investigation of aborti ons and inspection of imports and monitoring by the meat inspectorate 3.1 Epizootics As part of the monitoring programme, Switzerland's freedo m from disease is documented with an in- spection programme in the case of epizootics that have bee n eradicated and that are of major signifi- cance to international trade. Samples from companies are insp ected every year and, on the basis of negative test results, the national animal population i s declared to be free from disease. Samples are taken in a way that ensures compliance with all interna tional standards and enables scientifically sound conclusions that are backed up by statistics to be drawn reg arding the overall population. The samples from cattle companies also take into account so-called sentine l companies. These are companies that, due to specific factors such as the transportation of larger numbers of animals, direct imports of animals or a location near the border, can provide more informa tion about the possible import of epidemics than companies that are chosen at random. The inclusion of sentin el companies allows the total number of companies inspected to be significantly reduced. Proof of fr eedom from disease was provided in 2014 for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), enzootic b ovine leukosis (EBL), blue tongue disease in cattle, brucellosis in sheep and goats, Aujeszky's disease and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in pigs. For other epizootics, an inspection programme is being car ried out with the aim of documenting the extent of possible occurrence. In the inspection programme f or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), all animals aged four years and over are assigned t o the risk groups \"cows slaughtered while ill\" and \"fallen cows\". The progressive eradication of bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) is being investigated in a comprehensive serological inspection programme with bulk tank milk samples and blood samples. Monitoring of animal health Reporting epidemics Investigation of abortions Inspections of imports Meat inspection National monitoring programme Inspection programmes The following must be specified for each inspection programme: Epizootic (IBR/EBL, BSE...) Diagnostic methods (ELISA, PCR...) Sampling methods (random sample, full examination, risk-based...) Aim (proof of freedom from disease, determination of status of epizootic, estimation of prevalence...) 10 In poultry, a sample from flocks is tested for avian influenza viruses and the Newcastle disease virus. The aim is to detect subclinical infections with low pathogenic viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes at an early stage, as these could mutate into highly pathogenic avian influenza agents. With regard to the duty to report epizootics to the authorities, all persons who keep, care for or treat animals and the laboratories that investigate epizootics have an obligation to repor t epidemics and sus- picious diseases. These must be reported to the cantonal veterinary offices, whi ch in turn report to the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO). The FSVO publishes the current situation with re- gard to epidemics, development trends and the regional distribution of outbreaks onlin e ( www.in- fosm.blv.admin.ch/public/ ). The animal health statistics that are drawn up annually show the following: Switzerland is free from all highly infectious epizootics and many other epiz ootics ( www.blv.admin.ch/ ). The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the European Commission ar e notified regularly of the situation with regard to epidemics. The occurrence of highly infectious or exotic epidemics - and other specific incidents - would be reported to these partners immediately. A g ood reporting system requires constant observation of animals by the people who keep them, reliable rec ognition of the signs of illness, examination of sick animals by veterinarians and testing in competent l aboratories. Reliable monitoring and appropriate reporting ensures transparent and comprehensible communications r egard- ing the health situation. Other important areas of the monitoring of epizootics include the investigation of abor tions in ungulates and meat inspections at the slaughterhouse. Some epizootics are known to cause abortions, whic h means that abortions can be a sign of epizootics. The obligation to report abor tions to the authorities and the investigation of abortions are thus an important part of the monitoring of epi zootics. The occur- rence of abortions in cattle, small ruminants and pigs must be reported to the author ities. Depending on the animal species, the official veterinarian will order tests for Brucella, IBR viruses, Coxiella burnetii , chlamydia, PRRS viruses pathogens. Suitable sanitation measures are then imple- mented at the companies, based on the laboratory results. Meanwhile, the meat inspectorate examines every slaughtered animal while it is s till alive, as well as its carcass and organs. Any suspicious animals or carcasses are confiscated and furt her investigations are ordered. This allows epizootics to be identified from the symptoms and the safety of meat as a foodstuff to be ensured. Monitoring by the meat inspectorate is particularly important in the cas e of tuberculosis, which can be identified from changes in lymph nodes. 3.2 Zoonoses The Swiss Animal Health Ordinance contains specific regulations on zoonos es (TSV, and verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli are individu- ally mentioned. Brucellosis and tuberculosis are investigated as part of the moni toring of epizootics. With regard to trichinellosis, all pigs and horses are tested for Trichinella when they are slaughtered. The combating of Salmonella in the animal population focuses on the programme to control Salmonell a infections in poultry and the combating of salmonellosis in various animal speci es. Monitoring in poultry is geared towards the detection and extermination of infected flocks. The aim is to lower the burden of pathogens in eggs and meat and thus to reduce human exposure. Monitoring for Campylobacter takes place all year round when animals are slaughtered, as part of the programme to invest igate resistance to antibiotics. The information obtained from this is used, together with the number of cases of campyl- obacteriosis in humans, to assess the situation on an ongoing basis. The Campylobact er platform coor- dinates and implements measures to reduce the burden of Campylobacter throughout the food chai n on this basis, with all those concerned. Zoonoses are naturally also highly significant to the health of humans, and many must be reported to the authorities by doctors and laboratories. Reports are reviewed on an ongoing bas is and published online at www.bag.admin.ch/infreporting/index.htm . Cantonal enforcement bodies must report out- breaks of food-related illnesses to the FSVO as soon as investigations are compl eted. 11 A special inspection programme aims to monitor resistance to antibiotics in l ivestock, with the primary intention of detecting the spread of resistant germs that could be transmitted to humans i n food. The programme includes agents that cause zoonoses and indicator germs in cattle, pigs and chickens. In accordance with a risk-based plan, swabs are taken at the time of slaughtering and samples of meat are taken at sales outlets. The germs are investigated with regard to their resist ance to a wide range of antibiotics and with regard to multiple resistance. A planned course of action means t hat comparable figures are available regarding resistance and that unfavourable developments can be i dentified. Switzerland produces an annual report for the EU on the occurrence and preva lence of zoonoses, the causes of zoonoses and resistance to antibiotics (TSV, Art. 291e). This is sent to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which compiles a summary for Europe based on thi s report and the reports from the member states and Norway. http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/3991.htm . The har- monisation of monitoring activities and active communication of results leads to cr edible and comparable information for the individual states, which can be used to assess the situat ion with regard to zoonoses and resistance. 12 4 Animal population Fewer companies, larger animal populations - that is the structural chan ge that has been emerg- ing in the agricultural sector over the last few years. The popu lation of many types of livestock changed in the year under review in line with these expectations. Mean while, the number of im- ports reflects the fact that the tip of the breeding pyramid for poultry is abroad. 4.1 Companies with livestock, animal population and im- ported livestock A structural change has been observed in agriculture over the last few years: it is assumed that in future there will probably be fewer and fewer companies, but that they will have larger animal populations. No change in this trend was observed in 2014. The data in Table 4.a illustrate this. For cattle, pigs, sheep and goats, the number of companies declined further ( Figures 4.a and 4.b, red curve in each case). At the same time, overall numbers of cattle and pigs increased ( Figures 4.a and 4.b, black curve in each case). The fact that the latter were barely imported at all in 2014 may be linked t o the fact that pig breeding has become established in Switzerland. With horses, in contrast, there was lively trade with other countries. Meanwhile, the figures for poultry reflect the fact that the tip of the breeding pyramid is abroad. Imports of day-old chicks and hatching eggs therefore significantly outwe ighed those of other categories of animals once again in 2014. 13 Category of ani- mals 2013 2014 Change [%] 2013-2014 Cattle Companies 39,161 -3.1 -2.1 83,319 -0.5 Breeding hens and cocks (laying Companies 1,298 1,520 17.1 Total population 167,568 154,059 -8.1 and broiler lines) Imported day-old chicks 320,706 346,869 8.2 Laying hens Companies 16,814 17,262 2.7 of any age Total population 3,547,181 3,785,782 6.7 Imported day-old chicks 14,280 20,020 40.2 Broiler chickens Companies 1,057 1,083 2.5 of any age Total population 6,377,308 any age incl. pre-fattening and 292 315 7.9 Total population grow-out periods Beekeepers - 14,525 - Colonies - 148,328 - Imported colonies - 2,398 - Table 4.a: Companies with livestock, animal population and imported livestock in the year under re- view, compared with 2013 Sources: Agricultural policy information system AGI S, FOAG; imports, TRACES; imports of poultry, FOAG 4.2 Changes in the keeping of livestock 2004-2014 Figures 4.a: Number of companies with cattle or pigs (red curve, y-axis on the right) and animals kept per company (black curve, y-axis on the left) from 2004 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Number of companies Animals 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Number of companies Animals kept Pigs Bestand Betriebe Total animal population Companies Companies Total animal population 15 Figures 4.b: Number of companies with sheep or goats (red curve, y-axis on the right) and ani mals kept per company (black curve, y-axis on the left) from 2004 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Number of companies Animals 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Number of companies Animals kept Goats Bestand Betriebe Total animal population Companies Companies Total animal population 16 5 Slaughter and meat inspection statistics It is stipulated by law that every slaughtered animal must be inspected to make sure that it is fit for human consumption, as part of checks on animals to be slaughtered an d on meat. The results of these inspections are forwarded to the meat inspectorate's database ( Fleko). This results in reliable statistics on the number of animals slaughtered per year. The f igures for 2014 show that the overall number of animals slaughtered and the percentage of animals t hat were unfit for consumption were within the same range as in the previous year. 5.1 Legal basis The Swiss ordinance on slaughter and meat inspection (VSFK, SR 817.190) stipulates that the results of inspections of animals for slaughter and of meat must be forwarded to the database on the transpor- tation of animals (TVD ordinance of 26 October 2011) in electronic form, stati ng the registration numbers of the companies (TVD numbers). The meat inspection statistics are an official set of statistics compiled for Switzerland in accordance with the ordinance on the collection of statistics (SR 431.012.1) and a multi -annual statistical programme by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO). Statistics on the n umber of slaughtered animals allow the classification of animal species in terms of their economic importance and of p ossible risks to humans that may arise from meat as a foodstuff. 5.2 Meat inspection statistics The database of the meat inspectorate (Fleko, Identitas) contains the number of slaught ered animals recorded by the meat inspectorate and the decisions of the meat inspectors on fitness for consumption. This forms the basis for the meat inspection statistics. Table 5.a shows the number of slaughtered animals per canton and the changes compared with the previous year. Table 5.b shows the meat in- spectorate's assessment for 2014 for each animal species. The reasons why meat was u nfit for con- sumption in 2014 are listed in Table 5.c and shown in Figure 5.a . Figures 5.b and 5.c show changes in the numbers of slaughtered animals and in the number of animal carcasses that were not fit for consumption since 2005. The Fleko database does not record figures for poultry. The data for the slaughtering of poult ry have been obtained from the agricultural policy information system AGIS of the Federal Office of Agriculture (FOAG). The volume of poultry slaughtered is stated in tonnes rather than in units. The proportion of meat that is unfit for consumption is not recorded. Table 5.d shows the volume of poultry slaughtered in 2013 and 2014 and compares the figures for the two years. 17 Canton Cattle < 6 we. Cattle > 6 we.

All current cases are published by the Swiss Federal Food Saf ety and Veterinary Office (FSVO) in the information system for cases of notifiable diseases (InfoSM) . An important event for the Swiss Veterinary Service in 2014 was an outbreak of porcine r eproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which, thanks to comprehensive investigations and the implementation of suitable measures - was quickly brought under control and eradicated . As it proved impossible to determine the cause of the outbreak, a more intensive screening programm e for PRRS is being carried out in 2015. 6.1 Statutory framework for the notification of anim al dis- eases and the compilation of animal disease statistic s The obligation to report diseases or suspected disease symptoms is laid down in Ar ticle 11 of the Swiss Animal Diseases Act (TSG, CC (Classified Compilation) 916.40) and in the Animal Diseases Ordinance, Article 61 (TSV, CC 916.401). Animal health statistics are governed by the Statistical Investigation Or- dinance (CC 431.012.1). 6.2 Animal health statistics In the Information system for cases of notifiable diseases (InfoSM) the Federal Food Safety and Veter- inary Office (FSVO) publishes all of the latest cases of notifiable animal diseases and zoonoses in ani- mals. The system can be consulted at any time and includes facilities to view the data by region or chronologically. The FSVO also publishes a set of weekly statistics about ani mal diseases. In this report, the annual overview can be viewed by month in Table 6.a, and by canton in Table 6.b . The following explanations must also be taken into account with regard to animal disease notificati ons that are of special significance: Cattle: During the course of the official screening programme for Infectious Bovine Rhinot racheitis (IBR), a cow was tested and confirmed to have positive serology results for the condition. That cow was slaughtered. During the course of the measures carried out in accordance with the Animal Diseases Ordinance and in other investigations, neither viruses nor any other serological reagent s were detected. The cow that tested positive during the screening programme for IBR therefore concerned a \"serologi cal singleton reactor\", which are sometimes found in isolation during screening programmes for IB R. These singleton reactors do not jeopardise Switzerland's status as being free of the disease. Inv estigations are extremely costly in terms of time and effort. On the one hand, the fact that singleton re actors are detected demon- strates the risk that the disease is sometimes brought into the country. On the other hand, however, it also shows that genuine outbreaks will be discovered during the screening programme. Pigs: The three cases of Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome (PRRS) formed par t of an outbreak of PRRS. This was discovered on the basis of serologically positive tests i n fattened pigs examined during the screening programme. The investigative tests carried out during the screeni ng programme were extremely comprehensive. Thousands of pigs from several hundred farms were examined. Dur ing the course of the tests, the PRRS virus was detected in a single br eeding unit. The precise cause of the outbreak could not be determined. As a result of carrying out all of the measures laid down in the Animal Diseases Ordinance and all other investigations, the outbreak was successful ly contained and confined to the three farms in question. Extensive and costly examinations were requir ed in this instance, not 23 only to combat the outbreak, but also to prove that the outbreak had been successful ly eradicated and that no other infected herds existed. In order to restore the level of cert ainty that can be applied to the country's disease-free status to the level of certainty that applied before the outbreak, the screening programme for PRRS is being intensified in 2015.

In addition to compulsory notification in the ev ent of an outbreak, the screening of aborted foetuses and meat controls, risk-based random sampling is also carried out (in accordance with CC 916.401; Article 130). Table 6.c sets out which animal diseases do not exist in Switzerland . When carrying out tests of random samples, the scope of the r andom sample is dictated by the require- ment that it is possible for an incidence of infection of 0.2% of stock to be determined with a 99% degree of certainty. Which animal diseases can be verified by mean s of risk-based random sampling is de- scribed in detail in Chapter 8. a Disease eradicated since (year of most re- cent outbreak) b Disease never detected (historically dis- ease-free) c Surveillance system based on risk-based random sampling since (year) d The screening of aborted foetuses for sur- veillance purposes (in accordance with Di- rective 64/432/EEC and/or in accordance with CC 916.401, Article 129) e Meat control tests for surveillance pur- poses (in accordance with Directive 64/432/EEC) 1) Agreement between the Swiss Confederation and the European Community on trade in agricultural products (CC 0.916.026.81) 2) In accordance with EU Commission Decision 2008/185/EC, Switzerland is entitled to require addi- tional guarantees on the importation of domestic pigs. 3) Applies to HPAI in commercial poultry 4) In accordance with EU Commission Decision 2004/558/EC, Switzerland is entitled to require addi- tional guarantees on the importation of cattle: isolation for at least 30 days and testing using individual animal serology tests for IBR no sooner than 21 days following isolation, with a negative test result 5) In accordance with EU Directive 2009/158/EC, Switzer- land is entitled to require additional guarantees on the importation of domestic poultry: amongst other require- ments, the poultry may not have been vaccinated against Newcastle disease 6) The most recent case occurred in an imported dog in 2003.

Livestock were sampled the most, particularly cattle. The most common reasons for investigation were national cont rol programmes and official spot checks. Investigations into sickness, death and abo rtion accounted for only a small percentage of inspections. Although the quality of data suppli ed to Alis was improved in 2014, 11.2% of data sets were forwarded without the abbreviation for the c anton, which means that they are not avail- able to the cantons for use. 7.1 Organisation of diagnosis of epizootics in Switzerland The combating of epidemics and the monitoring of zoonoses are among the key tasks of the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO). Official diagnosis of epizootics includes: a. Investigations into suspected cases on behalf of the vet erinary authorities; b. National monitoring and control programmes; c. Monitoring of imports of animals by the official veteri narians; d. Official health certificates for national and intern ational exhibitions and the transportation of ani- mals; e. Assignments for the Swiss office for the early detection of epizootics (prevention). A laboratory needs to be officially recognised in order to carry out official inspection work (Article 312 of the Swiss Animal Health Ordinance (TSV) of 27 June 1995; TS V; SR 916.401). A total of 25 recognised laboratories, both state-owned and private, were invo lved in the diagnosis of epizootics on behalf of the Swiss Veterinary Service in 2014 ( Figure 7.a ). Along with the Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI) and the Bee Research Centre at Agroscope Liebefeld-Posieux, which are government institutions, 10 other university laboratories, 7 cantonal laboratories/ laboratories that are affiliated with the cantonal veterinary service and 6 private laboratories have off icial recognition. Two key requirements for the recognition of laboratories are accreditation in accordan ce with ISO/EN 17025 and affiliation with the database of the Alis laboratory information system (a ne twork comprising the federal government, the canton and the laboratory). Analysis of these data provi des information about how widespread an epi- demic is and how much effort is being made with regard to monitoring and control.

All epizootics that are regulated by the st ate in the TSV are assigned to an NRL, to ensure the quality of the diagnosis (confirmations, interlaboratory test s) and competent diagno- sis of rare epizootics. Table 7.a lists the individual NRLs and their responsibilities and areas of experti se. For investigations carried out as part of the official monitoring of trichinae, the cantons named 16 in- spection sites at slaughterhouses, butcheries and private veterinary practi ces, in addition to the recog- nised laboratories. 29 National reference laboratory Epizootics and other areas of expertise Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI), Mittelh\u00e4usern site http://www.ivi.ch Highly infectious epizootics in accordance with Article 2 TSV; blue tongue disease, haemorrhagic disease in deer , porcine repro- ductive and respiratory syndrome, West Nile fever \"Emerging diseases\" Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI) Site at the Vetsuisse faculty of the University of Bern 3012 Bern http://www.ivv.unibe.ch/ Bovine viral diarrhoea/mucosal encephalitis virus Institute of Veterinary Bacteriology Dept. of National Centre for Zoonoses, Bacterial Animal Diseases and Antibiotic Resistance (ZOBA), Vetsuisse faculty at the University of Bern, http://www.vbi.unibe.ch/ equine metritis, brucellosis with ovine and caprine pleuropneumonia, anthrax, poultry and pigs, salmonellosis, tularaemia , yersiniosis Antibiotic resistance Institute of Veterinary Bacteriology National reference centre for poultry and rabbit dis- eases (NRGK), Vetsuisse faculty at the University of Zurich, http://www.nrgk.ch/ Avian chlamydiosis , fowl myxomatosis , Newcastle disease , Salmonella infection in poultry and pigs , viral haemorrhagic disease in rabbits Centre for Fish and Wildlife Health Depart. of Infectious Diseases and Pathobiology (DIP), Vetsuisse faculty at the University of Bern, http://www.vetsuisse.unibe.ch/fiwi/ Spring viraemia of carp , infectious anaemia rhagic septicaemia Research facility Coxiellosis, paratuberculosis, pseudotuberculosis, glanders, tuberculosis Institute Dourine http://www.paras.uzh.ch/index.html Echinococcosis, cryptosporidiosis, hypodermosis Vector entomology Virology Institute Vetsuisse faculty University of Zurich vulvovaginitis, of and Experim.

Having initially been used mainly for statistical purposes (reporting within the framework of national and international report- ing systems), the laboratory data were directly linked with the cantons' ISVet i nformation platform for the first time in 2008 as part of the bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) control c ampaign. This made the laboratory results immediately available to the cantons to enable them to initiate measur es (ban on animals or companies). The laboratory database (ILD) that had been used up to then, which had b ecome outdated from a technical viewpoint and no longer met current requirements for efficient use, was replaced by the new Alis laboratory information system from 1 November 2013, following a 3- year project phase. When a new database was designed for all laboratory tests required as part of the offi cially decreed diagnosis of epizootics (initial and confirmation tests), the main focus was on th e possibility of making laboratory results available to the sponsor (cantonal veterinary office) quickly . Another new feature introduced with Alis is validity checks (technical) and plausibility checks on the for warded data sets directly during the reporting process. Data that do not comply with certain defined rules are judged by the system to be non-plausible and must be corrected independently by the laboratory that reported them. Compliance with these two specifications was ensured from a technical viewpoint by de veloping the sub-system \"Alis in Asan\" on the Agate portal for access by cantonal employees and the laboratory staff responsible, in addition to the actual \"Alis\" database. So that this functional cooperation b etween the laboratory, the canton and the FSVO can be used in a meaningful way, the quality of the data (c ompleteness for the purposes of traceability) and frequency of reporting (forwarding on a daily b asis) must meet high stand- ards. With regard to livestock in particular, this requires those responsibl e for sampling and sending to have greater discipline in stating company and animal identification, and involves more work by recog- nised laboratories in reporting and correcting data. Another requirement of the new laboratory information system was the possibility of extending it to all laboratory data along the food chain. As well as laboratory data relating to the diagnosis of epizootics, more than 500,000 tests linked to the legal inspection of milk are now reported in Ali s. 7.3 Investigations into epizootics in 2014 7.3.1 Investigations carried out by recognised labo ratories Recognised laboratories reported a total of 317,082 pieces of laboratory data regarding 69 epizootics to the Alis laboratory information system in 2014. Investigation figures are thus down almost 20% com- pared with the previous year, and for a few years have been steadily gro wing closer to the figures from before the high levels of investigation activity due to the eradication of BVD from 2008 onwards ( Figure 7.b ). The significant decline in overall investigation figures since 2012 is ther efore largely attributable to the sharp reduction in testing as part of BVD monitoring, due to a change from s ampling of all newborn calves to serological monitoring via bulk tank milk testing or the testing of sampl es from companies that do not supply milk. This trend also continued in 2014 ( Figure 7.d ; approx. 35% fewer tests for BVD than in 2013). While laboratory data from BVD monitoring accounted for almost 47% of all r eported tests in 2013, by 2014 this had dropped to 36.4% (n = 115,547) of all laboratory reports in Alis. 31 Figure 7.b: Test figures reported by recognised laboratories to the laboratory information sy stem in 2004-2014 As Figure 7.c shows, Alis typically experiences a peak in reports in the spring months (F ebruary to April), as this is the main season for nationwide testing of samples to provi de proof of freedom from certain epizootics (infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR/IPV), en zootic bovine tongue disease porcine reproductive and res piratory syndrome (PRRS)). Several PRRSV-seropositive pig holdings were identified dur ing these investigations, and ev- idence of the virus was found at two companies. The slight rise in reports in October 2014 can be ex- plained by an increase in investigation activity due to the extension of P RRS monitoring, particularly at the core breeding companies in the late summer.

Feb. Mar. Apr. May June July Aug. Sep. Oct. Nov. Dec. 32 7.3.2 The 12 most-investigated epizootics By looking at the most frequently investigated epizootics, we can show an d explain annual fluctuations. As already mentioned at the beginning of Chapter 7.3.1, the test figures reported in Alis in 2014 were down around 20% compared with the previous year. We have already described the c hanges in the combating of BVD and their impact on overall test figures (see Chapter 7. 3.1). The reduction in reported test figures for salmonellosis (-47%), in contrast to an increase in Salmonella infections in poultry (+45%) in 2014 ( Figure 7.d ) could be explained at least partly by more detailed reporting specifi cations in the Alis laboratory information system that has now been introduced. The fact that tests for Brucella melitensis in sheep and goats were reduced by half compared with the previous year (-54%) was due to a much higher number of samples per selected company in 2013. The serum bank was deliber ately topped up with blood samples from small ruminants at that time. The reduction in tests for bovine spon- giform encephalopathy (BSE) (-24%) was due to the raising of the age for exami nation of cattle slaugh- tered while ill and fallen cattle following the amendment of the Swiss Animal H ealth Ordinance in July 2013 and the cessation of the monitoring of healthy animals for slaughter. Since the ful l examination for caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE) in 2011/12, the figures for tests car ried out on a voluntary basis have fallen continuously each year (-70% compared with 2013). Figure 7.d: Comparison of the number of tests in 2014 with the previous year in percent. The chart shows the 12 most common epizootics. On the other hand, a programme to monitor the cattle population in Switzer land for blue tongue disease was launched in 2014 following a 3-year suspension; in accordance with international standards, this included around 3,000 samples, as planned. We have also already mentioned the ext ended monitoring for PRRS at core breeding companies for pigs, which was largely responsibl e for the increase of +40% in test figures.

Tests on cat- tle came out on top, accounting for around two-thirds of all reports ( Figure 7.f ), followed (11%), poultry (9%) and goats/sheep (7%). Figure 7.f: Distribution of species examined in percent Almost 62% of reported tests were commissioned as part of national inspection progr ammes ( Figure 7.g ). As well as national programmes to control BVD, CAE, BSE and Salmonella infections in poultry, these include, for example, official testing of samples to provide proof of freedom from IBR, EBL and BT in cattle, PRRS in pigs and brucellosis in small ruminants. As described un der 6.3.2, these are among the most frequently investigated epizootics. Investigations that are prescribed in accordance with the law on epizootic s also include examinations of contagious abortions in various species (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs), which account for about 7% of re- ported laboratory data. So-called health checks, which account for 6.7% of tests, are carried out on a clinically healthy population. These may be prescribed by law (e.g. t he monitoring of breeding animals in insemination stations, stallions, etc.), ordered additionally by cert ain label organisations (e.g. organic) or carried out voluntarily. Laboratory data generated and reported in connection with trade and the transportation of animals account for around 6%. Compared with official inspections to monitor healthy animals, the investigati ons forwarded to Alis re- garding cases of sickness, causes of death and the slaughtering of sick animals, inclu ding the investi- gations into abortions mentioned above, account for a relatively small proportion of tests (18%). Most of the monitoring programmes are carried out using serological methods. As a resul t, the materials submitted for testing ( Figure 7.h ) consist primarily (73%) of blood samples (full blood and serum) and bulk tank milk and, to a small extent (3%), of eggs (to provide evidence of Salmonella antibodies in poultry). The remaining 27% consists partly of disease-specific samples such as brain stem (4%) to provide evidence of BSE, faeces (4%) for some zoonosis agents and afterbirths ( 2%) for investigations into abortions. Sample materials such as organs/tissues (5%) and biopsies (2%) mainl y include ear punch biopsies taken to Commercial livestock - cattle Commercial livestock - pigs Commercial livestock - poultry Commercial livestock - small ruminants Pets - dogs Pets - cats Pets - domesticated horses Pets - guinea pigs and chinchillas Pets - rabbits Pets - rats and mice 35 Figure 7.g: Reasons for investigation in percent [The percentages stated refer to the proportion of t he total number of examinations that were carried out for the respective reason ] 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 Number of tests in thousands Surveillance programme Analysis of aborted foetuses Health check Investigation of suspi- cion/cause of disease Animal transport Investigation into suspected infection Slaughter Investigation into cause of death Slaughter of sick animals Importation Implementation of combat- ing measures Confirmatory testing (reference laboratory) 36 Figure 7.h: Percentage distribution of sample materials [The percentages stated refer to the proportion of t he total number of examinations that were carried out for the respective reason ] Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to provide indirect evidence (anti bodies) of the presence of an epizootic is clearly the most commonly used method during monitoring (n = 151,330). If we show the number of detection procedures used according to season during the year under review ( Figure 7.i), we see a peak for ELISA (red) in serological testing of samples in s pring and a double peak in spring and autumn for biphasic ELISA, used as part of the investigation of bulk t ank milk for BVD at companies that supply 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 Full blood Serum Milk sample from storage tank Organs/tissue/ fluids Brain stem Excreta Eggs Muscle tissue Plasma Biopsy Afterbirth Carcass 37 Figure 7.i: Use of serological detection methods according to season Figure 7.j: Use of different methods to provide proof of pathogens, according to season 23070 16548 22000 24000 Dec. 2013 Jan.

The most common area in which PCR is used as part of the official diagnosis of epizootics is in the examination of ear punch biopsies when testing calves for BVD. The only possible explanation that presents itself for the increased use of PCR from October onwards cou ld be that calves returned from the Alps in September and that sampling began after that. 7.4 Data quality 7.4.1 Non-plausible data sets To fulfil requirements for the provision of correct and complete data, Alis sets high standards by stipu- lating specific plausibility rules and mandatory fields. When the introduction of Alis began in 2013, up to 6% of data sets were found to be non-plausible over a period of several months. Through intensive collaboration between the laboratory, the canton and the FSVO, this percentag e was brought down to 0.6% for 2014 as a whole. Subsequent corrective work, together with a better overal l understanding of the specifications and function of Alis among users, led to a continuous improvement i n the quality of data throughout the year. Missing, incorrect or incorrectly entered earmark numbers on cattle continue to a ccount for the highest proportion of non-plausible data sets. Under certain circumstances, these canno t be recorded retro- spectively and the data sets cannot be corrected and thus remain non-plausible. Non-plausible data currently have a detrimental effect on the implementation of legislation in connect ion with the combating of BVD in particular, as Alis laboratory data are not available to I SVet under these conditions and there is thus no effect on the status of animals or companies. Data sets containing entries for which there was no Alis code at the ti me they were forwarded cannot be corrected retrospectively either, even if a code is introduced later. The data s et remains non-plausi- ble. One typical example of this is information about types of animals. A total of 276 different types of animals have to date been coded in Alis. 0.02% of the data sets contain no informat ion or information that cannot be used by Alis. Obviously, it is mainly exotic species (2%) that do not yet have Alis codes. However, other input errors that are also common, such as when data relating to sampling, receipt by the laboratory and incidents in the laboratory are not in chronological order, or the absence of a reason for investigation with simultaneous entry of a national inspection programme, etc., can easily be cor- rected by the laboratory. 7.4.2 Missing canton abbreviation and consequences for the imple- mentation of legislation Access to the laboratory data forwarded to Alis must be regulated for data protecti on reasons. The cantonal veterinary authorities can therefore view only the results of thos e laboratory tests that have been commissioned in their own canton in Asan via Alis. In order for the canton to have access to the results of all official laboratory tests in its territory, the la boratory performing the tests must enter a canton abbreviation when it forwards the data. In 2014, 35,567 data sets (11.2%) were reported without a canton abbreviation, which means that they are not available to the canton as the sponsor in Asan via Alis for the implementation of legislation. In principle, this can be corrected if a postcode has been provided. If there is a valid number from the business and enterprise register (BER), the postcode is automatically added in A lis. To automate queries relating to animal and company data and thus make them easier, the FSVO has granted recognised laboratories access to the Animal Tracing Service of Identitas AG through a licence agreement with the Federal Office of Agriculture. 39 8 Surveillance programme An important foundation of free trade is the ability to pr ove the absence of several animal dis- eases inside the country, on a yearly basis. Any diseases brought across the country's borders must also be detected at an early stage. For that reason, the possible r ecurrence of previously eradicated diseases has been a focus of the surveillance programmes carried out by means of random sampling since 1995. Since that screening programme began, the cou ntry has been able to provide evidence that it is free of major diseases. This serves to protect Switzerland's live- stock and secures the quality of the country's products. In 2014, samples were taken at random and examined for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, enzootic bovin e disease, brucellosis in sh eep and goats and blue- tongue disease, in order to prove that the country was free of these diseases. 8.1 Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis The bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV-1) is the pathogen that causes infectious bovine r hinotracheitis (IBR) and the rarer condition of infectious pustulous vulvovaginitis (IPV). Whic h of these two types of diseases occurs depends on the route of infection. Cattle are especially susceptible to such infection. Other ani- mals, namely goats, sheep, pigs and various types of wild even-toed ungulates are affected only rarely. It is also important to note that only cattle are capable of transmitting the dis ease. The disease is not harmful to humans. IBR is a typical disease of the respiratory tract and manifests itse lf in the form of high fever, rapid breath- ing, nasal secretion, coughing and a reddening of the muzzle. In cows, it can lead to abortions and milk output also declines. In calves, the disease manifests itself in the form of trembling muscles, abnormal movement, an inability to stand up and, in rare cases, blindness. This form of t he disease occurs if animals become infected with BHV-1 via the air, as a result of direct contac t with other infectious ani- mals. Transmission that occurs during service or insemination, however, wi ll lead to the onset of IPV. Typical symptoms of IPV are a reddening of the genital mucous membranes, with mi llet-sized blisters. The animals will urinate on a frequent basis and will hold their tails in an abnormal position. In contrast to IBR, only individual animals within a herd are usually affected by IP V. Of the two forms of the disease, IBR is by far the more common and the one that has a greater impact from a comm ercial perspective. That is why, when referring to infections with BHV-1, we generally refer only to IBR. IBR first occurred in Switzerland in 1977. Following a massive epidemic in 1983, an eradication pro- gramme was launched and was successfully completed 10 years later. Since then, Sw itzerland has carried out a screening programme each year and has provided annual evidence that is free of IBR. IBR still occurs in neighbouring countries, however the eradication programmes that have been underway in those countries for a number of years are achieving increasing levels of success. That is why a grow- ing number of regions within those countries now enjoy the same status as Swit zerland itself, namely as being free of IBR. In the case of imports from regions that are not IBR -free, cattle must undergo a special quarantine programme. International trade between IBR-free regions may not be subj ected to regulation. 40 8.1.1 Procedure to provide evidence of disease-free status In order to prove the absence of an animal disease, there must not be any signs in advance that the disease actually occurs in the area concerned. A condition of this type c an only be fulfilled if diseases or suspected incidences of disease are subject to compulsory screening and must be notified to the relevant official bodies ( obligation to report ). If there is a risk that the disease may be brought into the country, it is crucially important to have detailed disease-awareness and an effective means of recog- nising disease at an early stage. Animals that are displaying the typical, clinical signs of a disease must be examined. This means, for example, that a herd of cattle with a noticeably increased r ate of abortion must be screened for IBR. Though the signs will generally be thought to be the res ult of a different cause, due to the fact that IBR is not endemic in Switzerland, such screening i s still necessary, as the disease may be brought in from outside the country at any time. In order to en sure that the risk of importing IBR is kept as low as possible, imports of cattle and cattle semen ar e subject to stringent import regulations. Furthermore, cattle taking part in national shows, cattle that are sent to market or are admitted to animal clinics, must be screened for IBR. The purpose of all of these measures is to prevent any outbreak from spreading. For the same reason, breeders' associations regular ly screen all animals used for insemination. If all of these screening measures do not reveal any signs of IBR, a sensible step by virtue of the coun- try's bilateral treaties with the EU would be to carry out a screening progr amme in the form of random sampling, in order to provide evidence that the country is disease-free. As a result of international agree- ments, the screening programme is necessary in order to regulate the importation of cattle and semen. An important pre-requisite when it comes to ensuring the comparability of the evidenc e of disease-free status provided by individual regions and countries, is that the quality of surveillance and the results obtained therefrom are comparable, that is, it will be necessary for any statement s to be backed up by statistics. The scientific and statistical foundation for the screening pr ogramme operated in Switzerland fulfils this requirement. 8.1.2 Calculation of the random sample The random sample is selected in accordance with statistical principles. These hav e been published in a scientific journal and are therefore generally acknowledged. They are based upon a random selection of the farms that were tested. Only if the farms to be sampled are selected at random is it possible to extrapolate the results across the population as a whole. In the years since the screening programme to demonstrate Switzerland's freedom fro m IBR was intro- duced, the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO) has developed an d refined additional methods in accordance with the stated principles that enable the random samples to be carried out as effectively as possible. The two most important of those methods are: The risk-based random sample calculation This gives rise to a situation, in which the calcu- lated number of farms that take part in the random sample each year is lower when compared to the standard method, and The risk-based selection of farms Under this system, farms that are at increased risk of an outbreak of the disease are selected in a targeted way (these are known as sentinel farms ). In view of the higher risk that applies in the case of these farms, the number of farms can also be reduced. Of these two procedures, we have used only the risk-based selection of f arms since 2013 in connection with IBR. In doing so, we establish and quantify risk factors as a means of estimating the probability of a disease occurring on a farm (see Section 8.1.3). This then gives rise t o the relative risk of individual farms compared to one another . This means that a farm with a relatively high risk for the purpose of surveillance counts for more than another farm, which has a lower calculated risk. For example, a farm with three times' the average relative risk can replace 3 farms with a relati ve risk at an average level. 41 This means that the number of farms to be tested can be reduced. Farms with a high probability of an outbreak of a disease are referred to as sentinel farms . These are included into the random sample in a targeted way. The majority of the farms are still selected on a random basis, howe ver, so that the sample can continue to be regarded as the luck of the draw. Examining samples collected at random enables the results to be extrapolated across the popu lation as a whole, by means of probability calculations (stochastics). These set out to calculate how likely a certain result will be, if the population is composed in a particular manner. When it comes to providing evidence of disease-free status, it is necessary to determine how likely it is that the result of the random sample will be negative, if a certain number of instances of the disease actually ex isted within the population. This probability is also referred to as the certainty of the evidence of disease-free status. The task to be fulfilled by the screening programme is now to ensure that we are able to detec t a certain assumed prevalence within a herd (this is known as the design prevalence), with a defined degree of certainty. In specific terms, this means that an infected farm - amongst several farms assume d to be infected - will be identified within the random sample, with a specific degree of probabili ty. Based on this assumption, we can then calculate the necessary size of the random sample. In the case of IBR, the criteria to be fulfilled in this regard are laid down in the bilateral agreements with the EU . Within a random sample, it is then necessary to demonstrate with 99% certainty that the herd prevalenc e is lower than 0.2%. The larger the random sample, the higher the degree of certainty that can be associated wit h the proof of disease-free status. Two aspects frequently cause confusion, however, and must always be taken into acc ount: The aim of the screening programme is to demonstrate the disease-free status in connection w ith a particular type of animal disease. For that reason, no cases may be discovered by some other means - suc h as by examining suspected cases or examinations of aborted foetuses. The assumption that a number of infected farms or animals exist is only made in order to carry out the calculat ion of the random sample. That assumption is only used as a guide when performing the calculation. It does not mean therefore that a number of infected farms or animals can be discovered outside of the sam ple, without disease- free status being lost. The treaty with the EU demands that a screening programme be carried out eac h year. This is neces- sary, as the screening can only demonstrate an outbreak of a disease that has already taken place and can only provide an authoritative statement with regard to the preceding year . Nevertheless, we are able to reduce the size of repeat samples, based upon the following assumption: despite import regulations and the inspection of imports, even once evidence of disease-free status has been prov ided, there is still a very small probability that the disease will nevertheless be brought into the country on any given day. For that reason, the attained level of certainty of disease-free st atus - that is, the outcome of the screening programme - will decrease as time goes on. We set out to calculate that decrease in the form of a quantitative risk evaluation. The annual repetition of the screening programm e is therefore only required to counterbalance that decline in certainty. This procedure is referred t o as a risk-based ran- dom sample calculation . Using this calculation procedure developed by the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO), we are able to reduce the number of farms s creened on an annual basis, in a scientifically-based way. As the number of farms screened becomes smaller, we are able to reduce the cos ts of the screening programme, both in the case of risk-based random sample calculation, as well as when us ing a system of risk-based selection of farms. The difference between each of these procedures is that in the case of risk-based random sample calculation, the annual number of screenings is smaller and ther efore offers a lower degree of certainty that any instances of disease will be detected. In the case of the risk-based selection of farms on the other hand, the level of certainty remains the same, despi te the reduced num- ber of annual screenings, as the farms being screened are the ones that are at hi gh risk. During the past few years, a number of IBR outbreaks were discovered in Switzer land, outside of the screening programmes carried out. In order to increase the likelihood that potent ially infected farms will also be detected by means of the screening programme, two new approaches were i mplemented in 2013. On the one hand, in the case of IBR, screening was switched from diagnosi s using blood samples to a more cost-effective system in which a diagnosis is established by test ing milk stored in a tank. This enabled the number of farms being screened to be increased at the same time. On the ot her hand, a 42 proportion of the farms are selected according to the level of risk that applies. We undertook both of these changes, as we set ourselves the target back in 2013, to improve upon the s creening programme carried out in 2012, while keeping costs at the same level. During the year under r eview, the tried-and- tested screening programme adopted in 2013 was retained. As screening using samples of milk from a tank is much more cost-effective than the testing of blood samples taken from individual livestock that is necessary when testing animals on non-dairy farms, test- ing only dairy farms would appear to be an attractive option. Nevertheless, pr oceeding in that manner would severely violate the fundamental principle of selection at random that is applied when collecting the random sample. For that reason, we set the same screening targets for dairy f arms and non-dairy farms alike. Taking the entire cattle population as a whole, these targets far exceed the requirements laid down by the EU and increase the degree of probability that the screen ing programme will detect any IBR outbreaks that exist. The screening programme for 2014 was designed in such a way that in the case of both sub-populations (dairy and non-dairy cattle farms), it would be possible to achiev e 99% certainty that the design preva- lence of 0.2% would be detected. When carrying out the calculation in this wa y and in the case of a given size of the random sample population, a higher design prevalence is detected, w ith a greater the degree of certainty. When extrapolating from the sub-populations to the population as a whole, one either obtains a very high degree of certainty at a design prevalence of 0.2%, or the design prevalence is almost halved, while the existing degree of certainty, of 99%, remains the s ame ( Table 8.a ). Design Prevalence established [%] Certainty arising from non-dairy farms [%] Certainty arising from dairy farms [%] Certainty arising from dairy farms [%] This design prevalence corresponds to: 0.200 99 99 99.99 78 farms 0.103 90 90 99.00 40 farms Table 8.a: Relationship between certainty and design prevalence, including sub-populations and total population for the IBR random sample carried out in 2015 In addition to categorising dairy and non-dairy farms, it is also necessar y within each sub-population to make a distinction between Sentinel farms and farms that were selected at random. To that end, we decided that half of the required certainty should be obtained by examining farms selected at random. The other half would then be obtained by examining Sentinel farms. In view of t he stochastic interrela- tionship, a level of certainty equivalent to 90% would correspond to half of the certainty required in order to reach a certainty level of 99%. This means therefore that 90% of certainty in each case must be obtained from each of the four types of farm. When calculating the number of farms to be included in the random sample, we always include an additional number of farms as a back-up, as it may not be possible for some of the farms selected to be tested as a result of circumst ances. Table 8.b contains a summary detailing the calculated random sample sizes, population figures and backup farms that have been identified. Animal disease Type of farm Samples Farms in population Number of farms required Sentinel farms Farms se- lected at random Back-up farms IBR Non-dairy farm Individual blood samples 15,584 1,100 63 1,037 - Dairy farm Samples of milk stored in tanks 26,516 1,700 67 1,633 100 Table 8.b: Distribution of the selected farms according to type and method of selection 43 When calculating the size of the sample and in order to achieve a higher qu ality of surveillance, we decided to forego the possibility of carrying out a risk-based random sampl e calculation as a means of reducing the number of farms to be checked. Nevertheless, it is also possible t o delay applying that method until the evaluation stage. Since 2012, as a means of evaluating the samples obtained during the random sampling for I BR, we have used a special statistical method, in which the result of the current sample is combined with the data obtained from the sample in the preceding year ( Bayesian method ). In order to calculate the decline in certainty arising from the previous random samples, we carried out an ex tensive, quantitative risk evaluation over a period spanning several years. Since 2012, we have been using a simplified procedure, in which we evaluate the current sample and take into account a decline in cer tainty relating to the previous samples of 10% per year, in so far as fewer than 2,500 cattle w ere imported during the preceding year. This simplified procedure is based upon the data from the quantitative r isk evaluation that was carried out over a number of years. In view of the fact that a total of 1,636 cattle were imported during the preceding year, we were able to make use of the simplified procedure when carry ing out our review for 2014. 8.1.3 Selection of farms In the case of the samples taken to test for IBR and EBL, the same farms are s elected from the animal transport database and all cattle sampled are screened for both diseases. Farms, fro m which regular milk samples are taken for milk screening by Suisselab AG in Zollikofen, are r egarded as dairy farms, whilst all other farms are regarded as non-dairy farms ( Table 8.c ). The aim of the screening programme is to enable a statement to be made with regard to each farm. The standardised nature of the random samples taken at a farm is therefore paramount. For each farm t hat is screened, a calculation is carried out to determine the level of certainty with which it is possible to rule out the possibility of infection amongst the livestock. To that end, we rely upon an examination of indi- vidual animals as a diagnostic test for the farm as a whole. The sampling of mi lk stored in a tank, on the other hand, constitutes a mixed sample from all lactating cows on a particul ar farm. When testing a sample from milk stored in a tank, it is necessary to consider that only s ome of the cows on a farm may actually be lactating. For that reason, we analyse two samples taken at an int erval of 3 months, in order that as many of the cows on a farm as possible are included. In the case of IBR, we not only make use of selection at random, but also the ris k-based selection of farms (see Section 8.1.2). Sentinel farms for the purpose of IBR testing f eature several of the following characteristics, which were identified during an expert examination of the risk factors that apply in rela- tion to IBR: Use of summer pasture Farms with an above-average rate of livestock movement (animal movements in the animal transport database) Farms that have imported cattle Proximity of farm to the border (a distance of 5 km between the farm and th e border or road crossing the border) Farms in areas characterised by a high density of herds These five risk factors give rise to a total of 32 permutations. Farms wit h the same combination of risk factors will have the same relative risk that the disease will occur. As a result, they will be assigned to the same risk group, of which there are 32 in total. Farms in groups 1-7 have a ver y high risk of the disease occurring on the farm. All farms in these uppermost risk groups are t herefore selected as Sen- tinel farms. Farms belonging to the lower risk groups (number 8 or higher) are sel ected at random. The spot checks are also stratified by canton, based upon the number of farms in each canton. Stratification enables us to ensure that the farms that are selected are highly representativ e. In the case of the non- dairy farms selected at random, those that have been tested for IBR during t he past three years are excluded. 44 Type of farm Selection method Data set Random selection Stratified by canton Sampling period Non-dairy cattle farms (blood sam- ples) Random selec- tion Animal Transport Database as at 11 November of pre- ceding year Yes Yes 1.1. 2014.-31.5.2014 Sentinel farms No No Dairy cattle farms (samples of milk from tanks) Random selec- tion Milk testing, as at 11 November of pre- ceding year Yes Yes Two samples per farm: January and April 2014 (see Sec- tion 8.2.4) Sentinel farms No No Table 8.c: Selection of farms and sampling period 45 8.1.4 Selection of livestock In the case of non-dairy farms, blood samples are primarily taken from cattle older t han 24 months. These are then analysed to check for the presence of IBR antibodies. If fewer than seven animals are older than 24 months, a total of seven blood samples will be taken, including some from younger ani- mals. In the case of dairy farms, on the other hand, it is impossible to identify the cows that provided the milk that is included in a sample taken from a milk storage tank. By testing two s amples taken at an interval of three months, there is a high probability that all of the lactating cows on a f arm will have been included. All younger and male cattle are not included in the testing of milk contained in a s torage tank. In farms of both types, the probability of discovering any existing cow or bull infected with IBR will be 99%. 8.1.5 Laboratory analyses As part of the IBR screening programme, samples of milk taken from storage tanks at dairy farms, or blood samples from individual animals from non-dairy farms are analysed. In th e case of the samples of milk taken from storage tanks, diagnostic testing to ascertain the presence of I BR is carried out from what remains of the samples after the official milk testing has been carried out by Suisselab AG. The blood samples are extracted on the farms themselves by specially assigned veterinar ians. They are then sent for testing to one of several laboratories accredited by the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO) where they are individually analysed. The veterinarian must c omplete a collection report for each of the farms selected. If no blood samples could be taken - possibly because the f arm no longer keeps cattle, or if, at the time that controls are being carried out, no cat tle were present on the farm, the reason must be given. All samples taken as part of the sampling for IBR are also tes ted for EBL. Irrespective of whether a milk or a blood sample is tested, the aim of the ana lysis will be ascertain the presence of any antibodies against BHV-1. Any type of laboratory-based diagnos tic method can give rise to a false result, however this occurs only rarely and only under certain conditions. Those results may be either a false negative or a false positive. The probability of a laborat ory-based test giving rise to a false-negative result is described by the concept of sensitivity . In the case of a false-negative result, an infected animal will not be identified as such. In the case of false-positive results, the concept of specificity will be applied. In the case of a false-positive result, a healthy animal will be incorrectly labelled as infected. When issuing evidence of disease-free status, the procedure adopted first involves carrying out a screening test, mostly in the form of an ELISA, which is as sensitive as possible. That way, no infected animal will be missed, though a few false-positive results may be generated. The pos- itive samples identified following the ELISA test can then be re-examined using a s pecific test, in order to identify the false-positive samples. These confirmatory tests are carried out at the national reference laboratory. This procedure can also be applied in the case of the blood samples taken in order to iden tify cases of IBR. In the case of the samples of milk, the procedure will require slight ad aptation, as no confirmatory test is currently available in the case of milk samples being tested for IBR. What is more, the testing of milk sampled from a tank is highly sensitive and specific at the same time. F or that reason and in the event that the testing of a milk sample taken from a tank gives rise to a positiv e result, the same ELISA test will be carried out once again. If the result of the second test t o be carried out is also positive, all cattle from the farm will be tested by the taking of blood samples. If the second t est to be carried out is negative, the sample will be tested for a third time and the result obtai ned on that occasion will be used (Table 8.d ). 46 Animal dis- ease and type of sample Screening method Sensitivity and specificity 1) [%] Method used in con- firmatory analyses of samples that have tested positive Sensitivity and specificity [%] Reference labora- tory and 98.3-100 Virological Institute of the Vet- suisse Faculty of the University of Zurich IBR, samples of milk taken from a stor- age tank ELISA Both almost 100 Blood samples at a farm - - Table 8.d: Methods applied to screening for IBR, including sensitivity and specif icity and the IBR refer- ence laboratory In view of the fact that before the samples taken at random are analysed, it is assumed that Switzerland is free of IBR, animal keepers from the farms tested can expect to receive a negative test result. In those cases, no laboratory reports are sent. 8.1.6 Case definition The Animal Diseases Ordinance stipulates that in the case of IBR, any cow or bull confirmed by the reference laboratory to be carrying antibodies shall be deemed to be infected and that measures must be taken on the farm concerned (the same also applies in the case of EBL). When evaluating cases in accordance with the Animal Diseases Ordinance, it is also necessary to dis- tinguish between those cases in which antibodies were detected or those in which the presence of pathogens was established. In cases involving antibodies only, this means that the animal has been in contact with the pathogen at some time in the past. This may also mean that the animal was inoculated and is therefore incapable of infecting other animals. In very rare cases, it ma y also be the case that animals yield a positive result during the serological test, even though they had never been in contact with the pathogen in question. Animals of this type are referred to as singleton reactors . The reasons for this may involve non-specific immune responses or cross-reactive res ponses to other pathogens. As a result, different scenarios are capable of giving rise to a positive test r esult. It is therefore important to investigate the situation in more detail. Further investigations of th e animal, the farm and any other farms with which the animal has been in contact are the only way to enable sin gleton reactors to be distin- guished from a genuine outbreak of a disease, to find the route along which the disease arri ved in the country and to adjust the measures in line with the actual level of risk t hat exists. 8.1.7 Results 2004-2014 Since 1994, the year in which tests of random samples were first used as a means of providing evidence for disease-free status, a number of individual IBR outbreaks have occurred. Follo wing a major outbreak in a stable belonging to a cattle dealer in Graub\u00fcnden in 2005 ( Table 8.e ), the most recent outbreak occurred in 2009 and involved three farms located in the Jura region. None of these outbreaks was identified during the random sampling programme (see Section 8.1.8). These particular cases highlight the existing risk of IBR being brought into Switzerland. In order that the analysis of samples taken at random does not only generate statistics used in order to provide evidence of di sease-free status, but 47 is also represents a more suitable means of detecting outbreaks, we decided to f orego risk-based ran- dom sample calculation from 2012 onwards. This meant, however, that the number of far ms screened had to be increased. What is more, the use of diagnostic testing of milk sampled fro m storage tanks enabled the number of farms being tested to be increased, in a cost-neutral manner. I t was also neces- sary to forego the risk-based random sample calculation in 2010 and 2011. This was due to the outbreak of IBR in 2009. In addition, two samples tested positive in 2010. During t hat period, it was not possible to provide evidence of disease-free status, nor was it possible to arrive at a reliable estimation of the situation with regard to disease status. With the exception of 2005, it has always been possible to arrive at the requir ed degree of certainty. Since 2011, the degree of certainty has even been significantly higher than the required level of 99%. The fact that the surveillance that has been carried out since 2011 is also more suitable when it comes to detecting any outbreak that may already have occurred, is evidenced by the larger number of farms (which, in turn, provides more effective coverage of the population due to the use of the random sample) and by the singleton reactors discovered in 2013 and 2014. In 2014, a total of 62 Sentinel farms were tested by the taking of blood samples, while 58 Sentinel farms were tested usin g samples of milk taken from storage tanks, 1,218 farms selected at random were tested through the taking of blood samples and 1,665 farms selected at random were tested using samples of milk taken from storage t anks. Over- all, a total of 20,284 blood samples and 3,372 samples of milk taken from storage tanks were analysed. The rise in the number of samples testing positive during the screening was most likely due to the increase in infections with a different herpes virus, namely the pathogen associated with bovine mam- millitis (BHV-2). In 2015, a research project was carried out into that c ondition.

The case ident ified in the random sample was a singleton reactor. Irrespective of this particular case from the random sample, screening car ried out upon animals being transported identified a further animal that was sero-positive. 48 8.1.8 More detailed epidemiological investigation a rising from sur- veillance activity The types of epidemiological investigation that are required in response to each occ urrence of an animal disease are laid down in the Animal Diseases Ordinance. This chapter will now set out to describe investigations that extend beyond such activities. If a case of IBR is detected, the farm concerned will be placed in quarantine, until such time as the infected cattle have been sl aughtered and the remaining cattle have been retested after 30 days and the results of those tests have b een found to be negative. All epidemiologically linked will also be tested. Epidemiologically linked f arms are those farms from which the infected farm has received cattle, with whose cattle the infected cattle from the farm concerned have been in contact or to which cattle from the infected farm were moved. Prec isely which farms are epidemiologically linked will be established in accordance with the risk assessment carried out by the cantons and the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO). 2011 The IBR outbreak in 2009 that was mentioned in Section 8.1.7 involved 2 farms in t he canton of Jura and a third farm in the canton of Neuch\u00e2tel, in which only a calf purchased from outside the farm tested positive for IBR. In 2010, during the random sampling carried out in order to pro vide evidence of disease- free status in connection with IBR, 2 animals in the canton of Jura were f ound to be sero-positive. An analysis of animal transport data uncovered a contact network involving around 100 farm s, many of which were located in the canton of Jura. For that reason, it was decided to c arry out a full investigation in to these cases and to screen additional farms in Jura for IBR. In 2011, t he farms to be screened were selected on the basis of three criteria: All farms that formed part of the contact network referred to above In the district of Porrentruy, all farms displaying at least two of the six risk factors. In the canton of Jura, all farms that had sent cattle to summer pasture in France in 2009 and 2010 Thereafter, an additional 188 farms were screened for IBR. All of those farms tes ted negative. An evaluation of the contact network was carried out, in order to calculat e the risk that the disease may have been transmitted between the farms concerned. This is possible, on condition that one of the two affected farms in the canton of Jura in 2009 was the primary case and that the disease was transmitted from that farm to the other farm affected. Of the farms within the contact network during 2009/2010, only one was found to be IBR-positive. According to an analysis of the ani mal transport database, each of the affected farms had contact with around 100 other farms in Switzerland during that period. For the period in question, this equates to a risk of transmission of 2% and can therefore be regarded as mini- mal. The evaluation of the farms tested with the aim of providing evidence of diseas e-free status for the district of Porrentruy and the canton of Jura, meant that it was possible to acquire additional information during the course of the investigations. By carrying out an evaluation, it is also possible to estimate the probability of an independent occurrence of IBR and to relate this to the v alidity of the national random sampling programme. In order to calculate the probability of an occurrence of I BR, the total number of cattle farms in Porrentruy that were listed in the animal transport databas e (TVD 2010) was determined to be 315, whilst the number in the canton of Jura that were listed in t he agricultural information system (AGIS 2009) was found to be 950 ( Table 8.f ). The relative risk for the at-risk farms was determined to be factor 3. 49 Companies Farms tested (at-risk farms) With 99% certainty, fewer than welipsis infected farms With 95% certainty, fewer than welipsis infected farms Porrentruy 315 35 11 8 Jura 950 135 at-risk farms, plus 14 selected at ran- dom 9 5 Table 8.f: Result of the additional investigations in the canton of Jura in 2011 In contrast, the national random sampling programme carried out across Switzerland as a whole pro- vided evidence that to a level of certainty of 99%, the herd prevalence was below 0.2%. This corre- sponds to around 90 infected farms. This regional evaluation therefore clearly demonstrated th at a larger outbreak of IBR in the canton of Jura can be ruled out. What is more, havi ng carried out this investigation, the certainty that the canton of Jura is disease-free is greater than the lev el of certainty that applies to the rest of Switzerland. For statistical reasons, it is impossible to provide absolute proof of disease -free status using random sampling. Rather, this method is capable of providing information regarding the proba bility (certainty) that the prevalence will lie below a specific value. The outcome of this procedure depends to a consid- erable degree upon the size of the population that is tested: the smaller the populati on tested, the lower the degree of certainty that the prevalence will lie below the specified value. To that extent, it comes as no surprise that a small number of infected farms in the canton of Jura cannot be r uled out. This does not mean, however, that these actually exist. Due to the fact that a clust er of cases within the same region can be expected when an outbreak of an infectious disease occurs, the degree of cert ainty ob- tained as a result of a regional screening is greater than the certainty that woul d be obtained from a screening programme on a national level involving the same number of farms. In addit ion, the results must always be viewed in the context of the additional surveillance measur es. These also gave no indication of an outbreak of disease in the canton of Jura. 2009 IBR was detected during the examination of an aborted foetus in the canton of J ura. The outbreak encompassed two farms located in that canton. On a third farm located in the canton of Neuch\u00e2tel, IBR was only detected in a calf purchased from outside of the farm. In two of the three farms examined, a large proportion of cattle were sero-positive. In order to combat IBR, thos e cattle had to be slaughtered. What this outbreak shows is that IBR occurred in Switzerland in 2009. Des pite successful random sam- pling, it was therefore impossible to assume that cattle from Switzerland were f ree of IBR. For that reason, no residual certainty could be assumed during the programme of random sampli ng carried out in 2010. As a result, it was necessary to carry out a random sample calculated in the conventional way in 2010. This meant that in 2010, it was necessary to double the number of farms s creened, in compar- ison to 2009. 2007 The animal that tested positive was actually a 14-year old cow imported from Fr ance in 1999. The farm had been screened in 2006 during random sampling and according to the documentary records, the cow that tested positive in 2007 hadtested serologically negative in 2006. At the time that the random sampling was carried out in 2007, the cow that tested positive was lac tating, was treated for mastitis and displayed none of the clinical symptoms of IBR or IPV. During the inv estigations on the farm, it was determined, however, that the random sampling in 2006 and 2007 was not carried out correc tly; too few samples had been taken. In 2006, an additional 36 cattle and in 2007, 37 cattle tested serol ogically negative. During the screening 30 days after the cow that tested positive was slaughtered, all 99 cattle on the farm tested serologically negative. Investigations on the epidemiologic ally linked farms revealed 50 no signs of IBR or IPV. Overall, the case was categorised as an isolated p ositive case, though an infec- tion with BHV-1 cannot be ruled out with absolute certainty. Nevertheless, mor e plausible explanations are available for the facts established. The ultimate reason for the laboratory re sults will have been a non-specific response or, more likely, a latent infection that was reactivated, or a living virus adminis- tered in the form of a vaccination that was originally latent but became reactiv ated. In particular, refer- ences are made in the literature to laboratory results obtained in animals infected wit h BHV-1 and then vaccinated with an IBR marker, that were unable to be replicated. This situation c ould have occurred in the case of the animal that tested positive in 2007, that is, it could have been vaccinated prior to being imported into Switzerland. 2005 In the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden, a cow from a cattle farm was diagnosed with IBR/IPV. The cow, along with an additional animal suspected to be infected, was slaughtered immedi ately and the farm was put into quarantine by the animal health authorities. The cow that tested IBR-p ositive had been born and reared at the farm concerned and was clinically healthy at the time the samples were taken. No further cases were discovered during investigations carried out at the epidemiologic ally linked farms. All of the measures required under the Animal Diseases Ordinance were carried out. No signs of an out- break of disease were found. This was therefore a case of a singleton reactor. A second case was diagnosed in the canton of Aargau. A cow had been admitted to an a nimal hospital as a result of a different disease and tested positive in the screening, as well as in the confirmatory test. Following investigations on the epidemiologically linked farms and in all farms t hat had sent cattle to the animal hospital during the same period, no further animals were found to be carrying th e infection. All of the measures required under the Animal Diseases Ordinance were carried out. As there no s igns were found that pointed to an outbreak of disease, this case was also deemed to be si ngleton reactor. 8.1.9 Conclusion Switzerland also successfully provided evidence of disease-free status for IBR in 2014. As in the pre- ceding years, the level of certainty obtained during the programme of random sampli ng was significantly higher than the level required by the EU. This is a manifestation of the significant improvement in sur- veillance made during the screening programme since 2009, which was achieved with out giving rise to an increase in costs. In view of the risk of disease being brought into the country , that improvement in surveillance is justified, as it enables an outbreak of IBR to be detected as earl y as possible, so that the cost of combating the disease can be kept manageable. 8.2 Enzootic bovine leukosis Enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) is a chronic, wasting disease that pri marily occurs in cattle. Goats and sheep are affected only rarely. The disease is not harmful to humans. The disease is caus ed by the bovine leukaemia virus of the deltaretrovirus genus (the Retroviridae family). After infection, it takes from months to years until symptoms of the disease become visible. The clinical form of the disease typically begins with a loss of appetite, deterioration in milk output and weight-loss. After that, the victim's lymph nodes become enlarged (lymphadenopathy). Dependin g on their location, these expanding lymph nodes may not cause any symptoms, or may give rise to typical symptoms. If the affected lymph nodes are located near the surface, they will be easily visibl e. In an animal sent for slaughter, changes to the lymph nodes can easily be confused with tuberculosis. Only cattle which have a genetic pre-disposition will develop this illness. Other cattle ma y lack any signs of the disease, though the typical changes associated with leukosis may well be detectable in thei r blood. The infection can be determined by the presence of non-neutralising antibodies. As no neutralising antibodi es are formed in 51 the case of leukosis, the disease cannot be diagnosed by means of a serum neutralisatio n test (SNT). The disease is transmitted via milk, semen, blood, contaminated equipment (used syringes, dehor ning tools) and by biting houseflies (gadflies). Though nowadays, only individual animals belonging to an affected herd are actually clinically affected by a disease, EBL formerly gave rise to significant commer- cial losses. Today, EBL is widespread, but has been eradicated in many European count ries. Switzerland has carried out a screening programme since 1994, as a means of providing evidence of its disease-free status in connection with EBL. After 9 years with no cases of EBL or any isolated positive cases, the most recent case of EBL in Switzerland occurred in 2005. This inv olved a serological single- ton reactor. The surrounding regions and countries are predominantly free of EBL. In the case of impor ts from re- gions that are not EBL-free, cattle must undergo a special quarantine programme. Trade between EBL- free regions is not subject to regulation. 8.2.1 Procedure to provide evidence of disease-free status In order to provide evidence of disease-free status in connection with EBL, the f ollowing conditions must have been fulfilled in advance (this is explained in Section 8.1.1): No signs of EBL Compulsory reporting of disease and any suspected cases Disease-awareness and effective early detection In view of the fact that in the case of EBL, the clinical manifestati on of the disease occurs only in a small number of infected cattle and only following a long period of incubation, clin ical surveillance is not a very promising method of detecting infected animals at an early stage. During the incubation period, t rans- mission of the infection to other cattle is possible, but occurs only rare ly. With regard to the surveillance of entire farms, this fact means that an infected animal can form part of a herd for several years, without other animals becoming infected. With regard to the surveillance of EBL, an important aspect of the monitoring process is for the meat control personnel to examine the lymph nodes o f an animal for typical changes at the point of slaughter. As a result of Switzerland's bilateral treaties with the EU, it i s sensible to carry out random sampling as part of a screening programme, in order to provide evidence of disease-free status in relation to EBL and in order to be able to export cattle and products derived from cattle to other count ries that are also EBL-free. The importation of cattle and semen can also be regulated. The screening programme imple- mented in Switzerland fulfils the requirement by the EU that disease-free statu s be underpinned by relevant statistical evidence. 8.2.2 Calculation of the random sample In the case of random sampling to test for EBL and IBR, the same farms are sel ected and all cattle sampled are screened for both diseases. The calculations that form the basis of the random sample are the same for IBR as they are for EBL (see Section 8.1.2). In accordance wi th the bilateral treaties con- cluded with the EU, disease-free status in connection with EBL must be evidence d by means of a herd prevalence of below 0.2% that has been established to a certainty of 99%. 8.2.3 Selection of farms Random sampling to establish the presence of EBL is carried out on the same farms as those selected for screening for IBR. The methods used when selecting those farms were descri bed above in connec- tion with IBR (see Sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.3). During a separate expert survey, three risk factors for EBL were identified that are used in order to select Sentinel farms: 52 Use of summer pasture Farms with an above-average rate of livestock movement (with reference to the animal transport database) Farms that have imported cattle These three risk factors give rise to a total of eight different permutations. F arms with the same permu- tation of these factors will have the same relative risk of EBL occurring on the farm. Those farms belong to the same risk group and the number of possible permutations dictates that the number of ri sk groups totals eight. Farms belonging to groups 1 and 2 have the highest relative risk. All of these are treated as Sentinel farms. Farms belonging to group 3 that have a lower risk need not be included without exception and are therefore selected at random. 8.2.4 Selection of livestock For the purpose of these investigations into the possible occurrence of E BL, samples from the same cattle are used as were used during screening for IBR (see Section 8.1.3 and 8.1.4 ). 8.2.5 Laboratory analyses As each sample from the IBR screening programme is also analysed to detect EBL, sign ificant aspects of the laboratory analysis were described in relation to IBR (see Section 8.1.5). They apply in equal measure to EBL, with the exception of the information regarding sensitivity and spec ificity of the screen- ing and confirmatory analysis and the reference laboratory indicated ( Table 8.g ).

In the case of EBL, singleton reactors (cross-reactive responses) occur even more rarely, however, than in the case of IBR. 8.2.7 Results 2004-2014 Since 2004, when analyses of random samples were carried out for the fir st time, only individual cattle have tested positive for EBL. It is almost impossible to say whether these were singleton reactors or were infected animals, which up to that point had not infected any other animals. Nevertheless, we can certainly assume that EBL does not occur endemically in Switzerland without having been detected. This has been clearly established by the analyses of random samples that have been carried out over a number of years. With the exception of 2005, it was always possible to arrive at the requi red level of certainty. Since 2011, the level of certainty has even been significantly higher than the required lev el of 99%. In 2014, a total of 305 Sentinel farms were tested by the taking of blood samples, while 311 Sentinel farms were tested using samples of milk taken from storage tanks, 975 farms selected at random were tested through the taking of blood samples and 1,414 farms selected at random were tested for EBL usi ng samples of milk taken from storage tanks (total: 3005 farms, Table 8.h ). Overall, a total of 20,284 blood samples and 3,412 samples of milk taken from storage tanks were analysed (23,696 samples in total).

The case ident ified within the random sample was a singleton reactor. Irrespective of this particular case from the random sample , screening carried out upon animals being transported identified a further animal that was sero-positive. 54 8.2.8 More detailed epidemiological investigations arising from sur- veillance activity The types of epidemiological investigation that are required in response to each occ urrence of an animal disease are laid down in the Animal Diseases Ordinance. The measures to be taken in th e event of an occurrence of EBL are similar to the ones to be taken in an occurrence of IBR (see S ection 8.1.8), but are slightly more stringent. For example,the milk must be boiled before being used to f eed animals and two serological tests of the farm must be carried out following the s laughter of the infected animals. The additional tests required are described below. 2005 In the canton of Zurich, a five-year-old cow from a cattle farm was diag nosed with EBL. The cow was slaughtered immediately and the farm was put into quarantine by the animal health authorit ies. The cow which tested positive for EBL had been healthy at the time that the sample was t aken. During an exam- ination of the lymph nodes after slaughter, no bovine leukosis virus was found. N o further cases were discovered during investigations carried out at epidemiologically linked farms . All of the measures re- quired under the Animal Diseases Ordinance were carried out. No signs of an outbreak of disease were found. This therefore concerned a singletone reactor. 8.2.9 Conclusion Switzerland also successfully provided evidence of disease-free status for EBL in 2014. As in the pre- ceding years, the level of certainty obtained during the programme of random sampli ng was significantly higher than the level required by the EU. This is a manifestation of the s ignificant improvement in sur- veillance carried out during the screening programme since 2009, which was ac hieved without giving rise to an increase in costs. 8.3 Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is caused by the PRR S virus, which is part of the genus Arterivirus . Depending on the location of the first occurrence, it is possible t o distinguish between North American and European strains. Today, both strains occur the world ov er. The virus only affects pigs and does not remain contagious for long in the environment. The incubation peri od is short, lasting only a few days. As its name suggests, the disease occurs in two f orms. The reproductive form primarily affects breeding sows and boars. Breeding sows display symptoms of fertility disorder and late abortions, whilst in the case of boars, their fertility is reduced. Ol der piglets show symptoms of stunted growth, fever and loss of appetite. In its respiratory form, the disease affec ts the respiratory tract in older piglets and fattening pigs. They have fever, sneeze, cough and have difficul ty breathing. This, in turn, affects their development as fattening pigs. As a result of these clinical sympt oms, PRRS forms an important differential diagnosis in relation to Classical and African sw ine fever. In most cases, all of the pigs on an affected farm will contract the disease. The death rate, however, remains low. Transmission within the herd occurs via direct contact or through the air. In rarer cases , it may occur as a result of feeding the animals with uncooked meat waste or using infected semen. In the case of trans mission from farm to farm, this can occur as a result of animal movement or through the air across a distance of a few hundred metres. Vaccinations against PRRS are available, though the vac cination only goes some way towards minimising losses, but does not restrict the spread of the vi rus itself. In addition, the viruses used in the vaccination can themselves be transmitted and can cause large-scale loss es in farms whose livestock have not been vaccinated. PRRS occurs in almost all countries in Europe. All of Switzerland's neighb ouring countries are infected and Switzerland itself is one of the few countries in the world that are free of PRRS. Up to the present 55 time, the disease has been diagnosed in Switzerland only three times, before being eradi cated immedi- ately afterwards. The most recent outbreak in Switzerland was in 2012. In 2006, t he official programme of screening using random sampling of pigs was expanded with the addition of the ra ndom sampling required in order to provide evidence of disease-free status, in accordanc e with which it became possible to demonstrate that Switzerland is PRRS-free. No international agreements exis t with regard to PRRS. The screening programme is carried out in order to confirm Switzerland's status as a PRRS-free country. The importation of the disease and its subsequent onward transmission throughout the e ntire territory of Switzerland could result in severe economic consequences. 8.3.1 Procedure for the monitoring of disease-free status In order to provide evidence of disease-free status in connection with PRRS, t he following conditions must have been fulfilled in advance (this is explained in Section 8.1.1): No indications of PRRS in Switzerland Compulsory reporting of disease and any suspected cases Switzerland's status as a country that is free of PRRS was first de monstrated back in 2001. At that time, following a minor outbreak, a mass screening was carried out, in which over 4 0,000 pigs were serolog- ically tested for PRRS. The outcome confirmed the fact that at that time, havin g successfully combated the outbreak, Switzerland was free of PRRS once again. There is always a r isk that PRRS will be brought back into the country. That is why it is crucially important to have det ailed disease-awareness and an effective means of recognising disease at an early stage. Animals that are displa ying the typical, clinical signs of a disease must be tested. This means, for example, that the breeding so ws in a herd that are affected by a noticeably increased rate of abortion must be screened for PRRS. Though the signs will generally be thought to be the result of a different cause, due to the fact that PRR S is not endemic in Switzerland, such screening is still necessary, as the disease may be br ought in from outside the country at any time. Other than in the case of diseases that are subject to internat ional regulations, no import regulations have been introduced in the case of PRRS. Nevertheless, import organis ations voluntarily adhere to a number of stringent rules. Furthermore, all pigs that are tested because they are suspected to be suffering from swine fever or that are examined during screenings for that dise ases, are also screened for PRRS. The PRRS screening programme is the same as the one carried out in order to screen for Aujeszky's disease. This enables synergies to be utilised in the most effective possible way. This also ensures that the PRRS screening programme is underpinned by the necessary scientific and s tatistical data. 8.3.2 Calculation of the random sample The screening programme for PRRS is largely based on the screening programme for Auj eszky's dis- ease. The reason for this is that Switzerland carries out the PRRS screening for its own interests and the EU imposes no requirements in that regard. For that reason, the risk-based random s ample calcu- lation is also applied in the case of PRRS (this is explained in Section 8 .1.2). A random sample must provide evidence of a herd prevalence below 0.2%, to a level of certainty of 99%. All other aspects of the random sample calculation are described in the section referring to Aujeszky's disease (see Section 8.4.2). An obvious disadvantage of the smaller sample achieved by means of a risk-based random s ample calculation, lies in the fact that it would cause the probability t hat infected farms would be found, if they existed, to be reduced. In view of the favourable international situation wi th regard to the disease, this disadvantage can be tolerated in the case of Aujeszky's disease; however th is is not also true of PRRS, as there a risk that it may be brought into the country. During the past fe w years, a number of cases, in which PRRS was brought into the country, resulting in an outbreak, were dis covered in Switzerland and some of these were discovered during the screening programme. In order to increase the probab ility 56 that any infected farms will be identified by means of the screening programme, the sensitivity of the screening programme should be increased from 2015 onwards, such that breeding farms are also in- cluded in the screening programme. 8.3.3 Selection of farms As the PRRS screening programme is dependent upon the screening programme for Aujeszk y's dis- ease, the selection of farms for the purpose of the PRRS screening takes place in the manner that is described in the case of Aujeszky's disease (see Section 8.4.3). All samples are tested for both dis- eases. 8.3.4 Selection of livestock The PRRS screening programme is based upon the screening programme for Aujeszky's dis ease. For that reason, the livestock are selected and samples taken in the same manner that is descr ibed in the case of Aujeszky's disease (see Section 8.4.4). All samples are tested for both diseases. 8.3.5 Laboratory analyses All blood samples from the screening programme for Aujeszky's disease are also tested for antibodies against PRRS. The procedure that is followed is described in the section referring to Aujeszky's disease (see Section 8.4.5). The methods used in the screening and the confirmatory analysi s for PRRS, the sensitivity and specificity that apply in each case and details of the reference laboratory for PRRS are given here ( Table 8.i).

This special definition is necessary as a result of the comparatively low specificity of a PRRS diagnosis (see Section 8.3.5). If, on the other hand, the presence of the virus is establish ed, then a single pig is sufficient to constitute an occurrence of the disease. If, of the six pigs per farm from which samples are taken, only one pig is confirmed to be sero-positive, further samples must then be taken f rom this farm of origin and analysed. Based upon the results obtained from those samples, a decision is then taken as to whether this constitutes an occurrence of the disease, or not. Nevertheless, different scenarios are capable of giving rise to a positiv e test result (see Section 8.1.6). 57 For that reason, it is important to investigate the situation in more detail and to distinguish isolated positive cases from a genuine outbreak of the disease. As antibodies against the PRR S virus are only detectable for a few months, a rapid investigation is crucial in order to estimate the actual cause of a positive finding of PRRS. 8.3.7 Results 2004-2014 Since 2006, random samples have been taken from pigs at the slaughterhouse and are tested for Aujeszky's disease and PRRS. Up to 2012, the results obtained in the case of PRRS were unequivocally negativ e. There were also no signs of the disease outside the scope of the screening programme. In 2012, it became known that the disease had been brought into the country in semen imported from Germany. While monitor ing a breed- ing boar farm in Germany, an infection with PRRS was detected and the Swiss aut horities were in- formed. The necessary investigations in Switzerland encompassed tests of 9,500 pigs on more than 100 farms. The PRRS virus was found in three farms ( Table 8.j), and on one farm, the virus had spread further. All animals from that herd had to be slaughtered. The random sample in 2013 was negative without exception. In 2014, three sero-positive pigs were detected amongst the samples and investiga- tions revealed that a breeding farm was infected. From there, the virus had also b een transmitted to a fattening farm. In the case of another occurrence of the disease, a number of sero-posit ive pigs were found, but the virus itself could not be detected. Based on these findings, it is difficult to gauge the situation regarding PRRS in Switzerland. The most probable explanation for the sit uations observed is that they can be attributed to vaccinations of individual pigs after the dise ase was brought into the coun- try from Germany in 2012. There is, however, no evidence to back up this expl anation. Year Number of farms tested Number of samples tested Screening of samples that tested posi- tive Confirma- tions of samples that tested posi- tive Certainty of disease-free status obtained [%] 2014 1,254, of which 1,252 with six or more blood samples 8,238 32 3 over 98.98* 2013 1,267 8,305 86 0 2,828 26,364 - 0 99.00 Table 8.j: Results of the random samples taken since 2004 in order to detect cases of PRRS * Evidence of disease-free status successful, despite positive test f indings. In accordance with the case definition for PRRS, occurrence case is only deemed to exist if two pigs on a farm are found to be sero-positive. Seropositive samples were found within the random sample, however, though these only related to individual animals on each the fattening farms concerned. The three occurrences of the disease were then detected during the investigations. 58 8.3.8 More detailed epidemiological investigations arising from monitoring activity The types of epidemiological investigation that are required in response to each occ urrence of an animal disease are laid down in the Animal Diseases Ordinance. This chapter will set out to describe investi- gations that extend beyond such activities. If a case of PRRS is d etected, the farm concerned will be placed in quarantine, the infected pigs are slaughtered and the remaining pigs retes ted after 30 days. In order for the quarantine to be lifted, the test results obtained at this po int must be negative. All epide- miologically linked farms are also tested. Epidemiologcially linked farms are those farms from which the infected farm has received pigs, farms whose pigs have been in contact with pigs fr om the infected farm, or farms, to which pigs from the infected farm have been moved. Precisely which farms are epidemio- logically linked is established in accordance with the risk assessment carried out by the cantons and the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO). 2014 In spring 2014, the PRRS virus was found to be present on one breeding farm and one fatt ening farm. What is more, it was also impossible to rule out with sufficient certai nty that the virus had been transmit- ted on an individual basis within other pig farms. For that reason, add itional screening of pig breeding farms was ordered. From mid-August to early September 2014, tests of breeding s ows were carried out at 107 breeding farms and in a random selection of a further 99 pig breeding farms . Those tests have since been completed and show that in the 3,281 pigs tested in total, no further incidences of the PRRS virus were found. During the initial screening, 12 animals tested positiv e for antibodies against the virus. Of those animals, 11 were found to be negative in the confirmatory test. Only one animal was still found to be positive in the confirmatory test. It was not possible, however, for an epidemiological link with a possible PRRS infection to be demonstrated. Thanks to intensive follow-up investi gations at the pig breeding farms, it proved possible for Switzerland's continued favourable status with regard to PRRS to be confirmed. 2012 In late November 2012, the PRRS virus entered Switzerland as a result of the import ation of sperm originating from infected animals at a breeding boar facility in Germany. A PRRS infection was detected on three farms in Eastern Switzerland. Those farms were placed in quarantine an d investigations carried out within the herds. At one farm, the infection had already spread and so the enti re herd had to be culled. A further 23 breeding farms were placed in quarantine, as they had also us ed sperm from the aforementioned breeding boar facility in Germany. Epidemiologically linked farms that had received an- imals from those breeding farms were also placed in quarantine. The blood samples taken from these farms (over 9,500 in total) were found to be PRRS-negative, however. 8.3.9 Conclusion Switzerland also successfully provided evidence of disease-free status for PRRS in 2014. This was still possible despite the occurrences of the disease that were identified, as those occurrences were promptly and rigorously dealt with and ultimately turned out to be isolated cases. Nevertheless, the situation remains unclear, as neither the route along which the virus entered the c ountry, nor the cause of the positive serological findings, could be traced. Nevertheless, all of the facts do not point to an outbreak of PRRS in Switzerland in 2014, but to individual, non-linked eve nts without any major trans- mission of the virus. 59 8.4 Aujeszky's disease Aujeszky's disease is caused by the Suid Herpesvirus 1 (SuHV1). Only pigs secrete the virus, once infected. Human beings are not susceptible to the virus. As far as this par ticular virus is concerned, it is necessary to make a distinction between the primary host (the pig) and the fi nal host (other susceptible animal species). The primary host is the species in which the virus regularly occurs, from which other species become infected. Final hosts do not, however, transmit the virus themsel ves. They can however become ill or die as a result of being infected with the virus. An infection with the SuHV1 virus is fatal in almost all mammalian species. Only in primates and horses does the disease rarely l ead to a fatal outcome. As is the case with all Herpes infections, pigs infected with SuH V1 will remain carriers of the virus for the rest of their lives. The secretion of the virus is reactiva ted as a result of stress. A typical feature of outbreaks on pig farms is that dead rodents, dogs and cats are also found. The transmission of the virus to end hosts mostly occurs via uncooked meat or abattoir waste. Between pigs themselves, there are a number of routes of transmission - by direct contact with infected an imals, via infected semen or secretions, airborne transmission, vertical transmission from sow to pigl et, or indirect transmission via contaminated feed or contaminated objects. End hosts become ill only a few d ays after infection, contracting encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the brain and linings of the bra in and the spinal cord). They also experience extreme itchiness. The resulting changes in behaviour resemble thos e associated with rabies. For that reason, Aujeszky's disease is sometimes referred t o as pseudo-rabies. The clinical symptoms in infected pigs are less clearly defined. Depending on the age of the pig at the time of infec- tion, the central nervous system, the respiratory system or reproductive system may be affected. Fully- grown pigs do not normally become ill following infection. Alongside Switzerland and Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Luxembourg, Austr ia, Germany and the United Kingdom (except for Northern Ireland), together with parts of Franc e, have been recognised as being free of Aujeszky's disease in domestic pigs. In Switzerland, the most r ecent recorded outbreak in domestic pigs occurred in 1990. Aujeszky's disease probably continues to occ ur at very low levels amongst wild pigs and therefore does not pose any threat to other animal species. Hunting do gs in particular are at risk of contracting the disease if waste or parts of w ild pigs are fed to them. The SuHV1 viruses occurring in wild pigs pose hardly any risk at all to domestic pigs , as the viruses have become specially adapted to wild pigs. 8.4.1 Procedure for the monitoring of disease-free status In order to provide evidence of disease-free status in connection with Auj eszky's disease, the following conditions must have been fulfilled in advance (this is explained in Sec tion 8.1.1): No indications of PRRS in Switzerland Compulsory reporting of disease and any suspected cases Random sampling in order to detect Aujeszky's disease has been carried out since 2001. As Switzer- land's neighbouring countries are also free of Aujeszky's disease and Switzerland does not import any live breeding pigs, there is only a minimal risk that the virus will b e brought into the country. As a result of the bilateral treaties with the EU, it is a sensible precaution to c arry out a screening programme for Aujeszky's disease by means of random sampling. The screening programme is necessary, in order to be able to export live pigs and products derived from them to countries that also h old disease-free status. Furthermore, this also enables the importation of live pigs and their semen to be regulated . An important pre-condition for such trade relationships is the comparability of disease-free status in the various coun- tries involved, in other words, the statements on which disease-free st atus is based must be backed up in the form of relevant statistics. The screening programme operated in Switzer land fulfils that require- ment. The screening programme for Aujeszky's disease was also adopted in order to screen for PRRS (See Section 8.3.1). The synergies that exist between the two programmes are being used as effec tively as possible. 60 8.4.2 Calculation of the random sample The sample is selected at random, in accordance with statistical principles. O nly if the farms to be sam- pled are selected at random is it possible to extrapolate the results across the population as a whole. In order to carry out the sampling in the most effective possible way, the Federal Food Safety and Veteri- nary Office (FSVO) has developed additional methods and has refined them (see Section 8.1.2). In the case of Aujeszky's disease, a risk-based random sample calculation is used. The reason for this is that the risk of Aujeszky's disease being brought into the country is very small and that since the introduction of random sampling, no further outbreaks have occurred in Switzerland. The reduced quality of surveil- lance provided by the sampling associated with this procedure is not of concern in the case of this particular disease and it is therefore possible to utilise the economic benefit s generated by this proce- dure. In the case of Aujeszky's disease, bilateral treaties stipulate that ran dom sampling must be carried out that demonstrates with 99% certainty that the herd prevalence is lower than 0. 2%. The screening programme in 2014 focused solely upon fattening farms, as samples can easil y be taken from fattening pigs at the point of slaughter. Furthermore, the size of the slaught erhouses means that it is possible to examine a sufficient number of animals from a particular farm, in order to be able to arrive at a statement regarding the farm concerned. As fattening pigs originally come from breeding farms, this is also a means of monitoring those farms as well, albeit indirectly. From an organisational point of view, samples taken to test for Aujeszky's disease and PRRS are processed at the same t ime. To evaluate the samples, we apply the Bayesian method (see Section 8.1.2). As Switz erland has not imported any breeding pigs for many years, it is not possible to carry out a quantitative import risk as- sessment in the case of Aujeszky's disease. For that reason, we make use of a sim plified process, within which a reduction in certainty of 10% per year is taken into account in the cal culations. That 10% is based upon a \"management\" decision and is intended to take account of all conceivable i mport risks. The reduction in certainty of 10% corresponds to a halving of the certainty, in other words, the sample is around half the size than it would have been, had this calculation proc ess not been used. 8.4.3 Selection of farms In order to carry out screenings for Aujeszky's disease and PRRS, farms are selected by means of convenience sampling by the meat control personnel at 4 slaughterhouses. Meat control pers onnel de- termine of their own accord, from which farms and from which animals the samples will be taken. The Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO) determines only the p eriod and the number of farms from which samples must be taken at each slaughterhouse. The multiple testing of farms should be avoided, but can sometimes occur, as the slaughterhouses do not have access to a database of their own. As we have determined during the past few years that from certain cantons almost no pigs for slaughter are sent to the four abattoirs, samples are taken at the farm by veterinarianss at three farms in the Principality of Liechtenstein and in the cantons of Valais, Ticino and G larus. In those cases, a total of six blood samples are taken from each of the pig farms from pigs that are older than six months. 8.4.4 Selection of livestock The meat control personnel at the slaughterhouse take blood samples from six pigs fro m each fattening farm ( Table 8.k ). The documentation maintained by meat control personnel enables the findings to be related back to the individual fattening farm. By examining six animals, we can achieve a herd sensitivity of 80%, based on the assumption that the prevalence on an infected farm will be 30%. 61 Animal dis- ease Animal category Samples Total number of pig farms Farms in- cluded in the sample Period of sam- pling Aujeszky's disease Fattening pigs 6 blood samples from individual animals from a fattening farm 7,692 1,340 1.1.2014- 31.5.2014 Table 8.k: The total number of pig farms in Switzerland, together with the calculated size of the sample population per farm; samples are taken from 6 fattening pigs per farm 8.4.5 Laboratory analyses The blood samples taken by meat control personnel are sent to the designated diagnosti cs laboratories, where they are tested for antibodies against Aujeszky's disease and PRRS. Any type of laboratory- based diagnostic method can give rise to a false-negative or a false-positive result, however this occurs only rarely and only under certain conditions. The way in which this prob lem is approached in the context of screening programmes is described in the section devoted to IBR (see Sectio n 8.1.5).

As a variety of scenarios can give rise to a positive test result (see Section 8.1.6), it is important to investigate the situation in more detail and to distinguish singleton reactors from a genuine outbreak of the disease. 62 8.4.7 Results 2004-2014 Since 2006, random samples have been taken from pigs at the abattoir and are tested for Aujeszky's disease and PRRS. From 2001 to 2004, samples were taken from breeding sows at the point of slaughter or on the farm. From 2004 to 2014, none of the samples taken were confirmed to be p osi- tive for Aujeszky's disease ( Table 8.m ).

No investigations therefore needed to be carried out. 8.4.9 Conclusion Switzerland also successfully provided evidence of disease-free status f or Aujeszky's disease in 2014. As in the preceding years, the level of certainty obtained by random sa mpling was higher than the level required by the EU. 63 8.5 Brucella melitensis Brucellosis in sheep and goats a facultative, intra-cellular gram-nega- tive incubation period of several weeks, this condit ion is the cause of high abor- tion rates or the birth of less viable lambs. The placenta appears thickened and oedemat ous and dis- plays purulent-necrotising lesions in the vicinity of the cotyledons. Foetus es may be covered by yellow- ish membranes and the placenta is often retained post-partum. In a few cases, a mucal, purulent grey- white to reddish vaginal secretion may be observed a few days before the bir th. Transmission takes place both horizontally and vertically. A typical symptom encountered in male animal s that have become infected is a swelling of the testicles. This disease is a classic example of a zoonosis, and the bacterium can also affect hu mans. In humans, the disease is known as Bang's disease, Malta fever or Febris undulans. The other types of Brucella are also zoonotic, to a greater or a lesser degree (see Section 9.7). Infected animals secrete the pathogen mainly through the sex organs and mammary glands. Transmis- sion primarily takes place via infected semen, milk and lochia. Entry takes place o rally or via lesions in the skin or mucous membranes. The most recent case of brucellosis in sheep and goats in Switzerland occurred in 1985. Since 1998, the country's disease-free status in relation to brucellosis amongst the population of small ruminants is being monitored by means of examinations of aborted foetuses and an annual screening programme. Alongside Switzerland, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Ireland, L uxembourg, the Neth- erlands and the United Kingdom are free of brucellosis. Regular random sampling p rogrammes are also carried out in those countries. Other countries, however, such as France, I taly, Portugal and Spain, have only been successful in ensuring that certain regions of the country are disease -free. In the case of imports from regions that are not brucellosis-free, small ru minants must undergo a special quarantine programme. Trade between disease-free regions may not be subjected to regulation. 8.5.1 Procedure to provide evidence of disease-free status In order to provide evidence of disease-free status in relation to brucellosis, the following conditions must have been fulfilled in advance (this is explained in Section 8.1.1): No signs of brucellosis Compulsory reporting of disease and any suspected cases Disease awareness and effective early detection in place A typical symptom of brucellosis in small ruminants are aborted foetuses. To ensur e effective surveil- lance, it is therefore important that a flock of sheep or goats with a noticeably high rate of aborted foe- tuses should be tested for brucellosis, despite the fact that in general, a differ ent cause is usually as- sumed, as brucellosis does not occur endemically amongst small ruminants in Switzer land. On a farm that is infected, the primary causes of a rapid spread of the disease are lambing or br eeding. This causes the majority of animals to be infected and to test positive during serologic al tests. As a result of the bilateral treaties with the EU, it is sensible, when providing evidence of disease-free status in relation to brucellosis, to carry out a screening programme for bruc ellosis using random sam- pling, so that live sheep and goats and any products derived from them can be export ed to other bru- cellosis-free countries. The importation of live sheep and goats, or of their semen, can also be regulated. An important pre-condition for such trade relationships is the comparability of dis ease-free status in the various countries involved, in other words, the statements on which disease-f ree status is based must be backed up in the form of relevant statistics. The screening programme operated in Switzerland fulfils that requirement. 64 8.5.2 Calculation of the random sample The random sample is determined in accordance with statistical principles. In order t o carry out the sampling in the most cost-effective possible way, the Federal Food Safet y and Veterinary Office (FSVO) has developed additional methods and has refined them (see Section 8.1.2). In the case of brucellosis, a risk-based random sample calculation is used. The reason for this is that the risk of brucellosis being brought into the country is very small and that since the introduction of random sampling, no further outbreaks have occurred in Switzerland. For that reason, the reduced qual- ity of surveillance provided by the random sampling associated with this procedur e is not of concern and it is therefore possible to utilise the economic benefits generated by this proced ure. In accordance with the bilateral treaties, evidence must be provided of a herd pre valence of below 0.2% that has been established to a certainty of 99%. To that end and in accordance with an EU Directive (91/68/EEC), sheep and goats may be counted together as a single population. Blood samples are taken to serve as the sample for testing for the presence of brucellos is in sheep and goats. At goat farms, additional samples are also taken in order to diagnose Caprine A rthritis-Encepha- litis. When evaluating the sample, we apply the Bayesian method (see Section 8.1.2). In the evaluation of the current random sample, we take account of a decline in certainty of the previous random samples of 10% per year, in so far as no more than 600 small ruminants were imported during the pr evious year. This standard deduction was intentionally calculated generously, in order to ensure that the certainty associated with the current sample will not ultimately be overestimated. Neverthel ess, a total of 681 small ruminants were imported in 2013. For that reason, we were unable to make use of the standard deduction and calculate the residual certainty of the random samples taken from previ ous years. This came to 90.53% and was therefore higher than the standard deduction. The calculations for the size of the sample population in 2014 are therefore based on the level of residual certainty established by means of this calculation. 8.5.3 Selection of farms In order to obtain the sample to test for brucellosis, farms are selected at r andom from the Agricultural Policy Information System (AGIS). Goat farms must register at least 3 goats in the AGIS and must be included as a sheep or goat farm in the Animal Transport Database (TVD). In addition, they must not have been screened for brucellosis during the previous 3 years. 8.5.4 Selection of livestock Sheep and goats aged over 12 months are screened for brucellosis. In the case of lar ger herds, animals will be tested at random. Animals are selected at random for inclusion in a sample and are stratified according to the epidemiological units of the farm. The number of samples taken from sheep and goat farms ( Table 8.n) guarantees a suitable herd sensitivity of 99%. The herd sensitivity corresponds to the probability that an infection that is present within a herd will be detec ted using random sampling. This will depend upon the sensitivity of the individual animal diagnostics employ ed, from the number of in- fected animals in the herd and the number of animals examined. The larger the sample, the gr eater the probability that an infected farm will be detected. 65 Herd size (number of ani- mals older than 12 months) Number of blood sam- ples < 40 all 40-99 40 100 50 Table 8.n: Number of sheep and goats to be sampled for the purpose of screening for brucellosis 8.5.5 Laboratory analyses The blood samples are taken on the farms by designated veterinarians and undero diagnostic analys is at laboratories accredited by the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Of fice (FSVO). The designated veterinarian must complete a collection report for each farm, even if no samples were actually taken. If he/she was unable to take any samples, the reasons for this must be given. The laboratory will then analyse the samples for antibodies against brucellosis . Any type of laboratory- based diagnostic method can give rise to a false-negative or a false-positive result, however this occurs only rarely and only under certain conditions. The way in which this probl em is approached in the context of screening programmes is described in the section devoted to IBR (see Sectio n 8.1.5). The methods used in the screening and the confirmatory analysis for brucellosis, the sensi tivity and specificity that apply in each case and details of the reference laboratory for brucellosis are giv en below ( Table 8.o ).

Nevertheless, the analyses carried out by the reference laboratory and all exper iences gained to date have shown that the tests are very effective and are suitable for use in provid ing evidence of disease- free status. Animal keepers can expect to receive a negative result in view of the fact that before the samples taken during spot checks are analysed, it is assumed that Switzerland i s free of brucellosis. For that reason, no laboratory reports are sent if the results of the analy sis are negative. 8.5.6 Case definition The Animal Diseases Ordinance stipulates that in the case of brucellosis, any small ruminant confirmed by the reference laboratory to be carrying antibodies shall be deemed to be infected and t hat measures must be taken on the farm concerned. As a variety of scenarios can give rise to a positive test result (see S ection 8.1.6), it is important to investigate the situation in more detail and to distinguish singleton reactors from a genuine outbreak of the disease. In the case of brucellosis, however, hardly any singleton re actors occur in reality. 66 8.5.7 Results 2004-2014 Since 1998, the year in which screening programmes involving random sampling w ere first carried out in order to provide evidence of disease-free status in relation to brucellosis , no further outbreaks have occurred in small ruminants ( Table 8.p ). During that period, however, other types of brucellosis have been evidenced in other species, such as the semi-wild Mangalitsa pigs found to be c arrying porcine brucellosis ( B. suis ) in 2009. In sheep, a case of brucellosis in rams was recorded in 2010 ( B. ovis , which only occurs in sheep). As far as the country's disease-free status in relation to brucellosis in ruminants is concerned, these findings are of no relevance. Year Number of sheep farms tested Number of goat farms tested Number of samples tested Screening of samples that tested pos- itive Confirma- tions of samples that tested positive disease-free status obtained [%] 2014 688 471 12,281 2013 26,194 0 99.30 2012 542 716 14,404 1 0 99.30 2011 681 526 16,028 0 0 99.06 2010 697 527 13,244 2 0 2006 11,329 99.00 2005 673 592 13,787 4 0 99.00 2004 848 516 15,656 0 0 99.00 Table 8.p: Results of the random samples taken since 2004 in order to detect cases of brucellosis in small ruminants With the exception of 2008, it has always been possible to arrive at the req uired level of certainty. We therefore categorised a deviation of 0.4% in 2008 as being so small, that we deci ded to forego carrying out any additional sampling. Since 2011, the level of certainty has been only slightly higher than the level of 99% required by the EU. This effect was intentional. I n order to carry out only as many analyses as necessary, we refined the process used to select the farms and have managed to reduce the number of farms on the back-up list on a continuous basis. This is a rel atively costly process, as in the case of the random sampling carried out in order to screen for brucellosis, up to 20% of all farms could not be tested, due to the fact that no small ruminants were act ually present on the farm for samples to be taken at the time at which the tests were carried out. 8.5.8 More detailed epidemiological investigations arising from monitoring activity During the period of 2004-2014, there were no special events in connection w ith brucellosis in small ruminants. No investigations therefore needed to be carried out. 67 8.5.9 Conclusion Switzerland also successfully provided evidence of disease-free status for brucellosis in small ruminants in 2014. As in the preceding years, the level of certainty obtained during the pr ogramme of random sampling was higher than the level required by the EU. 8.6 Bluetongue disease Bluetongue is triggered by the bluetongue virus (BTV). Of this virus, 26 different serotypes that can be distinguished from one another by means of serological analysis methods, are known world-wide. The serotypes differ considerably in the range of hosts that they use and in their ability to cause disease. The virus is not transmitted from animal to animal, but mainly by means of blood- sucking insects, such as midges of the genus Culicoides (over 1,200 species, belonging to the gnat family). Only certain types are capable of spreading BTV. Sheep, goats, cattle and other ruminants are especially s usceptible to the bluetongue virus. Bluetongue is capable of spreading rapidly. The dynamics of transmission are substantially influenced by the density of the midge populations and the density of t he animals that may become infected. These will determine the rate of transmission and the reproduction rate of the virus. The incubation period is only a few days. All ruminants can be infected. For th e most part, sheep are affected, while cases involving goats and cattle occur more rarely. The animals s uffer from a high fever and appear listless. Typical symptoms also include conjunctivitis, hyper aemia and an inflammation of the mucous membranes, following by the formation of crusts on the muzzle, lips and nose. Typical symptoms include a subcutaneous oedema, accompanied by a swelling of the head and an inflam ma- tion of claw seam. In severe cases, the tongue swells up in such a way that it takes on a blue colour and causes laboured breathing. Based upon these symptoms, bluetongue in its acute form i s an im- portant differential diagnosis for foot and mouth disease. The disease can progress from acute to chronic. Practically all of the animals in affected herds become infected and form antibodies against the virus. Morbidity and mortality, however, vary greatly and primarily depend upon the particular serotypes involved, the species and the immunity status of the animals. The first case of bluetongue in Switzerland was triggered in 2007 by a bacterium of serotype 8. Subse- quently, between 2008 and 2010, Switzerland ordered that all cattle and sheep, and s ome goats, be vaccinated. A total of 76 cases of bluetongue were recorded up to mid-2010. No cli nical cases of blue- tongue have been notified since autumn 2008. The most recent recorded case was discovered in spring 2010 and was based on evidence of the virus genome (PCR). Both in infected and vaccinated animals, antibodies against BTV-8 can still be detected several years later. Based upon the surveillance out- comes during the preceding years, Switzerland and the Principality of Liec htenstein declared them- selves to be free of bluetongue in 2012. This declaration corresponds to the requirements of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and of the EU. In Europe, bluetongu e with the serotypes of 1, 2, 4, 8, 14 and 16 still occurs. For that reason, countries that are free of bluetong ue must demonstrate their disease-free status by carrying out a screening programme. In the case of imports from regions that are not BT-free, cattle must undergo a special quarantine programme. Trade between BT-free regions may not be subjected to regulation. 8.6.1 Procedure to provide evidence of disease-free status In order to provide evidence of disease-free status in relation to bluetongue, the fol lowing conditions must have been fulfilled in advance (see Section 8.1.1): No signs of BT at all By virtue of international agreements, the screening programme is a necessary part of providing evi- dence of disease-free status, in order to regulate the importation of ruminants and an y products derived from them and to export them to BT-free countries. 68 In order to confirm disease-free status, the EU requires that a screening programme be carried out in BT-free regions in order to exclude a prevalence of 20% at livestock level, to a level of certainty of 99%. In addition, surveillance must also be carried out in regions where bluetongue is present. Those areas are defined as squares covering an area of 2,000 square kilometres. Nevertheless, it is permitted to deviate slightly from this definition, in order to accommodate existing a dministrative boundaries. Using geo-statistical processes, we have subdivided these bluetongue surveillance areas in such a way that they largely coincide with the boundaries of the Swiss cantons. In this wa y, a total of 16 bluetongue areas have been designated in Switzerland, as several small cantons have been mer ged together to form a single bluetongue area. Furthermore, we took care to ensure that not only the sur face area, but also the populations of the relevant animal species are around the same size in all bluetongue areas. In this way, it is possible to examine the same number of livestock in each of the bl uetongue areas. As the required prevalence on livestock level is very high and already corres ponds to the level associ- ated with an advanced epidemic, we have decided that the Swiss screening progra mme must fulfil more stringent requirements. The reason for this is to ensure that an outbreak can be detected at the earliest possible stage and to ensure that measures can be taken at an early stage. These requirements corre- spond to the prevalence observed in bluetongue areas during the outbreaks i n 2007/2008. Switzerland has therefore imposed the following new requirements with regard to the screening pr ogramme: On a national level, the detection of a prevalence at livestock level of 2% with 99% certainty; in each of the 16 bluetongue areas, the detection of a prevalence at livestock level of 20%, als o with 99% certainty. An important pre-requisite when it comes to ensuring the comparability of the evidenc e of disease-free status provided by individual regions and countries, is that the quality of surveillance and the results obtained therefrom are comparable, that is, it will be necessary for any stat ements to be backed up by statistics. The scientific and statistical foundation for the screening pr ogramme operated in Switzerland fulfils this requirement. 8.6.2 Calculation of the random sample Important aspects of the random sample calculation are described in the section referr ing to IBR (see Section 8.1.2). The method used in the case of bluetongue differs, however, from t he one used for IBR. During an initial stage, we first calculate the size of the sample populati on per bluetongue area, based upon the average population size of a bluetongue area. This sample population per bluetongue area i s then multiplied by 16, in order to arrive at the necessary size of the sample population. We then calculate the validity of this size of population on a national level. If this is insufficient in order to achieve the required level of certainty of 99%, we then calculate during a second st age the necessary size of popu- lation on a national level directly and then distribute that number across the 16 blu etongue areas. In 2014, the the sample sizes in each bluetongue area was 150 cattle. Throughout Switz erland as a whole, a total of 2,400 cattle had to be screened, in order to fulfil the requirement. From the experience gained during previous screening programmes, we estimated the necessary additional number was 490 ani- mals. In the case of bluetongue, the reserve ensures that in all bluetongue areas, the planned screening numbers will actually be achieved. 8.6.3 Selection of livestock Blood samples are taken at 4 major slaughterhouses in Switzerland. Both the sampling itsel f and the selection of the cattle are carried out by meat control personnel on site. For that purpose, the animals themselves must fulfil the following criteria: They must not have been vaccinated. For that reason, samples are only taken from catt le born after May 2010. The cattle must be at least 8 months old. That way, maternal antibodies can be exc luded and it is also possible to ensure that the animals have been exposed for as long a t ime as possible to any potential transmission. 69 Wherever possible, only individual cattle from each farm should be tested. The d esignated meat control personnel fulfil this requirement by maintaining their own documentation regardin g the farms from which the animals originated. The samples required during the course of the programme i n 2014 were taken between 3.3.2014 and 28.3.2014, and between 5.5.2014 and 30.5.2014. 8.6.4 Laboratory analyses For the purpose of the bluetongue screening programme, blood samples from individual li vestock are analysed ( Table 8.q ). Once the animals have been slaughtered, the blood samples are taken from the animals. They are then sent to one of several laboratories accredited by the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO) and are individually analysed. The traceabilit y with regard to the farms of origin can be achieved using the information from the meat control or by referring to the animal history con- tained in the Animal Transport Database. Diagnostics will focus upon demonstrating the presence of antibodies against all serotypes of the blue- tongue virus. Important aspects during the testing for antibodies and the procedure to be adopted are described in the section relating to IBR (see Section 8.1.5). In addition, in the case of bluetongue, the serotype against which antibodies are encountered is identified, together with th e virus itself. The pres- ence of the bluetongue virus in the blood cells may still be demonstrated, even if antibodies are already present in the serum. A seropositive result may also be caused by an earlier vaccination, though this does not constitute any risk for the herd as a whole. This possibility must therefore be investigated in the case of all seropositive findings. Vaccination against the bluetongue virus is not prohibited in Switzerland. Animal dis- ease and type of sample Screen- ing method Sensitivity and specificity [%] Confirmatory analysis in the case of positive sam- ples Sensitivity and specificity [%] Evi- dence of virus Sensitivity and specificity [%] Reference la- boratory Bluetongue virus, blood sam- ples ELISA Table 8.q: Methods used during screening for bluetongue, including sensitivity and specifi city and de- tails of the reference laboratory for bluetongue Animal keepers from the farms tested can expect to receive a negative test resul t in view of the fact that before the samples taken are analysed, it is assumed that Switzerland is free o f bluetongue. For that reason, no laboratory reports are sent if the results of the analysis are negat ive. 8.6.5 Case definition The Animal Diseases Ordinance stipulates that in the case of bluetongue any animal that tests positive constitutes an occurrence of the disease and that measures must be taken on the farm concer ned. If only antibodies are found in the sample taken as part of the screening programme, this means that the animal has been in contact with the virus at some point in the past. That may mean, however, that the animal has been vaccinated and is therefore incapable of infecting others. If, i n the case of an animal that tests positive for antibodies, it is impossible to demonstrate that it had been vaccinated, the sus- ceptible animals on the farm of origin must be examined for bluetongue by a veter inarian. A minimum 70 of five blood samples must be taken and tested for the bluetongue virus. This procedure was l aid down in such a way that it would enable an outbreak of bluetongue on the farm of origin to be ruled out. To do this, all samples must test negative for the bluetongue virus and for antibodi es. 8.6.6 Results 2004-2014 Sampling in 2014 Serological tests of 12 animals were positive during the screening programme in 2014. Of those animals, 11 did not fulfil the age requirement for the screening programme. These animals were ei ther too old or too young and had therefore been vaccinated or had gained immunity in a passive way thr ough expo- sure to maternal antibodies. An animal from the correct age segment also tested posit ive in the sero- logical test. Following testing of additional animals on each of the two f arms of origin, no further animals tested positive. All tests for the presence of the virus were negative. The s ize of the sample populations per bluetongue area were very different. An evaluation of individual bluetongue areas was not possible, as the information regarding the farm of origin was incomplete and would have required extensive re- working. On a national level, it was possible, to a degree of certainty of 99%, to provide evidence that the prevalence in Switzerland is below 0.2%. A prevalence of that figure woul d correspond to 2,850 infected animals. Outbreak in 2007-2010 In Central and Northern Europe, bluetongue is an emerging disease. The transmission ar ea of the dis- ease has continuously expanded geographically in a northerly direction. In addi tion, increasing numbers of species of Culicoides midges are becoming effective transmitters of the bluetongue virus. The most significant event with regard to bluetongue was the Europe-wide epidemic dur ing the period from 2006 to 2010. This was triggered by serotype 8. Whilst the number of cases in France, the Benelux countries and Germany rose into the tens of thousands, Switzerland was only marginally af fected, with 75 cases. One of the reasons for this was because Switzerland had been carrying out monitor ing for bluetongue since 2003. Those efforts with the intention of identifying the importation of the b luetongue virus were originally directed towards the possibility of the disease being brought into the country from the South. After the disease broke out in the Benelux countries, the surveillance programmes wer e rapidly able to adjust to the latest situation. The discovery of the first cases in t he late autumn of 2007 took place at a very early stage in the same region. On the one hand, this was due to suspected clinical cases, whilst on the other hand, cases were also discovered via samples taken from milk in stor age tanks from se- lected Sentinel farms. Both parts of the surveillance processes have been fou nd to perform very well. Alongside the provision of an effective surveillance programme, the prompt commencement of vaccina- tions in 2008 also played a decisive role when it came to preventing even greater losses and larger numbers of cases. As it was no longer possible to carry out serological testing on samples of milk taken from storage tanks once livestock had been vaccinated, the screening programme has been c arried out upon young, non-vaccinated animals since 2009. The subdivision of the country int o bluetongue areas and the size of the random samples have not changed since 2009. Based upon the results of the sur- veillance system, the country was able to achieve disease-free status in r elation to bluetongue in 2012. For that reason, no screening programmes for bluetongue were carried out in 2012 and 2013 . In view of the EU requirement that even countries that are free of bluetongue must obtain ev idence of their disease-free status, a further screening programme was commenced in 2014. In view of the fact that each year since 2012, BTV-4 has been moving closer to Switzerland at a distance of several hundred kilometres a year from the South East, that screening programme also has an import ant part to play when it comes to detecting at an early stage that BTV-4 has been brought into the country. Observation of the type of midge responsible for transmission Another requirement imposed by the EU is that the observation of the types of midge responsible for transmission should form part of the surveillance of the bluetongue virus. To this end, a special midge 71 trap must be operated in each of the bluetongue regions. During the period from 2007 to 2011 , Switzer- land carried out these observations and was able to identify the \"midge-free period\" in this way. For that reason, it is no longer necessary to carry out observations of the midge. Analysis of milk samples taken from storage tanks When it comes to creating a cost-effective, country-wide serological sc reening programme, the analysis of milk samples taken from storage tanks is an especially suitable method. That is why since 2012, the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO) carries out serological testing of milk samples taken from storage tanks at 200 dairy cattle farms, three times a year, to establi sh the presence of the blue- tongue virus. These analyses show that at practically all farms, the majorit y of cows still carry antibodies against BTV-8. This is a result of the vaccination campaigns during the period from 2008 to 2010. Nev- ertheless, in the case of the bluetongue virus, only vaccinations of the s ame serotype can provide reli- able protection against infection. As a result, there is currently no immuni ty against BTV-4, which is approaching Switzerland from South-Eastern Europe. Vaccines against BTV-4 are available, but at the present time, are not approved for use in Switzerland. 8.7 Avian influenza and Newcastle disease Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) poses a danger to animals and humans. A fter HPAI-H5N1 started to become rampant amongst flocks of poultry in Asia in 2003, the HPAI virus spread ever further westwards, reaching Western Europe in autumn 2005. This was the reason that intensi ve surveillance of commercial poultry and wild birds was launched in 2006. In commercial poultry, infections with HPAI mostly give rise to clear and visible clinical symptoms. As a result, these are covered by the system of passive surveillance that i s in place. Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus (LPAIV) of the sub-types H5/H7 can turn into strains of HPAI as a result of reassorting or mutations within the genome. As LPAIV infections mostly give rise t o mild and less specific symptoms of illness, their occurrence can only be identified in commercial poultr y at an early stage by means of an active system of surveillance. Screening for antibodies against Newcastle disease (ND) enhances the passive s urveillance for ND, thereby providing additional indicators of disease-free status. ND is caused by the avian paramyxovirus, serotype 1 (APMV-1). 8.7.1 Surveillance for LPAI in commercial poultry 8.7.1.1 Procedure Blood samples from commercial poultry in Switzerland have been analys ed to detect the avian influenza viruses (AIV) H5/H7 and antibodies against ND, since 2006. The particul ar livestock categories from which samples are taken are heavily dependent upon the current situation concerning avian i nfluenza in Switzerland and in Europe. The surveillance work that is carried out is c ontinually adjusted in the light of the latest findings. Table 8.r shows how many flocks from which livestock categories were sampled, and where. 72 Sampling 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Blood samples at the slaugh- terhouse Laying hens - Flocks (and/or farms *) [+Safehouse flocks] 64 62 [+26] 70 [+22] 66 (64) 64 (61) 40 (37) 102 (96) 89 (82) 79 Broiler chickens 60 43 58 - - - - - - Fattening tur- keys 48 - - - - 25 23 23 22 On the farm 146 1 44 2 202 3 43 4 - - - - - 1 Farms holding an approved exemption from the Free Ran ge Prohibition (serological) 2 Laying hens in at-risk areas (egg yolk serology) 3 Hobby livestock-keeping and duck or geese holding s (virological) 4 Duck or geese holdings (serological) Table 8.r: Number of flocks examined 2006-2014 *each year, samples are taken from several flocks per year at certain farms Reasons behind the decision to make changes: No screening was carried out of flocks of laying hens in defined at-risk areas by means of egg yolk serology in 2008, as more intensive monitoring of around 202 duck and geese holdings and very small-scale chicken holdings in the at-risk areas was carried out (O rdinance of 28 September 2007 concerning precautionary measures to prevent the introduction of avian infl u- enza (CC 916.403.11)). This type of monitoring replaced the universal obligation for poultry holdings in at-risk areas to keep their birds indoors. In addition, 202 hobby holdings with fewer than 100 chickens or turkeys and duck and geese holdings (irrespective of the number of ani- mals kept) were subjected to virological screening for HPAI (especially H5N1) . In winter 2008/2009, it was decided not to designate any at-risk areas. Ins tead, a recommenda- tion was made to analyse a certain set of samples of duck and geese holdings in 2009, withi n the framework of the active monitoring programme for LPAI, as these would not displ ay any symptoms, even if infected with HPAI. In the case of fattening chickens, there is only a small risk of infection with AIV, as a result of the short production cycle. As surveillance within the EU had never yielded any positive indica- tions, serological screening was ceased in 2009. Though ducks and geese are at a greater risk of coming into contact with AIV, the risk that LPAI may be spread is assessed as low, as the hobby or pure breed poultry holdings (< 50 ducks/geese) have hardly any contact with commercial poultry holdings. As t he extraction of samples from ducks and geese is only possible using labour-intensive methods?, ser ological testing was ceased in 2010. Fattening turkeys are fattened for longer periods than fattening chickens. As fattening turkeys in Switzerland are also kept outdoors and in view of the fact that inside the EU , 6 turkey holdings tested positive during serological tests for H5/H7 in 2009, fattening turke ys were included in the screening programme in 2011. 73 8.7.1.2 Random sample calculation The number of flocks to be screened was determined in such a way that in the case of a far m-based prevalence of 5% and proven certainty of 95%, at least one farm infected with LPA IV would be found. In the case of Switzerland, which has over 250 laying hen farms, this woul d involve a random, repre- sentative sample of 60 farms. Samples are taken from all turkey farms on an annual basis. The number of animals to be screened per flock is laid down in such a way that in the c ase of a preva- lence of 30% of LPAIV seropositive animals, at least one LPAIV-seropositive animal can be detected with a proven certainty of 95%. Samples must therefore be taken from a total of 10 ani mals per flock. In the case of turkeys, samples were taken from 15 animals per flock up to 2013, due to the fact that in the previous EU Decision 2007/268/EU, turkeys were included together with ducks and geese. In the laboratory, the existing samples from the LPAI screening programme are also screened for ND antibodies. As the samples are not taken for the purpose of calculating disease-fr ee status, they are not suitable for use as such. 8.7.1.3 Selection of farms The Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO) selects free-range laying hen farms based upon the regularly updated slaughter lists kept by Gallo Circle, a society o perated by the egg producers' association, Gallo Suisse. Most of all, flocks slaughtered in close succ ession are selected, in order to minimise the expense incurred for the dispatch of samples from the slaughterhouse, whi ch is located in Germany. As a result of the restriction, which requires that only f locks of free-range laying hens sent to slaughter should be sampled, the choice of flocks is relatively limited and the farms that are screened each year are very similar. 2012 may be used as an example of the approximate geographical d istribu- tion ( Figure 8.a ). In the case of turkeys, samples are taken from all turkey farms on an annual basis. Figure 8.a: Geographical distribution of farms subjected to screening (as in 2012) 74 8.7.1.4 Laboratory analyses The laboratory analyses are carried out at the Institute for Virology and Immunology (IVI). The diagnostic procedures correspond to the requirements of the World Organisation for Animal Heal th (OIE). All blood samples were tested using commercially-available ELISA tests that ar e validated at the IVI (competitive AI/blocking ND). Positive and questionable samples were retested using a c onfirmatory ELISA (blocking AI/indirect ND) test. In the case of sera that still tested positive us ing the ELISA test, a haemagglutination inhibition test (HIT) was carried out in order to demonstrate the presence of antibo dies against the AIV sub-types H5/H7 or against the avian paramyxovirus, serotype 1 (APMV- 1). 8.7.1.5 Case definition In the case of an infected flock, one would expect to encounter antibodies in several animals. Flocks, in which only a single animal yields a questionable test result, are categorised as negative and no further tests are carried out. Only if several animals belonging to a single f lock generate a positive of question- able result will a farm be categorised as positive for the presence of antibodies. I n such cases, the subsequent flocks, or, in the case of multi-year farms, the remaining flocks on t he farm will be subjected to serological and virological testing and epidemiological investigations carri ed out. 8.7.1.6 Results 2006-2014 In 2014, no antibodies against AIV were found in laying hens or fattening chickens. Since screening for AIV, subtypes H5/H7 began in 2006, serological tests in laying hens, broiler chickens and turkeys carried out in the screening years were negative (see Table 8.s ). In the case of a flock of laying hens from an at-risk area in 2007, c ontact with AIV of a different subtype to H5/H7 was supposed to be the cause. All livestock holdi ngs operated as a hobby (including duck and goose holdings) in at-risk areas that were screened in 2008, w ere AIV negative. On the other hand, however, antibodies against H5/H7-AIV were evidenced in s amples taken from duck and geese holdings in 2009. Furthermore, antibodies against ND were encountered in c ommercial poul- try on an isolated basis. In 2014, however, all samples tested negative. Year Category of an- imals Antibodies positive Number of herds testing positive Cantons affected 2007 Laying hens not H5/H7-AIV 1 of 441 1 x Lucerne 2009 Ducks/geese H5/H7-AIV 4 of 43 2x Basel Landsch.; 2x Aargau 2009 Laying hens ND 1 of 66 2 1 x Basel Landsch. 2012 Laying hens ND 1 of 1022 1x Geneva 2013 Fattening tur- keys ND 1 of 23 2 1x Fribourg Table 8.s : Evidence of antibodies against AIV and/or NDV - 2006-2014 1 In the case of a flock of laying hens with organic certification in the canton of Lucerne (in the at- risk area of the Vierwaldst\u00e4ttersee), suspect results obtained from eggs submi tted resulted in an order requiring the flock to be investigated by carrying out a follow-up scr eening involving the sero- logical testing of blood samples. The results from the sera also indicated that the birds had been in contact with AIV. By carrying out a haemagglutination inhibition test (HIT) , it was possible to rule out reactions specifically associated with H5/H7. No clinical symptoms deemed t o exist. 2 For further information regarding the epidemiological investigations, please see Sect ion 8.7.1.7. 75 8.7.1.7 More detailed epidemiological investigations arising from monitoring activity 2013 In the case of fattening turkeys found to have antibodies against avian paramy xoviruses, those animals belonged to the final batch of animals from the flock to be sent for slaughter. This meant , therefore, that no further animals were left on the farm. Animals at other farms that came from the s ame delivery of hatching eggs had also already been slaughtered. No clinical symptoms deemed to exist. The farm had accommodated the fattening animals as one-day-old chicks. The hatching eggs came fro m Canada and both parents had been vaccinated against ND. It cannot be assumed that these cases invo lved maternal antibodies, due to the fact that, at the age that the fattening turkeys had reach ed, such antibodies ought not to have been detectable. Whether the hatching eggs had come into contact with ND vaccine in Canada and the chicks could therefore have become infected in that way, remains unc lear. In late 2013, a total of seven farms in the canton of Geneva were subjected t o active monitoring, due to the results obtained during the previous year. In December 2013, two additional far ms were found to contain chickens carrying antibodies against ND. No virus was detectabl e, however, and the chickens were all clinically healthy. 2012 Antibodies against avian paramyxoviruses were also found in other lives tock, at the laying hens farm in the canton of Geneva - including a peafowl that originally came from the botanic al gardens in Geneva, as well as in the botanical garden itself. In 1 out of 5 farms within a radi us of 3 kilometres of the infected farm, it turned out that the farm kept vaccinated animals that had been imported i llegally from France. Based on the fact that during the course of the screenings, five out of 12 ducks in the botanical garden seroconverted, it can be assumed that a virus was circulating in the region conc erned. No avian para- myxoviruses could be detected, however. 2009 A subsequent investigation of an additional flock at the laying hen farm, which in 2009 had been found to be carrying antibodies against avian paramyxoviruses, was found to be negat ive. 76 8.7.1.8 Conclusion The prevalence of AIV infections in laying hens and fattening turkeys resp ectively is estimated to be very low. In the case of ducks and geese, this level may be a littl e higher. As the largely small holdings of pure breed poultry or poultry kept as a hobby (< 50 ducks/geese) have hardly any close contact with commercial poultry farms, the risk of transmitting LPAI to commercial poult ry farms is estimated to be small. The ND outbreak in the canton of Neuch\u00e2tel in 2011, which was discovered as a result of clinical symp- toms that arose during the course of passive monitoring, and the monitoring data from 2006 onw ards show that Swiss commercial poultry, at least those that are free range, c an come into contact with avian paramyxoviruses. The keeping of commercial, pure breed and waterfowl in the same setti ng may pose a risk. Without evidence of the virus, the specific pathogens and their pathogeni city will, unfortunately, remain unclear. In the case of imports of hatching eggs and poultry, compulsory checks should be carried out to ensure that the additional guarantees in connection with ND have been fulfilled. 8.7.2 HPAI screening programme in wild birds Wild birds are passively monitored. A total of 5 events were reported in 2014. One of these reports involved several dead birds found at the same location. This ultimately resul ted in seven wild birds (all of which were mute swans) being examined ( Table 8.t ). After 2005 and 2006, the years in which avian influenza occurred on a widespread basis, the number of screenings has signifi cantly decreased. Up to the present time, HPAIV-positive wild birds have only been evidenced in 2006: in the cantons of Schaff- hausen (14), Thurgau (9), Zurich (8) und Geneva (1), 32 wild birds tested positive for HPAIV (ducks (22), coots (4), grebes (3), swans (2), goosanders (1)). Wild birds were also actively monitored during 2005/06 and 2006/07. The active monit oring focused upon five areas (Lake Constance, the Semperachsee, the Bolle di Magadino, Lake Geneva and Lake Neuch\u00e2tel) and involved the taking of samples from ducks, swans and coots. On Lake Constance, in the context of the Constanze research project, water birds were captured using two traps and Sentinel ducks were kept at three different locations. On the Semperachsee and in Ticino (Bol le di Magadino) wild birds were also caught using traps. On Lake Geneva and Lake Neuch\u00e2tel samples were taken during the regular waterfowl hunt. In winter 2005/2006, 749 wild birds tested negative for HPAIV. In winter 2006/2007, 6 out of 683 wild birds were found to be carrying LPAIV: 4 mal lard ducks on Lake Neuch\u00e2tel and 1 mallard duck and 1 moorhen in the Bolle di Magadino. In winter 2005/2006, 750 songbirds were also screened at ringing stations on the Ulmet peak (in the canton of Basel Land) and in the Bolle di Magadino (in the canton of Ticino). As all of the results of those tests were negative and no postive test results were known to have b een obtained in other countries, no further screening of songbirds was carried out. 77 Year Number of incidents Number of dead wild birds Number of dead wild birds examined Number that were HPAI posi- tive 2006 1153 1312 1175 32 2007 116 138 116 0 2008 62 78 62 0 2009 38 96 38 0 2010 6 13 6 0 2011 18 26 20 0 2012 4 9 9 0 2013 7 32 32 0 2014 5 7 7 0 Total 1409 1711 1465 32 Table 8.t : Results from the passive monitoring of wild birds 2006-2014 8.7.3 Sentinel site on Lake Constance This Sentinel location takes the form of an open enclosure with mallard ducks, int o which waterfowl are able to enter from the air. The mallard ducks are regularly screened for AIV and ant ibodies against AIV. The Sentinel site in the Austrian town of Bregenz is financed jointl y by Austria, Germany and Switzer- land. The results can be read in the interim report entitled \"Die \u00f6sterreichi sche Sentinel-Anlage anderer relevanter Pathogene\" (The Austrian Sentinel site on Lake Constance for the monitoring of avian influ enza and other relevant path- ogens).

As long as no evidence has been found that the West Nile Virus is present inside Switzer land, one can assume that Switzerland is free of the West Nile Virus. It cannot be ruled out, howe ver, that WNV is circulating inside Switzerland, especially amongst wild birds and midges. In 2011, the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO), in conjunction with the Federal Office of Public Hea lth (FOPH) drew up a draft document, in order to be prepared for a variety of possible situations. The two Federal O ffices involved will notify one another immediately, in the event of that a case of WNF occurs in an animal or a human being. Once a year, a status report is also drawn up and any necessary actions outlined. 8.8.1 WNF-surveillance in humans As far as humans are concerned, laboratories have been obliged to notify the a uthorities of any inci- dences of West Nile Virus since 2006 ( Ordinance of the Federal Department for Home Affairs concern- ing notifications by doctors and laboratories ). In the case of conditions affecting the central nervous system or flu-like symptoms without a known cause, the possibility that th e patient is suffering from WNF must be ruled out by means of laboratory tests. In Switzerland, up to the present ti me, there have been no home-grown cases of WNF, that is, cases, in which the person concerned became infected with West Nile Virus in Switzerland. Since 2010, one or two imported cases of the co ndition have been reported, in which the persons involved became infected with West Nile Virus abroad: one case in 2010 and 2012 and two cases in 2013. The persons involved had previously spent time in Egypt, K osovo, Italy and Croatia. 8.8.2 WNF surveillance in animals WNF in animals has been notifiable since 1 July 2011, initially as a disease that requires monitoring, however since 1 August 2014 as a disease belonging to the equine encephalomyeli tides group that must be eradicated. Up to the present, in Switzerland, no cases of WNF have been demonstrated in animals. Horses In 2014, four horses and one horse in each year between 2011-2013 which displayed abormalit ies of the central nervous system of unknown cause, tested negative for WNF. The investigat ions were carried out at the Friedrich L\u00f6ffler Institute (FLI), as a sub-contractor of the Institute for Virology and Immunology (IVI). In order to be able to protect horses from any possible infection, a vaccine has been approved for use in Switzerland. Birds In 2014 (details correct as at 21 November 2014), at the National Reference Centre f or Poultry and Rabbit Diseases (NRGK), samples of brain tissue from 235 wild birds fro m Switzerland were tested using PCR as part of a research project, but found to be negative for West Nile V irus. Future plans include examining a number of blood samples taken from flocks of free-range laying hens, t o detect the presence of antibodies against West Nile Virus. All wild birds, especiall y crows, sparrows, blackbirds and birds of prey that are found dead must always be sent for examination to detect West Nile Virus, especially if several dead birds are found in one location. In 2013, 6 wild bi rds found dead tested nega- tive for West Nile Virus (2 sparrows, 2 pigeons and 2 common buzzards). Si nce 2011, no more than 6 dead birds have been examined each year. Since 2013, mallard ducks at the Austrian Sentinel site (see Section 8.7.3.) h ave been tested for anti- bodies against West Nile Virus at the end of each year. In 2013 and 2014, no antibodi es against West Nile Virus were found. 79 Midges In 2014, the Spiez laboratory set itself the objective as part of a research project to optimise the methods used for the capture and analysis of midges, so that it would be possible to examine l arger quantities of midges in the future. In Ticino and in other parts of Switzerland, it is intended that additional studies into midges will be carried out in 2016. Between 2011 and 2013, a number of groups of midges were screened for West Nile Virus in the cantons of Ticino and Geneva, as well as in areas north of the Alps. For the purpose of testing and depending on the species of midge and the region, between one and ten midges were grouped together. In the canton of Ticino, a total of 466 (2011), 1,429 (2012) and 605 (2013) groups discov ered (0.8%), that differed significantly from the West Nile Virus. In the canton of Geneva, 62 (2011) and 214 (2012) midge groups ( Culex only) tested negative. Furthermore, in 2013, a total of 123 groups of midges ( Culex, Aedes vexans and Aedes albopictus ) located to the north of the Alps tested negative for West Nile Virus. 80 9 Zoonoses Zoonoses are infectious diseases that can be transmitted from animals to h umans and vice versa. There is a legal obligation to monitor 8 zoonoses: campylobacteri osis, salmonellosis, TSV , Art. 291a). humans is the most frequently re c- orded. The reporting rate remained high in 2014. Salmonellosis i s also common, although the number of cases has stagnated at a lower level since 2009. What most zoonoses h ave in common is that humans can protect themselves well against them, through goo d hygiene when handling food, pets and livestock. For each of the 8 zoonoses that must be monitored by law, we outline below which pathogen causes the disease, how people become infected, how frequently diseases are reported, w hich symptoms can occur, how people can protect themselves against such an infection and how it is monitored. 9.1 Campylobacteriosis/ Campylobacter infection Campylobacteriosis is caused by an infection with bacteria of the Campylobacter species. In industrial- ised nations, it is currently the most frequently recorded diarrhoeal disease in humans that must be reported to the authorities. An infection with Campylobacter can cause abdominal pain, watery or bloody diarrhoea, increased body temperature or a high fever and sometimes vomiting. Evidence of Campylo- bacter is very often found in the intestinal tract of healthy animals ( Campylobacter infection). Contami- nation of meat can occur during the slaughtering process, which is a signi ficant source of infection for humans. Consumption of the meat and liver of poultry is a known risk factor for c ampylobacteriosis. If poultry is frozen before consumption or consumed without its skin, the ris k of transmission is reduced. Humans can also become infected through direct contact with animals, contaminated drinking w ater and foreign travel, particularly to countries with low hygiene standards. To prot ect against sickness, trans- mission of the pathogen from raw meat to food that is ready to eat via the hands or kitchen utensils should be prevented. When preparing fondue Chinoise or similar dishes, separate plates must be used for the raw meat and the side dishes that are ready to eat. Hands must be was hed thoroughly with soap after handling raw meat, and it must be ensured that food of animal origin, particular ly poultry, is heated sufficiently. It is also essential to wash hands after going to the toilet and after contact with animals. Campylobacteriosis tends to be rare in animals. 9.1.1 Obligation to report to the authorities and n umbers of cases in humans Diagnostic laboratories have a duty to report evidence of Campylobacter in humans. If there is a cluster of cases at a particular time and in a particular place (e.g. with food poisoning) , doctors must also report this ( ordinance of the FDHA on doctor and laboratory reports ). A total of 7,565 cases of campylobacteriosis in humans that had been confirmed by laboratory diagnosis were reported to the FOPH in 2014 (previous year: 7,479), corresponding to a reporti ng rate of 93 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants (previous year: 91 per 100,000). The number of r eported cases thus remained high but stable compared with the previous year. The number of cases has been risi ng steadily since 2005 and in 2012 reached its highest level to date since the reporting o bligation was introduced, with over 100 reported infections per 100,000 inhabitants ( Figure 9.a ). As in previous years, the age group with the highest reported rate was young adults aged 15-24, with 137 cases per 100,000. It has also been noticed that the reported rate in people ag ed over 65 has more 81 than doubled in the last 20 years (1994: 32 cases per 100,000; 2014: 103 per 10 0,000), while the re- ported rate in children under 5 years of age has tended to decrease during the same period ( from 130 to 98 cases per 100,000). Slightly more men than women were affected (4,002 cases versus 3,507 cases). The peak winter figure in January 2014 was much higher than in previous year s, at 910 infec- tions. The peak summer figure in August 2014 of 957 reported infections was similar to previous years. The most commonly identified species in 2014 remained C. jejuni at 75%, although in 15% of cases it was not possible to distinguish between C. jejuni and C. coli. Figure 9.a: Number of cases of campylobacteriosis reported in humans, 2005-2014 (Source: Federal Office of Public Health, as at March 2015) 9.1.2 Obligation to report to the authorities and m onitoring in ani- mals Campylobacteriosis in animals must be reported to the authorities and is among the epizootics that must be monitored ( TSV , Art. 5). Campylobacter infections do not have to be reported to the authorities. Campylobacteriosis Campylobacteriosis is monitored passively. In 2014, 164 cases of campylobact eriosis were reported in animals. The number of reports doubled compared with the previous year and was several t imes as high as in the years before that. In the last 10 years (2005-2014), the number of cas es has fluctuated between 5 and 164 per year. Dogs were most frequently affected (71%), followed by c attle (13%) and cats (12%) ( Figure 9.b ). As campylobacteriosis tests were no longer carried out in recognis ed diagnostic laboratories, this can be ruled out as the reason for the increase in cases . However, more confirmation tests were carried out in the reference laboratory in 2013 and 2014. The higher number of confirmed positive results could have altered reporting behaviour in cantonal veterinary offices. A genuine increase in cases cannot be ruled out. 01000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Number of human cases reported 82 Figure 9.b: Number of cases of campylobacteriosis reported in animals, Information system for reporting epidemics (InfoSM) , FSVO; as at February 2015) Campylobacter infections Campylobacter infections are actively monitored, as the animals are healthy here and there are no signs of illness. In slaughterhouses, cloacal/faecal swabs and appendixes are examined for Campylobacter . As poultry plays a particularly significant role as a source of infection for humans, poultry flocks have been monitored since 2002. In 2014, 179 out of 493 (36%) broiler chicken flocks were Campylobacter - positive ( C. jejuni (163) and C. coli (16)). Since 2009, the prevalence among broiler chicken flocks ex- amined by means of a cloacal swab has been between 33% and 38%. The Campylobacter burden is particularly high during the summer months ( Figure 9.c ). 020 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Number of cases reported in animals Dog Cat Cattle Other 83 Figure 9.c: Comparison of Campylobacter prevalence (stated in percent) in broiler chicken flocks per month, 2012-2014 9.1.3 Campylobacter monitoring in food Due to cross-contamination at the slaughterhouse, poultry meat from flocks that w ere originally Cam- pylobacter-negative can also be contaminated with the pathogen by the end of the slaughtering proces s. Poultry carcasses and poultry meat are monitored by the poultry industry. A s part of the poultry industry's self-regulation activities, 1,554 examinations were carried out in 2014, of which 29 6 (19%) proved to be Campylobacter -positive ( C. jejuni (48), C. coli (5) and not classified (243)). In the last 4 years, the pro- portion of positive samples among the approximately 1,300 poultry meat samples inspected per year was between 29% and 37%. Levels were particularly high in fresh chicken meat, with up to 50% of samples found to be positive. Up to 70% of poultry carcasses were Campylobacter -positive in 2008, according to a study. Inspections of poultry meat from the retail trade i n 2007 and 2009/10 found Cam- pylobacter in 44% and 38% of raw meat samples respectively. 9.1.4 Measures No direct action is taken for campylobacteriosis or Campylobacter infections in animals. If animals for slaughter are affected, the ordinance on primary production stipulates that foods must be produced that 010 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Proportion of Campylobacter-positive flocks [%] 2012 (N=564) 2013 (N=439) 2014 (N=493) 84 are not harmful to human health. Since 1 January 2014, poultry liver from a Campylobacter -positive flock may be sold on the market only if it is frozen ( hygiene ordinance , Art. 33a). This significantly re- duces the bioburden in poultry livers. Furthermore, the packaging of fresh poultry meat and any prepa- rations containing it must display hygiene advice, stating that the products must be thoroughly heated through before consumption and advising how consumers should handle fresh poult ry meat hygienically in the home. The note on heating meat through completely before consumption must also be included on the packaging of minced meat, meat products made from poultry and meat preparations (particul arly those including mechanically separated meat) ( ordinance on food of animal origin , Art. 9). 9.1.5 Assessment of the situation At present, about 1 in 1,000 people suffer from campylobacteriosis every ye ar. As many infected people do not go to the doctor and stool samples are not always examined, the actual number of cas es is higher than the figure recorded by the reporting system. People most commonly become infected thr ough con- taminated food. A comparison of human and animal Campylobacter strains from 2001 to 2012 showed that 71% of cases in humans could be traced back to chickens ( Kittl et al., 2013 ). The focus is on poultry meat as a source of infection. Occurrence in broiler chicken flocks has stagnated at a high level for years, with clear peaks during the summer months. Meat from other animal species is not considered to be a significant source of infection, as Campylobacter does not usually survive on the surface of the carcasses of these animals. In the study mentioned above ( Kittl et al., 2013 ), 19% of cases were at- tributable to cattle and 1% to pigs. The high numbers of cases in humans in the summer could be due to an increased burden in poultry flocks, an increase in the number of barbecues or increased travel abroad. The Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) published a study in 2014 that identifies the main cause of the peak in winter ( Bless et al., 2014 ). This study investigated cases of sickness reported between December 2012 and February 2013. It found that consuming meat fondue (e.g. fondue Chinoise) increases the risk of infection, particularly i f fresh poultry meat is used. The study also showed that half of patients were sick for at least a week. Around 15% had to have inpatient treat- ment in a hospital. If consumers adhere to the rules on kitchen hygiene (see also hygiene rules when handling food ), they can successfully protect themselves against infection. The risk of infec tion can be reduced, for example, by using only frozen meat for meat fondue and by using separate plates for raw meat and food that is ready to eat. Good kitchen hygiene should generally be observed when preparing fresh c hicken, and raw meat (or marinated raw meat for barbecues) should not be allowed to come into contac t with ready- to-eat foods (such as side dishes and salad). Direct contact with dogs plays only a minor role in Campylobacter infections. The proportion of human strains that could be traced back to dogs in the study came to 9% ( Kittl et al., 2013 ). 9.1.6 The Campylobacter platform At the end of 2008, representatives of the authorities, researchers and the poultry industry came to- gether to set up the Campylobacter platform, with the aim of helping to contain this cause of diarrhoeal diseases by exchanging knowledge, coordinating measures and initiating research proj ects. The focus is on reducing the burden at poultry farms and contamination of carcasses at s laughterhouses, as well as on communicating the most important rules of kitchen hygiene. The FSVO plans t o inform the public about risks linked to handling meat in a joint broad-based communication campaign and to c ommunicate how to handle food hygienically in the home. The industry has been invited to get involved and to make available its communication channels and media products. It is considered important to have joint com- munication with clear, recognisable messages, to improve effectiveness. When the hyg iene ordinance (HyV) is next amended, there are plans to introduce a process hygiene criteri on for Campylobacter for poultry carcasses that have been refrigerated. 85 9.2 Salmonellosis/ Salmonella infections Salmonellosis is caused by an infection with bacteria of the Salmonella species. People generally be- come infected by consuming contaminated foods such as eggs, egg dishes, non-pasteuri sed milk or meat and meat products. However, it is also possible in principle to bec ome sick through direct contact with animals infected with Salmonella or through human-to-human transmission. A Salmonella infection usually causes diarrhoea, which starts suddenly, as well as nausea, vomiting, fever, headache and abdominal pain. The symptoms can last for several days. As Salmonella multiply in food at room tem- perature, perishable foods should always be stored in a cool place. Meat dishes must be cooked through. Egg dishes that are not heated (e.g. mayonnaise, tiramisu, chocolate mouss e) should always be eaten on the day they are prepared. In general, good kitchen hygiene (see hygiene rules when han- dling food ) is important. All animal species can contract salmonellosis. The symptoms range from fever, di arrhoea and impaired performance to abortions or weak newborns. The clinical symptoms often vary depending on the species and the age of the animals. Along with contaminated feed and water, animals wit h a latent infection represent the most common source of infection for other animals. Rodents (particul arly mice) can also transmit the pathogen. To keep animal populations as free from Salmonella as possible, attention should be paid to the levels of hygiene in their stalls. However, animals are often merely carriers of Salmonella without becoming sick themselves (asymptomatic Salmonella infection). This puts humans at risk, as they can become infected by consuming contaminated foods that have come from such infected ani- mals. 9.2.1 Obligation to report to the authorities and n umbers of cases in humans Diagnostic laboratories must report evidence of Salmonella in humans. If there is a cluster of cases at a particular time and in a particular place (e.g. with food poisoning), doct ors also have a duty to report this ( ordinance of the FDHA on doctor and laboratory reports ). A total of 1,238 cases of salmonellosis that were confirmed by laboratory diagnosis were forwarded in 2014 (previous year : 1,266 cases). This corresponds to a reported rate of 15 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants. Case numbers have stag- nated at this level since 2009. No further decline is discernible ( Figure 9.d ). As in previous years, the age group with the highest reported rate was children under 5 years of age (< 1 year: 45 per 100,000; 1- to 4-year-olds: 47 per 100,000). The typical seasonal increase in reports during the summer and autumn months was noticed once again in 2014. The most commonly reported serovars remained S. enteritidis (28%), followed by the monophasic strain 4,12,:i:- (16%) and S. typhimurium (15%). An out- break of S. bovismorbificans (N = 25) was also observed in 2014, which was caused in particular by consumption of sprouts in southern Germany. In 80% of cases, patients said that t hey had eaten in a restaurant in southern Germany. 86 Figure 9.d: Number of cases of salmonellosis reported in humans, 2005-2014 (Source: Federal Office of Public Health, as at March 2015) 9.2.2 Obligation to report to the authorities and m onitoring in ani- mals In animals, illness caused by Salmonella (salmonellosis) in all species and infections with Salmonella in poultry and pigs (healthy carriers) must be reported to the authoriti es and belong to the group of epizo- otics that must be combated ( TSV , Art. 4, Art. 222-227 and Art. 255-261). Anyone who keeps or cares for animals must report any suspicious cases to their veterinarian. Salmonellosis in animals Salmonellosis is passively monitored. A total of 63 cases of salmonellosis w ere reported in animals in 2014. These mainly affected cows (22), reptiles (17) and dogs/cats (12). This is w ithin the range of annual fluctuations, including for cattle. Slightly more cases were reported i n cattle in 2013 than in pre- vious years ( Figure 9.e ). S. typhimurium and the monophasic variant 4,12:i:- are often detected in cattle. In the last 10 years (2005-2014), between 49 and 83 cases of salmonellosis have been recorded pe r year in animals (32% cattle, 31% reptiles, 20% dogs/cats and 6% sheep). 0500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Number of human cases reported 87 Figure 9.e : Number of cases of salmonellosis reported in animals, (Source: Information system for reporting epidemics (InfoSM) , FSVO; as at February 2015) Salmonella infections in poultry and pigs Salmonella infections in poultry are actively monitored. Since 2007, Salmonella infections in poultry have been monitored through a comprehensive control programme. Poultry holdings with more than 250 breeding animals, 1,000 laying hens, 5,000 broiler chickens or 500 turkeys must be inspect ed regularly for Salmonella (in accordance with the technical instructions on the taking and examination of samples for Salmonella infections in domestic poultry ). The Salmonella serotypes S. enteritidis , S. typhimurium and its monophasic variant are combated, as well as S. hadar, S. infantis and S. virchow in breeding animals. 5 cases were reported in poultry in 2014 as part of the control programme, 1 case in laying hens at a holding with space for > 1,000 animals ( S. enteritidis ) and 4 cases in broiler chickens at holdings with space for > 5,000 animals (all S. enteritidis ). The latter all occurred within the same period. The affected companies had all obtained their day-old chicks from the same breeder. Regular i nspections at this breeder's premises had consistently shown negative results. The affected hatching eggs originally came from the EU. Transovarial transmission cannot be ruled out in the case of S. enteritidis . No further in- vestigations have been carried out. There were also 8 suspected cases (posit ive environmental samples that were not confirmed in animals). Table 9.a shows which categories of animals other types of Sal- monella were detected in. Since 2007, no more than 11 Salmonella infections per year in poultry have been reported in the infor- mation system for reporting epidemics (InfoSM) . These generally affected laying hens. In broiler chick- ens, only one case in 2010 and the 4 linked cases (probably an outbreak) in 2014 hav e been found to date. In breeding flocks, there has so far been one case in 2012. 010 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Number of cases reported in animals Cattle Reptiles Dog Cat Sheep Other 88 Category of animals and size of company Incident Number of incidents Serovar Number of serovars Laying hens > 1,000 spaces Epidemic 1 S. enteritidis 1 Suspected case 6 S. enteritidis 4 S. typhimurium 2 - 4 S. mbandaka 2 S. idikan 1 S. schwarzengrund 1 Broiler chicken > 5,000 spaces Epidemic 4 S. enteritidis 4 Suspected case 2 S. enteritidis 1 S. typhimurium 1 - 16 S. albany 4 S. schwarzengrund 2 S. braenderup 1 S. bredeney 1 S. chester 1 S. idikan 1 S. infantis 1 S. lexington 1 S. senftenberg 1 S. tennessee 1 S. welikade 1 [13,23:i:- (monophasic)] 1 Broiler turkeys > 500 spaces - 2 S. indiana 1 Salmonella, not classified 1 Small flocks of laying hens, outside the con- trol programme - 6 S. typhimurium 3 S. enteritidis 1 S. indiana 1 Salmonella, not classified 1 Table 9.a: Salmonella cases detected in 2014 Salmonella infections in pigs must be reported to the authorities, but there is to date no gover nment control programme. However, the ordinance on primary production stipulates that foods must be pro- duced that are not harmful to human health. Basic studies carried out between 2006 and 2008 showed the following estimat ed prevalence of Salmo- nella infections in poultry and pigs: in laying hens 1.3% (3 out of 235 flocks; 2006) , in broiler chickens 0.3% (1 out of 299 flocks; 2007), in slaughtered pigs 2.3% (14 out of 615 slaughtered pigs ; 2007) and in breeding pigs 13.0% (29 out of 223 breeding pig companies; 2008). While S. enteritidis and S. typhi- murium were the only serovars found in poultry, they accounted for 60% of serovars detec ted in slaugh- tered pigs and 27% of those detected in breeding pigs. 89 9.2.3 Salmonella monitoring in food Monitoring in meat Poultry meat and meat from other livestock (particularly pigs) can be contaminate d with Salmonella . The poultry industry monitors its production as part of its self-regulation. O nly Swiss poultry meat is included in the analysis. In 2014, 6 out of 3,268 (0.2%) samples were Salmonella -positive ( S. infantis (1), S. mbandaka (2), S. agona (1), Salmonella , not classified (2)). The positive samples involved skin from the neck (2), fresh chicken meat with skin (2), poultry meat preparations (1) and mec hanically separated meat (1). The 0.2% represents the lowest figure for annual fluctuations over the last 5 years, which range from 0.2% to 2% of approximately 3,000 samples examined each year. Studies have shown that in 2007, 0.4% of Swiss broiler chicken meat available for sale and 15.3% of broiler chicken meat imported from abroad was Salmonella -positive, compared with 2.6% of poultry carcasses in 2008. Monitoring in dairy products In 2014, the Institute of Food Science (IFS) at Agroscope examined Swiss cheeses made from raw milk or milk heated to only a low temperature for various pathogens. All 222 samples wer e Salmonella -neg- ative. Between 2002 and 2009, dairy products were monitored regularly for Salmonella as part of the national inspection programme for dairy products. As Salmonella had never been found since 2004, examination for Salmonella as part of this programme was stopped in 2009. Monitoring at the border Only a few products from third countries enter Switzerland directly vi a airports. As part of a border control programme, a small sample is taken every year and examined for certain infectious agents , among other things. In 2014, 14 samples of raw fish and 2 samples of ready-to-eat fis h products from Vietnam, Ma- laysia, Japan and Australia, as well as 29 samples of fresh beef from South A merica, the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, tested negative for Salmonella (see also the annual report of the border veterinary service for 2014 ). 9.2.4 Measures Salmonellosis in animals If salmonellosis occurs in ungulates, the sick animals must be isolated and t he entire herd and its envi- ronment must be tested for Salmonella . If it is not possible to isolate the animals, the entire company must be blocked so that no movement of animals is possible ( TSV , Art. 69). Healthy animals may be slaughtered, but a note regarding salmonellosis must be included on the accompanyi ng documentation. Milk from dairy cows with salmonellosis may be used only as animal feed and onl y if it has previously been boiled or pasteurised. If animals other than ungulates contract salmonellosis, appropriate measures must be taken to prevent risk to humans and to stop the epidemic from spreading further. Salmonella infections in poultry and pigs If one of the serovars that is relevant according to the law on epizooti cs is detected in the environment of poultry flocks, this is a suspected case. If Salmonella is detected in the organs/muscles of 20 animals in a herd or flock, this is an epidemic. The company is blocked, to prevent the mov ement of animals (TSV , Art. 69). The infected herd or flock must be slaughtered or killed. The poultry meat and eggs from such a flock may be used only if they have previously undergone heat treatment to destroy the Salmo- nella . The block on the company can be lifted only once all animals in the infected population have been killed or slaughtered and the premises have been cleaned and disinfected and have tested negativ e for Salmonella . 90 Meat from infected pigs may also be marketed only if it has undergone heat treatment to destroy the Salmonella . Evidence of Salmonella in food The hygiene ordinance stipulates limits for Salmonella in various foods. If these are exceeded, canton chemists must report this to the FSVO. The foods concerned will be confis cated and destroyed. De- pending on the situation, products may also be recalled and the public may be war ned against con- sumption of these products. The packaging of minced meat, meat products made from poultry and meat preparations (particularly those containing mechanically separated meat) must in principle contain a note stating explicitly that these products must be heated through thoroughly before consumption ( ordinance on food of animal origin , Art. 9). All large cheese manufacturers have a hygiene management system that complies with IS O 9000. 9.2.5 Assessment of the situation The decline in the number of cases in humans from over 6,000 cases per year in the ear ly 1990s to the current level of about 1,300 cases per year has largely been attributed to the c ontrol programme for S. enteritidis in breeding and laying hens that was introduced in 1995. The number of cases of S. enteritidis in laying hens and breeding animals declined from 30 in 1996 to 3 in 2006. The co ntrol programme was extended in 2007 to include broiler chickens and turkeys as well as other serovars , although it is limited to larger companies. In addition to S. enteritidis , S. typhimurium (incl. the monophasic variant) is also controlled by the state, as well as S. hadar, S. infantis and S. virchow in breeding flocks. Since 2007, no more than 11 cases have been reported per year in poultry in the information system for reporting epidemics (InfoSM) . These case numbers include smaller companies and other serovars that are not covered by the control programme. It is not entirely clear how much of an influence pork and beef have as a reservoir for human cases. In order to further reduce the number of human cases, which is currently stagnating, it may be necessary to extend the control programme to these species. The same applies as with Campylobacter : good kitchen hygiene is important to prevent cases of salmonellosis in humans. 9.3 Listeriosis Listeriosis is caused by an infection with bacteria of the Listeria species. Listeria occur everywhere in the environment, can survive in the soil and in plants for weeks or months and us e a wide range of hosts. Humans become infected through direct contact with sick animals or abortion material or by eating contaminated foods. Listeriosis can manifest itself in many different ways and ranges from listeriosis in pregnancy to glandular, local or septic/typhoid listeriosis or listeriosis of the central nervous system. It is important to ensure good hygiene and to avoid dirt and smear infections when handli ng animals. In particular, pregnant women and immunocompromised people should avoid raw meat, raw sausage products, smoked cheese and soft cheese made from non-pasteurised milk. The animals that most commonly become infected with Listeria are cattle, sheep and goats, although in principle any species can be affected. Silage feeding is a known risk factor for an infection. If silage is not adequately acidified, Listeria can multiply in it easily. As well as asymptomatic infections (healthy animals excrete Listeria in their faeces), various symptoms can occur in animals: fever, movement dis- orders, paralysis, conjunctivitis (cerebral form), septicaemia (septicaemic form) and abortions, prema- ture births or birth of weak newborns (metrogenic form). This can be prevented wit h good feeding hy- giene and clean silage. 91 9.3.1 Obligation to report to the authorities and n umbers of cases in humans Laboratory evidence of Listeria monocytogenes in humans must be reported to the authorities. If there is a cluster of cases at a particular time and in a particular place (e.g. wit h food poisoning), doctors must also report this ( ordinance of the FDHA on doctor and laboratory reports ). A total of 98 cases of listeriosis that had been confirmed by laboratory dia gnosis were reported to the FOPH in 2014, corresponding to a reporting rate of 1.2 new infections per 100,000 inhabit ants. The number of reported cases was much lower in the 10 preceding years (2004-2013), at 3 9 to 73 per year (Figure 9.f ). The increase compared with previous years was due to an outbreak in the period fr om October 2013 to April 2014, with 32 cases of serotype 4b. Pre-packaged, ready-t o-eat salad was iden- tified as the probable source of infection. As in previous years, the highest rate was reported in people over 65 years of age, with 4.3 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Two cases involved newborn babies; in these cases, the inf ection was probably transmitted from mother to child. The gender ratio was balanced, with 48 men and 50 women. The mos t commonly detected serotypes, as previously, were 1/2a (26%) and 4b (60%), with a significant increase in serotype 4b compared with the previous year, due to the outbreak. Other outbreaks of listeriosis occurred in 2011 (serotype 1/2a; imported cooked ham) and 2005 (sero- type 1/2a; contaminated cheese) and in the 1980s (serotype 4b). The latter involved contaminated Vacherin Mont d'Or cheese and led to the largest outbreak of Listeria to date in Switzerland, in which 122 people became ill and 33 died. Figure 9.f: Number of cases of listeriosis reported in humans, 2005-2014 (Source: Federal Office of Public Health, as at March 2015) 9.3.2 Obligation to report to the authorities and m onitoring in ani- mals Listeriosis in animals must be reported to the authorities and is among the epizooti cs that must be monitored ( TSV , Art. 5). It is passively monitored. 8 cases of listeriosis were rep orted in ruminants in 2014 (5 cattle, 2 goats and 1 sheep). The ninth case in 2014 involved a monkey. In the last 10 years (2005-2014), the number of cases reported has fluctuated between 6 and 20 per year. S heep were most frequently affected (39%), followed by cattle (36%) and goats (23%) ( Figure 9.g ). 020 40 60 80 100 120 140 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Number of human cases reported 92 Figure 9.g : Number of cases of listeriosis reported in animals, (Source: Information system for reporting (InfoSM) , FSVO; as at February 2015) 9.3.3 Listeria monitoring in food Monitoring in dairy products A total of 2,345 samples were tested as part of the Listeria Monitoring Programme (LMP) of the Institute of Food Science (IFS) at Agroscope in 2014. Evidence of Listeria (L.) monocytogenes was found in 3 samples (0.2%). These included one environmental sample and the surface of a sample of semi-har d cheese and a sample of hard cheese. Types of Listeria other than L. monocytogenes were detected in 51 samples (2%). The LMP has been running since 2007 and examines 2,800-5,200 samples every year. L. monocytogenes has consistently been detected in fewer than 1% of samples, usually in envi- ronmental samples. When samples of cheese were involved, L. monocytogenes was only ever found on the surface of the cheese. In one study carried out at the IFS in 2014, 222 samples of Swiss cheeses made from raw milk or milk heated to only a low temperature also tested negative for Listeria . A national inspection programme for dairy products was carried out between 2002 and 2011, i n which several hundred samples of semi-hard and soft cheese were tested every year. Evi dence of Listeria was found in only very few samples of semi-hard and soft cheese each time, so the programme was stopped in 2011. Monitoring at the border Only a few products from third countries enter Switzerland directly via airports. As part of a border control programme, a small sample is taken every year and examined for certain infectious agents , among other things. In 2014, 16 samples of raw fish and 3 fish products (one of whic h was ready to eat) from Vietnam, Malaysia, Japan, Sri Lanka and Australia tested negative for L. monocytogenes (see also the annual report of the border veterinary service for 2014 ). 9.3.4 Measures The hygiene ordinance stipulates limits for Listeria in various foods. If these are exceeded, canton chem- ists must report this to the FSVO. The foods concerned will be confiscat ed and destroyed. Depending on the situation, products may also be recalled and the public may be warned against consumption of these products. The packaging of minced meat, meat products made from poultry and meat preparations 0510 15 20 25 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Number of cases reported in animals Cattle Sheep Goat Other 93 (particularly those containing mechanically separated meat) must in principle contain a note stating ex- plicitly that these products must be heated through thoroughly before consumpti on ( ordinance on food of animal origin , Art. 9). All large cheese manufacturers have a hygiene management system that com- plies with ISO 9000. 9.3.5 Assessment of the situation Infections with L. monocytogenes frequently lead to sickness in humans. Even if the number of cases is low, mortality is high, particularly in older people. To prevent infections with Listeria , it is particularly important to monitor Listeria at different stages of the food chain. Milk and dairy products are monitored particularly carefully, because of the large outbreak in the 1980s. Listeria levels in the milk industry have remained stable and at a low level for years. The same applies to the situati on with regard to animals. 9.4 Verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) Verotoxin-producing Escherichia (E.) coli (VTEC) are a type of bacteria that are a major infectious agent associated with food. As they have a low minimum infectious dose, VTEC infec tions can easily occur through contaminated foods (e.g. minced beef that has not been heated sufficiently, unpast eurised dairy products or sprouts) or water that is contaminated by faeces. VTEC can also be t ransmitted from human to human. VTEC infections can be asymptomatic. Sickness usually begins with watery diarrhoea, which does not contain blood. Haemorrhagic colitis with bloody diarrhoea and abdominal cramps may develop later. Fever and vomiting are additional symptoms that can occur. Haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS) can occur in 5-10% of symptomatic cases; this can become life-threatening in chi ldren of pre-school age in particular, with haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and kidney failure. The bes t preventative measures involve good kitchen hygiene and the heating of critical foods. In warm-blooded animals, E. coli bacteria are part of the normal intestinal flora and do not cause illness. Among livestock, ruminants, particularly sheep and goats, are an important reser voir of VTEC agents. 9.4.1 Obligation to report to the authorities and n umbers of cases in humans Laboratory evidence of VTEC in humans must be reported to the authorities, and an add itional report must be filled in by the doctor providing treatment. If there is a cl uster of cases at a particular time and in a particular place (e.g. with food poisoning), laboratories and doctors must report this ( ordinance of the FDHA on doctor and laboratory reports ). A total of 122 cases of VTEC that had been confirmed by laboratory diagnosis were reported in 2014 (previous year: 81 cases), corresponding to a reporting rate of 1.5 new infecti ons per 100,000 inhabit- ants (previous year: 1.0 per 100,000). This is a significant increase compared w ith previous years and is one of the highest reported rates since the obligation to report to the authorit ies was introduced in 1999. In the last 10 years (2005-2014), the number of cases of VTEC has fluctuated bet ween 34 and 122 per year ( Figure 9.h ). The age group with the highest reported rate continues to be children under 5 years of age, with 6.5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants; however, this has remai ned stable over the years, while the reported rates in adults have increased slightly in gen eral. Slightly more women (N = 68) were affected than men (N = 54). No localised clusters have been observ ed. Of the 10 reported cases of HUS, 4 children aged between 0 and 4 years, 4 children aged betw een 5 and 14 years and 2 people aged over 65 were affected. The increase observed in the number of cases is explained in particular by the fact that more multiplex plates are being used in laboratories, which is resulting in increased ev idence of toxins. The fact that the number of cases of HUS has remained virtually constant supports this hy pothesis. 94 Figure 9.h: Number of cases of VTEC reported in humans, 2005-2014 (Source: Federal Office of Public Health, as at March 2015) 9.4.2 Obligation to report to the authorities and m onitoring in ani- mals There is no obligation to report cases in animals to the authorities, as no cases of sickness occur. How- ever, various studies have recorded data relating to the occurrence of VTEC. Monitoring in livestock VTEC is frequently detected in young cattle. In 2012, 417 out of 563 samples of faeces (74%) from young cattle at slaughterhouses tested positive for O26 strains, 28 O145 strains and 12 O157 strains were isolated. 9 of the 17 O26 strains, 4 of the 28 O145 strains and 5 of the 12 O157 strai ns were vtx -positive (Hofer et al., 2013). Samples of faeces from cattle, sheep and pigs were examined at slaughterhouses in 2000. 14% of faecal samples from cattle, 30% from sheep and 22% from pigs tested positive for VTE C. It was also demonstrated that younger cattle excrete more VTEC than older cattle. Caution is ther efore necessary in applying such data to the entire cattle population. Most of the strains found i n pigs were not very virulent. Slaughtered rabbits were also examined for VTEC in 2008, and evidence of VTEC w as found in 3% of faecal samples. Rabbits can thus also be a cause of contamination of carcasses (Kohler et al., 2008). 020 40 60 80 100 120 140 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Number of human cases reported 95 Monitoring in wild animals 239 samples of faeces from wild ruminants were analysed in 2011. 32.6% tested posit ive for the vtx gene, 6.7% for the intimin gene and 13.8% for both. A total of 56 strains were isolated, of whic h 44.6% had genes for the Vtx2 group, 30.4% genes for the Vtx1 group and 21.4% genes for both groups. The 56 VTEC strains came from red deer (18), roe deer (19), chamois (13) and ibexes ( 6) (Obwegeser et al., 2012). In 2007/08, wild boar from the Canton of Geneva were tested as a reservoir for VTEC. VTEC was detected in the tonsils of 4 out of 153 wild boar (9%) using PCR. However, all the faecal samples taken from 73 wild boar were negative. Wild boar therefore appear to tend to be carriers of VTEC without excreting it (Wacheck et al., 2010). 9.4.3 VTEC monitoring in food Monitoring in dairy products In a study carried out at the IFS in 2014, 222 samples of Swiss cheeses made fr om raw milk or milk heated to only a low temperature were tested for VTEC. 2 samples (0.9%) were PCR- positive for vtx genes. However, no isolates could be obtained for further classification. During the national inspection programme for dairy products carried out between 2006 and 2008, VTEC was detected in 24 samples of semi-hard cheese and 5 samples of soft cheese, out of a to tal of 1,422 samples (2%). All of these samples involved non-O157 serotypes (13 isolates were classed as O2, O22 and O91). 9 isolates carried the hlyA gene, but all isolates tested negative for the eae gene. Monitoring in foods of vegetable origin Following an incident in 2011 in Germany in which people became infected with EHEC by consuming sprouts, 233 foods of vegetable origin (142 lettuces, 64 sliced fruits, 27 sprout s) were tested for VTEC in Switzerland in 2012. VTEC with a virulence profile of a low pathoge nic strain was detected in one of the 233 samples. Monitoring in meat In the 1990s, 2.4% of minced meat samples and 21.6% of uncooked, frozen hamburgers tested positiv e for VTEC. Monitoring at the border Only a few products from third countries enter Switzerland directly via airports. Only small samples are therefore taken each year as part of a border control programme. In 2014, 29 samples of f resh beef from Brazil, Argentina, Chile, the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zea land tested negative for VTEC (see also the annual report of the border veterinary service for 2014 ). 9.4.4 Measures The hygiene ordinance stipulates limits for E. coli in various foods. Specific limits are set for VTEC in sprouts. If these values are exceeded, canton chemists must report this to t he FSVO. The foods con- cerned will be confiscated and destroyed. Depending on the situation, products may also be recalled and the public may be warned against consumption of these products. The packaging of minced meat, meat products made from poultry and meat preparations (particularly those containing mechanically separated meat) must contain a note stating that these products must be heated through thoroughly before consumption ( ordinance on food of animal origin , Art. 9). 96 9.4.5 Assessment of the situation The significance of VTEC infections is probably underestimated, as systematic t ests are not carried out for VTEC when investigating the causes of diarrhoea. Because of the low inf ectious dose (< 100 micro- organisms), infections with VTEC can occur very easily through contaminated food or water that is con- taminated with faeces. The results of the characterisation of non-O157 VTEC patient s trains from 2000- 2009 showed considerable diversity in the genomes. This suggests that these infec tions occur sporad- ically in Switzerland and are not linked to bigger outbreaks (K\u00e4ppeli et al., 2011a). Even if O157:H7 is the main cause of HUS, O26:H11/H - has become established as the most common non-O157 infectious agent for HUS. A study conducted in 2012, which examined 27 human strains from patients with bloody diarrhoea and 11 bovine strains and 1 ovine strain from healthy animals, showed that cattle and sheep can be a reservoir for O26:H11/H - (Zweifel et al., 2013). Ruminants are an important reservoir for VTEC. The pathogen can be inactivated by heating critical foods through (e.g. raw meat, raw milk). As a study conducted in 2011 (Peng et al., 2013) showed that VTEC was detected in semi-hard cheeses made from raw milk irrespective of th e selected heating tem- perature (40\u00b0C or 46\u00b0C) and initial contamination (low level or high leve l) of the milk and even after a maturing time of 16 weeks, VTEC must be taken into account as a risk with such products . Hygiene in slaughtering and milking is particularly important when producing foods of animal origin. As well as foods of animal origin, however, the so-called \"spinach outbreak\" in the USA in 2006 and the outbreak in Germany in 2011 caused by sprouts contaminated with VTEC O104 show the potential importance of plant-based foods. To prevent such infections, it is important to st ress general measures relating to kitchen hygiene such as washing foods of vegetable origin and the preventio n of cross-con- tamination (e.g. the order in which foods must be processed: firstly foods that are ready to eat, then raw foods; cleaning of surfaces and hands in between). 9.5 Trichinellosis Trichinellosis is caused by Trichinella , a threadworm. Depending on the infectious dose, the disease may be asymptomatic or fatal. Early symptoms include muscle pain, swelling of the upper eyelid, bleed- ing from the retina or under the conjunctiva and nails, eye pain and sensitivi ty to light. Fever, thirst, outbreaks of sweat, chills and a feeling of weakness may develop later. Humans become infected by consuming infected pork or wild boar meat, or more rarely horse meat, or meat products manufactured from these, that has not been heated or has not been heated sufficiently. Free zing the meat (-25\u00b0C for 10 days, for pieces of meat > 15 cm thick for 20 days) will kill off any Trichinella that are present. Heating to over 70\u00b0C will have the same effect. In animals, carnivorous and omnivorous mammals such as pigs, wild boar, dogs, cats , foxes, martens and rodents are generally asymptomatic carriers. Domestic pigs become infected primar ily by consum- ing rodents containing Trichinella , while wild boar can also become infected by eating infected fox car- casses. The feeding of raw or insufficiently heated slaughterhouse waste and food s craps can also be a method of transmission. However, this is currently prohibited in pigs. Horses can also be affected in rare cases. The cause of this is suspected to be accidental consumption of hay contaminated with in- fected rodents. 97 9.5.1 Obligation to report to the authorities and n umbers of cases in humans Evidence of Trichinella (T.) in humans that has been confirmed by laboratory diagnosis has had to be reported to the authorities again since 2009 ( ordinance of the FDHA on doctor and laboratory reports ). There were no reports of trichinellosis in people residing in Switzerland in 2014. Since the duty to report to the authorities was reintroduced in 2009, no more than 4 cases have been reported per ye ar ( Figure 9.i). Figure 9.i: Number of cases of trichinellosis reported in humans, 2005-2014 (Source: Federal Office of Public Health, as at March 2015) 9.5.2 Obligation to report to the authorities and m onitoring in ani- mals Trichinellosis must be reported to the authorities and is among the epizootics that must be monitored (TSV , Art. 5). It is monitored passively in animals. In 2014, 5 cases of tric hinellosis were reported in lynxes. In the last 10 years (2004-2013), between 0 and 5 cases have been regi stered per year. All cases were observed in carnivorous wild animals (86% in lynxes, 10% in foxes and 5% in w olves, Figure 9.j). Evidence of T. britovi was found in each case. 0246810 12 14 16 18 20 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Number of human cases reported 98 Figure 9.j: Number of cases of trichinellosis reported in animals, Information system for reporting epidemics (InfoSM) , FSVO; as at February 2015) A study in wild animals conducted between 1999 and 2007 found that 15 out of 55 lynxes examined (27.3%) were infected with T. britovi. In foxes, 21 out of 1,298 animals (1.6%) were infected in 2006/07 (Frey et al., 2009a). Wild boar were investigated a little more closely in 2008. Although no evidence of Trichinella was found in any of the 1,458 wild boar, 3 wild boar were found to have antibodies t o Trichinella (seroprevalence 0.2%) (Frey et al., 2009b). 9.5.3 Trichinella monitoring in food All carcasses from animals in the horse family, domestic pigs, wild boar, bear s and beavers must be examined for Trichinella . An exception is made for small companies that produce exclusively for the local market and have obtained permission for this from the relevant canton ( ordinance on slaughter and meat inspection (VSFK) , Art. 31). Meat that has been produced only for the local market must be labelled accordingly ( ordinance on food of animal origin , Art. 9). 2.5 million slaughtered pigs tested negative for Trichinella using the artificial digestion method in 2014, corresponding to 93% of the entire population of slaughtered pigs. In horses, 2,492 horses or 84% of the entire population of slaughtered horses tested negative. No evidence of Trichinella was found in 1,713 wild boar. The number of tests carried out was around the same as in previous years since 20 10. No more than 490,000 pigs were tested between 2001 and 2004. The number of tests in slaughtered pigs increased steadily from 2005 onwards: 34% in 2005, 44% in 2006 and about 90% in 2007 to 2009. Trichinella was never found in pigs, horses or wild boar. 012345678910 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Number of reported cases in animals Fox Lynx Wolf 99 9.5.4 Measures As this is an epizootic that must be monitored, no measures are generally taken with animals in the event of an epidemic. In slaughtered animals, the contaminated carcass would be destroyed in the event of positive evidence. 9.5.5 sAssessment of the situation Trichinellosis in humans is rare and is usually attributed to infections contracted abroad or to meat prod- ucts, such as raw sausages, imported from endemic regions. Based on the extensive t ests that have been carried out on animals slaughtered in Switzerland for many years and consistent ly shown negative results, it can be assumed that these animals are free from Trichinella . A Trichinella infection from Swiss pork is extremely unlikely. The risk of transmission from wild animals to the conventional domestic pig p opulation is classed as negligible. Nevertheless, it is important to monitor wild animals and pigs kept in fields. T. britovi occurs in lynxes, foxes and wolves in Switzerland. Wild boar have to date been negati ve; however, Trichinella infections cannot be ruled out in wild boar. The results of the study from 2008 show that wild boar can come into contact with Trichinella . It was also unclear whether it was a Swiss wild boar that was likely to have led to an infection in a Swiss citizen in 2012. The hunter and butcher had tried raw sausage dough containing wild boar meat. As only serological tests are generall y carried out in humans, the exact species of Trichinella that was involved also remained unclear. This case highlights the fact th at raw or insufficiently heated pork/meat should not be consumed. 9.6 Tuberculosis Tuberculosis is caused by various types of mycobacteria, most commonly Mycobacterium (M.) tubercu- losis . M. bovis , the classic agent that causes bovine tuberculosis, has for many years accounted for no more than 2% of cases of tuberculosis per year. Only about 10% of those infected become il l, usually within a few months but sometimes only after several decades. Tuberculosis manifes ts itself as pulmo- nary tuberculosis in around 80% of patients, although it can affect any organ. Patients usually have a cough, expectoration and possibly chest pain. Fever, weight loss, loss of appet ite, night sweats and fatigue are also typical. Transmission occurs when a person suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis coughs up droplets containing bacteria, which are then inhaled by another person. These bacteria can persist in the body for decades without making the person ill. 9.6.1 Obligation to report to the authorities and n umbers of cases in humans Laboratories and doctors must report cases of tuberculosis in humans. An additional report is also nec- essary. If there is a cluster of cases at a particular time and in a particular place (e.g. with food poison- ing), laboratories and doctors must also report this ( ordinance of the FDHA on doctor and laboratory reports ). In 2014, 2 out of 477 cases of tuberculosis were caused by M. bovis (0.5%). These involved 2 young women aged between 15 and 17 from a migrant background. This was within the same range as in previous years, with the exception of 2011, when 13 cases were recorded ( Figure 9.k ). 418 of the 477 reported cases were confirmed by laboratory diagnosis ( M. tuberculosis (338), M. bovis (2), M. afri- canum (6), M. caprae (1), M. tuberculosis -complex (71, not specified)). 100 Figure 9.k: Number of cases of tuberculosis reported in humans, 2005-2014 (Source: Federal Office of Public Health, as at March 2015) 9.6.2 Obligation to report to the authorities and m onitoring in ani- mals Tuberculosis in animals must be reported to the authorities and is among the epizootics that are to be eradicated ( TSV , Art. 3 and Art. 158-165). Tuberculosis is present if there is evi dence of M. bovis, M. caprae or M. tuberculosis or if the tuberculin skin test shows a positive result in an animal fr om a popu- lation in which tuberculosis has already been detected. The incubation period is 150 days. Switzerland is recognised to be free from tuberculosis in livestock. Proof of freedom from the disease was last provided in a study in 1997. In a random sample of 10% of companies (N = 4,874), a total of 111,394 cattle showed a negative result in a tuberculin skin test. However, iso lated cases can occur. The last case in cattle before the current outbreak in 2013/14 occurred in 1998. In this c ase, a cow became infected due to reactivation of a human case of M. bovis . 2 cases of tuberculosis were reported in 2014, one in a cow and one in a cat ( M. microti). This is similar to the figures for the years in which there were no specific incidents. The case involving a cow ( M. caprae ) was reported in early 2014 and was part of the outbreak that occurred in eas tern Switzerland in 2013/14. In this outbreak, cattle became infected from wild animals during their al pine sojourn in Austria. As well as these cases in cattle, isolated cases have occurred in cats ( 3), parrots (1), dogs (1), horses (1) and llamas (1) in the last 10 years (2005-2014) ( Figure 9.l). Cattle have since then been monitored passively by investigating lesions resembling tuberculosis in the slaughterhouse. As few changes are to be expected in a country that is free from tuberculosis and the meat inspectors therefore have little training in how to recognise such cases, good monitoring is a chal- lenge. The LyMON project was set up in autumn 2013 after the first cases were discovered in cattle. A handbook, \"Forms of tuberculosis in meat inspection\", was made available to all meat i nspectors. In addition, lymphatic tissue with non-specific changes is to be sent regularl y for examination. In 2014, 125 samples from cattle were sent in and tested using Ziehl-Neelsen staining and P CR. All 125 samples tested negative for the M. tuberculosis complex. Between October and December 2013, 20 samples tested negative. 0246810 12 14 16 18 20 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Number of human cases reported 101 Individual studies were also carried out: a) In 1998, lymph nodes from deer were examined at the slaughterhouse for tuberculosis-like le- sions and tested negative for M. bovis and M. tuberculosis . 124 out of 485 companies were inspected. All animals at these 124 companies were negative (Wyss et al., 2000). b) In 2010, 582 cattle that had been in the Austrian Alps in 2009 tested negative. 269 red deer from border regions were also negative. 6 out of 165 wild boar responded positive ly for the MTBC complex, but were negative for M. bovis and M. caprae (Sch\u00f6ning et al., 2012). Figure 9.l: Number of cases of tuberculosis reported in animals, 2005-2014 (Source: Information system for reporting epidemics (InfoSM) , FSVO; as at February 2015) 9.6.3 Measures The measures that need to be taken in the event of infection of cattle with M. bovis, M. caprae and M. tuberculosis are regulated in the TSV , Art. 158-165. If there is a suspected epidemic or suspected contagion and in the event of an epidemic, the transportation of animals must be stopped a t the company concerned and the herds must be epidemiologically investigated. In the event of an epidemic, all animals suspected to be infected at the company must be slaughtered and contaminated animals must be kil led. The milk of contaminated animals or animals that are suspected to be infected must be disp osed of. At most, it can be boiled and used as animal feed at the same company. Stables must be cleaned and disinfected. A year after an epidemic, all cattle at this company that ar e older than 6 weeks must undergo a follow-up inspection. 9.6.4 Assessment of the situation Tuberculosis declined significantly in industrialised nations in the 20th century . Around 550 people con- tract tuberculosis in Switzerland each year, usually a form that is e asily treatable. Tuberculosis caused by M. bovis is rare in humans. Since 2005, no more than 15 cases have been reported per year. This represents fewer than 2% of all reported cases. Most cases of tuberculosis invol ve immigrants. When people who are native to Switzerland are affected, they are usually over 65 ye ars of age. In most cases, 0246810 12 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Number of reported cases in animals Cattle Cat Other 102 these people became infected in childhood, when cattle herds were still severely affected by this dis- ease. The Swiss cattle population has been free from tuberculosis for many years. However, isolated cases can occur. The risk of becoming infected with tuberculosis in Switzerland is low. In the case of bovine tuberculosis transmitted to humans through food (alimentary), large numbers of germs are required (several million bacteria in adults). Only a few of the infected cows hav e lesions on their udders and release the pathogen into their milk. Often only a few individual animals are affec ted within a herd. Mixing their milk with milk that is not affected leads to dilution of the germs . Moreover, M. bovis cannot multiply in milk. Raw milk and raw cream are not intended for direct consumption and must be heated to at least 70\u00b0C before they can be consumed. M. bovis is eliminated through pasteurisation or heat treatment at a high temperature (e.g. ultra-high temperature processing, UHT). When it is transmitted via the air (airborne), even a few pathogens can lead to an infection, which means that infections caused by droplets are possible through direct contact. As the majority of Swiss cattle are free from tuberculosis, direct transmission from cattle to humans is not likely. The main aim here is t o protect cattle from be- coming infected by people suffering from tuberculosis. Risk factors for the import of tuberculosis include international trade, catt le spending their alpine sojourn in risk areas and wild animals in the area of the borders with Austria and Ger many. The outbreaks in eastern Switzerland in 2013/14 show that a summer alpine sojourn in Tirol and Vorarlber g, where M. caprae is endemic in the red deer population, is a source of infection for Swiss cattle. The cause of the first outbreak of M. bovis in 2013 remained unclear. There appears to have been an increase in cases of tuberculosis in the EU in recent years (e.g. in the UK, France, Italy, Spain and Portugal). Wild animals have been identified as a possible reservoir in all these countries, particularl y in regions with a high density of wild animals. Caution is required when importing cattle, particul arly from countries with an increased number of cases. 103 9.7 Brucellosis Brucellosis is caused by an infection with bacteria of the Brucella species. Humans become infected through direct contact with secretions from infected animals or animal materials ( placentas, foetuses, laboratory material) or through consumption of contaminated, unpasteurised milk or dairy pr oducts made from this. The pathogen gets into the human body through the gastrointestinal tract , the mucous membranes of the conjunctiva, the respiratory tract or small skin injuries. Bruc ellosis can also be ac- quired in a laboratory. Transmission from human to human is very rare, but has been obs erved in babies who have acquired it through the milk of infected mothers. Women who are infected w ith brucellosis must therefore not breastfeed. Fever, night sweats, headache, loss of appetite, g astrointestinal symp- toms, nausea and vomiting may occur. People who are exposed through their work should protect them- selves against infections by using disposable gloves and a mask over their f ace and mouth. Brucella can infect cattle, sheep, goats, bison, camels, alpacas, llamas, pigs, dogs, wild ruminants, foxes and horses. Brucellosis manifests itself in the form of contagious late abortions in the last third of ges- tation, inflammation of the testes and epididymis and subsequent fertility disorders. In many cases, however, there are no clinical symptoms. Infected animals excrete the pathogen mai nly through the sex organs and mammary glands. 9.7.1 Obligation to report to the authorities and n umbers of cases in humans Laboratories have an obligation to report brucellosis infections in humans ( ordinance of the FDHA on doctor and laboratory reports ). A total of 3 cases of brucellosis that had been confirmed by laboratory diagnos is were reported to the FOPH in 2014 (previous year: 4 cases). These affected 1 man and 2 women aged between 46 and 63 years. 2 cases involved B. melitensis, while in 1 case the species was not determined. The number of human cases has been low for many years, and in the last ten years (2005-2014) has fluct uated be- tween 1 and 14 cases per year ( Figure 9.m ). Figure 9.m: Number of cases of brucellosis reported in humans, 2005-2014 (Source: Federal Office of Public Health, as at March 2015) 0246810 12 14 16 18 20 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Number of human cases reported 104 9.7.2 Obligation to report to the authorities and m onitoring in ani- mals Brucellosis must be reported in cattle, sheep and goats, pigs and rams. It is among the epizootics that must be eradicated ( TSV , Art. 3 (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs) and combated ( TSV , Art. 4 (rams)). Abortions in ungulates must also be reported to the authorities. If there is a cluster of abor tions, these must be investigated ( TSV , Art. 129). Vaccination against brucellosis is prohibited. Switzerland is free from brucellosis in cattle, sheep and goats. The last case of Brucella abortus in cattle occurred in 1996, while the last case of Brucella melitensis in small ruminants was in 1985. The cattle population was documented as free from the disease in 1997, when a random sample of 139,655 cows (over 24 months old) from 4,874 companies underwent serological testing in 31,042 bloo d samples and 18,952 bulk tank milk samples and showed negative results. No cases in cattle have been reported since then. Freedom from disease in the sheep and goat populations has been documented each y ear since 1998 through the testing of samples. In 2014, 688 sheep farms (9,265 blood samples) and 471 goat farms (3,216 blood samples) tested negative for Brucella melitensis . For more information, see Chapter 6 \"Freedom from disease\". No cases of brucellosis were reported in animals in 2014. 5 cases of brucellosis have been recorded in the last 10 years (2005-2014) ( Figure 9.n ). In the 3 pigs and the one wild boar, these involved an infection with B. suis serovar 2. B. suis biovar 2 is known to occur in wild boar in Switzerland (Leuen- berger et al., 2007). In the period 2008-2010, 28.8% of 252 wild boar tested positive for B. suis biovar 2 using a culture/PCR and 35.8% showed antibodies (Wu et al., 2011) . At the first of the three companies at which there was an outbreak in 2009, Mangalitsa pigs that were kept outdoors were affec ted. Animals at the other 2 companies came into contact with animals at the first company. Investigations into the outbreaks showed that the same strain was involved at the 3 companies. However, thi s was different from wild boar isolates, which meant that direct transmission through wild boar was not likely in this case (Abril et al., 2011). One clinical case in 2010 involving a ram infected with B. ovis (brucellosis in rams) was the first case for 9 years. Brucellosis in rams occurred in par ticular between 1994 and 2001. A total of 101 cases were reported during this period, between 1 and 34 cases per year . Figure 9.n: Number of cases of brucellosis reported in Information system for reporting epidemics (InfoSM) , FSVO; as at February 2015) 012345678910 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Number of cases reported in animals Pig Wild boar Sheep 105 9.7.3 Measures The measures for cattle ( B. abortus ) are regulated in the TSV in Art.150-157, while those for sheep and goats (B. melitensis ) are regulated in Art. 190-195, those for pigs ( B. suis, B. abortus and B. melitensis) in Art. 207-211 and those for rams ( B. ovis ) in Art. 233-236. 9.7.4 Assessment of the situation The numbers of cases reported in humans remain low. In Switzerland, human infections wit h Brucella can usually be traced back to stays abroad or the consumption of foreign dairy prod ucts. Swiss livestock that supply milk are free from brucellosis, and there are no indications from monit oring data that this status is at risk. Raw milk in this country is therefore safe with r egard to Brucella . Nevertheless, raw milk is not a ready-to-drink product and must be heated to at least 70\u00b0C before consumption. The outbreak of Brucella suis in woolly pigs in the Canton of Geneva in 2009 shows that epizootics that have not been diagnosed for years can recur at any time. The transportation of ani mals played a crucial part here. B. suis serovar 2 is detected in wild boar (Wu et al., 2011). Pigs kept on open land are at particular risk, along with those kept near woods (< 50 m) and with low f ences (< 60 cm) along the Jura mountain range and in the Swiss Plateau, where the density of wild boar is parti cularly high. B. suis biovar 2 is, however, less virulent to humans than biovar 1 and 3 and is rare ly detected in humans. 9.8 Echinococcosis Echinococcosis is an infection with tapeworms (in definitive hosts) or the ir larval stages (metacestodes, bladder worms) of the Echinococcus species (in intermediate/dead-end hosts). A distinction is made in particular between 2 main pathogens, which present themselves in a dead-end host. They become infected by eating infectious eggs. This is possible through consumption of contaminated foods (through faecal contamination) or through contact with infec ted de- finitive hosts and contaminated objects or soil. The initial symptoms are usually upper abdominal symp- toms and/or jaundice. A severe, cancer-like illness develops, usually locali sed in the liver. It is estimated that 5-15 years generally elapse between the time of infection and diagnosis of AE in humans. Forest fruits such as berries and mushrooms and any vegetables and fallen fruit must be thoroug hly washed and if possible cooked before eating. Normal freezing at -20\u00b0C will not kill off the eggs of E. multilocu- laris . Transmission from human to human is not possible. The definitive hosts are foxes and occasionally dogs or cats. They become infected by eating interme- diate hosts containing tapeworm bladder worms (particularly voles, but in rare cases also other rodents). The bladder worms develop within a month into adult tapeworms in the small inte stine of the definitive host, and then in turn begin to excrete infectious eggs. b) Cystic echinococcosis (CE) Once again, humans are a dead-end host. Often no symptoms are noticed, or only non-specif ic symp- toms that depend on the organ in which the parasites are located. The definitive hosts are do gs, which become infected by eating bladder worms in the organs of slaughtered animals. The main inter mediate hosts that have been described are sheep, cattle, horses and pigs. Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato no longer occurs in Switzerland. There are sporadic imported cases in humans and animals (parti cularly dogs, cattle and sheep). 106 9.8.1 Obligation to report to the authorities and n umbers of cases in humans There has been no obligation to report the occurrence of Echinococcus spp . in humans since 1999. However, the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO) has figures s howing how many people have been hospitalised due to alveolar echinococcosis every year. The number of people hospitali sed due to AE for the first time rose from 17 in 2008 to 45 in 2013. This corresponds to an incr ease in the hospitalisation rate from 0.22 (2008) to 0.55 (2013) cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Since 2008, ther e have to date been an additional 3 to 11 new infections every year. Even if infections can occ ur in people as young as 19 years of age, the risk of infection increases with age (15-24 years: 0.2 cases per 100,000; years: 0.5 per 100,000; over 65 years: 1.2 per 100,000). Data from before 2005 collected by the Institute of Parasitology in Zurich had already shown that the incidence had increased by a factor of about 2.5, from 0.1 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants (mean for 1993-2000) to 0.26 (mean for 2001-2005) (Schweiger et al., 2007). This development followed a sharp rise in fox popula- tions, after successful combating of rabies. Analyses of cases between 1984 and 2010 showed that the incidence was significantly higher in rural regions than in urban areas (0.26 versus 0.12 per 100,000 inhabitants). Nevertheless, more than half (55%) of these cases occurred in cities , particularly in the urban areas around Kreuzlingen, Zurich, Bern, Basel, Lausanne and Geneva. On aver age, patients were 52-55 years old at the time of diagnosis. The risk of infection increased s ignificantly with each additional 20 years of life (Torgerson et al., 2008). 9.8.2 Obligation to report to the authorities and m onitoring in ani- mals Echinococcosis in animals is an epizootic that must be monitored (TSV, Art. 5). 8 cases of echinococ- cosis were reported in animals in 2014 (dogs (6), monkeys (2)). In the last 10 y ears (2005-2014), the number of cases reported has fluctuated between 1 and 11 per year. Dogs were most frequently af fected (48%), followed by foxes (30%) ( Figure 9.o ). In 2012 the first case since 1991 was reported in a cow, which was noticed during meat inspections. No laboratory results were ava ilable for this case, and there was therefore no more specific information about the species. Foxes are the main host of E. multilocularis. The prevalence in foxes is estimated at 30% to 70%. The latest figures from the Institute of Parasitology at the University of Zur ich show that in eastern Switzer- land, 53% (105 out of 200, 2012) and 57% (57 out of 100, 2013) of hunted foxes tested posi tive for E. multilocularis . Between 2006 and 2011, the Institute of Parasitology at the University of Zurich evaluated the deworm- ing of foxes as an option for combating this disease. In 2007/08, it was sho wn that the deworming of foxes reduced the proportion of E. multilocularis- positive fox droppings from 25% (361 out of 1,376) to 19% (202 out of 1,044). Without deworming, the proportion that were positive remained at 2 5% (63 out of 254). However, the positive effect of deworming lasts for only a short t ime. Dogs have been identified as a significant risk factor for echinococcosis i n various case-control studies. Although dogs are rarely infested, they can excrete large quantities of infecti ous eggs. The prevalence in dogs is estimated at 0.3-0.4%. This means that about 10% of dogs will be infecte d with Echinococcus once during their lives and could contaminate the environment with infectious eggs. A study in 2009 showed that farm dogs with free access to their environment were more frequently infect ed with E. multilocularis than domestic dogs (3 out of 124 (2.4%) farm dogs versus 0 out of 118 domestic dogs). Around 7-19% of fox tapeworm eggs in the settlement area could thus be excreted by do gs. The fur of dogs was also examined for the presence of worm eggs. Worm eggs were detected in the f ur of 2 farm dogs. Monitoring studies carried out by the Institute of Parasitology at the University of Zurich on mice in the Zurich area in 2007/08 showed that 17% of the mice were infected with E. multilocularis (100 out of 634 in 2007 and 66 out of 393 in 2008). In 2013, barely any mice were infected with E. multilocularis (3 out of 200 A. scherman and 6 out of 259 M. arvalis ). 107 Figure 9.o: Number of cases of echinococcosis reported in animals, Information system for reporting epidemics (InfoSM) , FSVO; as at February 2015) 9.8.3 Measures As this is an epizootic that must be monitored, no government measures are taken with animals in the event of an epidemic. 9.8.4 Assessment of the situation Cases of alveolar echinococcosis (AE) are rare, even if the risk of an infection has increased slightly in the last few years. AE is a disease that severely impairs the quality of life. However, treatment options have significantly improved in the last 40 years. The average life expectancy of people infected with AE is around 2 to 4 years lower than for the population as a whole. In many cases peo ple recover com- pletely. Further monitoring of the epidemiological situation will be important ov er the next few years. The increased risk of infection has been explained by the higher density of foxes (successful combating of rabies in the 1980s, less hunting) and by their advance into urban areas. It c an be assumed that the fox population will remain high in the next few years and that foxes will continue t o advance into urban areas. E. multilocularis is increasingly being detected in densely populated areas. Due to waste (e. g. food scraps on compost heaps), a plentiful supply of berries and fruit, deliberate feeding by residents and a sympathetic attitude to foxes, the density of foxes here is often high, with ov er 10 mature foxes per square kilometre. As important intermediate hosts such as water voles ( A. scherman ) and field mice (M. arvalis ) are common on the periphery of towns, the parasite can find optimum li ving conditions here. Contamination of the environment with eggs of the fox tapeworm is thought to be high at the transition from urban to rural areas. Infections can be significantly reduced by de worming foxes. Any programme to combat fox tapeworm should give priority to densely populated areas. However, the cost of deworm- ing is high, as it is necessary to put down bait regularly over a long period in order to achieve any effect. The focus is therefore currently on keeping the public well informed about indiv idual preventative measures (e.g. hand hygiene after working in the garden, washing of field crops and g arden fruits that are to be consumed raw, changing shoes before entering living areas, not feeding or t aming foxes). Dogs and cats that hunt mice should be dewormed every month. In addition, dog faeces should be consistently removed from settlement areas. If foxes are found dead or killed in a hunt, they should be handled with plastic gloves and the hands should then be washed thoroughly. Dogs that have been in foxes' dens should be thoroughly showered (see also www.paras.uzh.ch/infos and www.ESCCAP.ch ). 0246810 12 14 16 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Number of reported cases in animals Dog Fox Other 108 Infections with E. granulosus are rare in Switzerland. Dogs that are imported from areas contaminated with E. granulosus should undergo tapeworm treatment immediately before entry into Switzerland. Slaughterhouse waste should be fed to dogs only if it has been cooked or fr ozen to at least -18\u00b0C for 3 days. 109 10 Outbreaks of foodborne diseases It is rare in Switzerland for an entire group of people to b ecome infected with a pathogen via food. Only 11 outbreaks of foodborne disease were recorded in the y ear under review. These involved infections with Listeria , Salmonella , Campylobacter and toxin-producing pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus . With regard to foods, particular caution is required with sprouts and raw meat, although cheese and ready-to- eat lettuce have also been identified as sources of infection. 11 outbreaks of foodborne disease were recorded in the year under review ( Table 10.a ), confirming the trend towards a plateau in the frequency of such events in Switzerland at a low l evel. Some outbreaks resulted in more extensive epidemiological investigations, such as a cluster of c ases involving Listeria monocytogenes serotype 4b (Food Control 57, 14-17, 2015). The source of infection was found to be ready-to-eat lettuce that, due to a technical fault at the production site, had exceeded the specified limits. As Listeria is widespread in nature, it has been known for a long time that these germs can als o con- taminate foods of vegetable origin such as lettuce (Archiv f\u00fcr Lebensmittelhy giene 43, 108-110, 1992). However, there have been no outbreaks of listeriosis in Switzerland in the l ast 25 years due to such products. The outbreak that occurred should therefore be classed as an extremely rare event, and let- tuce can continue to be regarded as a safe product. It is also worth mentioning an outbreak caused by staphylococcal enterotoxins A and D in Tomme soft cheese (Journal of Dairy Science 98, 2944-2948). Diseases caused by such toxins are frequently pos- sible, particularly with artisanal cheeses, as another outbreak involving goats ' cheese proved. There were 2 recorded outbreaks of salmonellosis. In one event, a cluster of cases of Salmonella szentes , a rare serovar, were linked to sprouts, while Switzerland was also affected by a n international outbreak involving a large number of cases of Salmonella bovismorbificans (manuscript accepted for publication), in which the focus was on Germany. Patients mainly became infected in a restaur ant, and the source of the pathogen was again identified as sprouts. Campylobacteriosis remains the most important zoonosis in Switzerland, with a h igh number of cases in humans every year. A significant risk factor for campylobacteriosis is foods such as \"fondue Chinoise\", with which consumers come into contact with raw meat and meat juice. It was t herefore not surprising that an outbreak of campylobacteriosis was recorded in connection with a barbecue and ra w chicken meat. Incorrect storage of food (errors in times and temperature) can under some circumst ances allow any toxin-producing germs that are present to multiply rapidly, which in one case l ed to an outbreak affecting 41 people. The cause was a sauce that was contaminated with Bacillus cereus . Finally, a further 4 outbreaks were recorded at catering establishments. Although no causal agents were i dentified, it had to be assumed in view of the symptoms that these cases involved poisoning. 110 Pathogen Number of people taken ill Number of people hospitalised Contaminated food Place consumed Cause L. monocytogenes serovar 4b 31 Unknown Lettuce Home Cross- contamination S. bovismorbificans 23 Unknown Sprouts Restaurant Unknown S. szentes 11 Unknown Sprouts Home Unknown Campylobacter spp. 5 2 Barbecue with raw chicken meat Restaurant Cross- contamination Staphylococcal en- terotoxins A and D 15 0 Tomme soft cheese School Incorrect storage Staphylococcal en- terotoxins G and I 5 0 Goats' cheese Home Unknown B. cereus 41 4 Gratin and b\u00e9chamel sauce Canteen Temperature error Unknown 2 2 Kebab Takeaway Unknown Unknown 6 0 Spaghetti sauce Restaurant Unknown Unknown 3 1 Fried veal sausages Takeaway Unknown Unknown 30 0 Salad with sauce School Unknown Table 10.a: Outbreaks of foodborne disease and pathogens or toxins involved, 2014 111 11 Antibiotic resistance To estimate and prevent the spread of bacteria with resistance to antibiot ics from animal popu- lations to humans, a monitoring programme was set up in Switzerland in 2006. In 2014 it was adapted to the EU's new guidelines, to allow data to be compared wit h data from other countries in future. Among the pathogens that cause zoonoses, the rate of resistance of C. jejuni to ciprof- loxacin increased further, as did the occurrence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in slaughtered pigs. 11.1 Antibiotic resistance in livestock and meat Since 2006, various standardised tests have been carried out as part of a nationa l monitoring pro- gramme in Switzerland to determine the situation with regard to antibioti c resistance in fattening poultry, fattening pigs and cattle. The development of resistance in the pathogens that cause zoonoses and in indicator germs i n livestock is monitored continuously in order to gain a better understanding of the risk of the s pread of resistance within animal populations and from them via the food chain to humans. In addition, the monitoring of development of resistance in bacteria forms the basis for drawing up measures to improve the situation. To ensure that data can still be obtained that are comparable with those of other countries , the monitor- ing system was adapted to the EU's new guidelines in the year under review. In future, fattening poultry will be inspected every two years, while fattening pigs and cattle wil l be inspected in the alternate years. Meat samples from the species that are inspected will also be taken in the retail trade and tested for the presence of resistant germs. In 2014, healthy broiler chickens were sampled in slaughterhouses, as well as c hicken meat from the retail trade. As in the previous year, nasal swab samples from slaughtered pigs wer e also tested for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a strain of bacteria known for its multiple resistance to all antibiotics with active substances in the -lactam group that are currently available on the market. 11.1.1 Causes of zoonoses In the case of C. jejuni from broiler chickens, resistance to ciprofloxacin has increased significant ly since 2006. It rose from 15% in 2006 to over 45.9% in 2014. Resistance to erythromyci n is rarely observed in C. jejuni from broiler chickens. Only 1 such isolate was found in the year under revi ew, which also showed resistance to ciprofloxacin. Fluoroquinolones, which include ciprofl oxacin, and macrolides, which include erythromycin, are classified as critical antibiotics with top priority (WHO/OIE/FAO), as these groups of active substances are the treatment of choice for severe forms of campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis in humans. 112 Type of sample Number of sam- ples Germs investigated Number of resistance tests broiler chickens 493 Campylobacter spp. 174 Cloacal swab from broiler chickens 205 E. coli 200 Cloacal swab from broiler chickens 350 Enterococci 282 Cloacal swab from broiler chickens 297 ESBL/AmpC lactamase- producing E. coli 124 Nasal swab from fattening pigs 298 MRSA 79 Meat samples (chicken) 319 MRSA 22 Meat samples (chicken) 319 ESBL/AmpC lactamase- producing E. coli 232 Meat samples (chicken) 319 Carbapenemases 0 Clinical material/all species - Salmonella spp . 42 Clinical material/all species - S. typhimurium 18 Clinical material/all species - Monophasic S. typhimurium 13 Clinical material/all species - S. enteritidis 11 Table 11.a: Overview of data collected as part of the monitoring programme for antibiotic res istance in 2014, broken down according to the type and number of samples, stating the germs inv estigated and the number of resistance tests The occurrence of MRSA in slaughtered pigs in Switzerland has risen from 2% t o 26.5% since 2009. The results show that in particular, a clonal MRSA line is spreading rapid ly through the Swiss slaugh- tered pig population (CC398-t034). This type of MRSA is also commonly fou nd in livestock in other European countries and is one of the forms of so-called livestock-associat ed MRSA. Although it is known that people who are in close contact with animals are at increased risk of being M RSA carriers, such livestock-associated MRSA rarely causes infections in humans. MRSA was found in a total of 6.9% of chicken meat samples, with a much lower occ urrence in meat produced in Switzerland (1%) than in meat from abroad (16%). While food is not currently regarded as a source of transmission of MRSA to humans, high levels of multi-resistant g erms are not desirable here. If Salmonella are isolated in ungulates or poultry, they must be sent to the reference labor atory for further classification, where they will undergo resistance testing. However, Salmonella occur only rarely in Swiss animal populations and resistance rates are low, particularly wi th S. enteritidis and S. typhi- murium . The risk of transmission of resistant Salmonella from foods of animal origin produced in Swit- zerland to humans is therefore estimated to be low. 11.1.2 Indicator germs Resistance to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, sulfamethoxazole an d tetracycline has often been found in the past in commensal E. coli isolates from broiler chickens. The rate of resistance to these active substances increased in the period 2006-2012, but since then has fallen again significantly. Tests on the Enterococci species E. faecalis and E. faecium from broiler chickens show that resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline is often found. However, resistance to these a ntibiotics has declined significantly in E. faecalis in the last few years. No resistance to vancomycin or linezolid w as found in either of the two strains. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)/AmpC lactamase-producing E. coli were detected in 41.8% of broiler chicken flocks and 73.3% of chicken meat samples in the year under review, using selective detection methods. The increase in prevalence in the broiler chicken flocks is probably due to a change 113 in laboratory methods. ESBL/AmpC lactamase-producing E. coli was also found considerably more of- ten in chicken meat of foreign origin (85.6%) than in chicken meat produced in Switzer land (65.5%). However, no carbapenemase-producing E. coli was found. Although transmission of such bacteria to humans can be prevented with good kitchen hyg iene and by ensuring that meat is carefully cooked through, multi-resistant germs should not be pres ent on food, or should be present only in small quantities. 11.1.3 Conclusion Resistance is found both in the pathogens that cause zoonoses and in indicator germs in healthy broiler chickens in Switzerland. However, the frequency of resistance to several c lasses of active substances in indicator germs has declined significantly in recent years. In particul ar, the occurrence of resistant germs such as MRSA and ESBL/AmpC lactamase-producing E. coli has been found to be increasing or to remain unchanged at a high level; the frequency of these germs is influenced not only by the use of antibiotics alone, but also by other factors such as the transportation of animal s, biosafety and slaugh- terhouse hygiene. The development of resistant bacteria in animal populations must continue to be monitored. This is the only way to estimate the threat that they pose to humans and animals. Coordinated measures are cur- rently being developed with all the sectors involved as part of the national s trategy for antibiotic re- sistance (StAR), with the aim of ensuring that antibiotics remain effectiv e in protecting human and animal health in the long term.
