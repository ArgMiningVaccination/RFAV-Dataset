Given the epidemic of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease and the link to CKD, it isclear that this guideline will be of immense importance to a broad audience of practionersand patients. As for all KDOQI guidelines, allrelevant epidemiological studies and clinical tri-als have been reviewed to ensure a balancedpresentation of the key aspects of diabetes andCKD. The key points have been made that the combi- nation of CKD and diabetes is a cardiovasculardisease multiplier, and that these patients are athigh risk of cardiovascular disease. The uniquechallenges of managing patients and the need tointervene early in the course of disease are dis-cussed within the context of specic recommen-dations. As in all recent KDOQI guidelines,the difference between clinical practice guide-lines (which are based on a sound evidentiarybase) and clinical practice recommendations(which have a less sound evidentiary base, andon which ongoing research is needed) have beenseparated. There are some topics within this guideline that address special populations (including na-tive populations and pregnant women). These were included to ensure that 1 document couldbe used by practioners to address frequentlyasked key questions. This guideline has been developed by using the usual rigorous methods of the KDOQIprocess and has involved multiple disciplinesfrom both US and international sources. These perspectives have been invaluable in ensuringa robust document with broad perspective.This nal version of this document has under-gone revision in response to comments duringthe public review process, an important andintegral part of the KDOQI guideline pro-cess. Nonetheless, as with all guideline docu-ments, there will be a need in the future forrevision in the light of new evidence and, moreimportantly, a concerted effort to translate theguidelines into practice. We hope that this rst guideline for the evalu- ation and management of patients with diabetesand kidney disease will foster additional researchand facilitate implementation of key strategiesfor the early identication and treatment of thisgrowing population. Implementation is an inte-gral component of the KDOQI process, and itaccounts for the success of its past guidelines.The Kidney Learning System component of theNational Kidney Foundation is developing imple-mentation tools that will be essential to thesuccess of these guidelines. In a voluntary and multidisciplinary undertak- ing of this magnitude, many individuals make contributions to the nal product now in yourhands.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYEXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem affecting more than 50million people, and more than 1 million of themare receiving kidney replacement therapy. 1,2The National Kidney Foundation-Kidney DiseaseOutcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI)Clinical on 11% of the US popula-tion, 3and those affected are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and kidney fail-ure. Kidney failure represents about 1% of theprevalent cases of CKD in the United States, 3 and the prevalence of kidney failure treated bydialysis or transplantation is projected to in-crease from 453,000 in 2003 to 651,000 in2010. 3,4 Management of CKD is costly. The Medicare CKD stage 5 population nearly doubled in thelast 10 years, and the CKD population expanded,as well. Together, they account for 16.5% ofMedicare expenditures, nearly double that of 10years ago, and the total costs for kidney diseasenow approach 24% of Medicare expenditures. 4 A growing body of evidence suggests that someof the adverse outcomes of CKD can be pre-vented or delayed by preventive measures, earlydetection, and treatment. NKF-KDOQI CPGs presently offer strate- gies hypertension, 5dyslipidemia,6 disease,7anemia,8nutrition,9and CVD10in patients with CKD. The present Guidelines ex-tend the scope of the NKF-KDOQI CPGs andCPRs by offering strategies to diagnose andmanage patients with diabetes and CKD. BACKGROUND Epidemic of Diabetes Nearly 21 million people in the United States, or 7% of the population, have diabetes, and abouta third of those with diabetes are unaware theyhave the disease. About 5% to 10% of diabetes inthe United States is type 1, which develops as aconsequence of the body's failure to produceinsulin. In some racial and ethnic groups, theproportion of cases attributable to type 1 diabetesis even less. 11Most cases of diabetes in the United States and elsewhere are type 2, whichdevelops because of the body's failure to pro- duce sufcient insulin and properly use the insu-lin it produces. Worldwide, 171 million peoplehave diabetes. Diabetes prevalence is increasing most rapidly in the developed countries and in developingcountries undergoing transition from traditionalto modern lifestyles. 12,13In the general US popu- lation, estimates from national surveys14show an 8-fold increase in the prevalence of diagnoseddiabetes between 1958 and 2000. The San Anto-nio Heart Study 15suggests an increasing inci- dence rate of type 2 diabetes is responsible, inpart, for the increasing prevalence among Mexi-can Americans and for a borderline signicanttrend in non-Hispanic whites. The investigatorsattribute the greater prevalence of diabetes in thispopulation more to the increasing incidence thanto the decrease in cardiovascular mortality re-ported among people with diabetes nationally. 16 Other factors responsible for the increasing preva-lence of diabetes include changes in diagnosticcriteria, increased public awareness, decreasingoverall mortality, growth in minority popula-tions, a dramatic increase in the magnitude andfrequency of obesity, and the widespread adop-tion of a sedentary lifestyle. 14Most of the in- crease in diabetes prevalence is attributable totype 2 diabetes, and although much of this in-crease is occurring in adults, children and adoles-cents increasingly are affected. However, a world-wide increase in the incidence of type 1 diabetesalso has been noted, particularly among childrenyounger than 5 years. 17 Projections of the future burden of diabetes in the US population suggest that the prevalence ofdiabetes will increase 165% between 2000 and2050, with the greatest increases in the popula-tion older than 75 years and among AfricanAmericans. 18The global burden of diabetes is expected to double between 2000 and 2030, withthe greatest increases in prevalence occurring inthe Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, and In-dia. 19Moreover, the development of type 2 dia- betes during the childbearing years also will \u00a92007 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc. 0272-6386/07/4902-0102$32.00/0doi:10.1053/j.ajkd.2006.12.005 American Journal of Kidney Diseases, Vol 49, No 2, Suppl 2 (February), 2007: pp S13-S19 S13increase, primarily in the developing countries (CPR 3, Fig 27 ).19Projections regarding the future burden of diabetes are based on increasing life expectancy, population growth, and progres-sive urbanization. 20Of growing concern is the belief that these estimates may be too low be- cause they do not account for the increasingfrequency and magnitude of obesity and othermajor risk factors for diabetes. As the population of patients with diabetes of long duration grows, reports of a dramaticallyincreasing burden of diabetic kidney disease(DKD) are appearing from developed coun-tries, 21as well as from Africa,22,23India,24the Pacic Islands,25and Asia,26,27where infectious disease previously posed the greatest threat28 (see CPR 3). Increased risk and more rapid progression of DKD29,30also have been reported in immigrants from developing to developed countries.31,32 PROBLEM OF DIABETES AND CKD Diabetes is the leading cause of CKD in devel- oped countries and rapidly is becoming the lead-ing cause in developing countries as a conse-quence of the global increase in type 2 diabetesand obesity. 33In the United States, microalbumin - uria is found in 43%, and macroalbuminuria, in8% of those with a history of diabetes. 3More - over, diabetes accounts for 45% of prevalentkidney failure, up from 18% in 1980. 4 Substantial underdiagnosis of both diabetes and CKD leads to lost opportunities for preven-tion, and inadequate or inappropriate care ofpatients with diabetes and CKD may contributeto disease progression. Nevertheless, diabetescare has improved as the benets of meticulousmanagement have become widely accepted angiotensin patients with diabe-tes. 4Even so, fewer than 1 in 4 patients with diabetes receives at least 1 hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test, at least 1 lipid test, and at least 1 glucose testing strip each year, reflecting the need for better assessment of these high-riskpatients. 4 DKD refers to kidney disease that is specic to diabetes. Although kidney biopsy is required todiagnose diabetic glomerulopathy denitively, inmost cases, careful screening of diabetic patientscan identify people with DKD without the need for kidney biopsy. DKD is based in part on thending of elevated urinary albumin excretion,which is divided arbitrarily into: (1) microalbu-minuria, a modest elevation of albumin thoughtto be associated with stable kidney function, buta greater risk of macroalbuminuria and kidneyfailure; and (2) macroalbuminuria, a higher eleva-tion of associated progressive de-cline in glomerular ltration rate (GFR), an in-crease in systemic blood pressure, and a high riskof kidney failure. Most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screen-ing for microalbuminuria in patients with diabe-tes, and the suggested screening plan, adaptedfrom the American Diabetes Association (ADA)guideline, is shown in Guideline 1, Fig 6 . 34,35 Screening should begin 5 years after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and at the time of diagnosis oftype 2 diabetes because of the inability to estab-lish the onset of type 2 diabetes with certainty.Because urinary albumin excretion 36multiple are required for classication. Denitions of DKD by albuminuria and stage are shown in Guideline1,Table 6 . Evidence for the usefulness of estimated GFR (eGFR) alone as a screening test for CKD indiabetes is less secure. Many patients with diabe-tes and CKD may have elevated or high-normalGFRs, particularly in the early years after diagno-sis. Therefore, markers of kidney damage arerequired to detect early stages of CKD; eGFRalone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse(Guideline 1, Table 6 ). Because diabetes is a common condition, coinci- dence with other nondiabetic CKD is relativelyfrequent. Accordingly, evaluation of a person withatypical features should, in selected cases, includeadditional diagnostic testing, depending on the clini-cal presentation. Care should be used in determin-ing the appropriate diagnostic tests because admin-istration of radiographic contrast, with or withoutangiography, may pose greater risks in people withdiabetes and CKD than in others. Diabetes, CKD, and CVD Diabetes is one of the most important risk factors for CVD. The risk imparted by diabetesExecutive Summary S14has been described as a CVD risk equivalent because the likelihood of future events mayapproach that of people without diabetes whohave already had a myocardial infarction. 37Such observations have led to recommendations from both the ADA and the American Heart Associa-tion (AHA) for intensive cardiovascular risk fac-tor management in people with diabetes ( Table 1). 34,38CKD also imparts an extremely high risk of CVD. The NKF and the AHA recently issued guidelines and scientic statements recommend-ing that people with CKD be considered in thehighest risk category for CVD. 3,39For those with both diabetes and CKD, the outlook is far worse than for either condition alone because this com-bination is a powerful predictor of major adversecardiovascular events and death. The relation-ship between CKD severity and risk is continu-ous. People with diabetes and microalbuminuriahave twice the CVD risk of those with normoalbu-minuria, 40and as albuminuria increases and GFR decreases, CVD risk increases progressively.41-43 In an analysis of patients with type 2 diabetes from the UK Prospective Diabetes Study(UKPDS), rates of death and progression tomacroalbuminuria were equal at the microalbu-minuric stage. 41However, at the macroalbumin - uric stage, the death rate outpaced the rate ofkidney disease progression ( Fig 2 ). More people who reach CKD stage 3 will die, primarily ofCVD, than progress to kidney failure, especiallyif they also have diabetes. 3,44 In the Background, a focused review of rela- tionships among diabetes, CKD, and CVD rel-evant to people with CKD stages 1 to 4 ispresented. The review includes a discussion ofintensive risk factor management for the preven-tion of CVD, the evaluation of coronary heartdisease in patients with diabetes, and medicalmanagement and coronary revascularization inthese patients. Specic recommendations forCKD stage 5 are provided in the NKF-KDOQIGuidelines for CVD in Dialysis Patients. 10 People with diabetes and CKD are at high risk to both lose kidney function and experiencemajor adverse cardiovascular events (Back-ground, Fig 4 ). Treatment of risk factors reduces the likelihood of these outcomes. Fortunately,treatment strategies are largely shared for reduc-ing kidney and cardiovascular risks. The presentCPGs and CPRs for diabetes and CKD are con-sistent with those already established for the treatment of diabetes and CVD by the ADA andAHA. 34,38Goals of the management approaches recommended here are intended to mitigate the devastating consequences of the spectrum ofvascular complications, including kidney, heart,and others. GOALS OF CPG AND CPR PROCESS These CPGs seek to improve outcomes in patients with diabetes and CKD by providingstrategies for the diagnosis (Guideline 1) andmanagement (Guidelines 3 to 5 and CPRs 1 to 4)of CKD in the setting of diabetes and for themanagement of diabetes in the setting of CKD(Guideline 2). The general treatment of diabetesis beyond the scope of this guideline and isaddressed comprehensively in the ADA guide-lines. 34 As part of an evolution in the development of CPGs, the Work Group divided its recommenda-tions, which are based on a systematic review ofthe literature, into a series of Guidelines andCPRs. The Guidelines were based on a consen-sus within the Work Group that the strength ofthe evidence was sufcient to make denitivestatements about appropriate clinical practice.When the strength of the evidence was not suf-cient to make such statements, the Work Groupoffered CPRs based on the best available evi-dence and expert opinion. As new data becomeavailable, the strength of the evidence for manyof the CPRs may become sufcient for the CPRsto become CPGs, illustrating the need for recur-ring reviews and updates of this document. Manyof the research recommendations proposed bythe Work Group were developed with the goal ofstrengthening the evidence for the CPRs to deter-mine whether they should become Guidelines inthe future. The term \"denitive\" must be used with cau- tion, particularly in the context of CPGs. Uncer-tainty is an immutable element of all scienticresearch, and the establishment of a Guidelineshould neither preclude nor render unethical fur-ther inquiry. Rather, the establishment of guide-lines represents an evolving process that seeks toensure that each patient receives the best pos-sible care within the context of presently avail-able medical knowledge.Executive Summary S15Scope The target population of these CPGs is pa- tients with CKD stages 1 to 5, including dialysisand transplant patients. However, the emphasisis on stages 1 to 4 because the evidence in stage 5is either lacking or addressed in other NKF-KDOQI Guidelines. Consideration is given tothe diagnosis, impact, and management of diabe-tes and CKD in children, adults, the elderly,pregnant women, and different racial and ethnicgroups. The intended readers are practitioners who manage patients with diabetes and CKD, includ-ing, but not limited to, primary care providers,nephrologists, physician's assistants, nurse prac-titioners, nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, socialworkers, and diabetes educators. By reviewingscientic evidence from throughout the world,coordinating our efforts with guideline develop-ment processes elsewhere, and including in theWork Group experts from Latin America andEurope, as well as from North America, webelieve this document has relevance beyond prac-titioners in North America. The Value of Multifaceted Intervention Although these and other guidelines present recommendations for the management of riskfactors separately, in reality, multiple risk factorsare managed concurrently in patients with diabe-tes and CKD. In the Steno Study, a multifacetedapproach aimed at optimal management for a group of risk factors was evaluated in patientswith type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria. 45,46 The intervention had multiple targets, includingbehavioral (CPR 2,Table 48 ). This intensive intervention was com- pared with usual care. A mean decrease in albu-minuria (albumin decreased 20 mg/24 h) wasobserved in the intensive-intervention group,whereas a mean increase occurred in patients inthe usual-care group (albumin increased 30 mg/24h). Albuminuria progression and the compositeoutcome of CVD events or death were decreasedin the group treated intensively (CPR 2, Fig 26 ). However, which facets of the intervention areassociated with reduced risk is uncertain. Further-more, because the intensive intervention in-creased the use of RAS inhibitors, the contribu-tion of other treatments is unclear. Despite theselimitations, the Work Group recognizes the impor-tance of addressing multiple risk factors in anintegrated fashion. The incremental effects of amultifaceted approach appear to add up to sub-stantial clinical benets, even when each of thetherapeutic goals is not met ( Fig 1 ). A long-term, targeted, intensive intervention involving mul-tiple risk factors and using currently availabletherapeutic agents reduces the risk of cardiovas- Figure 1.

These questions led to researchrecommendations that should be high prioritiesto improve the care of patients with diabetes andCKD. The Work Group recognizes the impor-tance of bringing new treatments into clinicalresearch for DKD, especially for patients whohave progressive kidney disease despite the cur-rent standard of care. Promising treatments, in-cluding novel agents and potential new uses ofexisting agents, are currently in phase 2/3 trialsfor DKD. These recommendations and the newtreatments in clinical trials are described in theResearch Recommendations section. CPG AND CPR STATEMENTS Guideline 1: Screening and Diagnosis of DKD CKD in patients with diabetes may or may not represent DKD. In the absence of anestablished diagnosis, the evaluation of pa-tients with diabetes and kidney disease shouldinclude investigation into the underlyingcause(s). 1.1 Patients with diabetes should be screened annually for DKD. Initial screening shouldcommence: 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes; (A) or From diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. (B) 1.1.1 Screening should include: Measurements of urinary albu- min-creatinine ratio ina spot urine sample; (B) Measurement of serum creati- nine and estimation of GFR.(B) 1.2 An elevated ACR should be conrmed in the absence of urinary tract infectionwith 2 additional rst-void specimenscollected over the next 3 to 6 months. (B)Microalbuminuria is dened as an ACR between 30-300 mg/g.Macroalbuminuria is dened as an ACR>300 mg/g. 2 of 3 samples should fall within the microalbuminuric or macroalbumin-uric range to conrm classication. 1.3 In most patients with diabetes, CKD should be attributable to diabetes if:Macroalbuminuria is present; (B) or Microalbuminuria is present /H18537in the presence of diabetic retinopa- thy, (B) /H18537in type 1 diabetes of at least 10 years' duration. (A) 1.4 Other cause(s) of CKD should be consid- ered in the presence of any of the follow-ing circumstances: (B)Absence of diabetic retinopathy; Low or rapidly increasing proteinuria or phrotic syndrome; Refractory hypertension; Presence of active urinary sediment; Signs or symptoms of other systemic disease; or >30% reduction in GFR within 2-3 months after initiation of an ACEinhibitor or ARB. Guideline 2: Management of Hyperglycemia and General Diabetes Carein CKD Hyperglycemia, the dening feature dia- betes, is fundamental cause of vascular tar-get-organ complications, including kidney dis-ease. Intensive treatment of hyperglycemiaprevents DKD and may slow progression ofestablished kidney disease. 2.1 Target HbA 1cfor people with diabetes should be <7.0%, irrespective of the presence or absence of CKD. (A) Guideline 3: Management of Hypertension in Diabetes and CKD Most people with diabetes and CKD have hypertension. Treatment of hypertension slowsthe progression of CKD. 3.1 Hypertensive people with diabetes and CKD stages 1-4 should be treated with anACE inhibitor or an ARB, usually incombination with a diuretic. (A)Executive Summary S173.2 Target blood pressure in diabetes and CKD stages 1-4 should be <130/80 mm Hg. (B) Guideline 4: Management of Dyslipidemia in Diabetes and CKD Dyslipidemia is common in people with dia- betes and CKD. The risk of CVD is greatlyincreased in this population. People with dia-betes and CKD should be treated according tocurrent guidelines for high-risk groups. 4.1 Target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in people with should be <100 mg/dL; <70 mg/dL is a therapeutic option. (B) 4.2 with diabetes, CKD stages 1-4, and LDL-C >100 mg/dL should be treated with a statin. (B) 4.3 Treatment with a statin should not be initiated in patients with type 2 diabeteson maintenance hemodialysis therapy whodo not have a specic cardiovascularindication for treatment. (A) Guideline 5: Nutritional Management in Diabetes and CKD Management of diabetes and CKD should include nutritional intervention. Dietary modi-cations may reduce the progression of CKD. 5.1 Target dietary protein intake for people with diabetes and CKD stages 1-4 shouldbe the recommended daily allowance(RDA) of 0.8 g/kg body weight per day.(B) CPR 1: Management of Albuminuria in Normotensive Patients With Diabetes andAlbuminuria as a Surrogate Marker Treatments that decrease urinary albumin excretion may slow the progression of DKDand improve clinical outcomes, even in theabsence of hypertension. However, most peoplewith diabetes and albuminuria have hyperten-sion; management of hypertension in thesepatients is reviewed in Guideline 3. 1.1 Normotensive people with diabetes and macroalbuminuria should be treated withan ACE inhibitor or an ARB. (C) 1.2 Treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB may be considered in normotensivepeople with diabetes and microalbumin- uria. (C) 1.3 Albuminuria reduction may be consid- ered a treatment target in DKD. (C) CPR 2: Multifaceted Approach to Intervention in Diabetes and CKD Multiple risk factors are managed concur- rently in patients with diabetes and CKD, andthe incremental effects of treating each ofthese risk factors appear to add up to substan-tial clinical benets. 2.1 The care of people with diabetes and CKD should incorporate a multifacetedapproach to intervention that includesinstruction in healthy behaviors and treat-ments to reduce risk factors. (C) 2.2 Target body mass index (BMI) for people with diabetes and CKD should be withinthe normal range (18.5-24.9 kg/m 2). (C) CPR 3: Diabetes and CKD in Special Populations The increasing incidence of diabetes in chil- dren, young adults, the elderly, and membersof disadvantaged and transitional populationsis responsible for an increasing incidence ofDKD in these groups. Racial/ethnic differ-ences in susceptibility to DKD also may play arole. In pregnant women, the presence of dia-betes and CKD may adversely affect the healthof both the mother and her offspring. 3.1 Screening and interventions for diabetes and CKD should focus on populations atgreatest risk. (C) 3.2 Although management of diabetes and CKD in special populations should followthe same principles as management in themajority population, there are specialconsiderations in the treatment of chil-dren, adolescents, and the elderly. (C) 3.3 Population-based interventions may be the most cost-effective means for address-ing the burden of CKD in special popula-tions. Implementation and evaluation ofpopulation-based interventions shouldtake into account the heterogeneity of thepopulations at risk. (C) 3.4 Specialists in high-risk pregnancy and kidney disease should co-manage preg-Executive Summary S18nancy in women with diabetes and CKD. (C) 3.5 Treatment of DKD with RAS inhibitors before pregnancy may improve fetal andmaternal outcomes, but these medicinesshould be discontinued as soon as a men-strual period is missed or after a positivepregnancy test. (C) 3.6 Insulin should be used to control hypergly- cemia if pharmacological therapy is neces-sary in pregnant women with diabetesand CKD. (C) CPR 4: Behavioral Self-Management in Diabetes and CKD Behavioral self-management in patients with diabetes and CKD is particularly challengingbecause of the intensive nature of the diabetes regimen. Education alone is not sufcient topromote and sustain healthy behavior change,particularly with such a complex regimen. 4.1 Self-management strategies should be key components of a multifaceted treatmentplan with attention to multiple behaviors:(C) Monitoring and treatment of glycemia, Blood pressure, Nutrition, Smoking cessation, Exercise, and Adherence to medicines.Executive Summary S19II. CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINESBACKGROUND INTRODUCTION Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem affecting more than 50million people, and more than 1 million of themare receiving kidney replacement therapy. 1,2The National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI)Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) on CKDestimate that CKD affects 11% of the US popula-tion, 3and those affected are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and kidney fail- ure. Kidney failure represents about 1% of theprevalent cases of CKD in the United States, 3 and the prevalence of kidney failure treated bydialysis or transplantation is projected to in-crease from 453,000 in 2003 to 651,000 in2010. 3,4 Management of CKD is costly. The Medicare CKD stage 5 population nearly doubled in thelast 10 years, and the CKD population expanded,as well. Together, they account for 16.5% ofMedicare expenditures, nearly double that of 10years ago, and the total costs for kidney diseasenow approach 24% of Medicare expenditures. 4 A growing body of evidence suggests that someof the adverse outcomes of CKD can be pre-vented or delayed by preventive measures, earlydetection, and treatment. NKF-KDOQI CPGs presently offer strate- gies hypertension, 5dyslipidemia,6 bone disease,7anemia,8nutrition,9and CVD10in patients with CKD. The present Guideline ex- tends the scope of the NKF-KDOQI CPGs byoffering strategies to diagnose and manage thetreatment of patients with diabetes and CKD. PROBLEM OF DIABETES AND CKD Diabetes is the leading cause of CKD in devel- oped countries and is rapidly becoming the lead-ing cause in developing countries as a conse- quence of the global increase in type 2 diabetesand obesity. 33In the United States, microalbumin - uria is found in 43%, and macroalbuminuria, in8% of those with a history of diabetes. 3More - over, diabetes accounts for 45% of prevalentkidney failure, up from 18% in 1980. 4 Substantial underdiagnosis of both diabetes and CKD leads to lost opportunities for preven-tion, and inadequate or inappropriate care ofpatients with diabetes and CKD may contribute to disease progression. Nevertheless, diabetescare has improved because the benets of meticu-lous management have become widely acceptedand the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme(ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers(ARBs), and statins has increased in patientswith diabetes. 4Even so, fewer than 1 in 4 pa - tients with diabetes receives at least 1 hemoglo-bin A 1c(HbA1c) test, at least 1 lipid test, and at least 1 glucose testing strip each year, reflecting the need for better assessment of these high-riskpatients. 4 GOALS OF CPG AND CPR PROCESS This CPG seeks to improve outcomes in pa- tients with diabetes and CKD by providing strat-egies for the diagnosis (Guideline 1) and manage-ment (Guidelines 3 to 5 and CPRs 1 to 4) of CKDin the setting of diabetes and for the managementof diabetes in the setting of CKD (Guideline 2).The general treatment of diabetes is beyond thescope of this guideline, and it is comprehensivelyaddressed in the American Diabetes Association(ADA) guidelines. 34 As part of an evolution in the development of CPGs, the Work Group divided its recommenda-tions, which are based on a systematic review ofthe literature, into a series of Guidelines andClinical practice recommendations (CPRs). TheGuidelines were based on a consensus within theWork Group that the strength of the evidencewas sufcient to make denitive statements aboutappropriate clinical practice. When the strengthof the evidence was not sufcient to make suchstatements, the Work Group offered CPRs basedon the best available evidence and on expertopinion. As new data become available, thestrength of the evidence for many of the CPRsmay become sufcient for the CPRs to becomeCPGs, illustrating the need for recurring reviewsand updates of this document. Many of theresearch recommendations proposed by the WorkGroup were developed with the goal of strength-ening the evidence for the CPRs to determinewhether they should become Guidelines in thefuture. The term \"denitive\" must be used with cau- tion, particularly in the context of CPGs. Uncer-tainty is an immutable element of all scientic American Journal of Kidney Diseases, Vol 49, No 2, Suppl 2 (February), 2007: pp S21-S41 S21research, and the establishment of a Guideline should neither preclude nor render unethical fur-ther inquiry. Rather, the establishment of guide-lines represents an evolving process that seeks toensure that each patient receives the best pos-sible care within the context of presently avail-able medical knowledge. Scope The target population of this CPG is patients with CKD stages 1 to 5, including dialysis andtransplant patients. However, the emphasis is onstages 1 to 4 because the evidence in stage 5 iseither lacking or addressed in other NKF-KDOQI Guidelines. Consideration is given tothe diagnosis, impact, and management of diabe-tes and CKD in children, adults, the elderly,pregnant women, and different racial and ethnicgroups. The intended readers are practitioners who manage patients with diabetes and CKD, includ-ing, but not limited to, primary care providers,nephrologists, physician's assistants, nurse prac-titioners, nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, socialworkers, and diabetes educators. By reviewingscientic evidence from throughout the world,coordinating our efforts with guideline develop-ment processes elsewhere, and including in theWork Group experts from Latin America andEurope, as well as from North America, webelieve this document has relevance beyond prac-titioners in North America. DIABETES AS A PUBLIC HEALTH MANDATE An Epidemic Nearly 21 million people in the United States, or 7% of the population, have diabetes, and abouta third of those with diabetes are unaware theyhave the disease. About 5% to 10% of diabetes inthe United States is type 1, which develops as aconsequence of the body's failure to produceinsulin. In some racial and ethnic groups, theproportion of cases attributable to type 1 diabetesis even less. 11Most cases of diabetes in the United States and elsewhere are type 2, which develops because of the body's failure to pro-duce sufcient insulin and properly use the insu-lin it produces. Worldwide, 171 million peoplehave diabetes.Diabetes prevalence is increasing most rapidly in the developed countries and in developingcountries undergoing transition from traditionalto modern lifestyles. 12,13In the general US popu - lation, estimates from national surveys14show an 8-fold increase in the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes between 1958 and 2000. The San Anto-nio Heart Study 15suggests an increasing inci - dence rate of type 2 diabetes is responsible, inpart, for the increasing prevalence among Mexi-can Americans and for a borderline signicanttrend in non-Hispanic whites. The investigatorsattribute the greater prevalence of diabetes in thispopulation more to the increasing incidence thanto the decrease in cardiovascular mortality re-ported among people with diabetes nationally. 16 Other factors responsible for the increasing preva-lence of diabetes include changes in diagnosticcriteria, increased public awareness, decreasingoverall mortality, growth in minority popula-tions, a dramatic increase in the magnitude andfrequency of obesity, and the widespread adop-tion of a sedentary lifestyle. 14Most of the in - crease in diabetes prevalence is attributable totype 2 diabetes, and although much of this in-crease is occurring in adults, children and adoles-cents are increasingly affected. However, a world-wide increase in the incidence of type 1 diabetes also has been noted, particularly among childrenyounger than 5 years. 17 Projections of the future burden of diabetes in the US population suggest that the prevalence ofdiabetes will increase 165% between 2000 and2050, with the greatest increases in the popula-tion older than 75 years and among AfricanAmericans. 18The global burden of diabetes is expected to double between 2000 and 2030, with the greatest increases in prevalence occurring inthe Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, and In-dia. 19Moreover, development of type 2 diabetes during the childbearing years also will increase, primarily in the developing countries (CPR 3,Fig 27 ). 19Projections regarding the future bur - den of diabetes are based on increasing lifeexpectancy, population growth, and progressiveurbanization. 20Of growing concern is the belief that these estimates may be too low because they do not account for the increasing frequency andmagnitude of obesity and other major risk factorsfor diabetes.Background S22As the population of patients with diabetes of long duration grows, reports of a dramaticallyincreasing burden of diabetic kidney disease(DKD) are appearing from developed coun-tries, 21as well as from Africa,22,23India,24the Pacic Islands,25and Asia,26,27where infectious disease previously posed the greatest threat28 (see CPR 3). Increased risk and more rapid progression of DKD29,30also have been reported in immigrants from developing to developed countries.31,32 Obesity and Inactivity Obesity is one of the strongest determinants of diabetes and is a consequence of interactionsbetween genetic susceptibility, cellular metabo-lism, eating behavior, culture, level of physicalactivity, and socioeconomic status. Because obe-sity is a major determinant of diabetes and otherchronic diseases, an assessment of obesity shouldbe part of the routine clinical examination ofevery patient. General measures of obesity (BMI,weight, and percent body fat) and measures ofcentral fat distribution (waist circumference,waist-hip ratio, waist-thigh ratio, and waist-height ratio) predict the development of type 2diabetes in prospective studies, regardless of ageor ethnicity. 47-54Although a strong relationship exists between the quantity of intra-abdominal fat and diabetes, BMI remains an excellent pre-dictor of diabetes and is not improved signi-cantly by combining it with other measures ofgeneral adiposity or body fat distribution. 55In the kidney, obesity is associated with glomerular hyperltration and an increase in transcapillaryhydraulic pressure, 56,57hemodynamic changes that may accelerate the development and progres- sion of DKD in obese people with diabetes.Hence, CPR 2 was developed to address theissue of obesity and encourage further investiga-tion. One of the primary determinants of obesity is physical inactivity, and a physically active life-style is associated with a lower incidence of type2 diabetes in several prospective studies. 58-62 Recent clinical trials provide compelling evi-dence that increased physical activity, combinedwith dietary modication and weight loss, pre-vents diabetes regardless of age or ethnicity. 63-65 The Diabetes Prevention Program demonstratedthat a lifestyle-modication program that in-cluded a 7% weight loss and at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week was asso-ciated with a 58% reduction in the incidence ofdiabetes over nearly 3 years in people withimpaired glucose tolerance compared with pla-cebo. 63Because the lifestyle changes worked equally well in all racial/ethnic groups, they should be applicable to high-risk populationsworldwide. This approach to diabetes preventionprovides the most cost-effective means for reduc-ing the projected increase in the incidence ofdiabetes and its complications, including DKD. 66 Ethnicity In the United States, the burden of diabetes is borne disproportionately by ethnic and racialminorities, including African Americans, Hispan-ics, and Native Americans. The higher rates ofdiabetes in these populations relative to non-Hispanic whites are associated with a high rate ofDKD, as described in CPR 3. The particularlyhigh predisposition to diabetes is possibly on agenetic basis, when individuals are exposed to adverse conditions or rapid economic transition.Worldwide, populations of developing countriesappear to be at increased risk of developingdiabetes during the coming decades, perhaps formany of the same reasons. Economic transition may be the predominant risk factor for diabetes in many developing coun-tries. People who successfully undergo eco-nomic transition\u2014those who migrate to citiesand take industrial jobs that pay well\u2014experi-ence an increase in socioeconomic status andgreater access to food. In India, for example,higher socioeconomic status increases the risk ofdiabetes. 67The same is true among Hispanics in the United States.68Conversely, transition to higher socioeconomic status has the opposite effect in African Americans69; a nding that may be explained in part because higher socioeco- nomic status generally is associated with bettereducation, greater acculturation, and the re-sources to make healthier food choices. 70There - fore, although populations in rapid economictransition often are at increased risk of diabetes,proper education may mitigate or prevent theincrease in the risk of diabetes often associatedwith this transition.Background S23Extremes of Age The current epidemic of obesity in children and adolescents in many parts of the world hascreated an epidemic of type 2 diabetes in theseage groups. Although type 1 diabetes is thepredominant form of diabetes in children world-wide, it is likely that type 2 diabetes will soonbecome the most prevalent form in many ethnicgroups. 71,72Many children with type 2 diabetes are obese at diagnosis, have a strong family history of type 2 diabetes, and are the offspringof mothers with gestational diabetes. AmongNative Americans aged 15 to 19 years nation-wide, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes in-creased by 69% from 1990 to 1998, but remainedunchanged in those younger than 15 years. 73In Japan, a 10-fold increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes was reported during 20 years of fol-low-up in children initially aged 6 to 12 years,and a 2-fold increase was reported among thoseinitially aged 13 to 15 years, coinciding with asecular increase in the prevalence of obesity. 74,75 The proportion of children exposed to diabetes in utero also may be increasing as more womendevelop diabetes during their childbearing years.In Pima Indians, a doubling of the percentage ofchildhood diabetes during the past 30 years isattributed to an increasing frequency of intrauter-ine exposure to diabetes. 76Observations in Pima children born since 1965 indicate that offspring of mothers with diabetes have a greater preva-lence of obesity throughout childhood and amuch greater prevalence of type 2 diabetes. 77 Although only 3% of type 2 diabetes developsbefore 20 years of age, 78those who develop diabetes in childhood and adolescence are af- fected disproportionately in early adulthood bythe microvascular and macrovascular complica-tions diabetes, including DKD, 79,80as de - scribed in CPR 3. The World Health Organization (WHO) Multi- national Study of Vascular Disease in Diabetes81 reported that Native Americans from Arizonaand Oklahoma who had type 2 diabetes diag-nosed before 30 years of age had a higher age-adjusted incidence rate of kidney failure during amean follow-up of 9.5 years than the overallNative American population with diabetes. 82A study of long-term microvascular and macrovas- cular complications in Japanese subjects withonset of type 2 diabetes before 30 years of age83,84found that 5% of the subjects had CKD stage 5 after 20 years' duration of diabetes, and 23% of those who also had proliferative retinop-athy progressed to dialysis by a mean age of 35years. Premature atherosclerotic vascular dis-ease, including cerebrovascular disease and CVD,was the leading cause of death in this populationand was related largely to poor glycemic controland progression to CKD stage 5. These complica-tions have a signicant economic and publichealth impact because they will affect those withyouth-onset diabetes during their peak produc-tive years. Diabetes is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the aging population. At least 20%of people older than 65 years have diabetes, 34 and the greatest increase in diabetes prevalencein the coming decades will occur in those olderthan 75 years. 18The elderly are particularly prone to the cardiovascular complications of diabetes. CVD develops in the 2 years beforeinitiation of kidney replacement therapy in morethan 90% of patients aged 75 years and olderwith kidney failure and diabetes. Congestiveheart failure is the most common cardiac condi-tion among elderly patients with diabetes andCKD stage 5, affecting 71% of patients, fol-lowed closely by ischemic heart disease at 67%. 21 Other comorbidities also are more prevalent in the elderly, and intensive management of thesepatients may pose greater risks because hypoten-sion and hypoglycemia occur more frequentlythan in younger people. Although medicines forhyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemiacan be used in the elderly, as in other patientswith diabetes and CKD, they should be started atlower doses and carefully titrated while monitor-ing for responses and side effects (see CPR 3).The ADA, in collaboration with the AmericanGeriatric Society, has published evidence-basedguidelines for the management of geriatric pa-tients with diabetes. 85 Pregnancy The effect of pregnancy on diabetes and CKD is examined in CPR 3. Diabetes during preg-nancy is associated with an increased risk ofadverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Thefrequency of diabetes during pregnancy is increas-ing in developed countries primarily because ofBackground S24increasing obesity among women of childbear- ing age. Early diagnosis of diabetes during preg-nancy may be an important factor in improvingoutcomes in these mothers and their offspring.Nevertheless, much of the projected increase indiabetes prevalence during the childbearing yearswill occur in developing countries, 19where re - sources for identifying and managing the dia-betic pregnancy are limited. Whereas the maternal complications of diabe- tes are well known, there is increasing evidencethat the effects on the fetus are more extensivethan previously thought. In addition to increasedrates of macrosomia, congenital malformations,and perinatal mortality, the offspring of motherswith diabetes are prone to obesity and diabetes ata young age, leading to a vicious cycle of increas-ing frequencies of diabetes in successive genera-tions. 86In the Pima Indians, for example, the proportion of children exposed to diabetes in utero increased nearly 4-fold during the past 30years. 76The increased frequency of exposure to maternal diabetes was associated with a doubling of the number of cases of diabetes attributable tothat exposure. 76Moreover, the odds of having increased urinary albumin excretion was nearly 4 times as high in the offspring with diabetes whowere exposed to diabetes in utero than in thoseexposed to a normal intrauterine environment. 87 These ndings suggest that a diabetic pregnancycontributes not only to the increase in diabetesprevalence worldwide, but also to the increase inDKD among those who develop diabetes as aconsequence of this exposure. Whether strictglycemic control during a diabetic pregnancywill reduce the frequency of diabetes and kidneydisease in the offspring is unknown. Manage-ment of young obese women who desire tobecome pregnant should focus on preventing orat least delaying the onset of diabetes until afterthe childbearing years. Vascular Target-Organ Complications Cause Much Morbidity and Mortality Diabetes is associated with numerous vascular and nonvascular complications, and the vascularcomplications\u2014which include CVD, peripheralvascular disease, stroke, retinopathy, neuropathy,and DKD\u2014are responsible for most of the mor-bidity and mortality attributable to diabetes. Thefrequency of disability in people with diabetesoffers an indirect means of assessing the morbid- ity associated with various vascular complica-tions. Ischemic heart disease, stroke, and periph-eral vascular disease increase the risk of mobility-related disability in older adults with diabetes inthe United States by 2- to 3-fold relative to thosewithout diabetes. 88,89The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) found that in the United States, 25% of adultsolder than 60 years with diabetes cannot walkone quarter of a mile, climb 10 stairs, or dohousework, and half of those in this age grouphave some difculty performing these tasks. 88 Peripheral neuropathy often leads to greater limi-tations in performing the personal care activitiesof daily living, but has less impact on mobility. 89 Diabetes is the leading cause of visual decits indeveloped countries among people younger than60 years, 90,91and visual impairment or blindness can lead to disability affecting both mobility and daily living activities. One measure of population health and morbid- ity, the disability-adjusted life-year (DALY), pro-vides an estimate of the length of life lost topremature death and the time spent in an un-healthy state. This measure is computed for theUS population from data collected by theNHANES, the National Health Interview Sur-vey, and several other nationally representativehealth surveys. 92Diabetes is the 9thleading cause of DALYs among women and the 12thleading cause among men in the United States. African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Pacic Islanders,and Native Americans have the highest DALYsrelated to diabetes, in keeping with their greaterprevalence and earlier onset of diabetes. Theimpact of diabetes on DALYs and other healthoutcomes in these minority populations also maybe affected by disparities in their health thatresult from their social, political, and economicdisadvantage. 92 In the United States, the death rate in people with diabetes is twice that of people withoutdiabetes, and the major cause of the increaseddeath rate among those with diabetes is CVD(vide infra). 93Moreover, nearly all the excess mortality in both type 194and type 295diabetes is found in people with proteinuria. The WHO Multinational Study of Vascular Disease in Dia-betes 96reported that proteinuria was associated with signicantly increased mortality from kid-Background S25ney failure, CVD, and all other causes of death. Kidney and cardiovascular mortality ratios asso-ciated with proteinuria were similar for bothtypes of diabetes, although people with type 1diabetes were more likely to die of kidney failurethan those with type 2 diabetes. 96 DKD AND CKD Terminology for the Kidney Disease of Diabetes New terminology to describe kidney disease attributable to diabetes is introduced in the Dia-betes and CKD guidelines. The purpose of thisterminology is to clarify communication amongpatients, caregivers, and policy makers. For thispurpose and for consistency with CKD classica-tion, the term DKD is proposed for a presump-tive diagnosis of kidney disease caused by diabe-tes. Although kidney biopsy is required todiagnose diabetic glomerulopathy denitively,careful screening of diabetic patients can, inmost cases, identify persons most likely to havediabetic glomerulopathy without the need forkidney biopsy (see Guideline 1). The term \"dia-betic nephropathy\" should be replaced by DKD.The term diabetic glomerulopathy should be re-served for biopsy-proven kidney disease causedby diabetes. The goals of Guideline 1 are to facilitate identication of patients with kidney diseasepresumed to be caused by diabetes and distin-guish them from those who should have furtherinvestigation for a different diagnosis, whichmay alter treatment plans. Most clinical studiesof kidney disease in diabetes include patientswith low glomerular ltration rate (GFR) and/orproteinuria, with a ofDKD. However, in practice, few patients havebiopsy-proven DKD. Nevertheless, it would beuseful to distinguish patients with CKD that ispresumed to be caused by diabetes (DKD) fromthose with CKD from other causes on a clinicalbasis. DKD is based historically on the nding ofproteinuria in a person with diabetes. With thedevelopment of more sensitive assays specicfor of albumin thought to be asso-ciated with stable kidney function, but a greaterrisk of macroalbuminuria and kidney failure; and (2) macroalbuminuria, a higher elevation of albu-min associated with progressive decline in GFR,an increase in systemic blood pressure, and ahigh risk of kidney failure (Guideline 1, Table 6 ). However, these generalizations do not apply inall cases because people with normal urinaryalbumin excretion may have advanced DKD,whereas those with microalbuminuria may haveeither substantial or no pathological evidence ofkidney damage. Moreover, because of the highprevalence of diabetes in the population, someindividuals with diabetes may have other typesof CKD. Nevertheless, in most cases, clinicalmeasures may be used to diagnose DKD. Screening and Diagnosis Most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screen-ing for microalbuminuria in patients with diabe-tes, and the suggested screening plan, adaptedfrom the ADA guideline, is shown in Guideline1,Fig 6 . 34,35The Work Group supports these screening recommendations while recognizing the need for further studies to dene the impactof microalbuminuria detection on hard clinicalend points (see Guideline 1). Screening shouldbegin after 5 years of type 1 diabetes and at thediagnosis of type 2 diabetes because of the inabil-ity to establish the onset of type 2 diabetes withcertainty. Because urinary albumin test are required for classication. Denitions of DKD by albuminuria and stage are shown inGuideline 1, Table 6 . Evidence for the usefulness of estimated GFR (eGFR) alone as a screening test for CKD inpatients with diabetes is less secure. Many pa-tients with diabetes and CKD may have elevatedor high-normal GFRs, particularly in the earlyyears after diagnosis. Therefore, markers of kid-ney damage are required to detect early stages ofCKD; eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3or worse (Guideline 1, Table 6 ). Diabetes May Coexist With Other Causes of CKD Because diabetes is a common condition, coin- cidence with other nondiabetic CKD is relativelyfrequent. Accordingly, evaluation of a personBackground S26with atypical features should, in selected cases, include additional diagnostic testing, dependingon the clinical presentation. Care should be usedin determining the appropriate diagnostic testsbecause administration of radiographic contrast,with or without angiography, may pose greaterrisks in people with diabetes and CKD than inothers (see Guideline 1). Refractory hypertension and/or a signicant reduction in kidney function after renin-angioten-sin system (RAS) blockade should prompt con-sideration of renal artery stenosis because gener-alized vascular disease is common in diabetes.Patients with diabetes and CKD in whom refrac-tory hypertension is suspected should be evalu-ated, preferably without radiocontrast, to assesswhether arterial stenosis is present. Current non-invasive modalities to screen for arterial stenosisthat do not include use and du-plex scans are not recommended because sensi-tivity of these scans is low in patients withdecreased GFR or bilateral renal artery stenosis.In selected cases, imaging of the renal arteriesmay be undertaken with carbon dioxide or gado-linium angiography to avoid radiocontrast agents. Hypertension associated with unilateral renal artery stenosis may be treated with medicine(preferably an ACE inhibitor or ARB) with theoption of revascularization, usually by percutane-ous angioplasty and stent bilateral renal artery stenosis, or unilateralrenal artery stenosis in an individual with asingle functioning kidney, may require revascu-larization to both control hypertension and pre-vent loss of kidney function. However, whetherrevascularization of unilateral or bilateral renalartery stenosis adds benet to medicalmanagement Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions(CORAL), a randomized trial sponsored by theNational Institutes of Health (NIH), is address-ing this key issue and should provide importantdirection for the management of renal arterystenosis in the future. A number of systemic diseases that require specic therapy may occur in patients with diabe-tes. These diseases may present with a slowprogressive decline in kidney function or a rapiddecrease and may affect the kidney in variousways. Systemic diseases mostly likely to be confused with DKD are those that cause mild tomoderate proteinuria and a slow progressive de-crease in eGFR. Differentiation of these diseasesrequires clinical suspicion and appropriate diag-nostic testing. It is the opinion of the WorkGroup that in the absence of another identiableand treatable cause of kidney disease, patientswith diabetes and CKD should be treated as ifthey have DKD (see Guideline 1). DIABETES, CKD, AND CVD Diabetes and CKD: A High-Stakes Combination for CardiovascularComplications and Death Diabetes is one of the most important risk factors for CVD. The risk imparted by diabeteshas been viewed as a CVD equivalent becausethe likelihood of future events may approach thatof people without diabetes who have already hada myocardial infarction. 37Such observations have led to recommendations from both the ADA and the American Heart Association (AHA) for inten-sive cardiovascular risk factor management inpeople with diabetes ( Table 1 ). 34,38CKD also imparts an extremely high risk of CVD. The NKF and the AHA have recently issued guide-lines and scientic statements recommendingthat people with CKD be considered in the high-est risk category for CVD. 3,39For those with both diabetes and CKD, the outlook is far worse than for either condition alone because the com-bination is one the most powerful predictors ofmajor adverse cardiovascular events and death.The relationship between CKD severity and riskis continuous. People with diabetes and mi- croalbuminuria have twice the CVD risk of decreases, CVD in- creases progressively.41-43In an analysis of pa - tients with type 2 diabetes from the UK Prospec-tive Diabetes Study (UKPDS), rates of death andprogression to macroalbuminuria were equal atthe microalbuminuric stage. 41However, at the macroalbuminuric stage, the death rate outpaced the rate of kidney disease progression ( Fig 2 ). More people who reach CKD stage 3 will die,primarily of CVD, than progress to kidney fail-ure, especially if they also have diabetes. 3,44Background S27The scope of this review of relationships among diabetes, CKD, and CVD is relevant primarily topeople with CKD stages 1 to 4. Specic recom-mendations for CKD stage 5 are provided in theNKF-KDOQI Guidelines for CVD in DialysisPatients. 10 Intensive Risk Factor Management for Prevention of CVD Risk factor management is the cornerstone of therapy for CVD in patients with diabetes.In the present NKF-KDOQI Guidelines onDiabetes and CKD, intensive management ofhypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipide-mia is emphasized. Although evidence was reviewed primarily for effects on kidney out-comes, the conclusions regarding therapeuticgoals and choices of agents are strikingly simi-lar to recommendations from the ADA andAHA for prevention and treatment of CVD(Table 1 ). These similarities likely reflect un- derlying pathological mechanisms common toboth diabetic microvascular and macrovascu-lar complications. Recommendations for treatment of dyslipide- mia in patients with diabetes and CKD are basedon CVD risk reduction. The current state ofevidence is insufcient to recommend treatmentTable 1.

The recommendation to treat with statins indiabetes and CKD stages 1 to 4 was basedprimarily on large prospective studies of patientswith diabetes without markedly decreased kid-ney function and on a post hoc analysis from thePravastatin Pooling Project (PPP). 97-99In the PPP, people with diabetes and CKD had the greatest risk of CVD death, myocardial infarc-tion, or revascularization procedures comparedwith those with either condition alone or neithercondition. 99They also had the largest absolute risk reduction with statin therapy (Guideline 4, Fig 19 ). Despite these impressive results, the evidence was considered moderate by the WorkGroup because it was based largely on this posthoc analysis. Prospective randomized trials areneeded to conrm or refute these results andincrease condence in the data. This issue isespecially theDeutsche Diabetes Dialyse overall benet on primary out-come of major CVD events after initiating atorva-statin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetesreceiving hemodialysis therapy ( Fig 5 ). 100Based on results of the 4D, initiation of statin therapy is not recommended for people with type 2 diabe-tes on hemodialysis therapy who do not have aspecic cardiovascular indication for treatment. Ongoing studies evaluating lipid-lowering thera-pies for CVD risk reduction in people withdiabetes and CKD are critically important todene optimal treatment strategies. Consideringthe very different conclusions of the PPP and 4D,the window of opportunity for statin therapy toreduce CVD risk in patients with diabetes andCKD remains to be dened. Evaluation for Coronary Heart Disease Cardiac ischemia is a predominant form of CVD leading to major complications and deathin people with diabetes and CKD. A body ofresearch on evaluation for coronary heart diseasehas lead to evidence-based CPGs from majorprofessional societies. Coronary artery revascu-larization procedures are warranted in some pa-tients. To identify appropriate candidates, furtherdiagnostic testing should be performed based onspecic clinical indications ( Table 2 ). The recom- mendations from the ADA and AHA apply topeople with diabetes in general. 34,38No guide - lines have been developed for the subset ofpatients with diabetes and CKD. In the opinionof the Work Group, these recommendations rea-sonably can be extrapolated to most patients whohave both diabetes and CKD stages 1 to 4,Table 2. Diagnostic Testing for Coronary Heart Disease in Diabetes34,38 stnemmoC tseT noitacidnIProfessional Society Recommendation Typical or atypical chest discomfort Other symptoms that may suggest ischemia Unexplained dyspnea or fatigue Jaw, neck, arm, or shoulder discomfort Abnormal ECG result Exercise ECG Consider imaging modality for nondiagnostic ECG test result or with pharmacological stress test Nuclear perfusion scan Echocardiography Consider pharmacological stress testing for those unable to exercise Dobutamine Persantine Coronary angiography Clinically significant ischemia on noninvasive testing Diagnostic uncertainty on noninvasive testing Obtain cardiology consultation for pharmacological stress testing, imaging, or coronary angiography No guidelines have specifically addressed the subset of patients with diabetes and CKD ADA yes 34 AHA yes38 Consider screening for silent ischemia Patient > 35 years and sedentary with plans to begin a vigorous exercise program Carotid or lower-extremity atherosclerotic disease Same approach as above Controversial Data on improved clinical outcomes is lackingADA yes 34 AHA no38 Abbreviation: ECG, electrocardiogram. Background S29especially considering that their CVD risk is amplied over that of diabetes alone. The specic clinical indications for noninva- sive testing for coronary heart disease includetypical or atypical chest discomfort or othersymptoms of possible ischemia (eg, unexplaineddyspnea or fatigue or jaw, neck, arm, or shoulderdiscomfort). 34,38An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be included in the CVD risk assessment of all people with diabetes and repeated for anysymptoms suggestive of cardiac ischemia. If anECG result is abnormal, further diagnostic test-ing should be considered. Whether asymptom-atic people with diabetes should undergo diagnos-tic testing for coronary heart disease iscontroversial. At present, data that such an ap-proach improves prognosis beyond risk factorassessment and management are lacking. How-ever, patients with diabetes and silent ischemia,especially if accompanied by cardiac autonomicneuropathy, have a poor prognosis. Therefore,the ADA recommends that screening for silentischemia may be considered for certain high-riskcharacteristics: 35 years or older and sedentarywith plans to begin a vigorous exercise program,and carotid or lower-extremity atheroscleroticdisease. 34The presence of traditional CVD risk factors did not predict silent ischemia in the cross-sectional Detection of Ischemia in Asymp-tomatic Diabetics (DIAD) study. 101Therefore, the ADA no longer recommends screening of asymptomatic people with diabetes on the basisof risk factor clustering ( /H113502 risk factors). 34When the longitudinal component of DIAD is com- pleted, data will be available on the relationshipbetween abnormal cardiac nuclear perfusion im-aging results and clinical events. In the mean-time, the AHA does not endorse diagnostic test-ing for coronary heart disease in asymptomaticpatients with diabetes because of the lack ofevidence to support the benets of testing onclinical outcomes. 38 A noninvasive approach to diagnostic testing is preferred as the rst step in evaluating coro-nary heart disease. 34,38However, as discussed next, an initial invasive approach may be neces- sary in those with acute ischemic syndromes.According to the AHA and ADA, stress testingwith exercise ECG should be the initial noninva-sive strategy. 34,38Cardiology consultation should be obtained if evaluation beyond exercise ECGtesting is necessary. Those who have nondiagnos- tic exercise ECG test results may benet fromthe addition of an imaging modality (nuclearperfusion scan or echocardiography) to the exer-cise procedure. 38However, the NKF-KDOQI Guidelines for CVD in Dialysis Patients do not recommend exercise ECG testing because ofpoor exercise tolerance in general and a highprevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy in di-alysis patients. 10Many patients with advanced CKD are likely to be similarly affected. There- fore, for these patients or others who cannotexercise adequately, pharmacological stress test-ing (dobutamine or persantine) with imaging isindicated. 10,34,38Coronary may be performed if evidence for clinically signicant ischemic heart disease is detected or for diagnos-tic uncertainty. As detailed in Guideline 1, peoplewith diabetes and CKD are at high risk of acutekidney failure due to radiocontrast-induced ne-phropathy (RCN). Whenever possible, preven-tive strategies should be used to mitigate this risk(Guideline 1, Table 18 ). Nevertheless, consider- ing the extremely high CVD risk in patients withdiabetes and CKD, angiography should not beavoided if clinical indications for the invasiveassessment and/or treatment of ischemic heartdisease are present. Medical Management of Coronary Heart Disease RAS Inhibition. In people with diabetes and CKD, RAS inhibition is benecial for the man-agement of coronary heart disease and associatedcomplications, as well as for treatment of hyper-tension. ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce mortal-ity after acute myocardial infarction, 102,103and when used alone or in combination, these agents are equally benecial for improving survival andreducing CVD events after myocardial infarctioncomplicated by left ventricular dysfunction. 103 Patients with diabetes benet at least as much asthose without diabetes. 103Similarly, in people with diabetes with chronic coronary heart dis- ease and without left ventricular dysfunction,ACE inhibition reduces CVD death, myocardialinfarction, and stroke. 104,105Therefore, RAS in - hibition is recommended for treatment of acutemyocardial infarction and for chronic coronaryheart disease in patients with diabetes. 34,38,102 Recent post hoc analyses indicate that ACE inhi-Background S30bition is likely to be at least as efcacious at reducing CVD risk in people with and withoutdiabetes and CKD, as it is for others with coro-nary heart disease. 106,107As detailed in Guide - line 3, data regarding effects of ACE inhibitionfor treatment of hypertension on DKD progres-sion in type 2 diabetes are not as strong as in type1 diabetes. However, given their proven cardio-vascular benets and the shared properties ofACE inhibitors and ARBs in inhibiting the RAS,either type of agent should be strongly consid-ered for people with diabetes and CKD becausethey reduce the risk of both CVD events andprogression of kidney disease. /H9252-Blockers. /H9252-Blockers are peutic class with unique benets for CVD. Amongpeople with and without diabetes who have had amyocardial infarction, the American College ofCardiology (ACC)/AHA guidelines recommenduse of /H9252-blockers because they reduce the risk of death, reinfarction, and recurrent ischemia.102 /H9252-Blockers also are recommended by the AHA for the long-term treatment of patients with dia-betes and left ventricular dysfunction, but thebasis of this recommendation is not as rm as forACE inhibition. 38Although /H9252-blockers may mask symptoms of hypoglycemia or exacerbate glu- cose intolerance, these side effects usually are manageable. In addition, /H9252-blockers vary in their effects on glycemia. For example, the GlycemicEffects in Diabetes Mellitus: Carvedilol-Metopro-lol Comparison in Hypertensives (GEMINI) trialdemonstrated that in the presence of an ACEinhibitor or ARB, carvedilol stabilized glycemiccontrol and improved insulin resistance to agreater extent than metoprolol in patients withtype 2 diabetes and hypertension. 108Therefore, considering their substantial cardiovascular ben- ets, the AHA recommends that /H9252-blockers not be avoided in patients with diabetes for fear ofside effects. 38Based on their remarkably high CVD risk, the Work Group recommends that the ACC/AHA and AHA guidelines regarding use of /H9252-blockers also be applied to the subset of pa- tients with diabetes and CKD. Aspirin. Platelet inhibition with aspirin is strongly encouraged for the prevention and man-agement of ischemic heart disease in patientswith diabetes. 34,38In the opinion of the Work Group, people with diabetes who have CKDshould receive aspirin as part of a multifaceted approach to treatment, as outlined in CPR 2. Intensive Glycemic Control in Acute and Long-Term Care Settings. Glucose-insulin- potassium infusion (GIK) and intensive glyce-mic control are advocated for reducing mortalityrisk after acute myocardial infarction or withcritical illness (especially after cardiac surgery)in people with and without diabetes. 109,110Al- though the ACC/AHA and the ADA recommendnormalization (or nearly so) of blood glucoselevels within 24 to 48 hours after myocardialinfarction, more recent evidence does not substan-tiate this approach. 34,102Benets of GIK therapy were described in relatively small studies or in meta-analyses in which the reduction in mortal-ity risk had wide condence intervals (CIs),indicating uncertainty in the conclusions. 111Re- cently, the Clinical Trial of Reviparin and Meta-bolic Modulation Acute Myocardial InfarctionTreatment Evaluation (CREATE) and the Estu-dios Cardiologicas Latin America Study Group(ECLA) formally merged into a single trial,CREATE-ECLA, that randomly assigned morethan 20,000 patients with acute myocardial infarc-tion to receive GIK therapy or not. 112In this large trial, no benets on death or reinfarction rates were observed after 30 days in the group asa whole or in predened subgroups, includingthose with diabetes. Similarly, survival benetsof intensive insulin therapy in patients with criti-cal illness were not substantiated in patientsadmitted to a medical intensive care unit irrespec-tive of diabetes status, CVD, or kidney diseasediagnosis. 113Although a subgroup analysis of patients who remained in the intensive care unit more than 3 days suggested a survival benet,these patients could not be identied prospec-tively. Furthermore, in a larger follow-up after myocardial infarctionin patients with diabetes was not conrmed. 114 Hypoglycemia is a well-recognized complica- tion of GIK and intensive insulin therapy in theacute care setting. As discussed in Guideline 2,patients with CKD are at particularly high risk ofhypoglycemia and associated morbidities withintensive regimens for glycemic control. There-fore, the position of the Work Group is thatBackground S31current evidence does not support routine use of intensive glycemic control in acute care settings,including myocardial infarction, for patients withdiabetes and CKD. Whether long-term intensive control of glyce- mia reduces CVD risk has long been debated.Recent data from the Diabetes Control and Com-plications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Inter-ventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) Studyindicate reduced rates of death, myocardial infarc-tion, and stroke as many as 11 years after inten- sive management of type 1 diabetes has ceased(Fig 3 ). 115Reduction in these major adverse CVD events was mediated in part by reduction in incidence of DKD. In the UKPDS trial, intensiveglycemic control in general did not decrease therisk of myocardial infarction. However, in asubset of overweight patients received rate of myocardial infarction wasreduced. 116The Prospective Pioglitazone Clini - Figure 3. CVD outcomes by treatment assignment in DCCT/EDIC.(A) Cumulative incidence of therst of any of the predened CVDoutcomes. (B) First occurrence ofnonfatal myocardial infarction,stroke, or CVD. Com-pared with therisk S32cal Trial in (PROactive) suggested may reduce all-causemortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke inpatients with type 2 diabetes. 117In a post hoc analysis of people undergoing percutaneous cor- onary intervention (PCI) in the Prevention ofRestenosis with Tranilast and Its Outcomes(PRESTO) trial, metformin use was associatedwith reduced risk of myocardial infarction anddeath in people with type 2 diabetes. 118There - fore, emerging data indicate that intensive glyce-mic control reduces the risk of CVD events anddeath, but the benets appear to be primarily inlong-term, rather than acute, intensive glycemiamanagement. In type 2 diabetes, insulin-sensitiz-ing agents may be benecial for reducing CVDevent rates. Prospective controlled trials shouldbe conducted to conrm these observations. Im-portantly, caution is advised with use of met-formin in patients with CKD, as discussed inGuideline 2. Although studies regarding inten-sive glycemic control and CVD in people withdiabetes and CKD are nonexistent, the availabledata provide further support for the goal ofreaching an HbA 1clevel less than 7% or as close to normal as possible without excessive episodes of hypoglycemia. Reperfusion and Revascularization for Coronary Heart Disease Acute Ischemic Syndromes. In virtually all aspects, management of acute myocardial infarc-tion is similar for patients with and withoutdiabetes. 38Reperfusion therapies for acute ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction are founded on a strong evidence base and havebecome the standard of care because deaths andsubsequent major adverse cardiovascular eventsare reduced. 102Coronary artery reperfusion may be accomplished by using either PCI or brino- lytic therapy. Where acute PCI is readily avail-able with expert prompt intervention (within 90minutes of rst medical contact), this approachprovides superior results compared with brino-lysis. 102However, when acute PCI is not avail - able, brinolysis should be used as the initialtreatment strategy (within 12 hours of symptomonset) if contraindications do not exist (eg, his-tory of intracranial hemorrhage, closed orfacial IIb/IIIa ACE inhibition, are indicated, usually along withcoronary angiography and PCI. 119 Evidence to guide treatment of patients with CKD is sparse. Despite their high risk of deathand complications from myocardial infarction oracute coronary syndromes, those receive reperfusion or other recom-mended therapies. 120-123Suboptimal approaches to managing acute cardiac ischemic syndromes in the CKD population may result from fear ofsuch complications as acute kidney failure orbleeding, among others. However, when recom-mended therapies have been given to people withCKD, risk of death was decreased in observa-tional studies. 121-123Data for the subset of pa - tients with both diabetes and CKD do not exist.Clearly, this population should be included infuture clinical trials of treatment for acute car-diac ischemic syndromes to dene benets andrisks. In the meantime, the opinion of the WorkGroup is that the current standard of care formyocardial infarction and acute coronary syn-dromes, including PCI, brinolysis, antiplatelet strategies, and other recommended therapies,should be used in patients with diabetes andCKD unless specic contraindications exist. revascularization arecontroversial. Advances in this eld are evolvingso rapidly that technologies used in trials areoften considered outdated by the time the resultsare published. Data specically concerning peoplewith diabetes and CKD are lacking, but for thosewith either diabetes or CKD, coronary arterybypass surgery has been superior topercutaneous for mul-tiple-vessel disease. 38,124,125The NKF-KDOQI Guidelines for CVD in Dialysis Patients came to a similar conclusion based on retrospective andobservational data, while recommending re-search to include prospective controlled trials ofnewer stenting technologies. 97Much of the ben - et of coronary artery bypass surgery in diabetesor CKD stage 5 appears to be derived from use ofthe internal mammary artery. 38,97Background S33Studies of non-dialysis-dependent patients with CKD have been mostly observational co-hort studies in which PCI did not consistentlyinclude stenting. 124,125Since these studies were conducted, PCI approaches have progressed to almost routine use of coronary stents. In a recentsubgroup analysis of a prospective clinical trial,the Arterial Revascularization Therapies Study,patients with a calculated creatinine 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2had similar sur - vival free of death, myocardial infarction, orstroke whether they were randomly assigned toeither coronary artery bypass surgery or PCI withmultiple-vessel stenting. 126Only repeated revas - cularization was less frequent with coronary ar-tery bypass surgery. Most recently, drug-eluting stents containing sirolimus or paclitaxel were shown to largelyprevent restenosis, the most common reason forlong-term failure of bare metal stents. 126-128Al- though patients with diabetes have greater ratesof restenosis and major adverse cardiac eventsafter coronary artery stent placement, these com-plications were reduced markedly in the trials ofdrug-eluting stents. 127-129Addition of abciximab to stenting procedures in patients with diabetes also has been advocated to reduce restenosis, buthas not demonstrated a benet on clinical out-comes. 130Future studies using drug-eluting stents are likely to challenge the notion that coronary artery bypass surgery is the preferred method ofrevascularization in patients with diabetes. Although controlled trials of revascularization procedures are nonexistent for people with bothdiabetes and CKD, the excess cardiovascularrisk and deaths associated with diabetes afterPCI were driven predominantly by the subsetwith proteinuria in a large observational cohortstudy. 131This group of patients should be in - cluded in clinical trials of innovative revascular-ization technologies in the future. In the mean-time, the opinion of the Work Group is that eithercoronary artery bypass grafting or stenting (singleor multiple vessel) appear to be acceptable meth-ods of revascularization in people with diabetesand CKD. Decisions about revascularization pro-cedures should be based on individual patientcharacteristics, local expertise, and best judg-ment of the treating physicians.RISK FACTOR MANAGEMENT IN DIABETES AND CKD The Competing Risks Paradigm: CKD and CVD People with diabetes and CKD are at high risk to both lose kidney function and experiencemajor adverse cardiovascular events ( Fig 4 ). Treatment of risk factors reduces the likelihoodof these outcomes. Fortunately, treatment strate-gies for reducing kidney and cardiovascular risksare largely shared. The present CPGs and CPRsfor diabetes and CKD are consistent with thosealready established for the treatment of diabetesand CVD by the ADA and AHA. 34,38Goals of the management approaches recommended here are intended to mitigate the devastating conse-quences of the spectrum of vascular complica-tions, including kidney, heart, and others. New to the NKF-KDOQI Guidelines: Management of Hyperglycemia andGeneral Diabetes Care in CKD This is the rst guideline in the NKF- KDOQI series to address management of hy-perglycemia and general diabetes care in peoplewith CKD. The purpose of Guideline 2 is toreview the extensive literature regarding glyce-mic control and DKD, with an emphasis onbenets, as well as risks, of intensive treatmentof blood glucose, and to provide recommenda-tions for the care of people with diabetes compli-cated by kidney disease. Hyperglycemia, the dening feature of diabe- tes, is GFR Albuminuria DIABETES HTN, Age, Family HistoryCVD Events Intensive treatment of hyperglycemia preventsDKD and may slow progression of establishedkidney disease. An overall HbA 1cgoal of less than 7.0% for people with diabetes is supportedby substantial data from large prospective ran-domized studies of both type 1 and type 2 diabe-tes. Much of this support stems from benets forsome of the other major complications of diabe-tes, especially retinopathy. With respect to kid-ney outcomes, data are e2,Fig8 toFig11). and low GFR, are decreasedsignicantly with improved glycemic control,but much of this decrease is related to the smallernumber developing microalbuminuria to beginwith(Guidelin e2,Fig10toFig12). 116,133-141 Nonetheless, even for those with more advanceddisease, evidence supports reaching the recom-mended HbA 1ctarget. The ADA recommends an HbA1clevel less than 7.0% or as close to normal as possiblewithout excessive hypoglycemia. 34The major risk of attaining HbA1clevels less than 7.0% is the increasing development of hypoglycemia withlower glucose concentrations. For people with decreased kidney function (CKD stages 3 to 5),hypoglycemia is a major concern because ofimpaired clearance of insulin and some of theoral agents used to treat diabetes, as well asdiminished kidney gluconeogenesis. The amountof gluconeogenesis is decreased with reducedkidney mass. 142Reduction in gluconeogenesis may reduce the ability of a patient who is becom-ing hypoglycemic as the result of excessive insu-lin/oral agent dosage or lack of food intake todefend against hypoglycemia. Although this ef-fect is difcult to quantify, the kidney degradesabout a third of the insulin, leading to a pro-longed half-life when kidney function is re-duced. Patients with type 1 diabetes receivinginsulin who had signicant serum creatinine levelelevations (mean, 2.2 mg/dL) were reported 5-fold increase in the frequency of severehypoglycemia. 143,144Therefore, it is imperative that patients being treated intensively monitortheir glucose levels closely and reduce doses ofmedicines (insulin and oral agents) as needed toavoid hypoglycemia (Guideline 2, Table 22 and Table 23 ). A person with advanced CKD may no longer need to achieve good glycemic control to prevent deterioration in kidney function. However, inten-sive treatment of hyperglycemia may still pre-vent or slow the progression of retinopathy, neu-ropathy, and macrovascular disease. Survivalimproves with patientson peritoneal dialysis 145and hemodialysis therapy.146In the latter study, after adjustment for age and sex, HbA1clevel was a signicant predictor of survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13 per1.0% increment of HbA 1c; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.25, P/H110050.01). Data for monitoring glycemic control in people with diabetes and CKD essentially are absent.Therefore, in the opinion of the Work Group,assessment of glycemic control in diabetes andCKD should follow the general standards recom-mended by the ADA. 34In people receiving mul - tiple insulin injections, self-monitoring of bloodglucose (SMBG) is recommended 3 or moretimes daily (before meals and at bedtime). Inthose receiving less frequent insulin injections,oral agents, or medical nutrition therapy alone,SMBG is useful in achieving glycemic goals.Postprandial SMBG testing also may be helpful,particularly in patients gastroparesis, toachieve postprandial glucose goals. The optimalfrequency of SMBG has not been established inpatients with type 2 diabetes treated by oralagents, but the ADA recommends testing suf-ciently often to reach glycemic goals (Guideline2,Table 25 ). In addition, HbA 1clevel should be determined at least twice per year in stable pa-tients who are achieving glycemic goals andmore often, approximately every 3 months, inpatients whose therapy has changed or who arenot reaching goals. The Work Group emphasizes prevention and treatment of all diabetic complications in peoplewith diabetes and CKD. Assessment and manage-ment of CVD has been addressed in the preced-ing section. Management of retinopathy and footcare also is essential for optimal outcomes. In theabsence of specic data in the diabetes and CKDpopulation, the Work Group recommends follow-ing the standards set by the ADA. 34An ophthal - mologist or optometrist who is experienced inthe diagnosis and management of diabetic retinop-Background S35athy should perform a comprehensive dilated- eye examination annually in all people withdiabetes (Guideline 2, Table 26 ). Patients should be educated about the importance of foot surveil-lance and ulcer prevention with an emphasis onself-management, as discussed in CPR 4. Thefeet should be examined visually at each healthcare visit. A comprehensive foot examination,including visual inspection, Semmes-Weinsteinmonolament testing, and use of a 128-Hz tun-ing fork for testing of vibratory sensation, shouldbe performed annually. Because the risk of ulcersand amputations is increased in those with diabe-tes and CKD, referral to foot-care specialists forannual examinations and preventive care is en-couraged. Updates to the NKF-KDOQI Guidelines: Management of Hypertension,Dyslipidemia, and Nutrition Previous guidelines from the NKF-KDOQI series have addressed hypertension, dyslipide- mia, and nutrition in CKD.5,6,9The purpose of Guidelines 3, 4, and 5 is to focus on care ofpeople with both diabetes and CKD, summarizerapidly emerging literature in these elds, andtranslate the results into updated recommenda-tions for clinicians. Hypertension The natural history of DKD is characterized by hypertension, increasing albuminuria, and de- creasing GFR. In both types of diabetes, thenatural history is similar, with the exception thatonset of hypertension and vascular disease isearlier in the course of type 2 diabetes. 147,148 Hypertension is one of the most common comor-bidities in DKD (Guideline 3, Table 29 ). Because the studies cited in Guideline 3, Table 29 , were published before the Seventh Report of the JointNational Committee on Prevention, Detection,Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pres-sure (JNC 7), hypertension generally was de-ned as blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg. 149-153The JNC 7 denes hypertension in those with diabetes or CKD as blood pressuregreater than 130/80 mm Hg. 154Thus, the preva - lence estimates in Guideline 3, Table 29 , likely represent lower range values based on currentcriteria for hypertension in diabetes or CKD. Alarge number of epidemiological studies andcontrolled trials have dened as arisk factor for progression of DKD, and antihy-pertensive treatment reduces this risk (Guideline3,Fig 18 ). 5Studies of people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and CKD stages 1 to 4 were includedin the evidence review. Based on the availableevidence, the Work Group recommends a bloodpressure target of less than 130/80 mm Hg withACE inhibitors and ARBs as preferred agents,usually in combination with a diuretic, for thetreatment of hypertension in diabetes and CKD(Guideline 3, Table 27 ). Because diabetes is highly prevalent, individuals with other types ofCKD may have diabetes. The approach to antihy-pertensive treatment in DKD does not conflictwith that recommended for CKD in general. 34,154 The emphasis of the evidence review was on the effects of treating hypertension on kidneyoutcomes, although control of blood pressurealso is essential for reducing CVD risk. In peoplewith either type 1 or type 2 diabetes and mi-croalbuminuria, prevention of DKD progressionby treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs issupported by moderate evidence. 155-166For the purpose of the current guidelines, this evidencewas considered moderate rather than strong be-cause of insufcient data for outcomes other thanalbuminuria (ie, decrease in GFR, CKD stage 5,or mortality). The Work Group seriously deliber-ated about whether progression of albuminuria isan acceptable surrogate outcome for progressionof DKD. As detailed in CPR 1, they eventuallyconcluded that further study of this issue isnecessary to resolve the controversy. For thosewith hypertension and macroalbuminuria, evi-dence strongly supports use of ACE inhibitors intype 1 diabetes and ARBs in nofDKD(Guidelin e3,Fig13 9IntheviewoftheWorkGroup, the existing evidence has been influenced heavilyby the design of the studies, which used ACEinhibitors in type 1 diabetes and ARBs in type 2diabetes. Based on biological plausibility, simi-lar modes of action, and smaller studies, theWork Group considers these 2 classes of agentsessentially interchangeable and did not distin-guish between them in the guideline statement. To achieve target blood pressure, multiple antihypertensive agents usually are required(Guideline 3, Table 32 ). Therefore, most people with diabetes and CKD require medicines inBackground S36addition to RAS inhibitors for optimal control of hypertension. Diuretics are especially useful inthis population. /H9252-Blockers and calcium channel blockers also are effective therapies. Based on aseries of small studies and the Irbesartan Dia-betic Nephropathy Trial calcium chan-nel blockers of class mayworsen proteinuria and failed to improve clinicaloutcomes when used as primary antihyperten-sive therapy in DKD. 170,171Conversely, in the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) sub-group with type 2 diabetes and CKD (dened asGFR/H1102160 m 2), amlodipine was comparable to lisinopril or chlorthalidone for GFR decrease or onset of kidney failure wheneach agent was given separately. 172However, the lack of albuminuria/proteinuria data and rela- tively limited sample size in this substudy pre-clude rm conclusions. Based on numerous stud-ies of proteinuric kidney diseases (DKD andnon-DKD), 154it was the opinion of the Work Group that dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should not be used in the absence ofconcurrent RAS inhibition for DKD character-ized by microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria.However, dihydropyridine calcium channelblockers appear to be safe in such patients if theyalso use an ACE inhibitor or an ARB. 173 Dyslipidemia Dyslipidemia is common in people with diabe- tes and CKD. Modifying CVD risk by usinglipid-lowering agents is of asdiscussed (in Diabetes, CKD, and CVD). TheNKF-KDOQI CPGs for Managing Dyslipide- mia in CKD Patients were published recently, 6 and the CPGs for CVD in Dialysis Patientsadded new information about the management ofdyslipidemia in dialysis patients. 10Guideline 4 focuses specically on patients with diabetes and CKD stages 1 to 5. In general, the guidelines foruse of lipid-lowering agents in CKD stages 1 to 4due to diabetes and other causes do not con-flict, 174-177although there is no direct or indirect evidence for treating patients with CKD stage 4. The Work Group recommends that people with diabetes and CKD stages 1 to 4 be treated accord-ing to current guidelines for groups at high CVDrisk. 6,175Therefore, the target low-density li - poprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level should beless than 100 mg/dL, with less than 70 mg/dL asa therapeutic option (Guideline 4, Table 36 ). Lipid-lowering agents in the statin class are thepreferred drug therapies. However, treatment witha statin should not be initiated in patients withtype 2 diabetes on maintenance hemodialysistherapy who do not have a specic cardiovascu-lar indication for treatment because of negativeresults for CVD recently inthe 4D ( Fig 5 ). 100This nding represents an update from previous guidelines because 4D was the rst prospective randomized trial in hemodi-alysis patients with diabetes. 6,10,100Indirect evi - dence on the benecial effects of pravastatin indiabetes and CKD stages 1 to 3 from recent posthoc analyses of large multicenter trials also wasadded. 99Recommendations for treatment of dys - lipidemia in diabetes and CKD are based on A 92 85 631 252 873 515 916 nitatsavrot 91 15 631 252 383 235 636 obecalPFigure 5.

In the opinion ofthe Work Group, studies to determine effects ofstatins or other lipid-lowering agents on progres-sion of kidney disease are critically important tothe goal of optimizing care for people withdiabetes and CKD. Nutrition Management of diabetes and CKD should include nutritional intervention. Guideline 5 ad-dresses dietary strategies in people with diabetesand CKD stages 1 to 4. Dietary recommenda-tions for CKD stage 5 are provided in theKDOQI CPGs for Nutrition in Chronic RenalFailure. 9Nutritional management for people with diabetes has focused traditionally on blood glu- cose control. However, dietary modications mayreduce the progression of CKD, as well. Inparticular, dietary protein intake at all stages ofCKD appears to have an important impact in thepopulation with diabetes. When dietary protein islimited, adequate caloric intake must be main-tained by increasing calories from carbohydratesand/or fats. Competing needs for nutritional man-agement of hyperglycemia, hypertension, anddyslipidemia can make determination of appro-priate protein intake challenging. A dietary protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight per day (about 10% of total calories), therecommended daily allowance (RDA) for thismacronutrient, is a level that has been achievedin studies of nutritional intervention for diabetesand CKD. Nutrition surveys indicate that mostAmericans eat in excess of the RDA level. 178In 2 meta-analyses, low-protein diets reduced risks of progression GFR, with more pronounced benets inDKD than non-DKD (Guideline 5, Fig 21 ). 179,180 More recently, even a modest limitation of di- etary protein (0.89 versus 1.02 g/kg body weightper day) reduced the risk of CKD stage 5 ordeath (relative risk [RR], 0.23; 95% CI, 0.07 to0.72; P/H110050.04) in people with type 1 diabetes and stage 2 CKD (inferred based on levels ofalbuminuria and GFR; Guideline 5, Fig 22 ). 181 Benets of limiting dietary protein intake are more evident in type 1 than type 2 diabetes, butfewer studies have been done in the latter popula-tion. Based on the available evidence, the WorkGroup concluded that limiting dietary protein to the RDA level of 0.8 g/kg body weight per dayshould stabilize or reduce albuminuria, slow thedecrease in GFR, and may prevent CKD stage5. 179-186The current recommendation for dietary protein in diabetes and CKD stages 1 to 4 repre- sents an update to the diet recommended by theNKF-KDOQI CPGs for Hypertension and An-tihypertensive Agents in CKD (Guideline 5, Table 43). 5 At the other end of the spectrum, high-protein diets are a special concern in patients with diabe-tes because they may increase albuminuria andaccelerate loss of kidney function. Based on bothstudies of humans and experimental models,higher protein intake appears to produce moreprofound glomerular hyperltration and kidneydamage in diabetes. that higher proteinintake ( /H1135020% versus 10% of total daily calories) is associated with loss of kidney function inwomen with mildly decreased GFR (CKD stages1 to 2 inferred) and the development of mi-croalbuminuria in people with diabetes and hyper-tension. 197,198Therefore, in the opinion of the Work Group, people with diabetes and CKD should avoid high-protein diets ( /H1135020% of total daily calories). Some common fad diets thatrecommend high protein are Atkins \u00ae, Protein Power, the Zone, South Beach\u00ae, and Sugar Bust - ers\u00ae. In the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hyperten- sion (DASH) and DASH-Sodium diets, a rela-tively high protein intake (1.4 g/kg body weightper day, or about 18% of total calories) is recom-mended. 199Sources of protein in the DASH diets emphasize vegetables, low-fat or nonfat dairy products, whole grains, nuts, legumes, sh, andpoultry. Red meat is eaten in only small amounts.In recent studies of people with prehypertensionor untreated stage 1 hypertension, higher proteinintake from either soy or predominantly veg-etable sources decreased blood pressure in short-term (6 to 12 weeks) feeding studies. 200,201Along with the DASH trials, these data suggest that predominantly nonmeat protein may have a ben-ecial effect on blood pressure. Small studiessuggest that vegetable or soy protein sourcesmay be kidney sparing compared with red meatsources in diabetes and CKD. 182,202Further - more, the risk of losing kidney function in womenBackground S38with mildly decreased GFR in the Nurses Health Study was related primarily to animal meat in-take. 197,198Therefore, a DASH-type diet that emphasizes sources of protein other than red meat may be a reasonable alternative to a lowertotal protein intake in people with hypertension,diabetes, and CKD stages 1 to 2. New to NKF-KDOQI CPRs: How Should Albuminuria Be Managed in Normotensive Patients With Diabetes? Increased levels of urinary albumin excretion predict increased risk of kidney and CVD out-comes in diabetes, as reviewed extensively inGuideline 1 and the preceding section, Diabetes,CKD, and CVD. Albuminuria is believed to reflectendothelial injury that extends from the glomerulusto the arterial circulation at large, thus linking thismarker to both kidney disease and CVD. Theconcept that treatments aimed at decreasing albu-minuria may improve clinical outcomes has been asubject of great interest and debate. CPR 1 addresses the evidence for treatment of normotensive patients who have diabetes andelevated albuminuria with RAS inhibitors. Rela-tively few studies of these antihypertensive agentshave recruited normotensive patients. In a studyof type 1 diabetes with macroalbuminuria, ACEinhibitors decreased albuminuria and reducedthe risk of clinical outcomes (doubling of serumcreatinine level, CKD stage 5, or death) regard-less of the presence or absence of hyperten-sion. 168A quarter of the participants in this study were normotensive. There was no signicant difference in the treatment effect between normo-tensive and hypertensive individuals. In type 2diabetes with macroalbuminuria, ARB treatmentalso reduced the risk of clinical outcomes in 2separate studies. 167,169However, these studies had very few participants with normal blood pressure. Treatment of microalbuminuria by ACEinhibition in normotensive people with type 1diabetes reduces the level of albuminuria andprevent progression to macroalbuminuria in ameta-analysis. 203A small study of normotensive patients with type 1 diabetes showed that ACE inhibition prevented new-onset microalbumin-uria. 204Several studies have evaluated ACE inhi - bition people with type 2 microalbuminuria. 104,205-207All studiesdemonstrated decreased progression to mac- roalbuminuria and/or reduced levels of albumin-uria. In the opinion of the Work Group, change in level of albuminuria or transition between catego-ries (normoalbuminuria, microalbuminuria, ormacroalbuminuria) in normotensive people withdiabetes is relatively weak evidence for changein status or prognosis of kidney disease. Therationale for this opinion is as follows. First,level of albuminuria or crossing an albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) threshold is not a clinicalend point. Second, RAS inhibitors might maskthe progression of DKD marked by albuminuria.In type 1 diabetes, withdrawal of ACE inhibitioncaused a rapid increase in albuminuria, 208and in type 2 diabetes, discontinuation of irbesartan in the Irbesartan in Patients With Type 2 Diabetesand Microalbuminuria (IRMA-2) Study prompteda rapid return to pretreatment levels of albumin-uria in patients receiving the lower dose of irbe-sartan and a partial return to pretreatment levelsin those receiving the higher dose of irbesar-tan. 209Third, few normotensive patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria or macroalbumin- uria have been enrolled in clinical trials of treat-ments for kidney disease. The demonstrated ben-ets of RAS inhibitors for reducing andstabilizing albuminuria were noted; however, inthe absence of studies with clinical end points,the Work Group found this evidence insufcientto justify a higher evidence rating. Despite these concerns, the consensus of the Work Group was that the benet of ACE inhibi-tors and ARBs for reducing albuminuria anddelaying kidney disease progression are likely tobe similar among most people with diabetes andmicroalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria regard-less of their blood pressure level. Therefore, CPR1 recommends treatment with RAS inhibition fornormotensive patients with diabetes and mi-croalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria. The WorkGroup encourages further research to determineeffects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs on albumin-uria and clinical outcomes in normotensive peoplewith DKD. Is Albuminuria an Acceptable Surrogate Marker for Progression of DKD? CPR 1 addresses whether changes in albumin- uria are sufcient to predict clinical outcomes inBackground S39DKD. Studies testing the hypothesis that albumin- uria reduction predicts improved prognosis inDKD have been performed only as secondaryanalyses of studies of ARB treatment in peo-ple with type 2 diabetes and macroalbumin-uria. 210-212In these studies, level of albuminuria reduction was a marker of decreased risk ofadverse outcomes. Observational analyses fromthe Reduction of Endpoints (RENAAL)trial found that the magnitude of kidney end points(CPR 1, Fig 25 ). 210These ndings raise the hypothesis that albuminuria reduction per se hasbenecial effects. However, an alternative possi-bility is that albuminuria reduction is a markerfor patients with less severe kidney and vasculardisease. A strategy of targeting treatment of albu-minuria, in addition to blood pressure and otherrisk factors, has not been tested prospectively inpatients with diabetes. Furthermore, to date, onlythese secondary analyses from the RENAALtrial and IDNT have directly correlated albumin-uria/proteinuria reduction with clinical benet. In the opinion of the Work Group, there cur- rently is insufcient evidence to assume thatlowering albuminuria levels will necessarily leadto improvements in such clinical outcomes asprogression to CKD stage 5, CVD events, ordeath. Conversely, the failure to reduce albumin-uria does not preclude a benecial clinical effecton DKD from a potential intervention. There-fore, to be considered efcacious, potential treat-ments for DKD must demonstrate benets notonly on albuminuria reduction, but also on suchclinical end points as CKD stage 5, CVD events,or death. 213Nevertheless, the emerging data gen - erate a strong hypothesis that should be tested inprospective controlled studies\u2014namely, do treat-ments (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or others) thatdecrease albuminuria result in improved CKDand CVD outcomes in people with diabetes? The Value of Multifaceted Intervention Although these and other guidelines present recommendations for management of risk fac-tors separately, in reality, multiple risk factors are managed concurrently in patients with diabetesand CKD. In addition, considering the burgeon-ing epidemic of obesity and its role in producingdiabetes and, possibly, kidney disease, the impor-tance of weight control should be considered inthe care of patients with diabetes and CKD. CPR2 was developed to address these issues andencourage further investigation. In the Steno Study, a multifaceted approach aimed at optimal management for a group of riskfactors was evaluated in patients with type 2diabetes and microalbuminuria. 45,46The interven - tion had multiple forhyperglycemia, (emphasizing a vitamin/mineral supplement (CPR2,Table 1 ). This intensive intervention was com- pared with usual care. A mean decrease in albu-minuria (albumin decreased 20 mg/24 h) wasobserved in the intensive-intervention group,whereas a mean increase occurred in patients inthe usual-care group (albumin increased 30 mg/24h). Albuminuria progression and the compositeoutcome of CVD events or death were decreasedin the group treated intensively (CPR 2, Fig 26 ). However, which facets of the intervention areassociated with reduced risk is uncertain. Further-more, because the intensive intervention in-creased use of RAS inhibitors, the contributionof other treatments is unclear. Despite theselimitations, the Work Group recognizes the impor-tance of addressing multiple risk factors in anintegrated fashion. The incremental effects of amultifaceted approach appear to add up to sub-stantial clinical benets. Obesity now is recognized as a risk factor for diabetes, hypertension, CVD, and possibly CKD.Recent estimates from NHANES report that 31%of US population is obese (BMI /H1102230 kg/ m 2).214A growing body of evidence indicates that obesity is linked to CKD.215-221Whether this link is independent of diabetes, hyperten-sion, or perhaps other risk factors is not yet clear.Nevertheless, obesity is associated with the devel-opment of proteinuria and loss of kidney func-tion. Metabolic syndrome risk factors, as well asadipose-derived factors, may lead to kidney dam-age. Maintaining a normal weight (BMI, 18.5 to24.9 kg/m 2) improves risk factors and may de -Background S40crease the development or progression of CKD. The Work Group recommends that weight lossbe achieved by a balanced reduction in caloricintake, rather than by diets that derive excesscalories ( /H1102220%) from animal protein (Guideline 2). Regular physical exercise also is encouragedto assist in achieving and maintaining a normalweight. Lifestyle and Behavioral Management Strategies for behavioral change and self- management of risk factors are addressed in CPR4. Because of the paucity of data in the diabetesand CKD population, these recommendationswere extrapolated from data in other groups andthus are included in the CPR section. A proposedapproach to a diabetes and CKD self-manage-ment program is provided in CPR 4, Table 56 . At the core of the diabetes epidemic and its consequent complications is a fundamental shiftin lifestyle. In a relatively short time span, vigor- ous physical activity and limited calories havebeen replaced by sedentary behavior and a seem-ingly endless array of calorie-dense foods thatare cheap and easily obtained. Thus, major chal-lenges of the present century are the dual prob-lems of overfeeding and obesity. Optimal man-agement of risk factors, including hypertension,diabetes, and dyslipidemia, is emphasized inthese guidelines. However, this emphasis isdirected too often toward drug therapies with-out enough attention to key lifestyle issues. Inthe view of the Work Group, addressing life-style through behavioral change is criticallyimportant for success in reducing the devastat-ing impact of diabetes and CKD. The WorkGroup considers investigation in this area ofparticular importance to successfully translateadvances in knowledge to improvements inquality of life and health. Background S41GUIDELINE 1: SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETIC KIDNEY DISEASE CKD in patients with diabetes may or may not represent DKD. In the absence of anestablished diagnosis, the evaluation of pa-tients with diabetes and kidney disease shouldinclude investigation into the underlyingcause(s). 1.1 Patients with diabetes should be screened annually for DKD. Initial screening shouldcommence: 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes; (A) or From diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. (B) 1.1.1 Screening should include: Measurements of urinary ACR in a spot urine sample; (B) Measurement of serum creati- nine and estimation of GFR.(B) 1.2 An elevated ACR should be conrmed in the absence of urinary tract infectionwith 2 additional rst-void specimenscollected during the next 3 to 6 months.(B)Microalbuminuria is as an ACR dened as an ACR>300 mg/g. 2 of 3 samples should fall within the microalbuminuric or macroalbumin-uric range to conrm classication. 1.3 In most patients with diabetes, CKD should be attributable to diabetes if:Macroalbuminuria is present; (B) or Microalbuminuria is present /H18537in the presence of diabetic retinopa- thy, (B)/H18537in type 1 diabetes of at least 10 years' duration. (A) 1.4 Other cause(s) of CKD should be consid- ered in the presence of any of the follow-ing circumstances: (B)Absence of diabetic retinopathy; Low or rapidly increasing proteinuria or phrotic syndrome; Refractory hypertension; Presence of active urinary sediment; Signs or symptoms of other systemic disease; or >30% reduction in GFR within 2-3 months after initiation of an ACEinhibitor or ARB. BACKGROUND DKD, traditionally termed \"diabetic nephrop- athy,\" is a clinical diagnosis that historically hasbeen based on the nding of proteinuria in aperson with diabetes. This denition is indepen-dent of such markers of CKD as pathologicalchange or a decreased GFR, and it initially wasconned to those now considered to have mac-roalbuminuria. The development of more sensi-tive assays specic for albumin has since led tothe smaller increases, now termedmicroalbuminuria or \"incipient nephropathy.\" Thelower limit of microalbuminuria albumin excretion rate (AER) of20 /H9262g/min, which is equivalent to 30 mg/24 h or an ACR of 30 mg/g ( Table 3 ).222These deni - tions have had some clinical utility in that indi-viduals with macroalbuminuria historically had aprogressive decrease in GFR associated with anincrease in systemic blood pressure, whereasthose with microalbuminuria were considered to Table 3. Denitions of Abnormalities in Albumin Excretion Category Spot Collection excretion, at least 2 specimens, preferably first morning void, collected within a 3 - to 6-month period should be abnormal before considering a patient to have crossed 1 of thes e diagnostic thresholds. Exercise within 24 hours, infection, fe ver, congestive heart failure, marked hyperglycemia, pregnancy, marked hypertension, urinary tract infection, and hematuria may increase urinary albumin over baseline values. American Journal of Kidney Diseases, Vol 49, No 2, Suppl 2 (February), 2007: pp S42-S61 S42have stable kidney function, yet were at high risk of subsequent development of macroalbuminuriaand kidney failure. 223 More recent information has led to a reevalua- tion of some of these concepts.224-226The nd - ing that a substantial proportion of patients withtype 1 and type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuriaspontaneously regress to normoalbuminuria callsinto question the inevitability of Tables 4 and5). 224,226,227The sub - stantial variability in the severity of underlyingpathology in type 1 diabetes 228,229and the heter - ogeneous nature of pathology in type 2 diabe-tes 230suggests that microalbuminuria may or may not reflect underlying DKD. Given the strongly positive relationship between the dura-tion of diabetes and DKD, particularly in type 1diabetes, 231the presence of elevated albuminuria in diabetes of short duration should raise con- cerns about non-DKD. Furthermore, althoughantihypertensive therapy reduces albuminuria,there is little evidence that it affects the underly-ing pathology, and short-term withdrawal of anti-hypertensive medicines can result in increases inalbuminuria to pretreatment levels. 208Finally, the situation is complicated by the increasing use of microalbuminuria as a marker/predictor ofCVD in people with and without diabetes. Allthese factors imply that the underlying mecha-nisms of albuminuria are multiple, not entirelypathology dependent, and do not t neatly intodenitions of CKD. Thus, any denition of DKDhas to take all these factors into account. Most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screen-ing for microalbuminuria in patients with diabe-tes. 34,35These recommendations have been made although there are no conclusive data that early intervention and treatment of microalbuminuriaprevents CKD stage 5 or mortality in such pa-tients. RATIONALE Denitions Denitions of DKD by albuminuria and stage are shown in Table 6 . For this guideline, we included studies of people with type 1 or type 2diabetes and CKD stages 1 to 5 regardless ofwhether kidney biopsies were performed. Stud-ies of kidney transplant recipients were ex-cluded. Because of the high prevalence of diabe- tes in the population, many individuals withother types of CKD also may have diabetes.Accordingly, the term DKD refers to a presump-tive diagnosis of kidney disease caused by diabe-tes. The term diabetic glomerulopathy should bereserved for biopsy-proven kidney disease causedby diabetes. Microalbuminuria and estimation of GFR satisfy criteria for a screening test for DKD.(Moderate) Microalbuminuria is an independent risk fac- tor for the development of CKD 41,232and GFR loss223,233and for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.234,235It is relatively common, and in studies using the cutoff points recommended in this guideline, the point prevalence of microalbu-minuria varies (depending on the population)from 7% to 22% in type 1 236-238and from 42% in type 2134,239-241diabetes. Annual of microalbuminuria of 1% to 2% arereported consistently for both type 1 and type 2diabetes. Tests for microalbuminuria are widely avail- able, relatively inexpensive, and easy to perform. Because variations in urinary concentrationcaused by hydration status may adversely affectthe interpretation of tests of albumin concentra-tion alone and timed collections are inconvenientand prone to inaccuracy, the Work Group recom-mends estimating the ACR in a spot urine sample(preferably the rst morning void). 242 The sensitivity and specicity of ACR esti- mates are greater than 85% compared with timedurine collections. 242Some reported variation is dependent upon the method of albumin and cre- atinine measurement. Moreover, there is continu-ing debate around the effect of gender on thedenition of normal values. Because womennormally have lower urinary creatinine concen-trations than men, their ACR are higherfor the same level of urinary albumin excretion.Accordingly, some investigators have recom-mended lower ACR cutoff values for normoalbu-minuria in men than women. Whether sex-specic cutoff values improve accuracy isunknown and requires further study. Neverthe-less, because anintraindividual CV of Diagnosis of Diabetic Kidney Disease S43Table 4.

Although microalbuminuria satises nearly all criteria for a screening test, it does not satisfy thecriterion of providing proven clinical benetsbecause the impact of microalbuminuria detec-tion on such hard clinical end points as loss, or CVD microalbuminuria based onthe treatment possibilities discussed in CPR 1.The Work Group supports these screening recom-mendations while recognizing the need for fur-ther studies to dene the impact of microalbumin-uria detection on hard clinical end points. Thesuggested screening plan, adapted from the ADAguideline, is shown in Fig 6 . 34,35 The evidence for the usefulness of eGFR alone as a screening test for CKD in diabetes is lesssecure. Many patients with diabetes and CKDmay have elevated or high-normal GFRs, particu-larly in the early years after diagnosis. The sameis true for all types of CKD. Whether values ofGFR greater than 90 mL/min reflect progressiveCKD may be determined best by the slope ofsequential GFR estimates, rather than a singleestimate. Therefore, markers of kidney damageare required to detect early stages of CKD; eGFRalone can detect only CKD stage 3 or worse.Although eGFR is recommended to classify pa-tients with diabetes into stages of CKD ( Table 6 ), some potential problems exist with the currentlyavailable estimating equations. The Modicationof Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation,presently the most widely used estimating equa-tion for staging CKD, has been validated in onlysmall numbers of patients with diabetes andCKD, 243and other equations may provide better estimates of GFR in these patients.244An NIH- sponsored study currently is ongoing with thepurpose of developing a new equation derivedfrom multiple databases along with extensivecalibration studies to ensure generalizabilitythroughout the entire range of GFRs. Despite their value in the vast majority of patients, currently recommended screening testsare not sufcient to identify all cases of DKDbecause serious diabetic glomerular lesions mayoccur in normoalbuminuric patients with normalGFR. 228Normoalbuminuric patients with de - creased GFR have even more severe glomerularchanges. 245,246Therefore, further evaluation, in - cluding consideration of kidney biopsy, may berequired in some cases to establish the diagnosisof DKD. Screening for kidney disease should begin 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1diabetes and at the diagnosis of type 2diabetes. (Moderate/Strong) Although transient increases in albuminuria in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes are well de-scribed, it is thought that this increase representsacute metabolic perturbations and the level ofalbuminuria usually reverts to normal after glyce-mic correction. Most longitudinal cohorts reportsignicant increases in microalbuminuria preva-lence only after 5 years' duration, although 1cross-sectional study described a signicantprevalence of around 15% in patients with 1 to 5years of diabetes. 236Conversely, the UKPDS found a urinary albumin concentration greaterTable 6. Likelihood of DKD According to Staging by GFR and Level of Albuminuria a i r u n i m u b A GFR (mL/min) CKD Stage* Normoalbuminuria 3 Unlikely DKD Possible DKD DKD *Staging may be confounded by treatment because RAS blockade could render microalbuminuric patients normoalbuminuric and macroa lbuminuric patients microalbuminuric. Thus, although staging is done according to the current level of albuminuria for practical reasons, the impli cation of the staging undoubtedly is affected by past history. Therefore, when available, data before the initiation of therapy should be considered for classificat ion purposes. Because patients with diabetes often have elevated GFR in the ea rly years after diagnosis, GFR less than 90 mL/min may represen t a significant loss of function. Kidney biopsy in these patients can show histological evid ence of DKD. Patients with diabetes at increased risk of DK D include those with poor glycemic control, longer duration, hypertension, retinopathy, high -normal albuminuria, nonwhite race, and family history of hyp ertension, CVD, type 2 diabetes, and DKD. Reduction in GFR in patients with diabetes and normoalbuminuria is well described in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes; kidney bi opsy in such patients often shows evidence of diabetic glomerulopathy. However, in the absence of histological evidence, these patients should be considere d to have diabetes and CKD, which may require further investigation based on the criteria described in this guideline.

However, the nega-tive predictive value had sensitivities of 100% and specicities of46% to 62%. Thus, the presence of retinopathy inpatients with type 2 diabetes and macroalbumin-uria is strongly suggestive of DKD, and itsabsence in microalbuminuria suggests non-DKDs. Only a small number of patients in theseseries were found to have non-DKD amenable toa specic therapy, and most of those individualshad other clinical features, such as nephroticsyndrome or nondiabetic systemic illness. Duration of diabetes is related closely to the prevalence of DKD in type 1 patients. Preva-lence rates of microalbuminuria and macroalbu-minuria increase after 10 years, presumablyreflecting cumulative glycemic exposure (seeGuideline 2). Patients with type 1 diabetes,microalbuminuria, shorter diabetes duration,lower AER levels, better glycemic control, andlower blood pressure and plasma lipid concen-trations are more likely to reverse to nor-moalbuminuria. 226,263,264The contribution of the prepubertal years of diabetes to DKD riskmay be lower than that of postpubertal years,but this remains controversial. 265-270However, there are few good data on comparative levelsof glycemic control in young children, makingit difcult to control for this variable. Therealso may be a nonlinearity of risk of pathologi-cal damage before achievement of full growth,but this risk may be duration dependent, ratherthan puberty dependent. 271Moreover, postural proteinuria may be more common during ado- Figure 6.

For theseand other reasons, it would be incorrect in theview of the Work Group to regard the prepuber-tal period as risk free for the development ofDKD. This topic needs additional research.Because of the clinical difculty accuratelydetermining the onset of type 2 diabetes, knownduration is less strongly related to DKD. InPima Indians, the duration of type 2 diabetes isknown with greater accuracy and precisionbecause of systematic screening for diabetes,and in this population, the duration of diabetesis as strongly related to DKD as in type 1diabetes. 272 Several small series of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes describe cases of typicaldiabetic glomerulopathy with normoalbumin-uria and normal or decreased GFR. These databring into question the reliance on increasedAER alone or in combination with GFR fordiagnosis of DKD. Most of these patients werewomen, had relatively long durations of diabe-tes, and usually had retinopathy and/or hyper-tension. 245,246,273Atypical clinical features should prompt evaluation for non-DKD. People withdiabetes and CKD may have increased risksof testing and treatments. (Moderate) Because diabetes is a common condition, coin- cidence with other nondiabetic CKD is relativelyfrequent. Accordingly, evaluation of a personwith atypical features should include additionaldiagnostic testing in selected cases, dependingon the clinical presentation. For example, be-cause generalized vascular disease is common indiabetes, refractory hypertension and/or a signi-cant decrease in kidney function after RAS block-ade should prompt consideration of renal arterystenosis. Rapidly decreasing kidney functionand/or increasing proteinuria (particularly if ne-phrotic), active urinary sediment, or evidence ofother systemic disease should raise concernsabout nondiabetic glomerular disease. Diagnosisof these diseases may require invasive testing orinterventional procedures. Care should be usedin determining the appropriate diagnostic testsbecause administration of radiographic contrast,with or without angiography, may pose greaterrisks in people with diabetes and CKD than inother people. It is the opinion of the Work Group that in the absence of another identiable and treatable causeof kidney disease, patients with diabetes andCKD should be treated as if they have DKD. A kidney biopsy may be required in some patients with diabetes and CKD todetermine the underlying cause of thekidney disease. (Moderate) The risk of complications associated with per- cutaneous native kidney biopsy in patients withDKD is no greater than the risk faced by patientswith most other causes of CKD. 274,275The major - ity of complications are from bleeding and in-clude microscopic hematuria, decrease in hemo-globin level, gross hematuria, perinephrichematomas, and arteriovenous stulae. 276,277 Women are more likely to bleed than men, andother commonly identied risk factors for bleed-ing include younger age, decreased GFR, el-evated systolic and pressure, andprolonged bleeding and thromboplastintimes. 274,276,278,279The number of needle passes during kidney biopsy also increases the risk of bleeding, particularly if the number exceeds 4276 Figure 7.

Guidelines for Diabetes and CKD S56tions, several strategies have been developed that may reduce RCN risk in people with diabetesand CKD, as well as other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, aminoglycosides, administering the radiographic contrastagent. 295Second, intravenous fluids should be administered, but caution should be used in deter- mining the amount of fluid to avoid fluid over-load. Most studies evaluated 0.45% sodium chlo-ride at a dose of 1 mL/kg/h over 6 to 12 hours,but they did not include patients with advancedCKD. 296A recent study suggested that 0.9% sodium chloride may be better than 0.45% so- dium chloride for preventing RCN.298Third, a greater volume of contrast is associated with an increased risk of RCN. In the general population,administration of more than 100 mL of hyperos-molar radiographic contrast increases the risk ofRCN, but in those with diabetes and an eGFRless than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, as little as 30 mL of radiographic contrast agent can lead to acute kidney failure.298Hence, the use of radio - graphic contrast material should be kept to theminimum amount necessary for the evaluationrequired. 297Fourth, the type of contrast mate - rial affects the risk of RCN. Nonionic radio-graphic contrast material may confer a lowerrisk of RCN than ionic contrast material. 287 Moreover, controlled trial re-ported iso-osmolar andCKD. 288Fifth, because lactic acidosis may occur with RCN in patients with diabetes re- ceiving metformin, this medicine should bewithheld for 48 hours before infusion of con-trast medium and after exposure, until theestimate or measure of GFR is greater than 40mL/min/1.73 m 2.299Use of metformin is notTable 14.

Screening and Diagnosis of Diabetic Kidney Disease S59recommended in patients with diabetes and CKD (see Guideline 2). Although there is much interest in nding medicines to prevent RCN, few are known to bebenecial and none has been studied in a largepopulation of patients with diabetes and CKD.Table 18 summarizes the clinical trials that re- port results in patients with diabetes and CKD.Studies examining the effectiveness of N-acetyl- cysteine, sodium bicarbonate, and hemoltrationhave not specically reported results for patientswith diabetes and CKD. Nevertheless, in theopinion of the Work Group, it is reasonable toconsider these approaches for people with diabe-tes and CKD, considering their high risk of RCN(Table 18 ). 295,300-302 The European Society of College of Radiology (www.acr.org/s_acr/sec.asp?CID /H110052131&DID /H1100516687 ; last accessed January 31, 2006) offer guidelines for use of contrast media. Theseguidelines and results of a number of clinicaltrials are described in a recent review of methodsfor preventing RCN. The American guidelinesmention the use of N-acetylcysteine and other potential prophylactic drug therapies withoutspecically recommending these approaches. LIMITATIONS No data are available to conrm that detection of microalbuminuria and initiation of treatmentat this early stage of DKD leads to a decrease inhard end points (GFR decrease, CKD stage 5,and mortality). Furthermore, the predictive valueof microalbuminuria for DKD is not as high asoriginally considered. Whether the lower predic-tive value is due to changes in disease natural history, improved therapies, or overestimation bythe original studies is uncertain. 224However, as many as 30% to 50% of microalbuminuric patients may revert to normoalbumin-uria, 224,226,263,264and whether this regression is spontaneous or not cannot be determined if the patient is on ACE inhibitor or ARB treatment.Nevertheless, some data suggest benet of inten-sive glycemic and blood pressure control inpatients with microalbuminuria. A detailed discus-sion of treatment of albuminuria (microalbumin-uria and macroalbuminuria) and evaluation ofoutcomes can be found in CPR 1. The current recommendations for microalbu- minuria screening by the ADA 34,35do not speci - cally recommend use of a rst morning urinesample or overnight collections. However, pos-tural microalbuminuria or proteinuria may be aconfounding factor, particularly in young type 1patients. Despite these limitations, it is clear thatpatients who are persistently normoalbuminurictend to be at low risk of DKD, whereas microalbu-minuric patients have a 3- to 4-fold increasedrisk. For classication purposes, the Work Grouprecommends that health care providers consideras macroalbuminuric all patients who have beendiagnosed as such before ACE-inhibitor and/orARB treatment. Another limitation of this guideline relates to the classic denition of DKD according to AER,which has been used in the vast majority oftreatment trials (see CPR 1). AER does not mapeasily to the KDOQI stages of CKD ( Table 6 ) because staging is based on eGFR. Thus, whileGFR may be elevated or within the normal rangeTable 18. Preventive Strategies for RCN Stop drugs that increase risk of RCN or lactic acidosis 48 h before Amphotericin 1 mL/kg/h for 6-12 h before the radiographic contrast procedure Use 0.9% normal saline or sodium bicarbonate, 154 mEq/L295,296,298 Watch for volume overload in those with CKD stage 4 or congestive heart failure N-Acetylcysteine, 600 mg, orally twice daily the day before and day of radiographic contrast procedure299,302 Minimize radiographic contrast volume297 <30 or material288,290 Consider hemofiltration level > 2 mg/dL301 *Withhold metformin until the measure or estima te of GFR is greater than 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 to reduce risk of lactic acidosis.299Guidelines for Diabetes CKD S60in from serum creatinine values problem-atic in their application to patients with diabe-tes. 244Nonetheless, measures of albuminuria in combination with estimates of GFR will serve as useful guides in assessing and managing patientswith diabetes and CKD. The Work Group devel-oped a novel grid ( Table 6 ) to combine staging by albuminuria classication GFR, althoughat this time, evidence to dene DKD probabili-ties within each box of this table is lacking. IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES The diagnosis and staging of DKD in an individual patient should include an evaluationof other related factors. Apart from albuminuriaand GFR, patients should be evaluated for thepresence of hypertension, poor glycemic control,dyslipidemia, and smoking. A family history ofDKD or hypertension and/or CVD and stroke inparents without diabetes also is relevant. More-over, in patients developing DKD, hypertensionand dyslipidemia may be risk predictors, con-comitants, or consequences. Because DKD typi-cally does not occur in isolation, patients withDKD should have regular surveillance for othermicrovascular and macrovascular complications.These issues are covered in more detail else- where in these guidelines under the sectionsrelating to background, blood pressure control,glycemic control, lipid management, lifestyle issues, and multifactorial intervention. Ideally, ACR should be measured in rst-void urine samples, but sometimes this may be imprac-tical. Alternatively, if a random urine specimen isabnormal, the second test could be done in arst-voided morning sample obtained within thesubsequent 3 to 6 months. Screening for mi-croalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes,if leading to multifactorial interventions, canresult in reduced risks of cardiovascular events,progression of albuminuria, and development orprogression of retinopathy and neuropathy. 303 Similar studies in patients with type 1 diabetesare lacking. Several cost-benet analyses ofscreening for microalbuminuria have been pub-lished using various models. These models refermostly to type 1 diabetes and have not beenconrmed prospectively in clinical trials.

Intensive treatment of hyperglycemia prevents DKD and may slow the progression of established kidney disease. 2.1 Target HbA1cfor people with diabetes should be < 7.0%, irrespective of the presence or absence of (urinary albumin excretion be-tween 30 and 300 30 and 300 mg/gcreatinine), progression to macroalbuminuria(/H11022300 mg/24 h or /H11022300 mg/g creatinine), and change in kidney function. Very few studiesaddressed the benets and risks of intensiveglycemic control in later stages of CKD, letalone in patients who are undergoing dialysis orhave received kidney transplants. Lowering HbA 1clevels to approximately 7.0% reduces the development ofmicroalbuminuria. (Strong) Type 1 Diabetes ( Table 19 ) A number of observational studies have shown that poorer glycemic control predicts the develop-ment of microalbuminuria. 353-359Several small prospective intervention studies from the early1980s also showed that improved glycemic con- trol reduced the development and progression ofelevated albuminuria; however, in most cases,the small sizes of the cohorts precluded statisti-cally signicant changes. 360-366A meta-analysis of these studies concluded that intensive therapy signicantly reduced the risk of nephropathyprogression center randomized clinical trial of 1,441 subjectswith type 1 diabetes that compared the effects ofintensive glucose control with conventional treat-ment on the development and progression of thelong-term complications of type 1 diabetes. 132At baseline, mean HbA1clevels were similar in both treatment groups. By 3 months after randomiza-tion, mean HbA 1clevel was approximately 2% lower in the intensive-treatment group than theconventional-treatment group, and this differ-ence was maintained throughout the study (7.2%versus 9.1%; P/H110210.001). 132After a mean of 6.5 years, intensive the occurrenceof microalbuminuria by 34% (95% CI, to 58%) in thesecondary-intervention group, who had earlycomplications at baseline (background retinopa-thy with or without microalbuminuria, but nor-mal GFR; Fig 8 ). 132,368To assess whether their reduced risk of DKD persisted long term, 1,349of these subjects were evaluated as part of theEDIC study at the year 7 to 8 post-DCCT visit. 133 Data were analyzed according to the originalintensive- versus conventional-treatment groups,and the primary-prevention and secondary-intervention cohorts were combined. The previ-ous difference in HbA 1clevels for the intensive versus conventional group (7.2% and 9.1%, re-spectively) in the DCCT gradually narrowedduring the rst 2 years in the follow-up periodand then remained near 8% for both groups forthe subsequent 6 years.

In a study design similar to the DCCT, the Kumamoto study sepa-rated 110 Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes into primary-prevention and secondary-interven-tion cohorts and then randomly assigned 6-year study period, a signicant reduction of both new-onset and progressive DKD was found Figure 8.

In the prevention cohort, 7.7% of subjects inthe intensive-treatment group developed group ( P/H110050.03; Fig 10 ). After 8 years, the proportions were 11.5% and 43.5%, respectively(Fig 11 ). 137The UKPDS randomly assigned newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes to intensive management using a sulfonylurea orinsulin or to conventional management with dietalone. Average HbA 1clevel for the intensive group was 7.0% compared with 7.9% for theconventional group during the study.134After 9 years of intensive therapy, RR reduction for the development of microalbuminuria was 24% (95%CI, 9% to 38%; P/H110050.0006). 134No difference in risk reduction was seen whether intensive therapy was achieved with sulfonylurea or insulin.116In the Veterans Affairs (V A) Cooperative Study on Glycemic Control and Complications in Type 2Diabetes Feasibility Trial, 95 men with a meanduration of diabetes of 7.8 years and no mi-croalbuminuria were randomly assigned to inten-sive diabetes control (mean HbA 1c, 7.1% at 2 years) or conventional control (mean HbA1c, Figure 10.

In this study, 17% of the intensively treated group developed microalbu-minuria, whereas 35% of the conventionallytreated group developed microalbuminuria ( P/H110050.05). 135 Lowering HbA1clevels to approximately 7.0% reduces the development of macroalbuminuria. (Moderate) Type 1 Diabetes ( Table 19 ) In the DCCT, new cases of macroalbuminuria occurred in 5.6% of the conventional-treatmentgroup and 0.8% of the intensive-treatment Fig progressed from microalbuminuria to macroalbu- minuria, therapy also study, the end of the DCCT, previous inten- sive therapy within the DCCT was associatedwith only 9 cases (1.4%) of macroalbuminuriaversus 59 cases (9.4%) in the previous conven-tional-therapy group, an RR of 84% (95% CI,67% to 92%; Fig 12 ). 133In the similarly de - signed Stockholm study of 102 patients withtype 1 diabetes, intensive insulin therapy result-ing in a mean HbA 1cof 7.1% was associatedwith macroalbuminuria in only 1 of 48 patients (2.1%), whereas conventional therapy, resultingin a mean HbA 1cof 8.5%, was associated with macroalbuminuria in 9 of 54 patients (16.6%; P /H110050.01).138 Type 2 Diabetes ( Table 20 ) In type 2 diabetes, data from the Kumamoto study showed that 11.5% of the intensive-treatment group progressed to macroalbuminuriaversus 32.0% of the conventional-treatment group(P/H110050.04). 136In the long-term follow-up of participants in the Kumamoto study, 2 years after completion of the original randomized trial, thedifference in HbA 1cwas maintained, as was the signicant reduction in the development of mac- roalbuminuria (16% in the previous intensivegroup previous conventionalgroup; P/H110050.04). 137In the UKPDS, the RR reduction for the development of macroalbumin- uria with insulin or sulfonylureas was 33% at versus 6.5%, but this nding was not statisticallysignicant. 134In the V A study, 12% of those in the intensive-treatment group who entered with microalbuminuria progressed to macroalbumin-uria, whereas 36% of those in the conventional- Figure 12.

Guidelines for Diabetes and CKD S68treatment group progressed in this fashion ( P/H11005 0.04).135 For all these studies in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the overall numbers of individuals withmicroalbuminuria who developed macroalbumin-uria were small, but less with intensive therapy.Accordingly, differences in progression rates frommicroalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria with in-tensive therapy compared with conventional treat-ment generally were not statistically signicant,although the trends were to reduce progression. Lowering HbA 1clevels to approximately 7.0% reduces the rate of decrease in GFR. (Weak) A few long-term observational studies have shown that poorer glycemic control is associatedwith a greater rate of decrease in GFR in patientswith type 1 diabetes. 374-376In studies of other interventions, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs, HbA1clevels often were included as covariates. In the Collaborative Study Group (CSG) analysis of the early captopril trial of patients with type 1diabetes and CKD stages 2 to 3 (inferred fromGFR and proteinuria levels), a higher HbA 1c level was associated with an increased risk creatinine concentration. 377A correlation ( r/H110050.69; HbA1c level and rate of decrease in GFR also was found in a similar analysis of a much smaller group ofpatients followed up at the Steno Diabetes Cen-ter who were being treated with ACE inhibi-tors. 378 Most prospective randomized studies used as evidence for the effect of glycemic control onkidney function are limited by the small numberof patients reaching an outcome of a decrease inGFR. In a study of only 6 patients with type 1diabetes in whom the rate of decrease in GFRwas compared before and after institution ofintensive insulin therapy, the change from 1.35/H110060.31 to 0.69 /H110060.13 mL/min/mo was not statistically signicant, probably because of thesmall number of subjects. 141Another study found that more intensive glycemic treatment with just a modest decrease in HbA1cof 1.2% resulted in preservation of GFR during 2 years compared with a usual-treatment group.140None of 48 patients in the intensive-treatment group and 6 of 54 in the conventional-treatment group in theStockholm study decreased intensive-treatment group and of the previously conventional-treat-ment group developed creatinine 1% versus 4%, respectively, developed measuredcreatinine clearance values less than 70 mL/min/1.73 m 2(P/H110210.001).133For patients with type 2 diabetes, intensive treatment in the UKPDS was associated with a 67% risk reduction for a dou-bling of plasma creatinine levels at 9 years (0.71%of the intensive group and 1.76% of the conven-tional group; P/H110050.027). 134In a small random - ized study from Italy, 34 patients with type 2diabetes who underwent intensive treatment withinsulin and achieved an HbA 1clevel of 7.0% stabilized their rate of decrease in GFR, whereas those randomly assigned to metformin achievedan HbA 1cof 8.0% and had GFR during a 4-year period.139 Thiazolidinediones may have unique properties that reduce albuminuria. (Weak) Several relatively small short-term studies have evaluated whether thiazolidinediones (TZDs) de-crease albuminuria more than standard therapywith other oral (metformin or sulfonyl-ureas) or dietary treatment for hyperglycemia inpatients with type 2 diabetes and microalbumin-uria ( Table 21 ). 379-382Albuminuria was de - creased or trends in this direction were observedwith TZD treatment in all these studies. Whetherthis putative benet was caused by better controlof risk factors or the TZDs per se is not clearfrom the available evidence because TZD treat-ment was associated with larger decreases inglycemia or correlated with decreases in bloodpressure. 379,381,382 COMPARISON WITH OTHER GUIDELINES This guideline is consistent with the ADA guidelines,34which recommend that adults with diabetes achieve an HbA1clevel less than 7.0% or as close to normal as possible without exces- sive episodes of hypoglycemia, with the goal ofreducing all complications of diabetes. Althoughthe ADA does not have a separate guideline forpatients with DKD, it recognizes that certainpopulations may require special considerationsand that less intensive glycemic goals may beindicated in patients with severe or frequentManagement of Hyperglycemia and General Diabetes Care in Chronic Kidney Disease S69hypoglycemia. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the International Dia-betes Federation Global Guidelines, and the Eu-ropean NIDDM Working Group ( www.rbh. nthames.nhs.uk/PRESTIGE/niddm/niddm.htm ; last accessed 7/27/2006).383Again, this level is recommended with the goal of reducing all com- plications of diabetes. None of these organiza-tions has a separate guideline specic to DKD. LIMITATIONS An overall glycemic goal for people with diabetes of less than 7.0% is very strongly sup-ported by substantial data from large prospectiverandomized studies of both type 1 and type 2diabetes. Much of this support stems from ben-ets for some of the other major complications ofdiabetes, especially retinopathy. With respect tokidney outcomes, data are very strong for thedevelopment of microalbuminuria. The numbersof patients progressing to more advanced out-comes, such as macroalbuminuria and decreasesin GFR, are decreased signicantly with im-proved glycemic control, but much of this de-crease is related to the smaller number develop-ing microalbuminuria to begin with. Nonetheless,even for those with more advanced disease, evi-dence supports reaching the recommended HbA 1c target. IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES Drug Therapies The major risk for patients attaining HbA1c levels less than 7.0% is the increasing develop-ment of hypoglycemia with lower glucose con-centrations. This is particularly true for thosewith type 1 diabetes being treated with insu-lin. 132,138,384Although the risk is increased in those with type 2 diabetes being treated with insulin,134,137the magnitude of the risk is consid - erably less. The UKPDS also showed that sulfo-nylureas are associated with a small risk ofhypoglycemia. 134 Special Considerations in CKD Stages 3 to 5 Patients with decreased kidney function (CKD stages 3 to 5) have increased risks for hypoglyce-mia for 2 reasons: (1) decreased clearance ofinsulin and some of the oral agents used to treat diabetes, and (2) impaired kidney gluconeogen-esis. With reduced kidney mass, the amount ofgluconeogenesis carried out by the kidney isdecreased. 142This reduction in gluconeogenesis may reduce the ability of a patient who is becom- ing hypoglycemic as the result of excessive insu-lin/oral agent dosage or lack of food intake todefend against hypoglycemia. However, this ef-fect is difcult to quantify. About one third ofinsulin degradation is carried out by the kidney,and impaired kidney function is associated witha prolonged half-life of insulin. Thus, patientswith type 1 diabetes receiving insulin who hadsignicant creatinine elevations (mean, 2.2 mg/dL) had a 5-fold increase in the frequency ofsevere hypoglycemia. 143,144Therefore, it is im - perative that patients being treated intensivelymonitor their glucose levels closely and reducedoses of medicines (insulin and oral agents) asneeded to avoid hypoglycemia. With progressive decreases in kidney func- tion, decreased clearances of the sulfonylureasor their active metabolites also have beenfound, 385-387necessitating a decrease in drug dosing to avoid hypoglycemia. Table 22 provides recommendations for dosing of drugs used totreat hyperglycemia in should be avoided in patients with CKDbecause these agents rely on the kidney to elimi-nate both the parent drug and active metabolites,resulting in increased half-lives and risk because they do not have activemetabolites and do not increase the risk of hypo-glycemia in patients with CKD. In the meglitin-ide class, nateglinide has increased active metabo-lites with decreased kidney function, 388,389but increased active metabolites do not occur with repaglinide, another meglitinide.390Metformin should not be given to patients with serum creat- inine concentrations of 1.5 mg/dL or greater inmen and 1.4 mg/dL or greater in women becauseit is cleared by the kidney and may build up witheven modest impairment of kidney function,putting patients at risk of lactic acidosis. 391How - ever, hypoglycemia is not a problem with met-Guidelines for Diabetes and CKD S70formin. Rosiglitazone is cleared by the liver and does not have to be reduced with impaired kid-ney function. 392Therefore, rosiglitazone does not increase the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with CKD, but it has the potential, along withpioglitazone, to worsen fluid retention. Table 23 lists the available insulin prepara- tions that may be used in diabetes and CKD.Doses are not specied by level of kidney func- tion, but should be adjusted based on frequentmonitoring to balance goals of glycemic controlwith avoiding hypoglycemia. Other consider-ations that are not specic to the level of kidneyfunction include avoiding or minimizing the oc-currence of interactions with drugs used to lowerblood glucose.

Assessment of Glycemic Control and Complications Other Than Kidney Disease An additional factor that may hinder good glycemic control in patients with progressivekidney disease is some degree of inaccuracy ofthe HbA 1cmeasurement in reflecting ambient glucose concentrations. Factors that may contrib- ute to falsely decreased values include a reducedred blood cell lifespan, hemolysis, and iron de-ciency, whereas falsely increased values mayoccur due to carbamylation of the hemoglobinand acidosis. However, the relationship betweenHbA 1cand glucose concentrations was not differ - ent between patients with normal kidney func-tion and those with kidney failure (mean creati-nine, 6.6 mg/dL), but some hemodialysis patientshad lower than expected HbA 1cconcentrations relative to the ambient glucose concentrations.393 Opposite ndings for dialysis patients were re- ported.394In a comparison of different afnity high-performance liquid chromatography meth- ods, the Variant II (0.59% at diabetes/ngsp/index.html October 8, 2006).391Neither peritoneal dialysis nor hemo - dialysis acutely change HbA1clevels.392Fruc- tosamine generally correlated more poorly withglucose than did HbA 1cin patients with CKD stages 4 and 5.395,396 The patient on long-term dialysis therapy no longer needs to achieve good glycemic control toprevent deterioration of kidney function. How-ever, good control may still prevent or slow theprogression of retinopathy, neuropathy, and pos-sibly macrovascular disease. Survival patients on perito-neal dialysis 145and hemodialysis therapy.146In the latter study, after adjustment for age and sex, HbA1cwas a signicant predictor of survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.133 of HbA1c; 95% CI, 1.028 to 1.249; P/H110050.012).146 In the opinion of the Work Group, assessment of glycemic control in diabetes and CKD shouldfollow the standards set by the ADA ( Table Table 25.

Guidelines for Diabetes and receiving multiple insulin injec - tions, SMBG is recommended 3 or more timesdaily (before meals and at bedtime). In thosereceiving less frequent insulin injections, oralagents, or medical nutrition therapy alone, SMBGis useful in achieving glycemic goals. Postpran-dial SMBG testing also may be helpful, particu-larly in patients with gastroparesis, to achievepostprandial glucose goals and in patients usingrapid insulin injections before meals to adjust thedose-meal calculation. The optimal frequency ofSMBG has not been established in patients withtype 2 diabetes treated by oral agents, but theADA recommends testing sufciently often toreach glycemic goals. In addition, HbA 1clevels should be determined at least twice per year in stable patients who are achieving glycemic goalsand more often, approximately every 3 months,in patients whose therapy has changed or whoare not reaching goals. Other microvascular and macrovascular com- plications of diabetes are common in those withCKD. Assessment and management of CVD isaddressed in the Background section of theseguidelines. Screening and treatment of retinopa-thy and foot care also are essential to the care ofpatients with diabetes and kidney disease. In theabsence of specic data in the diabetes and CKD population, the Work Group recommends follow-ing the standards set by the ADA ( Table 26 ). 34 An ophthalmologist or optometrist who is knowl- edgeable and experienced in the diagnosis andmanagement of diabetic retinopathy should per-form a comprehensive dilated eye examinationannually in all people with diabetes. Recently,nonmydriatic digital stereoscopic retinal imag-ing has proved to be a sensitive and specicmethod to screen and diagnose retinopathy, andit is being used in many facilities. In a recentstudy, sensitivity was 98% and specicity was100%. 397Patients should be educated about the importance of foot surveillance and ulcer preven- tion, with an emphasis on self-management asdiscussed in CPR 4. The feet should be examinedvisually at each health care visit. A comprehen-sive foot and vascular examination includingvisual inspection, Semmes-Weinstein monola-ment testing, use of a 128-Hz tuning fork fortesting of vibratory sensation, and evaluation ofpedal pulses should be performed annually. Be-cause the risk of ulcers and amputations is highin those with diabetes and CKD, referral tofoot-care specialists for annual examinations andpreventive care is encouraged.Table 26.

In both type 1 and type2 diabetes, the natural history is similar, with theexception that onset of hypertension and vascu-lar disease is earlier in the course of kidneydisease in type 2 diabetes. 147,148A large number of epidemiological studies and controlled trials have dened hypertension as a risk factor forprogression of DKD, and antihypertensive treat-ment reduces this risk. 3 The purpose of this guideline is to provide a focused update of the diabetes and CKD sectionof the NKF-KDOQI CPGs on Hypertensionand Antihypertensive Agents in CKD. 5The rap - idly emerging literature in this eld was re-viewed to update the guidelines. A major differ-ence in the present guideline is that therecommendation for ACE-inhibitor or ARB treat-ment in normotensive people with diabetes andmicroalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria wasplaced in CPR 1. This change was made becausevery few normotensive patients were included inexisting studies and data are limited primarily tosurrogate outcomes (albuminuria/proteinuria).Studies in which albuminuria reduction by RASinhibition was a specied outcome also werereviewed. Because these studies were limited to secondary analyses of clinical trials of ARBs inpatients with type 2 diabetes and DKD, thisdiscussion also was placed in CPR 1. RATIONALE For this guideline, studies of people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and CKD stages 1 to 4 wereincluded. Studies of kidney transplant recipientswere excluded. Because of the high prevalenceof diabetes, many individuals with other types ofCKD also may have diabetes. In general, theguidelines for use of antihypertensive agents inkidney disease due to diabetes and other causesdo not conflict. 34,154 ACE inhibitors and ARBs were compared with other classes of antihypertensive agents. Inthese studies, diuretics frequently were used asadditional antihypertensive agents to achieveblood pressure control. Few studies directly com-pared ACE inhibitors and ARBs with each otherin DKD, and with the exception of 1 study, 400all focused on changes in blood pressure, rather than markers of kidney disease or clinical outcomes.In addition, data comparing other classes ofantihypertensive agents are provided. The mainrecommendations for this guideline and for dosesof ACE inhibitors and ARBs are shown in Table 27andTable 28 , respectively. Most patients with DKD have hypertension. (Strong) Hypertension is one of the most common comorbidities in DKD ( Table 29 ). 149-153Be- cause the studies cited in Table 29 were pub- lished before the JNC 7 report, hypertensiongenerally was dened as blood pressure greaterthan 140/90 mm Hg. The JNC 7 denes hyperten-sion in those with diabetes or CKD as blood Table 27.

American Journal of Kidney Diseases, Vol 49, No 2, Suppl 2 (February), 2007: pp S74-S87 S74pressure greater than 130/80 mm Hg. Thus, these prevalence estimates likely represent lower rangevalues based on current criteria for hypertensionin diabetes or CKD. The onset of hypertension intype 1 diabetes generally signies the onset ofDKD. Conversely, hypertension in type 2 diabe-tes may occur in the absence of DKD. Higher levels of blood pressure are associated with more rapid progression ofDKD. (Strong) A number of prospective studies show a strong relationship between a higher level of bloodpressure and an increased risk of kidney failureand worsening kidney function in DKD. 401-403 Some studies suggest that higher systolic bloodpressure is more important than higher diastolicblood pressure or high pulse pressure for kidneydisease progression. 173,403ACE inhibitors and ARBs are effective in slowing progression of kidney diseasecharacterized by microalbuminuria inhypertensive patients with type 1 or type 2diabetes. (Moderate) ACE inhibitors and ARBs decrease urine albu- min excretion, slow the increase in albuminexcretion, and delay the progression from mi-croalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria in kidneydisease due to type 1 or type 2 diabetes ( Table 30). 155-166Although most patients in these stud - ies were hypertensive, some patients were not(by conventional criteria) because of their earlystage of kidney disease. Consequently, patientsin the ACE-inhibitor or ARB group had lowermean blood pressure during follow-up than pa-tients in the control group.

Because no trials of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients with diabetes and microalbuminuriahave demonstrated a reduction in such clinicaloutcomes as CKD stage 5, doubling of serumcreatinine level, or death, the Work Groupconcluded that evidence for treatment of mi-croalbuminuric patients with these medicinesis moderate. This represents a change in levelof evidence grading from \"strong\" in the NKF-KDOQI CPGs on Hypertension and Antihy-pertensive Agents in CKD. 5At the time of the present review, the Work Group believed that the change in evidence grading would encour-age studies of long-term outcomes and other types of agents. However, in the absence ofparticipation in such a clinical trial, the WorkGroup recommends this treatment despite mod-erate evidence. ACE inhibitors are more effective than other antihypertensive classes in slowingprogression of kidney diseasecharacterized by macroalbuminuria inhypertensive patients with type 1 diabetes.(Strong) The CSG trial of captopril in diabetic nephrop- athy demonstrated that ACE inhibitors are effec-tive in reducing albuminuria and slowing thedecrease in GFR and onset of kidney failure inpatients with type 1 diabetes and macroalbumin-uria ( Table 30 ). 168,171,404,405In the placebo group, blood pressure was controlled with other antihy- pertensive agents as necessary.

The effects ofACE inhibitors may be caused in part by theantihypertensive effect and in part by additionalmechanisms because kidney benets appeared tobe greater than expected for blood-pressure low-ering. ARBs are more effective than other antihypertensive classes in slowingprogression of kidney diseasecharacterized by macroalbuminuria inhypertensive with diabetes.(Strong) A of randomized con- trolled ARBs are moreeffective than other antihypertensive drugclasses in slowing the decline in GFR andonset of kidney failure in patients with type 2diabete sandmacroalbuminuria .Figur e14andFigur e15showtheresult sfromIDNTandthe RENAAL, 2 withmacroalbuminuria and decreased GFR at thetime of enrollment. 167,169In these studies, the effects of ARBs may be caused in part by theantihypertensive effect and in part by addi-tional mechanisms because kidney benets ap-peared to be greater than expected for blood-pressure lowering. ACE inhibitors may be more effective than other antihypertensive classes inslowing the progression of kidney diseasecharacterized by macroalbuminuria inhypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes.(Weak) Data on the efcacy of ACE inhibitors in kidney disease caused by type 2 diabetes areuncertain. Some studies show greater reductionin albuminuria and slower decrease in GFR com-pared with other hypertensive agents ( Table 30). 405-408However, small sample size, use of surrogate outcomes, and inconsistent results pre- Figure 14.

A recent analysis of the subgroup of patients with type 2 diabetes andestimated GFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 enrolled in ALLHAT showed no benecial an a calciumchannel blocker (amlodipine) on decrease in GFRor onset of kidney failure during a 4-year intervalwhen each agent was used separately. 172Of note, measures of albuminuria or proteinuria were not available in that study. Therefore, the Work Groupconcluded that the ALLHAT results do not ruleout a benecial effect of ACE inhibitors on DKD characterized by macroalbuminuria in type 2diabetes. Based on the shared properties of ACE inhibi- tors and ARBs in inhibiting the RAS and a recentsmall study, 400ACE inhibitors may be as effec - tive as ARBs in slowing progression of kidneydisease caused by type 2 diabetes. In the opinionof the Work Group, either ARBs or ACE inhibi-tors can be used to treat DKD in hypertensivepeople with type 2 diabetes and macroalbumin-uria. Figure 15.

The Work Group found no long-term clinicaltrials on the use of ARBs in patients with DKDcaused by type 1 diabetes. However, based onthe shared properties of both drug classes ininhibiting the RAS, ARBs may be as effective asACE inhibitors in slowing progression of kidneydisease caused by type 1 diabetes. In the opinionof the Work Group, ARBs can be used as analternative class of agents to treat DKD in hyper-tensive people with type 1 diabetes and mac-roalbuminuria if ACE inhibitors cannot be used. Diuretics may potentiate the benecial effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs inhypertensive patients with DKD.(Moderate) Between 60% and 90% of patients in studies of hypertension treatment in DKD used eitherthiazide-type or loop diuretics in addition toACE inhibitors or ARBs. 167-169,409Conversely, diuretic use in the ACE-inhibitor group of ALLHAT was restricted by protocol; only 18%of this group received a thiazide diuretic. 172 Other studies have shown that the combinationof thiazide diuretics with agents that blockthe RAS is more effective than either typeof treatment alone for lowering blood pres-sure. 410-412Because most hypertensive pa - tients with DKD require more than 1 antihyper-tensive agent to reach the target blood pressureof less than 130/80 mm Hg, it is the opinion of the Work Group that most of these patientsshould be treated with a diuretic in combina-tion with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB to reachthe target blood pressure.Change after adjustment for sample size and study length.Change review of studies of DKD and non-DKD.The graph shows the change in blood pres-sure and proteinuria from baseline in trials thatprospectively randomized various calcium an-tagonists and looked at either doubling of cre-atinine, CKD stage 5 and death, or rate ofdecrease in GFR.

Re-printed Diabetes and CKD S82ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and nondihydropyridine calcium channel antiproteinuriceffect than other antihypertensive classesin hypertensive patients with DKD. (Strong) Two meta-analyses have demonstrated a greater effect of ACE inhibitors compared withother classes of antihypertensive agents on reduc-ingproteinuri ainDKD(Fig16andFig17). 413,414 Other studies show a larger effect of ARBs thanother classes. 415-417Some studies also suggest that/H9252-blockers may be effective, but this has not been observed consistently.418A systematic re - view demonstrates that nondihydropyridine cal-cium channel blockers have substantially greaterantiproteinuric effects than dihydropyridine cal-cium channel blockers, an effect that translatedinto greater slowing of kidney disease progres-sion and reduced cardiovascular event rates inthose with proteinuria greater than 300 mg/d. 413 In contrast to the benets of nondihydropyridinecalcium channel blockers for reducing protein-uria, the Bergamo Nephrologic Diabetes Compli-cations Trial (BENEDICT) recently reported thatnondihydropyridine calcium channel blockersused alone did not decrease the incidence rate ofmicroalbuminuria relative to placebo in hyperten-sive patients with type 2 diabetes with normalurinary albumin excretion at baseline. Addition-ally, they did not enhance the effect of ACEinhibitors to prevent microalbuminuria when usedin combination. 419 The combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB can reduce proteinuria more than eitheragent alone. 420-422Whether the benet of combi - nation therapy is additive or synergistic (greaterthan the sum of all agents) is difcult to deter-mine because of uncertainties about the maxi-mum antiproteinuric effect of single agents. More-over, because such combination therapy furtherlowers blood pressure, whether this is a generalblood pressure effect or a specic response tomore complete RAS inhibition is unclear. De-spite these uncertainties, in the opinion of theWork Group, it is reasonable to use a combina-tion of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB in hyperten-sive patients with DKD. Combination therapyshould be considered for those with controlledblood pressure, but who have persistent high-level macroalbuminuria or ACR greater than 500mg/g.Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, when used to treat hypertensionin the absence of ACE inhibitors or ARBs,are less effective than other agents inslowing progression of DKD. (Strong) Numerous studies have shown that dihydropyr- idine calcium channel blockers are less efca-cious than ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and nondihy-dropyridine calcium channel blockers reducingalbuminuria in DKD. showed that the dihydropyridine amlodipine was less effective inslowing kidney disease progression than the ARBirbesartan. 169IDNT also compared amlodipine with a placebo group treated with other agents,primarily diuretics and /H9252-blockers.169GFR de - cline and onset of kidney failure were similar inthese 2 groups. Conversely, ALLHAT showed nodetrimental effect of amlodipine compared withlisinopril or chlorthalidone on GFR decline oronset of kidney failure in type 2 diabetes wheneach agent was given separately. 172However, the lack of albuminuria/proteinuria data inALLHAT and the relatively limited sample sizeof the diabetic CKD subgroup (dened by eGFR/H1102160 mL/min/1.73 m 2) preclude rm conclu - sions. Based on numerous studies of proteinurickidney disease, including DKD and non-DKD, 5 it was the opinion of the Work Group that dihy-dropyridine calcium channel blockers should notbe used in DKD in absence of concurrentRAS inhibition. However, dihydropyridine cal-cium channel blockers probably can be usedsafely in patients taking an ACE inhibitor or anARB. 173 A systolic blood pressure goal even lower than 130 mm Hg may be more effective inslowing the progression of DKD. (Weak) A meta-analysis of 8 trials in DKD and 4 trials in non-DKD suggests that a lower blood pressuregoal may slow progression of kidney disease(Fig 18 ). 423This analysis is limited by the inabil - ity to control other factors related to rate ofprogression. Some studies have addressed a lowerblood pressure goal independent of antihyperten-sive drug class ( Table 31 ). These studies suggest that lower blood pressure levels are associatedwith lower levels of proteinuria. One study dem-onstrated a greater reduction in proteinuria inramipril-treated patients who achieved a lowerblood pressure goal (mean arterial blood pres-Management of Hypertension in Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease S83sure [MAP] /H1102192 mm Hg, equivalent to blood pressure /H11021125/75 mm Hg) compared with a usual blood pressure goal (MAP /H11021107 mm Hg, equivalent to blood pressure /H11021140/90 mm Hg).171The Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) trial showed a trend toward greater slowing of GFR decrease at the lowerachieved systolic blood pressure of 128 mmHg. 409,424Studies in non-DKD suggest a lower blood pressure goal is more effective in slowing kidney disease progression in patients with pro-teinuria. 5Because DKD typically is accompa - nied by proteinuria, it was the opinion of theWork Group that a lower blood pressure goalmay be benecial for DKD, as well. There isinsufcient evidence to dene this lower bloodpressure goal or the threshold level of proteinuriaabove which the lower blood pressure goal isindicated. As in non-DKD, 5it was the opinion of the Work Group that a systolic blood pressure goal even lower than 130 mm Hg should beconsidered for patients with persistent high-levelmacroalbuminuria (ACR /H11022500 mg/g). Lower- ing of systolic blood pressure levels to less than110 mm Hg should be avoided. 5 Multiple antihypertensive agents are usually required to reach target bloodpressure (Strong). Table 32 shows the target and achieved sys- tolic blood pressure and the number of antihyper-tensive agents used in randomized trials of anti- hypertensive agents to slow the progression ofDKD. 167-169,424Multiple agents usually were required. COMPARISONS WITH OTHER GUIDELINES This guideline generally is consistent with other recent guidelines, including the NKF-KDOQI CPGs on Hypertension and Antihyper-tensive Agents in CKD, 5the ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes,34and JNC 7.154All these guidelines support the use of diuretics with either ACE inhibitors or ARBs as initial therapyto achieve the systolic blood pressure goal of lessthan 130 mm Hg in patients with diabetes. More-over, the JNC 7 denes hypertension in individu-als with diabetes or CKD as blood pressuregreater than 130/80 mm Hg. The guidelines ofthe European Society of Hypertension also rec-ommend use of an ACE inhibitor or an ARB forthose with diabetes and CKD. 425 LIMITATIONS No claims of superiority between ACE inhibi- tors and ARBs can be made in type 1 diabetesbecause no randomized trials have comparedthese agents head-to-head in slowing the progres-sion of kidney disease in this type of diabetes.However, a head-to-head comparison in type 2diabetes suggested clinical equivalency of theseagents. 400SBP (mm Hg) 130 134 138 142 146 150 154 170 180 r = 0.39; P < 0.05 Untreated HTN0 -2 -4 -6 -8 -10 -12 -14GFR (mL/min/year) -Parving HH et al.

Management of Hypertension in Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease S85Combinations of ACE inhibitors with ARBs are effective in slowing progression of non-DKD, an observation related to further reduc-tion in proteinuria rather than blood-pressurelowering. 426,427No trials with clinical out - comes have evaluated such a combination fortreatment of DKD. Other combinations, suchas aldosterone blockade with ACE inhibition,may reduce albuminuria independent of bloodpressure changes in DKD. All studies to datethat have evaluated combinations of RAS in-hibitors have been performed in hypertensivepatients with diabetes with advanced CKD andmacroalbuminuria. Whether such combina-tions would be useful or tolerated in early-stage DKD, including normotensive patients,is unknown. A recent meta-analysis concluded that RAS inhibition with either ACE inhibitors or ARBs isno more effective at preventing GFR loss or suchclinical outcomes as doubling of serum creati-nine level or CKD stage 5 than other antihyper-tensive agents in hypertensive patients with dia-betes. 428However, studies selected for the active comparator portion of the meta-analysis in- cluded heterogeneous groups that did not consis-tently have hypertension (present in 86%) ormacroalbuminuria (mean albumin, 520 mg/g;range, 7 to 3,000 mg/g). The Work Group con-curs that blood pressure control is a predominantmechanism for kidney protection, but that themeta-analysis does not negate evidence for ben-ets of RAS inhibition in patients with diabetes,hypertension, and macroalbuminuria. The WorkGroup acknowledges the issues raised by thismeta-analysis and supports further study, particu-larly with active comparisons of RAS inhibitionwith other interventions for blood pressure con-trol.IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES Multiple interventions are needed to slow the progression of kidney disease and reduce the risk ofCVD in DKD. Generally, the approach requires 3or more antihypertensive agents, intensive insulintherapy in type 1 diabetes, 2 or more drugs forglucose control in type 2 diabetes, at least 1 lipid-lowering agent, and emphasis on lifestyle modica-tion, including diet, exercise, and smoking cessa- tion. One obstacle to achieving adherence is thenumber of medicines and the complexity of theseregimens. Therefore, the selection of antihyperten-sive agents must include considerations of cost,side effects, and convenience. Selection of antihypertensive agents also should include consideration of their effects ondiabetes management. The GEMINI trial demon-strated that, in the presence of an ACE inhibitoror ARB, carvedilol stabilized glycemic controland improved insulin resistance to a greaterextent than metoprolol in patients with type 2diabetes and hypertension. 108Moreover, new- onset microalbuminuria was 48% lower when carvedilol was added to RAS inhibition com-pared with metoprolol. Because blood pressure control is a key objec- tive in management of DKD, antihypertensiveagents, including ACE inhibitors and ARBs,should be titrated to achieve moderate to maxi-mal doses approved for the treatment of hyperten-sion. In addition, reducing dietary sodium ( /H110212.3 g/d) is critical to optimize the effectiveness ofmedication used to control blood pressure (seeGuideline 5). Assessment of Blood Pressure The Work Group recommends that blood pressure be measured at each health care en-Table 32.

Because of the frequent occur-rence of autonomic neuropathy in diabetes and CKD, orthostatic blood pressure should bemeasured. The Work Group concurred that theschedule for follow-up evaluation of bloodpressure, as outlined in the NKF-KDOQICPGs on Hypertension and AntihypertensiveAgents in CKD, is appropriate for those whohave diabetes as well as CKD ( Table 33 ). 5Table 33.

The risk of CVD is greatlyincreased in this population. People with dia-betes and CKD should be treated according tocurrent guidelines for high-risk groups. 4.1 Target LDL-C in people with diabetes and CKD stages 1-4 should be <100 mg/dL; <70 mg/dL is a therapeutic op- tion.

(A) BACKGROUND Diabetes is associated with a high risk of morbidity and premature mortality.433,434Most adverse diabetes outcomes are due to macrovas- cular or microvascular complications.134Mac- rovascular complications are common and se-vere; up to 80% of patients with type 2 diabeteswill develop or die of CVD. Based on thisseverity of risk, prevention and managementof CVD must be considered in the care ofpatients with diabetes and CKD. Therefore,these patients are strong treat-ment of CVD risk byusing lipid-lowering tremendousimportance and is a cost-effective strategy inpeople with type 2 diabetes. 435,436 The NKF-KDOQI CPGs for Managing Dyslipidemia in CKD re-cently and CPGs for CVD in Dialysis Patientsadded new information on the inverse associa-tion between cholesterol level and mortal-ity. 6,10The purpose of this guideline is to focus on patients with diabetes and CKD and to update the previous guidelines. Results fromthe rst prospective randomized trial in hemo-dialysis patients with diabetes and indirectevidence from a recent post hoc analysis of 3large multicenter trials on the benecial effectsof lipid-lowering therapy in diabetes and CKD were added to this guideline. RATIONALE For this guideline, we included studies of patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes andCKD stages 1 to 5. Because of the high preva-lence of diabetes in the population, many indi-viduals with other types of CKD also may havediabetes. In general, the guidelines for use oflipid-lowering agents in CKD stages 1 to 4 dueto diabetes and other causes agree with eachother, 174-177although there is no direct or indirect evidence for treating patients with CKD stage 4. Because CKD per se markedlyincreases the risk of CVD, CKD may be consid-ered a risk equivalent for CVD when assessingthe need for lipid lowering. Most patients with diabetes and CKD have dyslipidemia. (Strong) Patients with diabetes and CKD typically have low levels of high-density lipoprotein choles-terol (HDL-C), high triglyceride levels, and aver-age levels of LDL-C; LDL particles in peoplewith diabetes tend to be smaller, denser, andpossibly more atherogenic. 437-440 Elevated LDL-C can effectively be treated with statins in diabetes and CKD. (Strong) In general, cholesterol lowering with statin therapy is efcacious in patients with diabetes,including those without manifest coronary heartdisease and those with relatively low LDL-Clevels. 97,98 Most patients with diabetes and CKD are at very high risk to develop macrovascularcomplications. (Strong) The Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guide- lines of the National Cholesterol Education Pro-gram (NCEP) 175identied diabetes as a high- risk condition. This designation was based on evidence that most patients with diabetes have agreatly increased 10-year risk ( /H1102220%) of onset of CVD in patients withdiabetes carries a poor prognosis, both at thetime of an acute CVD event and in the posteventperiod. In the Heart Protection Study (HPS), American Journal of Kidney Diseases, Vol 49, No 2, Suppl 2 (February), 2007: pp S88-S94 S88patients who had both diabetes and CVD were at very high risk of future CVD events.97When type 2 diabetes is complicated by CKD, the cardiovascular risk increases dramatically; in par-ticular, in patients with microalbuminuria or mac-roalbuminuria, it is approximately 2 to 4 times ashigh as in normoalbuminuric patients. 40The pres - ence of CKD can be considered an additionalcardiovascular risk factor per se. LDL-C-lowering therapy decreases the risk of CVD in diabetes and CKD stages 1 to3. (Moderate) Primary and secondary prevention trials, in- cluding those in people with diabetes, have docu-mented substantial cardiovascular benet fromadministration of statins. 441,442The recent pri - mary prevention Collaborative Atorvastatin Dia-betes Study (CARDS) reported an impressivedecrease in cardiovascular deaths in people withtype 2 diabetes in the absence of markedly de-creased kidney function. 98In terms of absolute risk reduction, patients in the HPS with diabetes and CVD received the greatest benet fromstatin therapy. 97 A post hoc analysis of data from the PPP (a subject-level database combining results from 3randomized trials of pravastatin, 40 mg daily,versus placebo) included diabetes, but notCKD; and 571 had both conditions. 99 CKD was dened as eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2or GFR of 60 to 89.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 with trace or more proteinuria. The primarycomposite outcome was time to myocardial in-farction, coronary death, or percutaneous/surgi-cal coronary revascularization. The incidence of the primary outcome was lowest in individualswith neither CKD nor diabetes (15.2%), interme-diate in subjects with only CKD (18.6%) or highest in subjects withboth characteristics (27.0%). Pravastatin signi-cantly reduced the risk of the primary outcomeby 25% in subjects with CKD and concomitantdiabetes and by 24% in subjects with neithercharacteristic. The absolute reduction in risk ofthe primary outcome due to pravastatin use washighest in subjects with both CKD and diabetes (6.4%) and lowest in subjects with neithercharacteristic (3.5%; Fig 19 ). This study pro- vides indirect evidence that pravastatin treat-ment effectively decreases the risk of CVD indiabetes with CKD stages 1 to 3. The studydoes not provide evidence for a protectiveeffect of pravastatin in more advanced stagesof CKD because patients with more severeimpairment of kidney function were excludedfrom the trials. More advanced stages of CKDalso were excluded from the West of ScotlandCoronary Prevention Study (WOSCOP), 443a primary prevention trial, and from the Choles- terol and Recurrent Events (CARE) Study444 and the Long-term Intervention with Pravasta-tin in Ischemic Disease (LIPID) Study, 4452 secondary intervention studies. In the opinion of the Work Group, people with diabetes and CKD (other than stage 5) shouldreceive LDL-C-lowering therapy. The high riskassociated with diabetes and CKD supports initia-tion of statin therapy when LDL-C is greater than100 mg/dL, with an option to achieve an LDL-Cgoal of less than 70 mg/dL. Figure 19.

(Strong) The 4D, a multicenter, randomized, double- blind, and prospective study, randomly assigned1,255 patients with type 2 diabetes on mainte-nance hemodialysis to receive 20 mg of atorvasta-tin per day or matching placebo. 446After 4 weeks of treatment, atorvastatin reduced the me- dian LDL-C level by 42%, and placebo, by 1.3%.At least 1-mmol/L difference in LDL-C levelwas maintained throughout the treatment period(Fig 20 ). During a median follow-up of 4 years, 469 patients (37%) reached the primary endpoint (a composite of cardiac death, nonfatalmyocardial infarction, and fatal and nonfatalstroke): 226 assigned to atorvastatin to placebo P/H110050.37; Figure 20 ). Atorvastatin had no effect on the single components of the primaryend point with the exception of fatal stroke, inwhich RR was 2.03 (95% CI, 1.05 to 3.93; P/H11005 0.04). Secondary end points, such as all com-bined cardiac events (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68 to0.99; P/H110050.03), were reduced, but events (RR, 1.12; 95% CI,0.81 to 0.79 to 1.08; P/H110050.33). 100Despite the high rate of cardiovascular events and the pronounced LDL-C lowering by atorva-statin, a signicant reduction in the incidence ofthe composite primary end point was not achieved(patients with an LDL-C /H11022190 mg/dL were not included in 4D). In contrast to 4D, CARDSreported that people with type 2 diabetes whoreceived atorvastatin had an RR for stroke of0.52 (95% CI, 0.31 to 0.89) compared withplacebo. 98The rate fatal and nonfatal stroke decreased from 2.8% to 1.5% (39 versus 21 patients), whereas in the 4D, it increased from7.0% to 9.7% (44 versus 59 patients). This unex-plained nding of an increase in fatal strokerequires further study. The 4D is the rst large-scale cardiovascular outcome trial that does notshow overall benet from administration of apotent dose of a statin and does not conrm thegenerally accepted assumption that for every30-mg/dL change in LDL-C level, the RR ofcoronary heart disease is changed in proportionby about 30%. The result is in accordance withobservational data in patients on hemodialysistherapy that do not link dyslipidemia with re-duced survival; opposite trends have beennoted. 4474D results are in contrast to an observa - tional retrospective analysis of hemodialysis pa-tients in the US Renal Data System (USRDS)Morbidity and Mortality Study, Wave 2, 448which Figure 20.

Reprinted with permission. 100Guidelines for Diabetes and CKD S90indicated that the risk of cardiovascular death decreases by 36% in statin users compared withnonusers. This nding illustrates the difcultyassociated with basing treatment decisions onuncontrolled observational studies. 448,449Per- haps the pathogenesis of cardiovascular events inpatients with diabetes on hemodialysis therapymay be different, at least in part, from that inpatients without CKD stage 5. Additional infor-mation on the inverse association between choles-terol concentration and mortality is presented inthe NKF-KDOQI CPGs for CVD in DialysisPatients. 10 Dyslipidemia may and accelerate progression of DKD.Whether treatment with statins slowsprogression of DKD is uncertain. (Weak) A number of observational studies have re- ported that dyslipidemia is associated with de-creased kidney function in the general popula-tion and in patients with CKD, with or withoutdiabetes, as extensively reviewed in the NKF-KDOQI CPGs for Managing Dyslipidemia inCKD. 6An analysis of the lipid prole of the DCCT/EDIC cohort of patients with type 1 dia- betes demonstrated a specic prole in DKD triglyceride the very-low-density-lipoprotein(VLDL) subclasses. In men, high intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), high LDL particleconcentration, and a shift from larger towardsmaller LDL-C, apolipoprotein B, small with CKD. 439In the RENAAL Study, the RR of reaching the primary composite end point (doubling of serum creatinine level, CKD stage5, or death) among patients in the upper quartileof the distribution for total cholesterol and LDL-Cwas signicantly higher than for those in thelower quartile. 450 Small short-term randomized studies report mixed results of the effect of statins on progres-sion of DKD ( Table 34 ). In with type 1 diabetes and microalbuminuria, simvastatin benecial effect on either albuminuria orGFR. randomized trials in type 2 diabetes reported benecial effects of statins on albuminuria and GFR relative to pre-treatment levels, 452-454but not relative to pla -cebo or an alternative class of treatment for dyslipidemia.455-457 Whether dyslipidemia causes reduced kidney function, results from reduced kidney function,or whether other conditions, such as proteinuria,cause both reduced kidney function and dyslipi-demia cannot be determined from the availabledata. Large, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trials that examine the effectof dyslipidemia treatment on progression of DKDhave not been done. This is the only approachthat can adequately test the hypothesis that treat-ment of dyslipidemia provides benet for kidneyoutcomes. At present, primary and secondaryprevention of CVD is the principal reason toevaluate and treat dyslipidemia in patients withdiabetes and CKD. For patients with type 2 diabetes who are taking statins, routine monitoring of liverfunction tests or muscle enzymes is notrecommended except in speciccircumstances. (Strong) The current literature suggests that statins are safe. Although discontinuation and nonad-herence rates are approximately 15% or morein many clinical trials, rates of discontinuationtypically do not differ from those of placebo.Rates of elevated liver or muscle enzyme lev-els did not differ between the statin and pla-cebo groups in the 4D or in recent large-scalestudies in people with and without diabetesfrom the general population. Ongoing large-scale trials in diabetic and nondiabetic CKDand dialysis patients (A study to evaluate the use of Rosuvastatin in subjects on regular hemodialysis: an assessment of survival and cardiovascular events [AURORA]; and Studyof Heart and Renal Protection [SHARP]) havealready accumulated substantial patient treat-ment years and have not reported serious ad-verse events related to liver or muscle func-tion. On the basis of the safety data pertainingto these drugs, routine monitoring of muscleenzymes and liver function tests probably isnot warranted unless patients have symp-toms, 458,459have baseline abnormalities of liver function test results or myopathy, or are taking other drugs that interact with statins to in-crease the risk of adverse events.Management of Dyslipidemia in Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease S91Table 34.

Guidelines for Diabetes and CKD S92COMPARISON WITH OTHER GUIDELINES The 2004 NCEP Report on ATP III Guidelines A recent NCEP report discussed the implica- tions of the ATP III guidelines.175Results from the HPS and the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin in Evaluation and Infection Therapy (PROVE IT)Study suggested that additional benet may beobtained by reducing LDL-C levels to less than 100 mg/dL. While awaiting the results of theTreating to New Targets (TNT) Study to provethe efcacy of lowering LDL-C to very lowlevels, the NCEP report stated that \"until thesetrials are completed, prudence requires that set-ting an LDL-C goal of /H1102170 mg/dL for high-risk patients must be left as a therapeutic option onTable 35.

Management of Dyslipidemia in Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease S93the basis of clinical trial evidence, whereas a goal of /H11021100 mg/dL can be retained as a strong recommendation.\" Since that NCEP report, TNThas been completed and showed that intensivelipid-lowering therapy reaching a mean targetLDL-C level of 77 mg/dL with 80 mg of atorva-statin per day in patients with stable coronaryheart disease provides signicant clinical benetbeyond that afforded by treatment with 10 mg ofatorvastatin per day. 460Factors that favor a deci - sion to reduce LDL-C levels to less than 70mg/dL are those that place patients in the cat-egory of very high risk. 175 Based on these data, it is the opinion of the Work Group that people with type 2 diabetes andCKD stages 1 to 4 may receive additional benetfrom intensied treatment with a statin to reduceLDL-C levels to less than 70 mg/dL. Data fromthe 4D suggest that initiating lipid lowering witha statin in hemodialysis patients with type 2diabetes may come too late to translate intosubstantial improvement in cardiovascular out-comes, possibly because of additional or alterna-tive pathological mechanisms. LIMITATIONS These guideline recommendations should be validated in people with diabetes and CKD stage4. All available studies systematically excludedpeople with severe impairment of kidney func-tion. In addition, there are no prospective random-ized controlled trials available in diabetes andCKD stages 1 to 3. Recommendations made forpatients in the latter stages of CKD have beenmade based on post hoc analysis with limitednumbers of patients. Results from ongoing pro-spective randomized trials, such as the SHARP,are eagerly awaited. The guideline recommenda-tion for the therapeutic option of an LDL-C goalless than 70 mg/dL was based on the very highCVD risk in people with diabetes and CKD.However, the clinical trial evidence for this goalis based on studies of patients with coronaryheart disease. Studies of the target population(diabetes and CKD stages 1 to 4) are neededto verify this recommendation. Data fromAURORA are needed to prove whether a recom-mendation to withhold statin treatment in pa- tients with type 2 diabetes on hemodialysis isjustied. IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES Dosing adjustments of statins and bric acid derivatives may be required in patients withdiabetes and advanced CKD ( Table 35 ). Eziti- mibe may be considered as an adjunct to achieveLDL-C goals, particularly if statin doses arelimited due to concern about side effects. In the opinion of the Work Group, some cave- ats should be considered for implementing recom-mendations made in this guideline. First, the 4Dresults may not apply to patients who are alreadyon drug therapy for LDL-C. Therefore, statintreatment may continue into CKD stage 5 ifinitiated at an earlier CKD stage. Second, the 4Dresults do not preclude statin treatment for hemo-dialysis patients with type 2 diabetes and LDL-C/H11022190 mg/dL or specic cardiovascular indica- tions. According to ATP-III these indicationsinclude coronary disease and coronary heartdisease risk equivalents (eg, non-coronary athero-sclerotic disease or multiple risk factors thatconfer a 10-year Framingham risk /H1102220%). Assessment of Lipids A complete lipid prole, including total choles- terol, HDL-C, and triglycerides, should be di-rectly measured in people with diabetes andCKD. LDL-C is calculated from these values byusing the Friedewald formula, as recommendedby the ATP III Guidelines. 175Because dyslipide - mia associated with diabetes and CKD mayoccur without an elevated LDL-C level due toincreased lipoprotein remnants, non-HDL-C (to-tal the lipid prole at least annually in peoplewith CKD stages 1 to 4. 6Repeated measure - ments should be made 2 to 3 months after start-ing or adjusting lipid-lowering treatment or withsubstantial changes in albuminuria/proteinuria orGFR ( should include nutritional intervention. Dietary modi- cations may reduce progression of CKD. 5.1 Target dietary protein intake for people with diabetes and CKD stages 1-4 should be the RDA of 0.8 g/kg body weight per day. (B) dietary protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight per day, the RDA for this macronutrient, is a level that has been achieved in studies of diabetes and CKD. Reduction in albuminuria and stabilization of kidney function have been reported with dietary protein intake at the RDA level. Nutrition surveys indicate that most people eat in excess of the RDA for dietary protein. (Moderate) on the available evidenc e(Table37andTable38),theWork Group concluded that limiting dietary proteinwill slow the decrease in kidney function andprogression of albuminuria, and it may preventCKD stage 5. At the other end of the spectrum, high- protein diets are a particular concern in pa-tients with diabetes because they increase albu-minuria and may accelerate loss of kidneyfunction. Glomerular hyperltration and in-creased intraglomerular pressure are well-recognized mechanisms of kidney damage in-duced by excess dietary protein. Based on bothhuman studies and experimental models, higherprotein intake appears to have more pro-nounced effects on kidney hemodynamics andkidney damage in diabetes. 187-196,463Emerg - ing epidemiological evidence indicates thathigher protein intake ( /H1135020% versus 10% of total daily calories) is associated with loss ofkidney function in women with mild kidneyinsufciency (dened as estimated GFR /H1102180 and/H1102255 mL/min/1.73 m 2) development of microalbuminuria in people with diabetesand hypertension. 197,198Therefore, in the opin - ion of the Work Group, people with diabetesand CKD should avoid high-protein diets American Journal of Kidney Diseases, Vol 49, No 2, Suppl 2 (February), 2007: pp S95-S107 S95Table 37.

Some common fad diets that recommend high protein areAtkins \u00ae, Protein Power, the Zone, South Beach\u00ae, and Sugar Busters\u00ae. Diets for people with diabetes have tradition- ally been 15% to 20% protein.464The NHANES 1999 to 2000 indicated that the majority of Americans consume 15% of total daily caloriesor approximately 1.04 g/kg body weight per dayas protein, substantially more than the 0.8 g/kgbody weight per day RDA. 178In the DASH and DASH-Sodium diets, a higher protein intake (1.4 g/kg body weight per day) is recommended.199 However, sources of protein in the DASH dietsemphasize vegetables, low-fat or nonfat dairyproducts, whole grains, nuts, legumes, sh, andpoultry. Red meat is eaten in only small amounts.In recent studies of people with prehypertensionor untreated stage 1 hypertension, higher proteinintake from either soy or predominantly veg-etable sources reduced blood pressure in short-term (6 to 12 weeks) feeding studies. 200,201Along with the DASH trials, these data suggest that predominantly nonmeat protein may have a ben-ecial effect on blood pressure. However, whetherthe blood pressure effect is due to the proteincontent or other dietary components, such aspotassium or isoflavones, is unknown. 465Sev- eral small studies indicate that vegetable orsoy protein sources also may be kidney sparingcompared with red-meat sources in diabetesand CKD, and in the Nurses Health Study, therisk of losing kidney function in women withmild kidney insufciency was related primar-ily to animal meat intake. 182,185,197,202,466 Higher dairy or vegetable protein intake didnot increase this risk. Therefore, a DASH-typediet that emphasizes sources of protein otherthan red meat may be a reasonable alternativeto a lower total protein intake in people withhypertension, diabetes, and CKD stages 1 to 2.Nevertheless, people who achieve the RDA forprotein, 0.8 g/kg body weight per day, andmaintain an adequate caloric intake remainwell nourished.

(Weak/Opinion) Evidence of biological activity of dietary fats and carbohydrates indicates that an exclusivefocus on protein is too limiting with regard tobroad effects on health in people with diabetesand CKD. When protein intake is limited, caloricdistribution of the other macronutrients must beaddressed. According to the National Academyof Sciences, Institute of Medicine, nonproteincalories (90% of total) should be distributed as30% or less from dietary fats and up to 60%obtained from complex carbohydrates. 467The ADA recommends that carbohydrates be derived primarily from whole grains, fruits and veg-etables, and nonfat or low-fat dairy products. 174 Although glycemic effects are determinedstrongly by total amount of carbohydrate, low-glycemic index foods (a measure of type ofcarbohydrate) may decrease postprandial hyper-glycemia and improve overall blood glucosecontrol. 174Dietary ber is encouraged and may produce metabolic benets on glycemia and lip- ids.174 The optimal distribution of calories between fatty acid classes remains to be determined. Rec-ommendations for fatty acids usually combinepolyunsaturated fatty acids together without dif-ferentiating between categories. Few studies haveexamined the effects of fatty acid intake orsupplements on markers of kidney disease andrisk factors in patients with diabetes ( Table 41). 468-472Moreover, these studies were short term and performed in small numbers of people, precluding rm conclusions. Nevertheless, theavailable evidence suggests that increased intakeof omega-3 and monounsaturated fatty acidsmay be considered because of potentially favor-able effects on progression of CKD ( Table 41 ). Fatty acid intake can be modied easily bysubstituting canola oil, a blend that includes bothomega-3 and monounsaturated fats, for veg-etable oils. Several brands of salad dressings andbutter replacement products made from canolaoil are available in most grocery stores. To re-duce intake of saturated fat, consumption of redTable 40 (Cont'd).

People with diabetes and CKD should receive intervention from a specialty-trainedregistered dietitian that includesindividualized management of multiplenutritional aspects. (Moderate) The diet for diabetes and CKD is more compli- cated than that for either condition alone. Themanagement of diabetes and CKD involves mul-tiple nutrients (macronutrients and micronutri- ents), including protein, carbohydrate, fat, so-dium, potassium, and phosphate, among manyothers. Nutritional intervention should be indi-vidualized and completed in an interactive man-ner. Patients should identify achievable goalsand lifestyle behaviors they want to modify.Several studies have documented that frequentpatient contact with a registered dietitian accom-plishes dietary goals and/or improves clinicalTable 42.

COMPARISONS WITH OTHER GUIDELINES The NKF-KDOQI Guidelines on Hyperten- sion and Antihypertensive Agents in CKD recom-mended a version of the DASH diet with modi-cations for CKD stages 3 to 4. 5,199These modications decreased dietary protein from 1.4 g/kg body weight per day to 0.6 to 0.8 g/kg bodyweight per day, as well as restricted phosphorus(0.8 to 1.0 g/d) and potassium (2 to 4 g/d). 5 Based on concerns about potential detrimentaleffects of high-protein diets on the kidney andevidence for kidney and survival benets atapproximately the RDA level in diabetes andCKD stages 1 to 2, the Work Group concludedthat a protein intake that meets, but does notexceed, the RDA would be prudent at earlierstages of CKD ( Table 43 ). The ADA endorses a dietary protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weightper day for people with DKD. 34An additional restriction to 0.6 g/kg body weight per day is suggested should glomerular ltration rate beginto decrease. The dietary protein recommendationshould be based on idealized body weight be-cause obesity, which is highly prevalent in thediabetes and CKD population, otherwise wouldlead to overestimating the dietary protein recom-mendation. Dietary sodium reduction to 2.3 g/d (100 mmol/d) is recommended based on the DASHand DASH-Sodium diets. 199Because most people with diabetes and CKD have hypertension char- acterized by enhanced sodium retention, thislimitation should apply. Recommendations forphosphorus and potassium are the same for CKDwith and without diabetes. Phosphorus bindersmay be needed in patients with advanced CKDbecause of the emphasis on whole grains anddairy products. The Institute of Medicine established guide- lines for intake of omega-3 fatty strating reduced risk of progression ofDKD (loss of kidney function or in-creased albuminuria) by treatment withlow-protein diets.Reprinted with permission. 180 Figure 22.

Adequate intake of alpha-linolenic acid was es-tablished as 1.6 g/d for men and 1.1 g/d forwomen, with substitution of up to 10% of theseamounts by the more physiologically potent eico-sapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoicacid (DHA). 467The AHA and the KDOQI CPGs for CVD in Dialysis Patients recommend including 1 serving of cold-water sh in the diet3 times per week. 10,476It is possible that 3 servings of cold-water sh, such as salmon, mackerel, herring, and albacore tuna, would pro-vide EPA and DHA in excess of the 10% ofadequate intake amounts for men and women.The Work Group is not aware of studies indicat-ing disadvantages from this amount of EPA orDHA. However, some concerns exist related tothe potential for unacceptable levels of mercuryor other contaminants. Nevertheless, in the opin-ion of the Work Group, these recommendationsmay be considered for the diabetes and CKDpopulation. LIMITATIONS Studies of dietary protein interventions in dia- betes and CKD are relatively few, short term,completed in small numbers of participants, andhave limited documentation of DKD. In addi-tion, both the qualitative (eg, beef, chicken, orsoy sources) and quantitative denition of alow-protein diet differ tremendously among stud-ies. Substantial differences in amounts and typesof fat and carbohydrate also have not been ac-knowledged adequately. This type of variability is a potential explanation for the inconsistentresults observed between studies evaluating theeffect of protein intake on kidney outcomes. IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES As detailed in CPR 4, adherence to nutritional regimens is particularly challenging. Therefore,methods to improve adherence are crucial toachieve nutritional goals. In addition, diets rec-ommended by health care professionals often areviewed as unpalatable and unattractive. Culinaryapproaches to enhance appeal of nutrient-appro-priate foods should be encouraged, along withmethods to make food preparation easy andinexpensive. An example of a meal plan thatmeets the nutritional goals of this guideline isprovided in Appendix 1. A professional chefdesigned the menu and accompanying recipes incollaboration with registered dietitians experi-enced with diabetes and CKD. In the view of theWork Group, these types of creative approachesfacilitate interest and feasibility for lifestyle modi-cation in diabetes and CKD. Schedule for Nutritional Assessment and Intervention The Renal Dietitians Dietetic Practice Group of the American Dietetic Association recom-mends nutritional assessment and intervention atthe diagnosis of CKD and quarterly thereafter. 477 Considering that diabetes further complicatesCKD care, frequency of assessment may beTable 43.

Guidelines for Diabetes and CKD S106adjusted based on the needs of individual pa- tients. A registered dietitian who is knowledge-able of both conditions should perform nutri-tional assessments and interventions. Obtainingaccurate dietary histories often is challengingbecause of the subjective nature of reporting anddifculty with recall. For some key nutrients inthe regimen recommended for diabetes and CKD, such as sodium and protein (estimated by urinaryurea nitrogen excretion), 24-hour urine studiesare useful to assess intake and guide counseling.Close monitoring of patients who follow a di-etary protein restriction is important to ensureadequate, but not excessive, protein intake.

CLINICAL PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONSCLINICAL PRACTICE RECOMMENDATION 1: MANAGEMENT OF ALBUMINURIA IN NORMOTENSIVE PATIENTS WITH DIABETES AND ALBUMINURIA AS A SURROGATE MARKER Treatments that lower urinary albumin ex- cretion may slow progression of diabetic kid-ney disease (DKD) and improve clinical out-comes, even in the absence of hypertension.However, most people with diabetes and albu-minuria have hypertension; management ofhypertension in these patients is reviewed inGuideline 3. 1.1 Normotensive people with diabetes and macroalbuminuria should be treated withan ACE inhibitor or an ARB. (C) 1.2 Treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB may be considered in normotensivepeople with diabetes and microalbumin-uria. (C) 1.3 Albuminuria reduction may be consid- ered a treatment target in DKD. (C) BACKGROUND This CPR addresses the evidence for treatment of normotensive patients who have diabetes andelevated albuminuria with ACE inhibitors andARBs. RAS inhibition effectively reduces albu-minuria progression and improves clinical out-comes in hypertensive patients with DKD, butrelatively few studies, particularly of antihyper-tensive agents, have specically recruited normo-tensive people with diabetes and elevated albu-minuria. Although there is a greater body ofevidence that evaluates ACE inhibitors in type 1diabetes and ARBs in type 2 diabetes (Table 44to Table 46), the Work Group views their relativebenets as interchangeable for early and latestages of DKD. Accordingly, the Work Groupassumes, as in Guideline 3, that a class effectexists across these agents, although several indi-vidual agents of each class have not been testedwith clinical end points in kidney disease. Thisassumption is based on consistency among stud-ies with agents of either class and it reflects theopinion of the Work Group. Nevertheless, theeffectiveness of individual agents may differ. The role of albuminuria change as a surrogate end point for clinical outcomes in the setting ofDKD also is discussed. Albuminuria usually ispresent in DKD. Many studies in people withdiabetes and microalbuminuria or macroalbumin-uria have targeted stabilization or reduction in albuminuria levels as surrogate end points forprogression of kidney disease. Studies evaluat-ing interventions aimed at reducing albuminuriaprimarily used ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Relationships between glomerular structural lesions and the presence or absence of microalbu-minuria in diabetes are not straightforward. Inaddition, intrapatient variability in albuminuriameasurements is large, and there is controversyabout the standardization of the measurementitself. For all these reasons, the Work Groupconcluded that the evidence for using albumin-uria as a surrogate marker for clinical outcomeswas not sufciently strong to merit a guidelinestatement. In turn, this conclusion influenced theWork Group's interpretation of the strength ofthe evidence for use of ACE inhibitors or ARBsin diabetic patients who are normotensive andhave either macroalbuminuria or microalbumin-uria. Therefore, the evidence ratings in CPR 1were downgraded from those given for corre-sponding statements in the KDOQI Guidelineson Hypertension and Antihypertensive microalbuminuria 30 300 mg/g, and ofmacroalbuminuria, ACR greater than 300 mg/g(Guideline 1). The denition of hypertension isblood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg or greater(Guideline 3). Normotensive people with diabetes and macroalbuminuria should receive an ACEinhibitor or an ARB. (Moderate/Weak) In type 1 diabetes with macroalbuminuria, ACE inhibitors decrease albuminuria and reducethe risk of clinical outcomes regardless of thepresence or absence of hypertension. A random-ized controlled trial in people with type 1 diabe-tes and macroalbuminuria found that ACE inhibi-tors reduced the risk of the combined outcome ofdoubling of serum creatinine level, CKD stage 5,and death. 168A quarter of the participants were American Journal of Kidney Diseases, Vol 49, No 2, Suppl 2 (February), 2007: pp S109-S115 S109Table 44.

A 300-mg daily dose of irbesartan re-duced proteinuria levels (signicance not re-ported) and the risk of doubling of serumcreatinine level compared with 10 mg daily ofamlodipine or placebo in mostly hypertensivepeople with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. 169 In another study, losartan signicantly reducedthe ACR and the risks of serum creatinine level comparedwith placebo. 167These 2 studies had very few participants with normal blood pressure. Overall, patients with diabetes, macroalbumin- uria, and normal blood pressure rarely wereincluded in the available studies. Therefore, evi-dence for ACE-inhibitor or ARB treatment inthese patients was considered moderate to weak.Nevertheless, based on this limited evidence, theWork Group recommends treatment with an ACEinhibitor or an ARB in this group of patients. In normotensive people with diabetes and microalbuminuria, use of an ACEinhibitor or an ARB may be considered.(Weak) Few studies have evaluated ACE inhibitors or ARBs for the treatment or prevention of mi-croalbuminuria in normotensive people with type1 diabetes. A meta-analysis of clinical trials inpeople with type 1 diabetes found that ACEinhibitors reduced both the level of albuminuriaand progression from microalbuminuria to mac-roalbuminuria in normotensive subjects. 203In addition, a recent study (N /H1100573) found that only 8% of participants treated with 10 mg of enala-pril daily compared with 31% of participantsreceiving a placebo developed microalbumin-uria. 204 Because most people with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria have hypertension, few studies haveevaluated normotensive people with type 2 diabe-tes and microalbuminuria. One small study (N /H11005 94) found that enalapril reduced pro-gression 30% ( with only of patients in the treat-ment group progressing versus 42% in the pla-cebo group. 206Similarly, another study (N /H1100562)Table 46.

Recommendations for Diabetes and CKD S112found that enalapril signicantly reduced albu- minuria after 4 years of treatment, whereas par-ticipants randomly assigned to placebo experi-enced an increase in albuminuria. 207Another small study (N /H1100519) in normotensive people with either microalbuminuria or macroalbumin-uria found that albuminuria increased over 2years in the placebo group, but decreased signi-cantly with perindopril treatment ( P/H110210.05). 205 Similarly, ACE inhibitors may decrease albumin-uria and reduce the risk of kidney and CVDoutcomes. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evalu-ation (HOPE) trial found that ramipril reducedthe risk of the combined end point of myocardialinfarction, stroke, or death due to CVD in peoplewith type 2 diabetes. It also reduced progressionto macroalbuminuria in subjects with microalbu-minuria at baseline, but did not lower the risk ofnew cases of microalbuminuria. 104 In the opinion of the Work Group, a change in albuminuria or transition between categories (nor-moalbuminuria, microalbuminuria, or macroalbu-minuria) in normotensive people with diabetes isrelatively weak evidence for change in status orprognosis of kidney disease. The rationale forthis opinion is as follows. First, level of albumin-uria or crossing an ACR threshold is not aclinical end point. Second, RAS inhibitors mightmask the progression of DKD marked by albu-minuria. In type 1 diabetes, withdrawal of ACEinhibition caused a rapid increase in albumin-uria, 208and in type 2 diabetes, discontinuation of irbesartan in the IRMA-2 study prompted a rapidreturn to pretreatment levels of albuminuria inpatients receiving the lower dose of irbesartanand a partial return to pretreatment levels inthose receiving the higher dose of irbesartan. 209 Third, few normotensive patients with diabetesand microalbuminuria have been enrolled in clini-cal trials of treatments for kidney disease. Thedemonstrated benets of RAS inhibition for re-ducing and stabilizing albuminuria were noted,yet in the absence of studies with clinical endpoints, the Work Group found this evidenceinsufcient to justify a higher rating. Albuminuria change may be an acceptable surrogate marker for clinicaloutcomes in DKD. (Weak/Opinion) Studies testing the hypothesis that albumin- uria reduction predicts improved prognosis inDKD have been performed only as secondaryanalyses of studies of ARB treatment in peoplewith type 2 diabetes and macroalbumin-uria. 210-212In these studies, level of albuminuria reduction was a marker of decreased risk ofadverse outcomes. Observational analyses fromthe RENAAL trial found that the magnitude ofalbuminuria to decreased kidney end points(Fig 25 ). 210These ndings raise the hypothesis that albuminuria reduction per se has benecialeffects. However, an alternative possibility isthat albuminuria reduction is a marker for pa-tients with less severe kidney and vascular dis-ease. A strategy of targeting treatment of albumin-uria, in addition to blood pressure and other riskfactors, has not been tested prospectively inpatients with diabetes. Furthermore, to date, only Figure 23. Hazard ra- tios for CVD and heart fail- ure end points as a functionof percent change in6-month albuminuria in theRENAAL trial.Relation Reprinted with per-mission. of Albuminuria in Pts. With Diabetes & Albuminuria as Surrogate Marker S113these secondary analyses from the RENAAL trial and IDNT have directly correlated albumin-uria/proteinuria reduction with clinical benet. New interventions to prevent or slow the pro- gression of DKD are urgently needed. Interven-tions that reduce albuminuria or delay its in-crease may be promising as potential therapiesfor DKD. However, in the opinion of the WorkGroup, there currently is insufcient evidence toassume that lowering albuminuria levels willnecessarily lead to improvements in clinical out-comes, such as progression to CKD stage 5,CVD events, or death. Conversely, the failure toreduce albuminuria does not preclude a bene-cial clinical effect on DKD from a potentialintervention. Therefore, to be considered efca- cious, potential treatments for DKD must demon-strate benets not only on albuminuria reduction,but also on such clinical end points as CKD stage5, CVD events, or death. 213LIMITATIONS Most studies that assessed the efcacy of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in people with diabetes andalbuminuria were conducted in people with hy-pertension or in a mix of subjects with andwithout hypertension. Therefore, there are notabundant data to direct therapy for normotensivepeople with diabetes who have microalbumin-uria or macroalbuminuria. However, the consen-sus of the Work Group was that the benets ofACE inhibitors and ARBs for reducing albumin-uria and delaying kidney disease progression arelikely to be similar among most people withdiabetes and albuminuria, regardless of theirblood pressure level. In addition, in people with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria may represent early kidneyinjury or may be a manifestation of endothelial dysfunction and generalized vascular injury. Therelative contribution of these 2 causes may vary Figure 24.

Given the uncertainty regarding the presence of kidney disease in subjects withmicroalbuminuria and the lack of clinical endpoints in trials of patients with diabetes andmicroalbuminuria, the Work Group's recommen-dations for use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs innormotensive people with diabetes and mi-croalbuminuria are less strong than in those withmacroalbuminuria. IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES In normotensive people with diabetes and albu- minuria, the target dose of ACE inhibitors orARBs is unknown. In the absence of side effectsor adverse events (eg, hyperkalemia), the WorkGroup recommends titration up to the maximum approved dose. Placing people with microalbuminuria and diabetes on therapy with an ACE inhibitor orARB may lead to less attention to glycemiccontrol. The National Health and NutritionExamination Survey (NHANES) 1999 to 2000demonstrated that glycemic control has wors-ened in patients with diabetes and microalbu-minuria, which may be caused by health careproviders believing that RAS inhibition willreduce albuminuria and thus protect patientsfrom clinical end points. 484The Work Group emphasizes the importance of glycemic con- trol to prevent and treat albuminuria, as well asto reduce the overall risks of diabetes.Mgmt. of Albuminuria in Normotensive Pts.

(C) 2.2 Target BMI for people with diabetes and CKD should be within the normal range(18.5-24.9 kg/m 2). (C) BACKGROUND This CPR provides a summary of current evidence for a multifaceted approach to interven-tion in the management of diabetes and CKD.Studies evaluating multifaceted interventions andvarious other approaches to reducing albumin-uria or improving clinical outcomes were re-viewed ( Table 47 ). RATIONALE The care of people with diabetes and CKD should incorporate a multifacetedapproach to intervention.(Moderate/Weak) The Steno Study was a randomized trial that investigated a multifaceted treatment approach(intensive intervention) versus usual care inpeople with type 2 diabetes and microalbumin-uria. The intensive intervention had multipletargets, including behavioral modication andpharmacological therapies for hyperglycemia, hy-pertension (emphasizing with aspirin, and vita-min/mineral supplementation ( Table 48 ). Compared with usual care, patients receiving theintensive intervention had signicantly largermean decreases in systolic blood pressure (11mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (4 mm Hg),fasting plasma glucose (34 mg/dL), glycosylatedhemoglobin (0.7%), triglycerides (50 mg/dL),total cholesterol (47 mg/dL), and These changes corresponded to a meanreduction of albuminuria (albumin reduced 20 mg/24 h) for the intensive intervention, whereasthere was a mean increase in patients receivingusual care (albumin increased 30 mg/24 h). neuropathy, compos-ite or death ( Fig 26 ). 45,46 Other interventions using some of the individual components, such as aspirin or vitamins C or E,did not reduce albuminuria in smaller short-termstudies. 489,490Furthermore, vitamin E did not prevent the development or progression of albu- minuria or reduce CVD or mortality in a largelong-term study of people with type 2 diabe-tes. 491 As key components of multifaceted interven- tion, clinicians should encourage people withdiabetes and CKD to adopt healthy lifestyles thatinclude improved nutrition, exercise, and smok-ing cessation. Although not clearly associatedwith better kidney outcomes (such as doubling ofserum creatinine or CKD stage 5), control ofhyperglycemia, blood pressure, and lipids im-prove other relevant health outcomes in peoplewith diabetes irrespective of the presence ofCKD. For example, although glycemic controlhas not been proven benecial for kidney out-comes, it reduces risks for retinopathy and neu-ropathy. 134,136,367,492Additionally, treatment of elevated LDL-C improves cardiovascular out- comes in people with diabetes (except for thosewith LDL-C concentrations between 120 and190 mg/dL who initiate statin therapy while on hemodialysis therapy, Guideline 5). 100,177 A critical component of the comprehensive care of people with diabetes and CKD is manage-ment of diabetes according to current standards(Guideline 2). Targets for glycemic control shouldbe achieved with a combination of lifestyle ap-proaches, behavioral self-management, and medi-cines (Guidelines 2 and 5, CPR 4). Particularattention should be given to appropriate screen-ing for common comorbidities and referral tospecialists, such as those for eye and foot care.Considering the greatly increased CVD risk inpeople with diabetes and CKD, risk factors shouldbe managed with a goal of minimizing CVD American Journal of Kidney Diseases, Vol 49, No 2, Suppl 2 (February), 2007: pp S116-S119 S116Table 47.

Multifaceted Approach to Intervention in Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease S117events, as well as reducing progression of kidney disease (Background, Guidelines 2 to 4). Treat-ments, such as aspirin and /H9252-blockers, which are known to reduce CVD risk in other high-riskpopulations, should be strongly considered inthose with diabetes and CKD. A normal BMI (18.5 to 24.9 kg/m 2) may reduce the risk of loss of kidney function and CVD. (Opinion) Estimates from the NHANES indicate that 31% of the US population is obese (BMI /H1102230 kg/m2),214and obesity is a risk factor for diabe - tes, hypertension, and CVD. There is a growingTable 48.

Nevertheless, obesity is associatedwith the development of proteinuria and loss ofkidney function. The development of metabolicrisk factors, as well as adipocyte-derived factors,in response to obesity may lead to kidney dam-age, albuminuria, and loss of glomerular ltra-tion rate (GFR). Mechanisms that may play arole in the relationship between obesity andCKD are summarized in Table 49 . Maintaining a normal BMI (18.5 to 24.9 kg/m 2) reduces vari - ous risk factors for CKD and CVD, which maydecrease the development or progression of thesediseases. Weight loss should be achieved by abalanced reduction in calorie intake, rather thanby diets that derive the majority of calories fromanimal protein (Guideline 5). Weight manage-ment should include a plan for regular physicalexercise. LIMITATIONS Multifaceted intervention includes components that may not be directly benecial for kidney-related outcomes. Because RAS inhibitors are amajor component of the intensive intervention,importance of the other components is uncertain.The design of the multifaceted intervention makesit difcult to determine which facets are associatedwith reduced risk. Whether people already treatedwith RAS inhibitors would benet from intensiveintervention was not addressed. Generalizability of this intervention to other clinical settings is unknown. Importantly, studiesof multifaceted intervention have been per-formed only in patients with type 2 diabetes withmicroalbuminuria. Although multifaceted inter- vention seems likely to benet people with type1 diabetes and CKD, or later stages of CKD intype 2 diabetes, this opinion is based solely onextrapolation. Prospective studies are required todetermine benets and risks of multifaceted inter-vention across stages of CKD in both types 1 and2 diabetes. Studies of various treatments with the poten- tial to influence CKD (albuminuria) in the settingof diabetes were reviewed. However, these treat-ments were either ineffective (hormone therapywith estrogen/progestin in postmenopausalwomen) 493or the studies were inconclusive (pros - taglandin analogues).494,495Whether additional types of treatment will provide incremental ben- et to the previously described multifaceted inter-vention is unknown. The health benets of maintaining a normal BMI are not dened in people with diabetes andCKD. Optimal targets for BMI and weight lossshould be determined. IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES The Steno intensive intervention study is a model for a multidisciplinary team approach tocare of people with diabetes and microalbumin-uria. This specialty clinic-based approach is usedsuccessfully for other medical conditions (eg,heart failure and human immunodeciency virus/acquired immune deciency syndrome [HIV/AIDS] care), but it requires a critical mass ofpatients and the presence of specially trainedhealth care personnel. Other types of interventions that have been used for guideline implementation include com-puter reminders, provider feedback, and providerincentives. Because of the multifaceted compo-nents to the care of both diabetes and CKD, theclinical team approach may be the most effectivein settings where feasible. These teams typicallyare established by large health care organiza-tions. Prevention and treatment of obesity are major public health concerns. Effective, safe, and sus-tained weight loss interventions are elusive, andthe impact on relevant clinical outcomes is un-clear. A longitudinal clinical team approach maybe an effective strategy for treatment of obesityin the setting of diabetes and CKD.Table 49.

Racial/ethnic differ-ences in susceptibility to DKD also may play arole. In pregnant women, the presence of dia-betes and CKD may adversely affect the healthof both the mother and her offspring. 3.1 Screening and interventions for diabetes and CKD should focus on populations atgreatest risk. (C) 3.2 Although management of diabetes and CKD in special populations should followthe same principles as management in themajority population, there are specialconsiderations in the treatment of chil-dren, adolescents, and the elderly. (C) 3.3 Population-based interventions may be the most cost-effective means for address-ing the burden of CKD in special popula-tions. Implementation and evaluation ofpopulation-based interventions shouldtake into account the heterogeneity of thepopulations at risk. (C) 3.4 Specialists in high-risk pregnancy and kidney disease should co-manage preg-nancy in women with diabetes and CKD.(C) 3.5 Treatment of DKD with RAS inhibitors before pregnancy may improve fetal andmaternal outcomes, but these medicinesshould be discontinued as soon as a men-strual period is missed or after a positivepregnancy test. (C) 3.6 Insulin should be used to control hypergly- cemia if pharmacological therapy is neces-sary in pregnant women with diabetesand CKD. (C) BACKGROUND This CPR addresses 4 distinct, but overlap- ping, groups with diabetes and CKD: childrenand adolescents, pregnant women, the elderly,and members of disadvantaged and transitionalpopulations. The latter group is made up predomi-nantly, but not exclusively, of people from less-developed countries undergoing economic andsocial change and by racial and ethnic minorities in developed countries. In the United States, the burden of diabetes and CKD is borne disproportionately by ethnicand racial minorities. Worldwide, populations ofdeveloping countries appear to be at greatest riskof developing diabetes and CKD during the nextseveral decades. Early intervention in these high-risk populations provides the best opportunityfor reducing the morbidity and mortality associ-ated with diabetes and CKD. Children 79and elderly people496who are members of these populations appear to be at particularly high risk of morbidity associated with DKD. Moreover,the number of young women with diabetes whobecome pregnant and already have kidney dis-ease is increasing, yet little is known about theeffect of diabetes and CKD on these women oron their offspring. This CPR describes the burden of diabetes and CKD in special populations and suggests strate-gies for improving care in these highly suscep-tible groups. Maternal and fetal outcomes amongpregnant women with type 1 diabetes and CKDalso are described. However, few studies haveevaluated the benet of treating pregnant womenwho have diabetes and CKD with interventionsaimed at decreasing the risk of maternal and fetaladverse outcomes, and none of these studiesincluded women with type 2 diabetes or withCKD stage 5 treated by either kidney transplanta-tion or dialysis. RATIONALE The worldwide epidemic of diabetes disproportionately affects the developingworld. (Strong) The global burden of diabetes is expected to double between 2000 and 2030, with the greatestincreases in prevalence occurring in the MiddleEast, sub-Saharan Africa, and India. 19Much of this increase will be driven by urbanization and the increase in the population older than 65years. Countries with the highest numbers of estimated cases of diabetes in 2000 and projec-tions for 2030 are shown in Table 50 . Develop- ment of diabetes during the childbearing yearsalso will increase, primarily in the developing American Journal of Kidney Diseases, Vol 49, No 2, Suppl 2 (February), 2007: pp S120-S130 S120countries ( Fig 27 ).19Projections of the future burden of diabetes in the US population suggest that the prevalence of diabetes will increase165% between 2000 and 2050, from 11 to 29million, with the greatest increases in the popula-tion older than 75 years and among AfricanAmericans. 18 As the population of patients with diabetes with signicant duration of disease grows, re-ports of a dramatically increasing burden ofdiabetic CKD are appearing from Africa, 22,23 India,24Pacic Islands,25and Asia,26,27where infectious disease previously posed the greatest threat.28Increased risk and more rapid progres - sion of DKD29,30also have been reported in immigrants to Europe from South Asia.31,32 Minorities bear a disproportionate burden of diabetic CKD in the United States.(Strong) Disparities in the incidence of diabetic CKD stage 5 among racial/ethnic groups in the UnitedStates have existed for many years, but themagnitude of these disparities has increased inrecent years ( Fig 28 ). Between 1999 and 2002, a total of 35% of the new cases of CKD stage 5 dueto diabetes in the United States were members ofracial minorities, with incidence rates 4 times ashigh among African Americans and NativeAmericans than among whites. 4Excess burden of CKD also is well documented among Pacic Islanders497,498and Hispanics.499Several stud - ies suggest a greater risk and more rapid develop-ment of DKD in racial minorities, and thesestudies attribute the increased susceptibility toboth genetic factors 496,500-503and socioeco - nomic barriers, including decreased access tocare. 504 Special populations may demonstrate different patterns of comorbid conditionsand a different course of CKD than themajority population. (Moderate) The natural history of diabetic complications may be falsely perceived as benign when diabe-tes rst emerges as a major problem in a popula-tion because few people will have diabetes ofsufcient duration to develop the usual complica-tions. 505Nevertheless, once diabetes has estab - lished itself, differences in the rate of develop-ment and frequency of diabetic complications,including CKD, have emerged among racial/ethnic groups. 82,506,507These differences may be attributable to such factors as age at onset of diabetes,82diet, exercise patterns, living condi - tions, access to medical care, education, infec-tions, environmental toxins, and inherited suscep-tibility. The frequency of nondiabetic CKD differs among special populations with diabetes.(Moderate) Higher rates of non-DKD in people with diabe- tes have been documented in Zuni Indians 508and Aborigines,509emphasizing the importance of a careful diagnostic evaluation in patients with diabetes from high-risk groups. In populationswith decreased access to care, when care is oftenreceived only late in the course of disease, thecause of kidney disease may be attributed, byTable 50. Countries With the Highest Numbers of Estimated Cases of Diabetes for 2000 and 2030 Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease in Special Populations S121default, to the most common cause in that group (eg, hypertension in African Americans510and type 2 diabetes in Native Americans) without adequate investigation. Diabetes and CKD are increasing among children and adolescents.(Strong/Moderate) The worldwide increase in childhood obesity has increased the prevalence of type 2 diabetesamong children and adolescents. 511Whereas all populations in the United States have shown dramatic increases in the overall prevalence ofobesity ( /H1102210% in 2- to 5-year-olds and /H1102215% in 6- to 19-year-olds), the greatest increases haveoccurred in ethnic and racial minorities. 512At the same time, there has been a worldwide increase in the incidence of type 1 diabetes, particularlyamong children younger than 5 years old. 17Given that duration of diabetes, rather than age of onset, is the more predominant risk factor for DKD,increasing rates of both type 1 and type 2 diabe-tes in children and adolescents undoubtedly willlead to an increase in DKD in these age groups, anding that is already being reported in somepopulations. 79,80,82 In many racial/ethnic groups, type 2 diabetes has already become\u2014or is rapidly becoming\u2014the predominant cause of childhood diabe-tes. 72,513,514While optimal treatment of child - hood type 2 diabetes is essential to reduce theburden of DKD, public health interventions thatpromote proper diet and increase exercise mayoffer the best opportunity to reduce disease bur-den through primary prevention of obesity anddiabetes. 71 Children and adolescents with diabetes and CKD have special treatmentconsiderations. (Weak/Opinion) CKD stage 3 or greater due to DKD is rare in children and adolescents. Also, children and ado-lescents are more likely to revert from microalbu-minuria to normoalbuminuria than adults (seeGuideline 1). Nonetheless, those children andadolescents with diabetes and CKD pose a num-ber of unique concerns. Accordingly, specialistsin diabetes and kidney disease with experience inthese age groups should be involved in their care.Data regarding treatment of hyperglycemia, hy-pertension, and dyslipidemia in children withdiabetes and adolescents with CKD are almostnonexistent. However, therapeutic lifestylechanges (diet, exercise, and weight loss, whenappropriate) are prudent for each of these riskfactors. In the opinion of the Work Group, treat-ment goals for glycemia in type 1 diabetes andCKD should follow the American Diabetes Asso-ciation (ADA) Standards of Care for childrenand adolescents ( Table 51 ). 174Given the greater risk of hypoglycemia in those with countries 0102030405060 20-44 45-64 65+ 20-44 45-64 65+ World 020406080100120140160180200 20-44 45-64 with diabetes (millions)2000 2030 Figure 27.

In patients with type 2 dia-betes, therapeutic lifestyle changes should be theinitial interventions for hyperglycemia. 513If life - style changes do not succeed in achieving a goalof near-normal glycemia (HbA 1c/H110217%), drug therapy should be initiated.513Although the ADA recommends oral agents as rst-line therapy for children or adolescents with type 2 diabetes, onlymetformin is approved by the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) for this use\u2014and only inchildren older than 10 years. However, met-formin should be avoided in children and adoles-cents with diabetes and CKD. Cautions regard-ing the use of other oral agents in children andadolescents with diabetes and CKD are the sameas those described for adults (Guideline 2, Table 22), with the exception that TZDs should not be used because of concerns about liver toxicity dueto the experience with troglitazone. According to the NKF-KDOQI CPGs on Hypertension and Antihypertensive Agents inCKD, the target blood pressure in children andadolescents with CKD is less than the 90 thpercen - tile for age, sex, and height or less than 130/80mm Hg, whichever is lower. 5The ADA recom - mends a similar goal in children and adolescentswith diabetes. 174Therefore, in the opinion of the Work Group, a target blood pressure less than the 90thpercentile for age, sex, and height or less than 130/80 mm Hg, whichever is lower, should be applied to children and adolescents with both Table 51.

Although not approved for use by the FDA, both the NKF and the ADAsuggest that ACE inhibitors are the drugs ofchoice for treatment of blood pressure in chil-dren and adolescents with diabetes and/orCKD. 5,174ARBs are reasonable alternatives if ACE inhibitors are not tolerated.5Adolescent girls must be counseled fully and repeatedly about pregnancy prevention while on ACE inhibi-tors or ARBs and about immediate discontinua-tion of these agents should pregnancy be sus-pected. Drug therapy should be considered for either severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides /H11022500 mg/dL) or marked elevations in LDL-C ( /H11022160 mg/dL) that are unresponsive to control of hyper-glycemia or therapeutic lifestyle changes as out-lined in the NKF-KDOQI CPGs on ManagingDyslipidemias in CKD. 6Fibric acid derivatives are the preferred agents for hypertriglyceride- mia, but they are not FDA approved for use inchildren or adolescents. Statins are preferred forelevated LDL-C levels, and atorvastatin has re-ceived FDA approval for use in children andadolescents with familial hypercholesterolemia.The ADA suggests an LDL-C target of less than100 mg/dL in children and adolescents withdiabetes. 174Adolescent girls must be counseled fully and repeatedly about pregnancy prevention while on statin therapy and about immediatediscontinuation of these agents should preg-nancy be suspected. Children and adolescents should be referred to a registered dietitian experienced in managingdiabetes and CKD in this age group. For thosewho are obese, weight loss strategies shouldinclude both increased physical activity and awell-balanced diet. As per Guideline 5, high-protein diets ( /H1102220% of calories) should be avoided in children and adolescents with diabe-tes and CKD. However, low-protein diets ( /H1102110% of calories) also should be avoided because ofconcerns about providing adequate nutrition forgrowth and development and because proof ofefcacy is lacking in this age group. Elderly people with diabetes and CKD have special treatment considerations.(Weak/Opinion) Elderly people with diabetes and CKD often have a number of comorbidities, particularlyCVD, as well as cognitive and functional im- pairments. Therefore, the benets of intensiverisk factor management should be consideredjudiciously in light of these increased risks.Because hypoglycemia and hypotension areparticular concerns, less intensive goals shouldbe considered based on individual circum-stances. Drug therapies for hyperglycemia, hy-pertension, and dyslipidemia can be used as inother patients with diabetes and CKD. How-ever, drugs should be started at low doses andcarefully titrated to monitor for responses andside effects. The greater frequency of comorbid conditions in the elderly with diabetes is responsible for agreater prevalence of elevated albuminuria unre-lated to DKD. Accordingly, the appearance ofelevated albuminuria is less likely to be a sign ofprogressive kidney disease, even in those withdiabetes of long duration. 515GFR may be a more specic marker of DKD in the elderly compared with albuminuria.516Development of diabetic complications, including CKD, is associated strongly with mortality in elderly people,517and poor outcomes are associated with nonadherence to the medical regimen.518The high cost for caring for elderly people with CKD may be reduced through the aggressive management ofCVD. 519 The presence of microalbuminuria in pregnant women with type 1 diabetesincreases risks of adverse maternal andchild outcomes, including preeclampsia and preterm delivery. Macroalbuminuriafurther increases these risks and also mayincrease risk of perinatal mortality.(Strong/Moderate) Case-control and cohort studies involving more than 1,300 pregnant women with type 1 diabeteswere reviewed to identify adverse maternal andchild outcomes in pregnancies complicated byboth diabetes and CKD ( Table 52 ) and the predic- tors of these adverse outcomes ( Table 53 ). All entries in the summary tables refer to thesestudies in type 1 diabetes. Microalbuminuriaincreases risks of preeclampsia and preterm deliv-ery up to 8 times. 520,521Macroalbuminuria fur - ther increases these risks to more than 30times 522-524(Table 52 ).

Inthe opinion of the Work Group, pregnant womenwith diabetes and CKD should be co-managedby specialists in high-risk pregnancies and kid-ney disease. Albuminuria in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes does not increase the risk ofworsening of DKD unless kidney functionalso is impaired. (Strong/Moderate) Only a few studies have explored the pro- gression of DKD in pregnant women. Clini-cally signicant worsening of kidney diseaseis apparent only in women who already haveincreased baseline levels of serum creatinineand albuminuria. These patients have a greaterGFR decline during pregnancy and a higherrisk of progression to CKD stage 5 after deliv-ery. 520,524,529-532 The effect of CKD on the outcome of pregnancy in women with type 2 diabetes isunknown. (Opinion) Due to the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes in younger women, some may becomepregnant after the development of kidney dis-ease. In the absence of data regarding pregnancyin women with type 2 diabetes and CKD, it is theopinion of the Work Group that they should bemanaged according to the same principles aswomen with type 1 diabetes and CKD becausetheir risks are likely to be at least as great as inwomen with type 1 diabetes. Medical management of CKD should be adjusted during pregnancy in women withdiabetes. (Weak/Opinion) Recommendations regarding the medical management of hypertension, hyperglycemia,dyslipidemia, and nutrition in pregnant womenwith diabetes and CKD are outlined in Table 54.Table 52 (Cont'd).

Methyldopa and labetolol arepreferred agents tes, macroalbuminuria, and normal GFR whowere treated with captopril, 37.5 to 75 mg/d,for at least 6 months before pregnancy anddiscontinued immediately after a missed men-strual period or a positive pregnancy testshowed no deterioration of kidney function 2years after delivery. 536,537ACE inhibitors and ARBs have adverse effects on the fetus during the second and third trimester, including acutekidney failure in neonates, lung toxicity, andskull hypoplasia. 538Emerging evidence - gests that risk of fetal abnormalities (congeni-tal malformations of the cardiovascular sys-tem, central nervous system, and kidney) duringACE-inhibitor treatment extends to the rsttrimester. 539Therefore, RAS inhibitors shouldbe discontinued immediately after a missed menstrual period or a positive pregnancy testin women with diabetes and CKD. 5Women and adolescent girls with childbearing poten- tial who are treated with RAS inhibitors shouldbe counseled about these risks. Treatment of hypertension should follow the guidelines adopted by the American College ofObstetrics and Gynecology. 533Because antihy - pertensive therapy does not reduce the risk ofpreeclampsia and may cause potential harm tothe fetus, hypertension should be treated cau-tiously. Based on extensive experience, meth-yldopa has long been considered the drug ofchoice by many experts. Labetolol now also isconsidered a preferred agent because com-bined /H9251- and /H9252-blockade may better preserve uterine perfusion. /H9252-Blockers are considered reasonable add-on or alternative therapies.However, some data suggest that atenolol earlyin pregnancy may cause fetal growth retarda-tion.

Diuretics usually are avoided in pregnancy, particularly when there are con-cerns about preeclampsia. However, if a preg-nant woman with chronic hypertension hasbeen treated with a diuretic before conception,it is not necessary to discontinue the therapy aslong as there are no signs of preeclampsia.Nevertheless, most experts recommend reduc-ing the diuretic dose and carefully monitoringthe patient. 534,535 Insulin is the preferred pharmacological therapy for hyperglycemia in pregnantwomen with diabetes and CKD. (Opinion) Oral antidiabetic medicines have successfully controlled hyperglycemia in women with type 2diabetes during pregnancy, but these studies didnot include patients with CKD. 540,541In the opinion of the Work Group, insulin remains the pharmacological treatment of choice for hyper-glycemia during pregnancy in women with diabe-tes and CKD, and goals for glycemic controlshould be the same as those for women withoutCKD. 542-544 Dyslipidemia should not be treated during pregnancy in women with diabetes andCKD. (Opinion) Pharmacological treatment of lipid abnormali- ties during pregnancy is not currently recom-mended due to potential risks to the fetus. 545 Nevertheless, maternal hypercholesterolemia isassociated with the development of fetal athero-sclerosis, 546so this recommendation may change as results of additional studies of statins and other agents during pregnancy become available.However, until such studies are available, it isthe opinion of the Work Group that statins andother lipid-lowering therapies should be discon-tinued after a missed menstrual period or a posi-tive pregnancy test result in women with diabe-tes and CKD. Women and adolescent girls withchildbearing potential who are treated with lipid-lowering therapies should be counseled aboutthese risks. Dietary protein intake should not be restricted during pregnancy in women withdiabetes and CKD. (Opinion) Limitation of dietary protein in women with diabetes and CKD should be liberalized duringpregnancy to ensure adequate nutrition for the fetus. In the opinion of the Work Group, thesepatients should be counseled to increase theirintake of protein to 1 to 1.2 g/kg (prepregnancyweight) per day. Pregnant women with diabetes and CKD stage 5 treated by kidney transplantationor dialysis should be managed according tothe recommendations for earlier stages ofCKD. (Opinion) Pregnant women with diabetes and CKD stage 5 (kidney transplantation or dialysis) have notbeen included in treatment studies. Therefore, inthe opinion of the Work Group, strategies for themanagement of hyperglycemia, hypertension, anddyslipidemia may be extrapolated from the rec-ommendations for women with earlier stages ofCKD. The scope of the evidence review did notinclude specic management of CKD stage 5 inpregnancy. IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES Population-based interventions in special populations, including systematic communityscreening and surveillance, have been success-ful in reducing the burden of DKD, particu-larly when they are applied early in the courseof the disease. 547,548Such approaches, includ - ing the NKF Kidney Early Evaluation Pro-gram, are effective in identifying asymptom-atic people with CKD from high-riskpopulations. 549Interventions targeted at high- risk special populations and implemented in the primary care and community settings havereduced the rate of diabetic complications,including CKD stage 5. 550-552Successful com - munity-based model programs have beenimplemented in Australian Aboriginal commu-nities 553and rural India.554 Poor access to care and late referral for neph- rological intervention are associated with pooroutcomes in United States racial minorities. 555 Improving outcomes for special populations will require not only changes in standards of clinicalcare, but also efforts to improve access to carefor these high-risk groups. Understanding thecultural and socioeconomic milieu of the targetpopulations is essential for successful interven-tions. 556Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease in Special Populations S129Addressing the increased burden of diabetes and CKD in developing countries where health re-sources are severely limited will require creativityand collaboration with public health professionals.Unfortunately, the increase in diabetes and otherchronic diseases is occurring in many countries that are still experiencing a high prevalence of infec-tious disease, including an increase in the burden ofHIV/AIDS. Limited resources may be strained bythese competing health problems.Recommendations for Diabetes and CKD S130CLINICAL PRACTICE RECOMMENDATION 4: BEHAVIORAL SELF-MANAGEMENT IN DIABETES AND CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE Behavioral self-management in diabetes and CKD is particularly challenging because ofthe intensive nature of the diabetes regimen.Education alone is not sufcient to promoteand sustain healthy behavior change, particu-larly with such a complex regimen. 4.1 Self-management strategies should be key components of a multifaceted treatmentplan with attention to multiple behaviors:(C) Monitoring and treatment of glycemia, Blood pressure, Nutrition, Smoking cessation, Exercise, and Adherence to medicines. BACKGROUND The success of strategies to promote glyce- mic control and minimize progression of CKDdepends upon patient self-management, or theability and willingness of the patient to changeand subsequently maintain appropriate behav-iors regarding diet, physical activity, medi-cines, self-monitoring, and medical follow-upvisits. Adherence to complex regimens often ispoor. Interventions to enhance adherence re-quire intensive education and behavioral coun-seling. Maintenance of adherence requires on-going support from a variety of health careprofessionals. RATIONALE Due to complexity of the behavioral self-management regimen for diabetes andCKD and high frequency of nonadherence,alternative approaches to traditionaleducation should be considered.(Moderate/Weak) Self-management requires intensive education and behavioral adjustments in many areas, aswell as taking a variety of medicines. 561Given the risks associated with diabetes and CKD, people with these conditions should engage in arigorous self-monitoring regimen that typicallyincludes blood glucose and blood pressure; exam-ining skin integrity; obtaining regular foot, eye, medical, and dental examinations; and reportingcomplications to their health care providers. Glu-cose self-monitoring is particularly important forbalancing physical activity and diet against medi-cines to control glycemia and prevent or impedethe progression of complications. 116,134,562-564 This regimen requires tremendous effort on thepart of the patient. Efforts to adopt new behav-iors may fail due to inadequate knowledge; lackof a disease-management that exceedscognitive capacity. To our knowledge, no studieshave specically examined adherence of peoplewith diabetes and CKD to self-management regi-mens. However, the challenges of modifyingbehavior to achieve adherence and successfulself-management for those with diabetes are wellestablished ( Table 55 ). A recent meta-analysis examining factors that influence adherence to disease manage-ment regimens found that patients have theleast difculty with circumscribed regimens(eg, medicines) and the most difculty withregimens requiring extensive behavior change(eg, dietary change). Perhaps because of theextensive behavior change required of thosewith diabetes, patients with diabetes had amongthe lowest rates of adherence across a range of17 disease states, second only to those withsleep disorders. 565A survey of 2,056 adults with diabetes from across the United States found the most frequently reported adherenceproblem was diet, followed by exercise andblood glucose monitoring. 566 Dietary habits that develop over a lifetime can be particularly difcult to change. Indi-vidual perceptions of dietary restrictions, par-ticularly feelings of deprivation, are difcultfor patients and health care professionals toaddress. In addition to personal eating prefer-ences, many foods have social, cultural, and/orreligious meaning to patients, making feelingsof loss even more signicant. In addition, thedietary regimen for diabetes and CKD is com-plex. Ideal self-management requires vigilance American Journal of Kidney Diseases, Vol 49, No 2, Suppl 2 (February), 2007: pp S131-S138 S131Table 55.

Pa-tients should be aware of day-to-day patternsin their blood glucose levels to make informedchoices. However, a study found that patientstypically purchase enough capillary blood sam-pling supplies to self-monitor their blood glu-cose for only 70% of possible days in the rst 4years after diagnosis and for only 50% of daysthereafter. 567Moreover, at least 20% of pa - tients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes donot monitor their blood glucose at all. 568,569 Although glucose meters generally are inexpen-sive and easy to use, glucose testing strips arequite expensive, and some insurance compa-nies provide little or no coverage for thesesupplies. A recently completed systematic review of 20 studies conducted between 1966 and 2003 mea-sured adherence to diabetes medicines ( Table 55). 570The study found that, among patients using oral agents, adherence rates ranged from 36% to 93% and were even lower for insulin.Adherence also was found to be related inverselyto the number of diabetes medicines prescribed.Thus, the addition of medicines for other com-mon comorbid conditions (eg, hypertension anddyslipidemia) is likely to further reduce adher-ence. Rates of adherence to an exercise programranged from 19% to 30% in people with diabe-tes, 571,572indicating that compliance issues im - pact on multiple aspects of disease management.Another study found that only 7% of patientsadhered to all aspects of their diabetes regi-men. 573 The management plan should include careful coordination of care, addressingboth diabetes and CKD. (Moderate/Weak) Although intensive glycemic control reduces diabetes complications, 116,134,562,564once pa - tients develop CKD, there may be a tendency toplace less emphasis on glucose management.While no studies document inattention to glyce-mic control in early-stage CKD, a recent reviewof dialysis patient records found diabetes manage-ment to be suboptimal. 574Individuals with diabe - tes and CKD require the attention of a health careteam that can address social, educational, emo-tional, and medical consequences of both condi-Table 55 (Cont'd).

The ADA has developed Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education.575These standards summarize evidence that self-manage- ment education is most effective when deliveredby a multidisciplinary team. This team shouldinclude a combination of expertise in medicaltreatment, nutrition, teaching skills, and behav-ioral psychology. Each patient should have anindividualized assessment, educational plan, andperiodic reassessment pertaining to educationalneeds. Table 56 lists the components and prin- ciples of a diabetes and CKD self-managementprogram, combining educational elements fromthe ADA Standards, 575Guideline 5 the NKF- KDOQI predictors of nonad - herence. Behavioral adherence should be assessed in all patients, particularly inthose who do not respond to therapy.(Weak/Opinion) Intensive glycemic control may increase the number of hypoglycemic episodes, with the needto increase food intake to cover peak times ofinsulin action. Although DCCT and UKPDS dem-onstrated that patients receiving intensive treat-ment had better glycemic control, they also weremore likely to experience weight gain than thosereceiving usual care. Intensive treatment alsomay mask poor adherence to the treatment regi-men, especially adherence to diet and physicalactivity. Over time, inattention to behavioral as-pects of the regimen may mitigate the potential benets of intensive treatment. Self-management approaches based in behavioral medicine may be effective inenhancing adherence to the managementregimen for diabetes and CKD.(Weak/Opinion) No studies were found of interventions to enhance adherence of individuals to manage-ment regimens for diabetes and CKD. How-ever, 2 meta-analyses have been published thatprovide valuable information about the mosteffective approaches for encouraging adher-ence to the diabetes regimen ( Table 55 ). The rst summarized the results of 72 studies con-ducted between 1980 and 1999. Interventionsthat were collaborative in nature (rather thandidactic/lecture format) resulted in better gly-cemic control, particularly if the interventioncontacts were repetitive and ongoing. Knowl-edge was not consistently related to glycemiccontrol, and factors other than knowledge areneeded to achieve long-term behavioralchange. 576The second conducted a meta- regression analysis on 28 studies between 1990 and 2000 to characterize the components ofbehavioral interventions most likely to resultin improved glycemic control.

Assess and ad dress the patient's beliefs abo ut the nature, cause, and treat ment of their illness. Explain consequences of nonadherence. Promote social support by involving significant others in educational activities. Incorporate appropriate nutritional management. Attention should be paid to cultural food preferences in dietary counseling. Describe use of medicines for therapeutic effectiveness. Discuss side effects of medicines and emphasize the importance of disc ussing side effects with the primary-c are provider. Explain that the health care professi onal and patient can work together to find the rig ht treatment regimen. Discuss the importance of monitoring glucos e and blood pressure. Relate the nature of the disease (ie, hypertension is asymptom atic and hyperglycemia often is asymptomatic, ye t both require continual treatment). Preventing, detecting, and treating acute complications. Preventing (through risk-reduction behavio r), detecting, and treating long-term comp lications. Risk-reducti on behaviors include smoking cessation, exercise, weight loss, diet, and medication management, as appropriate. Goal setting and problem solving. Setting stepped easily achievabl e goals enables patients to experience success and a sense of self- efficacy. Encourage patients to discuss barriers to adherence (eg, transportati on, economic issues, so cial support) and refer a s appropriate. Integrating psychosocial adjustment to daily life. Assess for depression an d refer as appropriate. Promoting preconception care, management during pregnanc y, and gestational diabetes management (if applicable). Behavioral Self-Management in Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease S135tions that included an exercise component were key to improving glycemic control.577The principles noted in Table 57 enhance adher- ence to medical management in other patientpopulations and, in the opinion of the WorkGroup, should be applicable to patients withdiabetes and CKD. Complex regimens require multiple lifestyle changes. However, targeting multiple behav-iors may have a negative impact on treat-ment. 578For example, in a study of hyperten - sion treatments, participants who wereinstructed to follow a low-sodium diet and loseweight were less adherent than those who wereinstructed to follow either 1 of these regimensalone. 579Thus, targeting a single behavior or sequencing the introduction of various compo- nents of the diabetes and CKD managementregimen may be successful selpmaxE noitatnemelpmI selpicnirP tnemeganaM-fleS Verbal persuasion; changing health beliefs, values, and perceptions of risk and severity of disease; convincing patient of the benefits of behavior change Provide comprehensive education re garding the disease, management regimen, consequences of adherence , consequences of nonadherence Tailoring messages to patient's readiness to change; addressing patient's intentions to engage in required behavior change; addressing preexisting beliefs and preferences about the disease and its management regimen Determine the motivational level of the patient to incorporate self- management behaviors into their daily lives (eg, readiness to begin a regimen of exercise) and tailor educat ional efforts accordingly. Address normative and/or cultural beliefs about the disease and its management that could influence adherence Self-monitoring; self-regulation; establishing \"feedback loops\" Assist patients in developing self-awareness of their behavior s, as well as their physical health (eg, use of diet or physical activity logs, weekly weights, self-monitoring blood pressure) Stimulus control; enhancing patient's ability to gain and maintain control over factors that influence their behavior Assist patients in identifying factors/stimuli that predispose them to unhealthy patterns of behavior or nonadherence to the regimen. Assist patients in changing their response to the stimulus (eg, when tempted to have a soft drink, choose sugar free), or avoid the stimulus altogether (eg, when shopping for groceries avoid the soft-drink and snack aisles) ym rewol them in identifying easily achievable intermediate or \"stepped\" goals, which lead to the ov erall health goal (eg, this week, instead of drinking 3 regular soft drinks each day, I will limit myself to 2). Help the patient monitor their progress in meeting goals (eg, for 5 of 7 days this week I was able to limit myself to only 2 cans of soft drinks). Set new goals as appropriate (eg, next week I will reduce my intake of soft drinks to 1 each day). When goals are not reached, assess reasons for failure and then reformulate discussion on how such situations can be addressed. Relapse prevention is a problem-solving approach in which \"high-risk\" situations for nonadherence are addres sed and dealt with advance involve the person responsible for food preparation in the home to attend dietary education with the patient, start a walking program with a friend) Building self-confidence or self-efficacy; reinforcing positive beliefs about the probability of successful self-management Persuade the patient that they are able to achieve behavioral goals. Past experience does not have to dictate future su ccess or failure. By establishing easily achievable \"stepped\" goals, the patient experiences success in reaching their goals. Attribute successes in meeting goals to the patient's efforts in addressing patient-identified barriers (eg, pharmaceutical assistance with smoking cessation, use of pill minders in those who cannot remember to take medications, addressing economic barriers to glucose self-monitoring, healthy eating, or adherence to the medication regimen) status, encourage participant to reward self for improvements Adapted from Guideline 5 of the NKF-KDOQI CPGs for Hypertension and Antihypertensive Agents in CKD.5Recommendations for Diabetes and CKD S136Assessments and educational efforts should take into consideration modiablebarriers to self-management, should beculturally appropriate, and should considerthe unique learning needs of the patient.(Weak/Opinion) Modiable predictors of nonadherence to medi- cal therapies in patients with hypertension in-clude side effects of medicines, complexity ofthe regimen, cost and nancial difculties, depres-sion, socioeconomic status, transportation is-sues, and social support. 5Modiable predictors of nonadherence to the diabetes regimen include depression,580self-efcacy (the patient's con - dence in their ability to successfully managetheir disease), 581-584and health literacy.585In a study of exercise behavior of individuals with type 2 diabetes, nonexercisers were found tohave more negative attitudes. They perceivedphysical discomfort, feared hypoglycemia, andhad perceptions that they were too overweight.They also reported a lack of family support forengaging in exercise. 586 Cultural factors also play a role in adherence. Ethnic minorities are overrepresented amongpeople with diabetes. 587They also have a higher burden of diabetes and CKD than whites.499,588 A recent review of studies targeting ethnic minori- ties with diabetes found that adherence was im-proved by tailoring the intervention to age orculture, use of group counseling or support, andinvolvement of signicant others ( Table 55 ). 589 Cognitive decits are common in individuals with diabetes.590,591This problem appears to be associated with poor glycemic control, although obesity, hypertension, and depression also maycontribute. 592Problems with cognitive function have obvious implications for adherence in that individuals with these decits may have dif-culty with memory, organizing information, andsolving self-management problems. Behavior change requires repeated contacts and sustained support from thehealth care team. (Weak/Opinion) A meta-analysis summarized the numerous clinical trials that have been done to enhance theadherence of people with diabetes to self-management regimens ( Table 55 ). 593These stud - ies generally dene adherence as an educationalor behavioral issue. Those that conceptualizedadherence as an educational issue tested interven- tions that involved the development of materialsor unique teaching approaches to help peoplewith diabetes learn about the disease and itsmanagement. Those that conceptualized adher-ence as a behavioral issue employed techniquesbased in behavioral medicine or psychology tofoster behavior change (eg, motivational inter-viewing, verbal persuasion, goal setting, positivereinforcement, social support, and coping, amongothers). Regardless of how adherence was con-ceptualized, these studies found that interven-tions to enhance adherence tend to improve gly-cemic control. The greatest improvements weremade in interventions involving frequent contactwith the patients. Unfortunately, improvementsgenerally were lost within 1 to 3 months afterstopping the intervention. 583No literature was found regarding the frequency and duration of contacts required to make and sustain behaviorchange in patients with diabetes and CKD. How-ever, given that CKD only complicates the self-management regimen, the Work Group con-cluded that interventions to support and sustainbehavior change should be comparable to orexceed those required for good self-managementof diabetes. LIMITATIONS Research that pertains to self-management in those with diabetes and CKD is virtually nonex-istent. Accordingly, evidence regarding adher-ence to blood pressure management regimensand to self-management of diabetes were extrapo-lated to people with diabetes and CKD. IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES Simplication of the management regimen (including medicines, diet, physical activity, andself-monitoring requirements) may be helpfulfor encouraging adherence. Focusing on oneaspect of the regimen and/or sequential introduc-tion of requirements may be helpful. Incorporation of behavioral strategies to en- hance self-management optimally requires a mul-tidisciplinary team effort nurse, pharmacist, and/orsocial worker). Self-management, as described,requires frequent and repeated contacts withhealth care professionals for education, goal set-ting, evaluation of progress, and teaching self-Behavioral Self-Management in Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease S137monitoring and problem-solving skills. Establish- ing and maintaining self-management behaviorslikely will require multiple ongoing contactswith members of the health care team. Education of the patient regarding medicines should include, at a minimum, the reason themedicine is being prescribed, instruction regard-ing side effects, importance of adherence, conse-quences of nonadherence, and signs or symp-toms that should trigger a return call or visit to ahealth care provider. If appropriate, the patientshould be instructed that other medicines areavailable if side effects become unmanageable.All information should be relayed to the patientin lay terms. Referral to a social worker, diabetes educator, dietitian, nurse, case manager, or pharmacist forappropriate counseling should be consideredwhen encountering such barriers to regimen ad-herence as cost; cultural factors and culturalbeliefs; misperceptions or misunderstandings re-garding diabetes and CKD, its treatment, and the consequences of nonadherence; or apparent in-ability to take medicines on a regular basis (ie,forgetfulness, or difculty managing a complexmedication regimen). Aging of the population will require regular reassessment of the patient's ability to indepen-dently handle the management regimen. Development of culturally sensitive educa- tional materials and services is necessary toensure adherence to medical recommendationsand requires time and resources that may bebeyond the control of the individual clinician. The approach to the patient should be individu- alized, taking into consideration his or her cul-ture, economic situation, knowledge and beliefsregarding the disease and treatment, response tomedication (in particular, side effects), ability(emotional, functional, cognitive, visual) to ad-here to the prescribed regimen, and changes instatus over time. Recommendations for Diabetes and CKD S138IV. RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONSGuideline 1. Screening and Diagnosis of Diabetic Kidney Disease What is the best screening test for DKD? Mi- croalbuminuria is the best available test forscreening of DKD, but it is imprecise. For this reason, additional research on the use of newbiomarkers or better use of already availablemarkers may lead to the important advances inthis eld. Markers may include: Urinary immunonreactive intact albumin and shed podocytes; Genetic risk indicators; Blood and/or urine changes in growth factors, cytokines, inflammatory markers, or markersof oxidative stress; Innovative kidney imaging or tissue studies. Appropriately weighted risk algorithms should be derived using predictive variables: AER within the normoalbuminuric or mi- croalbuminuric range; duration; Lipid measures of glomerular ltration rate (GFR) should be developed and may in-clude: reliable creatinine measurement meth- ods; Modications of existing Application of GFR such as cystatin C; Development of simplied direct GFR measurements. How should albuminuria be mea- sured? Additional studies on urinary albumin measurements, including predictive values ofgender-specic ACR cutoffs, urine collectionmethods, and processing of urine samples, arewarranted. What is the rate of progression of DKD in people with reduced GFR, but normal urinaryalbumin excretion? How does this compare with the rate in those with elevated urinaryalbumin excretion? Does regression of albuminuria modify the long-term progression of DKD? What is the effect of promising agents to pre- vent RCN in patients with various stages of CKDand both types of diabetes? What is the best common denition of RCN? Guideline 2. Management of Hyperglycemia and General Diabetes Carein CKD Does intensive treatment of glycemia re- duce progression of CKD, or prevent CKD stage5 and CVD events, in people with diabetes andCKD (secondary prevention)? Do effects dif- fer by macroalbuminuria) kidney CVD benets beyond glycemic control in people with diabe-tes and CKD? Are risks of fluid retention with TZDs greater in people with CKD? What is/are the best methods for assessing glycemic control in CKD? What are the best methods for administer- ing insulin in patients on dialysis? What are the best ways of countering the hyperglycemic effects of glucocorticoids, cyclo-sporine, and tacrolimus in the transplant pa-tient? Are there CVD beyond glycemic or DPP-4 inhibitorsin people ana- logues (incretin mimetic or amylin analog) orDPP-4 inhibitors in people with diabetes andCKD? Guideline 3. Management of Hypertension in Diabetes and CKD What are optimal doses of ACE inhibitors and ARBs for kidney disease protection inpeople with diabetes and hypertension? American Journal of Kidney Diseases, Vol 49, No 2, Suppl 2 (February), 2007: pp S140-S143 S140What is the role of ARBs or other classes of antihypertensive agents, either aloneor in combination with ACE inhibitors, onslowing kidney disease progression and pre-venting CVD in hypertensive people withDKD? What is the optimal level of blood pressure to slow DKD progression? The question re- garding the optimal level of blood pressure reduc-tion for cardiovascular risk reduction may beanswered in 2008 by the ACCORD trial. How-ever, this may not answer the question aboutkidney protection. Do ACE inhibitors or ARBs prevent progres- sion of kidney disease in patients with diabe-tes and CKD, dened by low GFR withoutalbuminuria? Guideline 4. Management of Dyslipidemia in Diabetes and CKD What is the effect of lipid lowering with statins on CVD in patients with diabetes andCKD stages 1 to 4? What is the impact of inflammation (ie, high C-reactive protein) on the response to lipidlowering with statins in diabetes and CKDstage 5? This question may be answered by subgroup analysis and biomarker determinationsof the 4D participants. What is the effect of statin treatment on progression of DKD? Do effects differ byalbuminuria status (normoalbuminuria, mi-croalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria) or levelof GFR? Guideline 5. Nutritional Management in Diabetes and CKD Randomized clinical trials in diabetes and CKD examining the role of nutrition on clinicaloutcomes are needed. Diet interventions are extremely challenging, but are required to iden-tify new therapeutic options. Studies examining specic nutrients on kid- ney disease would be benecial. What is the effect of 0.8 g of protein/kg body weight per dayon grains, fruits, andvegetables. The above question modied for amino acid composition by altering the protein source: soy protein; lean poultry and sh; vegetable protein only; 50% protein as sh rich in omega-3 fatty acids. What is the best strategy for nutrition inter- ventions? Evaluate types and frequency of nu- trition education sessions provided by a regis-tered dietitian in conjunction with medicalmanagement. What is the effect of nutritional intervention on progression of DKD using the diagnosticcriteria dened in the NKF-KDOQI differ (normoalbuminuria, microalbuminuria, or level of GFR? CPR Management of Albuminuria in Normotensive Patients With Diabetes andAlbuminuria as a Surrogate Marker in DKD What is the effect of RAS inhibition (ACE inhibitors and ARBs) on albuminuria and clini-cal outcomes in normotensive people withDKD? What is the relationship between magni- tude of albuminuria change and risks of CKDand CVD people with DKD? What is for urine in DKD during treatmentwith ACE inhibitors and ARBs? Do different types of treatment that reduce albuminuria improve clinical outcomes inDKD? CPR 2. Multifaceted Intervention for People With Diabetes and CKD Which facets of the intensive multifaceted intervention are associated with reduced risksof CKD and CVD?Research Recommendations S141Do people with diabetes and CKD already treated with RAS inhibitors benet from inten-sive multifaceted intervention? Does intensive multifaceted intervention provide CKD and CVD benets at earlier orlater stages of CKD in diabetes? Can intensive multifaceted intervention for diabetes and CKD be accomplished in otherclinical settings? In overweight and obese people (BMI > 24.9 kg/m 2) with diabetes and CKD, what is the effect of weight loss using a balanced calorie-restricted diet on glycemic control,GFR, benets and risks of using rimonabant for weight loss in people withdiabetes and CKD? CPR 3. Diabetes and CKD in Special Populations What are the most effective means of trans- lating clinical knowledge into public healthinterventions for DKD? While evaluation of direct clinical and public health efforts will beessential, development of systems models can beuseful planning tools for predicting the mostcost-effective way to use the limited resourcesthat will be available in the countries most af-fected by DKD in the future. What are the prenatal and early childhood factors that lead to later development of dia-betes and CKD? What are the causes of different risks of DKD progression and mortality after onset ofkidney replacement therapy in various ethnicgroups? Native Americans on dialysis therapy have better survival compared with Caucasiansin the United States, while Canadian First Na-tions members have similar survival as CanadianCaucasians. This difference in relative survivalsuggests that nongenetic factors may play a sig-nicant role in survival. Are inexpensive combination antihyperten- sive agents safe and effective for DKD inpopulations of developing countries? Such an approach could have great clinical impact,particularly where limited resources are avail- able for purchasing drugs. The effectiveness oflow-cost interventions using less expensive ge-neric drugs to control risk factors for DKD hasbeen demonstrated in rural India. Are programmatic efforts to improve the care of patients with CKD worldwide effective,such as the NKF Kidney Disease\u2014ImprovingGlobal Outcomes and the International Soci-ety of Nephrology Commission for the GlobalAdvancement of Nephrology? These pro- grams should be regularly assessed. What are effects of interventions that may decrease the risk of preeclampsia and pre-term delivery in women with diabetes andCKD? This is an especially challenging popula- tion that should be included in clinical trials. What factors influence maternal and fetal outcomes in women with type 2 diabetes andCKD? CPR 4. Behavioral Self-Management in Diabetes and CKD To what extent do low-dose combinations of medicines for treatment of diabetes and CKDreduce adverse effects and improve adher-ence? Do optimal interventions combine behav- ioral approaches with pharmacological thera-pies to improve management of risk factorsfor diabetes and CKD? Particular attention should be paid to identifying which behavioralstrategies are most effective in producing thedesired change. What are effective strategies for maintain- ing long-term adherence to self-care require-ments for management of diabetes and CKD? New Treatments for DKD The Work Group recognizes the importance of bringing new treatments into clinical research forDKD, especially for patients who have progres-sive kidney disease despite the current standardof care. Promising treatments, including novelagents and potential new uses of existing agents,are currently in phase 2/3 trials for 1: NUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES AND CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE Sample meal plan MENU Breakfast Peanut Butter Oatmeal Fresh Sliced Pears Very Berry Smoothie Lunch Baked Salmon on a Toasted Hamburger Bun Roasted Asparagus Spears With a Spicy Tofu Hollandaisea Sliced Pineapple With Strawberry Lemon ThymebSorbetc Snack Cucumbers With Horseradish and Dill Dip Mixed Nuts Dinner Grilled Vegetables on Bulgur Pilafd Sliced Avocado Rum-Baked Apples a.

The Work Group developed the guidelines and recommendations using an evidence-based approach. Evidence regarding the guide-line topics was derived primarily from a sys-tematic summary of the available scienticliterature. When sufcient evidence was lack-ing, recommendations were developed that re-flect expert opinion. When appropriate, avail-able guidelines or systematic reviews wereused to support the current guidelines andrecommendations. OVERVIEW OF PROCESS Development of the guidelines and recommen- dations required many concurrent steps to: Form the Work Groups and Evidence Re- view Team that were to be responsible fordifferent aspects of the process; Confer to discuss process, methods, and results; Develop and rene topics; Dene exact populations of interest; Create draft guideline statements and ration- ales; Create data extraction forms; Create and standardize quality assessment and applicability metrics; Develop and perform literature search strat- egies; Screen abstracts and retrieve full articles; Review articles; Extract data and perform critical appraisal of the literature; Tabulate data from articles into summary tables; Assess the overall strengths of the bodies of evidence; and Write guideline statements and rationales based on literature and Work Group consen-sus. An Evidence Review Team, composed of ex- perts in systematic review and guideline develop-ment, guided the Work Group in all methods andaspects of guideline development. The Work Group and the Evidence Review Team met infour 2-day meetings over 18 months. Creation of Groups The Chair and Co-Chair of the KDOQI Advisory Board selected the Co-Chairs of theWork Group and the Director of the EvidenceReview Team, who then assembled groups tobe responsible for the development of theguidelines. The Work Group and the EvidenceReview Team collaborated closely throughoutthe project. The Work Groups consisted of domain ex- perts, including individuals with expertise inadult and pediatric nephrology, adult and pedi-atric diabetology and endocrinology, cardiol-ogy, pharmacology, social work, nursing, andnutrition. The rst task of the Work Groupmembers was to dene the overall topics andgoals of the guidelines. They then further devel-oped and rened each topic, literature searchstrategies, and data extraction forms (de-scribed below). The Work Group memberswere the principal reviewers of the literature;from their reviews and detailed data extrac-tions, they summarized the available evidenceand took the primary roles of writing theguidelines and rationale statements. Com-pleted data extractions were shared amongWork Group members. The Evidence Review Team consisted of neph- rologists, physician-methodologists, and re-search assistants from Tufts-New England Medi-cal Center with expertise in systematic review ofthe medical literature. They supported the WorkGroups in rening the topics and clinical ques-tions so that literature searches could be under-taken. They also instructed the Work Groupmembers in all steps of systematic review andcritical literature appraisal. The Evidence Re-view Team coordinated the methodological andanalytical process of the report, dened andstandardized the methodology of performing lit-erature searches, of data extraction and of sum-marizing the evidence in summary tables. Theyperformed literature searches, organized abstractand article screening, created forms to extractrelevant data from articles, organized Work Groupmember data extraction, and tabulated results. American Journal of Kidney Diseases, Vol 49, No 2, Suppl 2 (February), 2007: pp S148-S154 S148Throughout the project the Evidence Review Team led discussions on systematic review, litera-ture searches, data extraction, assessment of qual-ity and applicability of articles, evidence synthe-sis, and grading of the quality of the body ofevidence and the strength of guideline recommen-dations. Renement of Guideline Topics and Development of Materials The goals of the Work Group spanned a di- verse group of topics, which would have beentoo large for a comprehensive review of theliterature. Based on their expertise, members ofthe Work Group focused on specic questionsdeemed clinically relevant and amenable to sys-tematic review. Other sources of data includedpreviously published guidelines and systematicreviews. The Work Groups and Evidence Review Team developed: (1) draft guideline statements, (2)draft rationale statements that summarized theexpected pertinent evidence, and (3) data extrac-tion forms requesting the data elements to beretrieved from the primary articles. The topicrenement process began before literature re-trieval and continued through the process ofreviewing individual articles. Literature Search The Work Group members developed spe- cic questions with regards to predictors andinterventions related to specic outcomes.Search strategies were developed according tospecic study topics, study design, and yearsof publication. Studies for the literature reviewwere identied through MEDLINE searches ofEnglish language literature of human studiesfrom January 1990 to December 2003. Selec-tive updates were performed through May 2005.Broad MeSH (medical subject heading) termsand text words were used so that searches wereboth general in scope for high sensitivity inidentication of pertinent literature and spe-cic to preliminary topics selected by the WorkGroups. The searches were also supplementedby articles identied by Work Group membersthrough August 2005. The principal kidney-related search terms used included: kidney, renal, kidney disease, andpregnancy in diabetes. Only full journal articles of original data were included. Editorials, letters, abstracts, and unpub-lished reports were not included. Selected reviewarticles, however, were included for backgroundmaterial. A separate search for systematic re-views of health education in diabetes was con-ducted for the behavioral management recom-mendation. MEDLINE search results were screened by members of the Evidence Review Team for rel-evance using predened eligibility criteria, de-scribed below. Retrieved articles were screenedby the Evidence Review Team. Potentially rel-evant studies were sent to Work Group membersfor rescreening and data extraction. Domain ex-perts made the nal decision for inclusion orexclusion of all articles. Generation of Data Extraction Forms Data extraction forms were designed to cap- ture information on various aspects of theprimary articles. Forms for all topics includedstudy setting and demographics, eligibility cri-teria, severity of kidney disease, type of diabe-tes, numbers of subjects, study design, studyfunding source, comorbid conditions, descrip-tions of relevant risk factors or interventions,description of outcomes, statistical methods,results, study quality based on criteria appropri-ate for each study design (see below), studyapplicability (see below), and sections for com-ments and assessment of biases. Training ofthe Work Group members to extract data fromprimary articles occurred at face-to-face meet-ings, supplemented by e-mails and teleconfer-ences. Generation of Evidence Tables The Evidence Review Team condensed the information from the data extraction forms intoevidence tables, which summarized individualstudies. These tables were created for the WorkGroup members to assist them with review of theevidence and are not included in the guidelines.All Work Group members (within each topic)received copies of all extracted articles and allevidence tables. During the development of theMethods for Evaluating Evidence S149evidence tables, the Evidence Review Team checked the data extraction for accuracy andrescreened the accepted articles to verify thateach of them met the initial screening criteriadetermined by the Work Group. Format for Summary Tables Summary tables describe the studies accord- ing to 4 dimensions: study size and follow-upduration, applicability or generalizability, re-sults, and methodological quality. Within eachtable, the studies are rst grouped by outcometype. Data entered into summary tables by the Evi- dence Review Team were derived from the dataextraction forms, evidence tables, and/or the ar-ticles. All summary tables were reviewed by theWork Group members. Within each outcome section of each table, studies are ordered rst by methodological qual-ity (best to worst), then by applicability (most toleast), and then by study size (largest to small-est). Results are presented by using the appropri-ate metric or summary symbols, as dened in the table footnotes. Systematic Review Topics, Study Eligibility Criteria, and Literature Yield The topics listed in Table 59 were systemati- cally reviewed. Predened eligibility criteria areincluded. These were based on the study designsof the available literature (eg, whether there werean \"adequate\" number of randomized whether therewere \"so many\" studies that restriction based onsuch factors as study size or duration weredeemed appropriate). For the primary literature topics, the litera- ture searches yielded 11,378 citations. Of these,765 articles were retrieved in full. An addi-tional 57 studies were added by Work Groupmembers. From all 822 articles, 250 wereextracted and included. Of these, 142 studiesare included in Summary Tables. A supplemen-tal search for systematic reviews of diabetesTable 59.

Appendix 2 S150and health education yielded 901 citations, of which 10 systematic reviews were summa-rized. Grading of Individual Studies Study Size and Duration The study (sample) size is used as a measure of the weight of the evidence. In general, largestudies provide more precise estimates of ef-fects and associations. In addition, large stud-ies are more likely to be generalizable; how-ever, large size alone does not guaranteeapplicability. A study that enrolled a largenumber of selected patients may be less gener- alizable than several smaller studies that in-cluded a broad spectrum of patient popula-tions. Similarly, longer duration studies maybe of better quality and more applicable, de-pending on other factors.Applicability Applicability (also known as generalizability or external validity) addresses the issue of whether thestudy population is sufciently broad so that theresults can be generalized to the population ofinterest. The study population typically is denedprimarily by the inclusion and exclusion criteria.The target population varied somewhat from topicto topic, but generally was dened to include pa-tients with both CKD and diabetes (ideally DKD,CKD caused directly by diabetes mellitus). Morespecic criteria were sometimes appropriate, for example, subjects with retinopathy or pregnantwomen. A designation for applicability wasassigned to each article, according to a 3-levelscale. In making this assessment, sociodemo-graphic characteristics were considered, as wellas comorbid conditions and prior treatments.Applicability is graded in reference to thepopulation of interest for each topic. Sample is representative of the target population, or results are definitely applicable to the target population irrespective of study sample. Sample is representative of a relevant subgroup of the target population. For ex ample, sample is only representative of people with macroalbuminuria, or all elderly individuals. Sample is representative of a narrow subgroup of patients only, and not well generalizable to other subgroups. For example, the study includes only a small number of patients or older patients with new-onset diabetes. Studies of such narrow subgroups may be extremely valuable for demonstrating exceptions to the rule. Results In general, the result is summarized by both the direction and strength of the association.Depending on the study type, the results may refer either to dichotomous outcomes, such asthe presence of retinopathy or a laboratory testabove or below a threshold value, or to theassociation of continuous variables with out-comes, such as serum laboratory tests. We ac-counted for the magnitude of the association andboth the clinical and statistical signicance of theassociations. Criteria for indicating the presenceof an association varied among predictors depend-ing on their clinical signicance. Both univariateand multivariate associations are presented, whenappropriate. The following metrics were used:prevalence, relative effects (relative risk [RR], odds ratio [OR], hazard ratio [HR], or netchange\u2014change from baseline in the interven-tion group minus the change in the control group),correlation ( rorr 2), and test accuracy (sensitiv - ity, specicity, and positive and negative predic-tive value). The choice of metric often waslimited by the reported data. For some studies,only the statistical signicance was reported. Methodological Quality Methodological quality (or internal validity) refers to the design, conduct, and reporting of theclinical study. Because studies with a variety oftypes of design were evaluated, a 3-level classi-cation of study quality was devised:Methods for Evaluating Evidence S151 Least bias; results are valid. A study that mostly adheres to the commonly held concepts of high quality, including the following: a formal study; clear descriptio n of the population and setting; clear description of an appropriate reference standard; proper measurement techniques; appropriate statistical and analytical methods; no reporting errors; and no obvious bias. Not retrospective studies or case series. Susceptible to some bias, but not sufficient to invalidate the results. A study that does not meet all the criteria in category above. It has some deficiencies but none likely to cause major bias. Significant bias that may invalidate the results. A study with serious erro rs in design or reporting. These studies may have large amounts of missing information or discrepancies in reporting. Summarizing Reviews and Selected Original Articles Work Group members had wide latitude in summarizing reviews and selected original ar-ticles for topics that were determined not torequire a systemic review of the literature. How-ever, a thorough review and summary of system-atic reviews of diabetes and health education wasperformed. Format of Guidelines and Clinical Practice Recommendations The format for each CPG and CPR chapter is outlined in Table 60 . Each CPG or CPR contains one or more specic \"statements,\" which arepresented as \"bullets\" that represent recommen-dations to the target audience. Each CPG or CPRcontains background information, which is gen-erally sufcient for interpretation. A discussionof the broad concepts that frame the CPGs andCPRs is provided in the preceding section of thisreport. The rationale for each CPG contains aseries of specic \"rationale statements,\" eachsupported by evidence. The CPG or CPR con-cludes with a discussion of limitations of theevidence and a brief discussion of clinical appli- cations, and implementation issues regarding thetopic. Research recommendations for topics re-lated to all CPGs and CPRs are compiled in aseparate chapter. Rating the Strength of Guidelines and Rationale Statements Grading the Strength of Evidence The overall strength of each guideline or clini- cal practice recommendation statement was ratedby assigning either \"A\", \"B\", or \"C (CPR)\" asdescribed in Table 61 . The strength of evidence was graded using a rating system that primarily takes into account:(1) methodological quality of the studies; (2)whether the study was carried out in the targetpopulation, ie, patients with CKD and diabetes,or in other populations; and (3) whether thestudies examined health outcomes directly orexamined surrogate measures for those out-comes, eg, reducing death or improving albumin-uria ( Table 62 ). These 3 separate study character- istics were combined to provide a preliminarystrength of evidence provided by pertinent stud-ies. In addition, aspects of the GRADE recom-mendations for grading the quality of evidenceand the strength of recommendations were incor-porated to determine a nal strength of evi-dence. 598 Thus, specic criteria for assessing the quality of the body of evidence (including an initialcategorization of evidence quality based on studydesigns of the available studies) were discussedwith the Work Group. For questions of interven-tions, quality was High, if randomized controlledtrials; Low, if observational studies; Very Low, ifother types of evidence. The quality rating wasthen decreased if there were serious limitationsto individual study quality, if there were impor-tant inconsistent results across studies, if theTable 60. Format for Guidelines Introductory Statement Guideline or CPR Statement 1 Guideline or CPR Statement 2 BACKGROUND RATIONALE Definitions (if appropriate) Rationale statement 1 Supporting text and tables Rationale statement 2 Supporting text and tables LIMITATIONS IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES Appendix 2 S152applicability of the studies to the population of interest was limited, if the data were imprecise orsparse, or if there was thought to be a highlikelihood of bias. The quality rating for observa-tional studies was increased if there was strongevidence of an association (ie, signicant RR orOR of about /H110222 [or/H110210.5] based on consistent evidence from 2 or more observational studies,with no plausible confounders), if there wasevidence of a dose-response gradient, or if plau-sible confounders would have reduced the effect.Four nal quality categories were used: High,Moderate, Low, and Very Low. The Work Group and Evidence Review Team also discussed how the strength of the evidencewould be determined based on the quality ofevidence across all outcomes of interest, takinginto account the relative importance of each ofthe outcomes (eg, death and CKD progressionhaving greater weight than albuminuria or glu-cose levels) and a balance between net benets and additional considerations, such as costs (re-source utilization), feasibility, availability, likelydifferences in patient values, likely differencesamong populations and regions. Each major item of evidence discussed in the Rationale sections for each CPG and CPR wasgiven a strength rating. Upon consideration ofthe strength of evidence for the various sectionsof the body of evidence for a given set ofrecommendation statements, a determination wasmade whether the set of statements rise to thelevel of a CPG or whether the body of evidenceis sufciently weak to warrant only a CPR. Setsof statements that were graded as being Strong orModerately Strong were designated as Guide-lines. In the absence of strong or moderatelystrong quality evidence or when additional con-siderations did not support strong or moderatelystrong evidence-based recommendations, theTable 61. Rating the Strength of Guideline and CPR Statements Grade Recommendation AIt is strongly recommended that clinicians routinely foll ow the guideline for eligible patients. There is strong evidence that the practice improves health outcomes. BIt is recommended that clinicians routinely follow th e guideline for eligible patients. There is moderately strong evidence that the practice improves health outcomes. C (CPR)It is recommended that clinicians consider followin g the CPR for eligible pati ents. This recommendation is based on either weak evidence or on the opinions of the Work Group and reviewers that the practice might improve health outcomes. Health outcomes are health-related events, conditions, or symptoms that can be perceived by individuals to have an important e ffect on their lives. Improving health outcomes implies that benefits outweigh any adverse effects. Table 62.

Methods for Evaluating Evidence S153Work Group could elect to issue expert opinion- based recommendations termed CPRs. These rec-ommendations are based on the consensus of theWork Group that the practice might improvehealth outcomes. As such, the Work Group rec-ommends that clinicians consider following therecommendation for eligible patients. These rec-ommendations are based on either weak evi-dence or on the opinions of the Work Group. In addition, the Work Group adopted a conven- tion for using existing expert guidelines issuedfor populations other than the target population.Grades for the strength of evidence assigned bythe professional societies that issued the guide-lines were adopted. When the guideline or theevidence was not graded, this Work Group as-sumed that the guideline would be based on atleast moderately strong evidence. The extrapola-tion of these guideline recommendations from the general populations to the target populationwas considered to support grade B recommenda-tions. Limitations of Approach While the literature searches were intended to be comprehensive, they were not exhaustive.MEDLINE was the only database searched, andsearches were limited to English language publi-cations. Hand searches of journals were not per-formed, and review articles and textbook chap-ters were not systematically searched. However,important studies known to the domain expertsthat were missed by the literature search wereincluded in the review. No meta-analyses wereperformed.Appendix 2 Pablo Aschner, MD, Associate Profes- sor and Head of the Endocrinology Unit at theJaveriana University School of Medicine andScientic Sub-director at the Colombian Diabe- tes Association Clinical Research Center inBogot\u00e1, Colombia.
