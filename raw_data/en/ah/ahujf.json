Detox treatment helps you overcome physical dependency on drugs and alcohol so you can stop using these substances and recover from addiction both physically and mentally. [Detox centers](https://www.detox.com/centers/) offer several different treatments that can help you successfully overcome addiction to nearly any substance based on your unique, personal health needs and preferences. What is Detox? Detox is a process in which you quit using and abstain from drugs, alcohol, and other substances. There are two main types of detox treatments offered at most detox centers: [medical detox](https://www.detox.com/centers/medical/top-5-benefits-of-medical-drug-detox/) detox](https://www.detox.com/drug/methods/natural-drug-detox/). Medical detox involves the use of [medications](https://www.detox.com/drug/drug-alcohol/what-medications-help-with-detox/) that can reduce or eliminate one or more withdrawal symptoms. For instance, medical detox is frequently used to treat addiction to heroin and painkillers, since these drugs are highly addictive and difficult to stop using without triggering cravings and [withdrawal symptoms](https://www.detox.com/drug/symptoms/common-drug-and-alcohol-detoxification-symptoms/). Medical detox is effective at treating nearly any addiction type, and can make the withdrawal process safer and more comfortable. Natural detox, on the other hand, involves quitting drugs and alcohol [cold turkey](https://www.detox.com/drug/methods/is-quitting-cold-turkey-recommended/) without the use of other drugs or medications that relieve withdrawal symptoms. Instead, natural detox allows you to overcome addiction using natural therapies such as yoga, exercise, and massage. Since natural detox may result in cravings and withdrawal symptoms, the medical staff at these detox centers can safely and comfortably support you through the detox process. Medical and natural detox treatments are both highly effective at helping you overcome addiction, but the ideal detox for you depends on your addiction type and personal needs. For example, if you've been struggling with addiction for several years and want to avoid severe, painful withdrawal symptoms, you may fare best with medical detox, which can eliminate one or more symptoms. On the other hand, if you want your addiction treated naturally without the use of drugs, opt for natural detox and benefit from [holistic therapies](https://www.detox.com/drug/drug-addiction/about-holistic-treatment/) such as exercise, massage, and IV vitamin therapy. The Role of Detox in Addiction Treatment Addiction involves more than just physical dependency on drugs or alcohol, and often stems from underlying psychological causes, such as [mental illness](https://www.detox.com/centers/alcohol/do-alcohol-detox-centers-provide-mental-health-treatment/) or previous trauma. Detox helps you overcome physical dependency on substances so you can move on to treating the psychological aspects of addiction. Due to the way detox treatments eliminate drugs and alcohol from your body, you may experience one or more withdrawal symptoms, even when undergoing medical detox. These symptoms can interfere with your physical and mental health, and make it difficult for you to focus on counseling, therapy, and other treatments aimed at addressing addiction. This is why detox is a necessary first stage of addiction treatment, as it helps you prepare for a new, healthier, and happier life free of substance abuse. Benefits of Detox Treatment Receiving detox treatment at a detox center allows you to recover in a safe, controlled environment with immediate access to medical staff. You won't have to worry about suffering through withdrawal symptoms alone, or without help and support in the event symptoms become severe and life-threatening. The staff at detox centers will guide you safely through detox, and help you feel as comfortable as possible so you can fully overcome dependency on substances. Detox treatments can also help relieve or eliminate cravings and withdrawal symptoms so you can recover from addiction with few distractions.
