Gallatin and his cofounders said that the new university was to be a \"national university\" that would provide a \"rational and practical education for all.\" The result of the founders' foresight is today a university that is recognized both nationally and internationally as a leader in scholarship. Of the more than 3,000 colleges and universities in America, only 60 institutions are members of the distinguished Association of American Universities. New York University is one of the 60. Students come to the University from all 50 states and from over 130 foreign countries. The University includes 18 schools, colleges, institutes, and programs at major centers in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Abu Dhabi (UAE). In 2013, NYU in New York and NYU Abu Dhabi will be joined by a third portal campus in Shanghai, China. In addition, the University operates a branch campus program in Rockland County at St. Thomas Aquinas College. Certain of the University's research facilities, notably the Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, are located in Sterling Forest, near T uxedo, New York. Although overall the University is large, the divisions are small- to moderate-sized units\u2014each with its own traditions, programs, and faculty. Enrollment in the undergraduate divisions of the University ranges between 130 and 7,672. While some introductory classes in some programs have large numbers of students, many classes are small. Nearly 4,600 undergraduate courses are offered. The University overall grants more than 25 different degrees.The founding of New York University in 1831 by a group of eminent private citizens was a historic event in American education. In the early 19th century, a major emphasis in higher education was on the mastery of Greek and Latin, with little attention given to modern or contemporary subjects. The founders of New York University intended to enlarge the scope of higher education to meet the needs of persons aspiring to careers in business, industry, science, and the arts, as well as in law, medicine, and the ministry. The opening of the University of London in 1828 convinced New Yorkers that New York, too, should have a university. 6 INTRODUCTION TO NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITY1832 College of Arts and Science cas.nyu.edu 1835 School of Law www.law.nyu.edu 1841 School of Medicine school.med.nyu.edu 1865 College of Dentistry www.nyu.edu/dental (including the College of Nursing [1947], www.nyu.edu/nursing) 1886 Graduate School of Arts and Science www.gsas.nyu.edu 1890 Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development steinhardt.nyu.edu1900 Leonard N.

With 4.1 mil-lion print volumes, 112,000 BobCat serial subscriptions, 120,000 electronic journals in BobCat, 850,000 e-books in BobCat, 171,000 audio and video recordings, and 30,000 linear feet of special collections of archival materials, the collections are uniquely strong in the performing arts, radical and labor history, and the history of New York and its avant-garde culture. The library's website, library.nyu.edu, received three million visits in 2008-2009. Bobst Library offers approximately 2,500 seats for student study. The Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media, one of the world's largest academic media centers, has 134 carrels for audio listening and video viewing, as well as three multimedia classrooms. Last year, the center filled more than 78,000 research requests for audio and video material. The Digital Studio offers a constantly evolving, leading-edge resource for faculty and student projects, and it promotes and supports access to digital resources for teaching, learning, research, and arts events. The Data Service Studio provides expert staff and access to software, statistical computing, geographical information systems analysis, data collection resources, and data management services in support of quantitative research at NYU. The Fales Library, a special collection within Bobst Library, is home to the unparalleled Fales Collection of English and American Literature; the Food Studies Collection, the country's largest trove of cookbooks, food writing, pamphlets, paper, and archives, dating from the 1790s; and the Downtown Collection, an extraordi-nary multimedia archive documenting the avant-garde New York art world since 1975. Bobst Library also houses the Tamiment Library, the country's leading repository of research materials in the history of left politics and labor. T wo fellowship programs bring scholars from around the world to Tamiment to explore the history of the Cold War and its wide-ranging impact on American institutions and to research academic freedom and promote public discussion of its history and role in our society. Tamiment's Robert F . Wagner Labor Archives contain, among other resources, the archives of the Jewish Labor Committee and of more than 200 New York City labor organizations. The Barbara Goldsmith Preservation and Conservation Department in Bobst Library comprises laboratories for book, film, and audio/video conservation. Its preserva-tion projects often provide training for students in many aspects of book, paper, and media preservation. In a groundbreak- ing initiative funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Division of Libraries in 2008 completed development of rationales and strategies for all aspects of moving image and audio preservation, consulting with a variety of other institu- tions to identify and test best practices and disseminating them throughout the archival community. Beyond Bobst, the library of the renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences focuses on research-level material in mathematics, computer science, and related fields. The Stephen Chan Library of Fine Arts at the Institute of Fine Arts (IFA) houses the rich collections that support the research and curricular needs of the institute's graduate programs in art history 7 INTRODUCTION TO NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYand archaeology. The Jack Brause Real Estate Library at SCPS Midtown, the most comprehensive facility of its kind, serves the information needs of every sector of the real estate community. The Library of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) is a resource for advanced research and graduate education in ancient civilizations from the western Mediterranean to China. Complementing the collections of the Division of Libraries are those of the libraries of NYU's School of Medicine, Dental Center, and School of Law. The New York University Abu Dhabi library provides access to all the resources in BobCat and is developing its own collection of books and other print materials in sup- port of the school's developing curricula. The NYU Division of Libraries continually enhances its student and faculty services and expands its research collections, responding to the extraordinary growth of the University's academic programs in recent years and to the rapid expansion of electronic information resources. Bobst Library's professional staff includes more than 33 subject specialists who select materials and work with faculty and graduate students in every field of study at NYU. The staff also includes specialists in undergraduate outreach, instructional services, preservation, electronic informa- tion, and digital libraries. fine a rts The Grey Art Gallery, the University's fine arts museum, presents three to four innova-tive exhibitions each year that encompass all aspects of the visual arts: painting and sculpture, prints and drawings, photogra-phy, architecture and decorative arts, video, film, and performance. The gallery also sponsors lectures, seminars, symposia, and film series in conjunction with its exhibi- tions. Admission to the gallery is free for NYU staff, faculty, and students. The New York University Art Collection, founded in 1958, consists of more than 5,000 works in a wide range of media. The collection primarily comprises late-19th-century and 20th-century works; its particular strengths are American painting from the 1940s to the present and 20th-century European prints. A unique segment of the NYU Art Collection is the Abby Weed Grey Collection of Contemporary Asian and Middle Eastern Art, which totals some 1,000 works in various media repre- senting countries from T urkey to Japan. The l arger c ampus New York University is an integral part of the metropolitan community of New York City\u2014the business, cultural, artistic, and financial center of the nation and the home of the United Nations. The city's extraor-dinary resources enrich both the academic programs and the experience of living at New York University. Professors whose extracurricular activities include service as editors for publishing houses and magazines; as advisers to city government, banks, school systems, and social agencies; and as consultants for museums and industrial corporations bring to teaching an experience of the world and a professional sophistication that are difficult to match. Students also, either through course work or in outside activities, tend to be involved in the vigorous and varied life of the city. Research for term papers in the humanities and social sciences may take them to such diverse places as the American Museum of Natural History, the Museum of Modern Art, a garment factory, a deteriorating neighborhood, or a foreign consulate. Students in science work with their professors on such problems of immediate importance for urban society as the pol-lution of waterways and the congestion of city streets. Business majors attend seminars in corporation boardrooms and intern as executive assistants in business and financial houses. The schools, courts, hospitals, settlement houses, theatres, playgrounds, and prisons of the greatest city in the world form a regular part of the educational scene for students of medicine, dentistry, education, social work, law, business and public administration, and the creative and performing arts. The chief center for undergraduate and graduate study is at Washington Square in Greenwich Village, long famous for its contributions to the fine arts, literature, and drama, as well as for its personalized, smaller-scale, European style of living. New York University itself makes a significant contribution to the creative activity of the Village through the high concentration of faculty and students who reside within a few blocks of the University. University apartment buildings provide housing for over 2,100 members of the faculty and administration, and University student residence halls accommodate over 11,500 men and women. Many more faculty and students reside in private hous- ing in the area. a Private University Since its founding, New York University has been a private university. It operates under a board of trustees and derives its income from tuition, endowment, grants from private foundations and government, and gifts from friends, alumni, corporations, and other private philanthropic sources. The University is committed to a policy of equal treatment and opportunity in every aspect of its relations with its faculty, students, and staff members, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender and/or gender identity or expression, marital or parental status, national origin, ethnicity, citizenship status, veteran or military status, age, disability, and any other legally protected basis.

Samuel F . B. Morse, after whom the current core curriculum is named, invented the telegraph while teaching art and design; John W. Draper invented modern photography; and the American Chemical Society was founded here. In the arts and culture, too, it can be argued that the College not only participated in but also generated much of the creative energy that has characterized Greenwich Village. The original University Building housed ateliers that were the forerunners of the current downtown art scene. And although Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was turned down for a teaching post, literature thrived, with University Building even featured in an 1861 novel by Theodore Winthrop. Finally, this neighborhood and this institu- tion have had a long tradition of social and political activism\u2014from the Stonecutters Riot over the construction of the University's first building in 1834 to the tragic T riangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911, a major event in U.S. labor history that took place in what is now the Brown Building. From its earliest days, then, the College on Washington Square has been at the cutting edge of intellectual, cultural, and social developments. In 1895, however, NYU's great chancellor, Henry McCracken, decided to reserve Washington Square for the professional schools, which had prolifer- ated under his leadership, and to move University College to a beautiful campus in the Bronx\u2014University Heights\u2014designed by Stanford White. The College's move to the Heights reflected McCracken's \"Ivy\" aspirations for the school and his successful effort to raise quality by attracting the best students nationally. Also relevant was the ascendant, nonurban collegiate ideal of a residential community, with fine teaching, extracurricular activities, fraternities, and intercollegiate athletics. A few years later, an undergraduate presence was restored downtown with the opening of a Collegiate Division (1903), soon to become Washington Square College (1913). This school had a more diverse student body, opening its doors to women, recent immi-grants, commuters, and professional students. For over 60 years, undergraduate liberal arts education at NYU took place in two locations\u2014University College (and the Engineering School) at the Heights and the College on Washington Square, both offering excellent, but different, educational and social experiences. In the 1970s, the College underwent yet another major transformation. In response to financial pressures, the Heights campus was closed in 1973, and University College merged with Washington Square College. The new institution, which is now known simply as the College of Arts and Science, is the beneficiary of both traditions\u2014the Heights' residential and collegiate culture and the Square's progressive urban focus. At that time, a decision was also made to build aggressively for quality\u2014to recruit the very best faculty and students, to update and expand the physical plant, and to create dis- tinguished programs both here and abroad. In recent years, the College has become recognized as a national leader for its efforts to reinvent a liberal arts education for the 21st century. With a challenging liberal arts core, the Morse Academic Plan, at the center of the curriculum, the College emphasizes student inquiry and research, offers unique opportunities for interna-tional and preprofessional study, and makes use of the city as a site for learning and service. A liberal arts education thus recon- ceived is not only personally enriching but also eminently practical in developing the skills and perspectives essential to assume a leadership role in the 21st century. As the new millennium proceeds, the College continues to build on its founders' goal of providing \"Useful Knowledge.\"The history of the College of Arts and Science begins with the founding of the University by a number of prominent New Yorkers, led by Albert Gallatin, a member of Jefferson's cabinet. Unlike other insti- tutions at the time, it was to be nonsectarian and to produce a different sort of elite citizen, not born to privilege but set apart for leadership by talent and effort. To that end, it provided a more practical education, what the 19th century called \"Useful knowledge.\"13 College Directory COLLEGE DIRECTORY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYG.

Study of a foreign language 2. The Expository Writing Program 3. Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) 4. Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) Though structured and integrated, the MAP curriculum affords students flexibility in a number of ways. It permits the choice of different tracks in each component, the satisfaction of some courses by examination or Advanced Placement credit (foreign language, FSI), and the substitution of departmental courses (FSI, and certain requirements in FCC). Given this flexibility, students work individually with advisers to plan course schedules that take into account their past preparation, current interests, and longer-term goals. While there is no prescribed schedule of courses that will be appropriate for every student, the following broad guidelines should be kept in mind: Incoming freshmen should complete their MAP courses by the end of sophomore year. This will leave them free in their junior and senior years to focus on their major and elective courses. Some science majors, engineering students, prehealth students, and students placed in the International Writing Workshop sequence may need to delay starting, and thus finishing, a component of the MAP for a semester or more. Students who study away may also need to delay completing their MAP courses beyond the sophomore year. Students must complete Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1) during their first year. Those placed into the Liberal Studies Writing or International Writing Workshop sequences must begin in their first semester and must register for their remaining writing course(s) in the semester(s) immediately following. In designing the MAP , the faculty sought to ensure that all students would receive a broad exposure to the liberal arts early in their college careers. With this wide academic horizon, the MAP encourages students to discover new intellectual interests outside their intended areas of specialization and to pursue those interests with elective courses outside their majors in their later undergraduate years.Programdirector of the morse academic Plan To be announced director of the expository Writing Program Professor Hoy associate director of the morse a cademic Plan for f oundations of contemporary culture Clinical Associate Professor Renzi associate director of the morse a cademic Plan for foundations of Scientific Inquiry Clinical Associate Professor JordanThe Morse Academic Plan (MAP) of the College of Arts and Science is an integrated general education curriculum in the liberal arts. The MAP is named for Samuel F . B. Morse, an early faculty member of the University. Best known as inventor of the electric telegraph, Morse taught fine arts at NYU and was an eminent painter. In his breadth of talent and high achievement as both an artist and scientist, Morse symbolizes the range of skills and interests that the MAP is designed to foster. The MAP provides a core academic experience for undergraduates at NYU. Through a challenging array of foundational courses, the program heightens cultural awareness, hones critical reading skills, and promotes creative and logical thinking. It also gives students extensive practice writing and speaking English and profi- ciency in at least one other language. Rather than specifying a fixed canon of knowledge, the MAP focuses on modes and methods of humanistic and scientific inquiry. In each case, students are free to pursue particular interests by choosing among a number of courses. Students examine our contemporary culture\u2014its origins and social structures, its modes of expression, and its inherent diversity and evolving patterns of thought. In other classes, they consider the place and importance of modern science\u2014its quantitative and analytical foun- dations, its processes of reasoning, and its relationship to technology and to our views of the natural world. By helping them to broaden their perspectives, gain new pathways for intellectual inquiry, and develop the skills, background, and social awareness to thrive in dynamic circumstances, the MAP seeks to prepare students for their later studies and to equip them well for lives as thinking individuals and members of society.www.map.cas.nyu.edu Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 903, New York, NY 10003-6680 Phone: 212-998-8119The Morse A CADEMIC PLAN C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYThe study of foreign languages is an integral part of a liberal arts education. It nurtures an awareness of the diversity of human culture and serves the practical need for language skills in fields such as govern-ment, business, and research. New York University is a particularly exciting setting for language study because of its location in a great cosmopolitan city, its international student body, its many renowned language programs and centers, and its numerous opportunities for study away. In addition to the foreign language courses offered for academic credit, the College offers opportunities for students of modern languages to practice their skills in real-world situations outside the classroom. NYU Speaking Freely is a free, noncredit program that allows students to practice their speaking and aural comprehension skills and to explore the linguistically diverse cultures of New York City. For more information about this popular program, con- tact the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 909; 212-998-8140. Increasingly, college graduates must be prepared to function in a global society. Apart from the inherent interest of learning about other cultures, many NYU students take the opportunity to study or travel abroad as preparation for their future careers. For more information about study away programs, visit the Office of Global Programs, 110 East 14th Street, New York, NY 10003-4170 (212-998-4433) and consult the Study Away section of this Bulletin. Requirement To fulfill the foreign language component of the Morse Academic Plan, students must show or attain proficiency in a foreign language through the inter- mediate level. Ordinarily, this is accomplished by the successful completion of two years of language study in the College, through the second semester of a regular intermediate-level language sequence. Some languages are also taught as intensive courses, allowing students to complete the equivalent of two years of study in a single year. After two years of college language study or the equivalent demonstrated proficiency, students should have gained a broad competence in a language, but true fluency of written or oral expression will not usually have been developed at this point. For this reason, all students are encouraged to continue their language study beyond the intermediate level. In particular, students studying modern languages will find it most beneficial to immerse themselves in the living culture of a language by studying, traveling, or working abroad. Likewise, students of all languages, whether ancient or modern, are encouraged to con-tinue their studies with elective courses in literature at the advanced level. Exemptions Students may fulfill the foreign language component of the MAP by presenting outstanding scores on the SAT Subject Test or Advanced Placement Test in cer- tain foreign languages, or by passing a departmental proficiency examination. For further information on language placement and exemption, see \"Placement Examinations\" in the Academic Policies section of this Bulletin. For Advanced Placement Test equiva-lencies, consult the chart in the Admission section, also in this Bulletin. Students whose secondary schooling was in a language other than English and other than a language offered in the College, or who complete the International Writing Workshop sequence (EXPOS-UA 4, 9), are exempt from the foreign language requirement. Also exempt are students in the dual-degree engineering program. Courses Listed below are courses covering the second semester of the intermediate level of language study. Intensive courses, which allow students to complete the equivalent of two years of study in a single year, are also listed where available. Completion of any of the following courses will fulfill the foreign language requirement. Please consult the individual departmental listings for information on prerequisite courses.

Not every language is offered at Columbia every semester. eXPo SITorY WrITINgIt is difficult to exaggerate the value of clear and effective writing. The Expository Writing Program at NYU assumes that writing is not merely a useful skill but also a way of learning and knowing. Its courses focus on the examination of evidence, the development of ideas, and the clear expression of those ideas in a variety of different kinds of essays. In these writing courses, students routinely move from exploration to argument as they read and make use of various texts\u2014written, visual, experiential\u2014to create a spectrum of persuasive essays. Examined texts become more complex, and the writing tasks more difficult, as students grapple with intriguing questions that lead to richer ideas and more interesting forms of expression. The essays students write become more formal and argumentative as the semester's work progresses. For a complete description of the curriculum, see the Expository Writing Program section of this Bulletin.19 THE MORSE A CADEMIC PLAN MORSE A CADEMIC PLAN C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYThe Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the Morse Academic Plan is a series of four coordinated courses in the humanities and social sciences. Within each of the four offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes. Overall, the structure of the FCC ensures that every student in the College gains a common core of skills and experiences in the liberal arts. In addition to the information on the FCC sequence provided in this Bulletin, detailed descriptions of each year's course offerings may be found on the MAP website. Texts and Ideas Texts and Ideas introduces students to the ideals of liberal education and the central role of humanistic study in the liberal arts and fosters appreciation of the importance of humanistic learning for society at large. Students become acquainted with some of the literary and philosophical works that have been most influential in shaping the contemporary world and with significant instances in which the ideas in these works have been debated, developed, appropriated, or rejected. Texts and Ideas is not a survey but, rather, an examination of how texts influence subsequent thinking, create traditions, and reflect societal ideals. Texts and Ideas thus aims to provide a richer understanding of how cultures are constructed, modified, and represented. cultures and c ontexts Cultures and Contexts prepares students for life in a globalized world by introducing them to the ways in which humans come to understand themselves as members of social, religious, national, and regional collectives and by fostering their appreciation of the dynamics of cultural interaction and influ- ence. Individual sections focus on specific social or cultural groups different from the dominant tradi-tions of contemporary North America. They share a common concern to examine the ways cultures have interacted, for example, through trade, coloniza- tion, immigration, religious dispersion, and media representation; how such groups define themselves against internal and external difference; and how the dominant perspective of Western modernity affects comprehension of the ways in which people outside that position understand, experience, and imagine their lives. Offerings include emergent traditions, diaspora formations, and societies understood as nationally, geographically, or culturally distinct from the domi- nant traditions of contemporary North America. Courses focusing on ancient civilizations are also included, as are courses that address contemporary challenges to traditional European conceptions of national identity. Societies and the Social Sciences Over the past several centuries, enormous social transformations have taken place around the world. To understand the complexity of these phenomena, new methods have been developed to study societal structures and human behavior. Each of the courses under Societies and the Social Sciences begins from a particular disciplinary approach, social concern, or topic, in order to orient students to the characteristic methods of these social sciences. Students learn how issues are objectified for study, how data are collected and analyzed, and how new understanding is thereby achieved. Whether through an interdis- ciplinary approach, consideration of their historical development, or reflection on critical and positivistic debates, the courses help students both to appreciate the unique insights afforded by these methods and to recognize the limits of such inquiry. In this way, students move beyond the particular focus of the class to a broader understanding of methods and problems in the social sciences generally. expressive culture In Expressive Culture, students explore the complexities of artistic expression in various media: sounds, images, words, performance, or film. Each course introduces requisite historical, formal, and critical vocabularies; examines fundamental issues associated with interpretation of the arts making use of these media; and investigates the complex relations between artistic activity and other facets of social organization. The courses also make use, whenever possible, of the rich cultural resources of New York City.foUNda TIoNS of coNTemPorar Y cUlTUre20 THE MORSE A CADEMIC PLAN C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYThe Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) component of the Morse Academic Plan is a series of three coordinated courses in quantitative reason- ing and the natural sciences. Together, these courses ensure that every student in the College gains a fundamental understanding of how mathematics and laboratory experimentation advance scientific investigation. While some students acquire this background through course work offered in the science majors, FSI courses are especially designed to meet the needs of nonscience students. Within each of the three offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes. In addition to the information on the FSI provided in this Bulletin, detailed descriptions of each year's course offerings may be found on the MAP website. Quantitative reasoning Students in Quantitative Reasoning engage mathematical concepts in a variety of contexts in the natural or social sciences. All courses include a substantial amount of problem solving that requires both conceptual and computational work. Natural Science I Scientific knowledge has its basis in our natural curiosity about the world around us and our place in it. These courses approach the physical sciences with the intent of asking and trying to answer interesting questions, dealing with topics ranging from the origin of our universe and planet to how human activity affects our environment. Students consider the important roles played by laws of physics and chemistry in biology, earth and environmental sciences, astrophysics, and cosmology; they also develop an understanding of how the physical sciences inform the natural sciences generally. Mathematics is introduced in each course with frequent applica-tions to the subject matter. Predictions that can be made only with the use of mathematics are clearly delineated, showing the powerful role it plays in our understanding of the universe. Wherever possible, the courses relate science to societal problems and develop a historical perspective. Natural Science II The complexity of the biological realm continues to fascinate and challenge modern scientists, who are currently engaged in such diverse pursuits as exploring the organization and function of the brain, reconstructing the origin of the human species, link- ing the multiplicity of interactions in ecosystems, and deciphering the influence of heredity on com- plex traits. The courses in Natural Science II take a nontraditional approach to the life sciences, with an emphasis on approaching science as a dynamic process of investigation and discovery. Each course selects a broad theme that is at the forefront of contemporary research, then uses specific questions and examples to introduce students to the method- ology of scientific inquiry, the critical evaluation of results, and the mathematical tools used to quantify scientific information.foUNda TIoNS of ScIeNTIfIc INQUIr Y21 HONORS SEMINARS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYwww.cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.honorsprograms Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 908, New York, NY 10003-6688 Phone: 212-998-8110 director of c ollege honors Programs Associate Professor Deer freshman h onors Seminars The Freshman Honors Seminars, required of all incoming students, have as their goals to put new students into contact with leading thinkers (both distinguished faculty members and eminent visitors), to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through rigorous standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research. To that end, they stress demanding readings and writing assignments that introduce students to an essential research skill\u2014such as a literature review, quantitative reasoning, critical use of primary sources, the identification of a research problem, critical analysis of texts, or confrontations with works of art. In addition to participating actively in class discussions, students are expected to give oral presentations in class. A final paper will typically, though not always, have gone through one or more revisions, perhaps revised with the benefit of in-class comments. In other seminars, the focus may be on individual or group projects. collegiate Seminars First-year students may elect to register for one of the Collegiate Seminars to satisfy the Freshman Honors Seminar requirement. The Collegiate Seminars are taught exclusively by distinguished senior Arts and Science faculty whose excellence as scholars and teachers has been recognized by their appointment as Collegiate Professors. These faculty not only teach these first-year courses, but also serve as their students' mentors through-out their entire undergraduate careers at NYU. During the semester in which the seminar is offered and in subsequent semesters, the faculty work with their students to create special enrichment and reunion activities, which might include a visit with a renowned scholar; a museum, theatre, concert, or film outing; a dinner discussion on a book or poem; or just a purely social evening. collegiate Professors Young advanced h onors Seminars The Advanced Honors Seminar program extends the principles of the Freshman Honors and Collegiate Seminars to upper-level courses. These courses have as their goals to put undergraduates into contact with leading thinkers (drawn not only from the College's faculty but also from NYU's professional schools and from among New York's professional, cultural, and governmental leaders), to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE Honors Seminars The College of Arts and Science is one of the most diverse communities anywhere-an exciting, sophisticated center in one of the most exciting and cosmopolitan cities in the world. Our mission is to prepare students to be thought leaders and successful global citizens. We do this by creating unique academic opportunities for student and faculty engagement that emphasize research and scholarly communication. As part of the College's Honors Program, the Freshman Honors Seminars, Collegiate Seminars, and Advanced Honors Seminars place students in small classes with first-rate instructors to study topics that have the potential to change how we think and how we work. As such, they are ideal gateways for the intellectually stimulating discussions we aim to foster. They challenge students and faculty to engage intensively within and beyond their fields of study, and they inspire intellectual responsibility toward the scholarly community and the wider world. All first-year students are required to take either a Freshman Honors or Collegiate Seminar, while sophomores and juniors (and, if space allows, seniors) may choose to register for an Advanced Honors Seminar. Program22 HONORS SEMINARS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYCOLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE HONORS SEMINARS intellectually through demanding standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research (for example, a Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund grant or a Senior Honors Thesis). In some instances, students may count the Advanced Honors Seminar toward their major or minor, if the department considers this appropriate; in other cases, the classes count simply as electives. Sophomores and juniors typically have priority in registering for Advanced Honors Seminars. general Information Most first-year seminars (Freshman Honors Seminars and Collegiate Seminars) are given only in the fall semes- ter, while the upper-level offerings (Advanced Honors Seminars) are offered in the spring. The array of seminars changes from year to year. Brochures describing all the seminar offerings and their instructors appear during the academic year and are available in the CAS Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 905) as well as in the CAS Office of the Dean (Silver Center, Room 909). Students may also find the most up-to-date offerings and descriptions at http://cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.HonorsPrograms. Below is a sampling of recent seminars in the three programs. Except where noted, the seminars do not assume any specific course or background on the student's part. Computer Simulation FRSEM-UA 207 Peskin. 4 points. A hands-on course in which students learn how to program computers to simulate physical and biological processes. The course meets alternately in classroom and computer laboratory settings. The techniques needed to perform such simulations are taught in class and then applied in the laboratory by the students themselves, who work individually or in teams on computing projects and report on these projects to the group as a whole. Students learn how to make the computer generate graphics, movies, and sounds as needed for presentation of the results of the different simulations. Examples emphasized in class include the orbits of planets, moons, comets, and spacecraft; the spread of diseases in a population; the production of sound by musical instruments; and the electrical activity of nerves. Students may draw their projects from this list or choose other projects according to individual interests. Language and Reality in 20thCentury Science and Literature FRSEM-UA 210 Ulfers. 4 points. Explores the possibility that a common ground exists between the so-called two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (for example, quantum theory) and postmodern literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg's \"uncertainty principle\" and the \"undecidability\" of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions, and their implications in literary works, revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon, as well as from nontechnical texts on quantum and chaos theories. The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America FRSEM-UA 218 Sexton. 4 points. Should members of the Native American church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benedic-tion and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? This course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty, separation of church and state, and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more impor- tant, invites students to construct a new vision of the proper relationship among religion, state, and society in a 21st-century liberal constitutional democracy. First Amendment Freedom of Expression FRSEM-UA 235 Solomon. 4 points. Conflicts over freedom of speech erupt into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge indecency from online communications. A tobacco company sues a major television network for libel. Press disclosures threaten the fair-trial rights of defendants in the Oklahoma City bombing trial. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on speech, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open freShmaN hoNorS SemINarS23 HONORS SEMINARS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYCOLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE HONORS SEMINARS expression against other vital interests of society. This course begins by examining the struggle against sedi- tious libel (the crime of criticizing government or its officials) that was not won in this country until the landmark decision in New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964. Students examine freedom of speech through the prism of a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including political dissent that advocates overthrow of the government, prior restraints against publica- tion, flag burning, obscenity and pornography, the new law that bans indecency from online services, hate speech, and inflictions of emotional distress. Students read and analyze important decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. From the Rise of Christianity to Bowling Alone: A Sociological Perspective on T wo Millennia FRSEM-UA 282 Lehman. 4 points. The second decade of the new millennium has dawned with intensifying ideological cleavages in the United States and assertions that we are increasingly a nation of isolated individualists whose disregard for collective responsibilities is eroding civic virtues and democratic institutions. Our seminar's aim is to assess these diagnoses using Amitai Etzioni's The New Golden Rule as a theoretical template and relying on such analytical dimensions as autonomy versus order and freedom versus determinism. We first situate American society in the broader context of decisive moral and social transformations that have occurred in Western civilization over the last two thousand years. To that end, our seminar looks at Rodney Stark's acclaimed The Rise of Christianity, which focuses on formative developments during the first four centuries of the first millennium of the common era, and Max Weber's classic, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. We then examine social-science analyses of the contemporary American situation, with the help of such books as Habits of the Heart by Robert Bellah and his colleagues. Our final readings are Robert Putnam's controversial Bowling Alone, which remains the most publicized critique of contem- porary American civic life, and Claude S. Fischer's recent Made in America, which paints a much more upbeat picture of what is happening around us. The Crusades and Their Legacy FRSEM-UA 296 Claster. 4 points. In the history of the interactions among Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, the Crusades, which began at the end of the 11th century, form one of the most important chapters, if not the most important chap- ter. The Crusades began as religious wars to recover the holy places venerated by Christians in the city of Jerusalem. For 200 years, the Crusaders managed to hold on to their possessions, losing more of them with every passing decade, until at last the Muslims triumphed and the kingdom in the East was lost to Western Christendom. This seminar covers the Crusades themselves, but focuses on the relations among the three great religions and how it came about that they all claim Jerusalem for their own. We study the differences among the religions, as well as their many similarities. Most of all, we address some of the problems crucial to an understanding of the world we live in: the nature of a holy war, the issue of whether the Crusades were the first manifestation of European imperialism in the Middle East, and the legacy of the crusading era. Readings include Muslim, Jewish, and Christian writings of the era in translation, as well as secondary works. Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos? FRSEM-UA 306 Casta\u00f1eda. 4 points. Focuses on several aspects of Latin America's prob-lems in the past and their possible solutions today. The seminar takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic rule during the first 160 or 170 years of independence from colonial rule and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the absence of economic growth during the last 20 years and the possibility of a new economic takeoff today; the widespread persistence of violence in Latin America and the growing respect for human rights today; and the weakness of civil society in Latin America in the past and the growing strength and vigor of civil society today. For each topic, readings deal with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present. Documentary Theatre FRSEM-UA 351 Martin. 4 points. Explores the subject matter, history, and theoretical discourses surrounding the global occurrence of contemporary theatre of the real, also popularly known as documentary theatre. By analyzing the content, structure, and dramatic devices of a number of plays, we will look at the problems and possibili- ties of the ways in which theatre that cites reality portrays a range of human behavior from everyday life to important political events in the attempt to create and recreate personal, political, and historical realities. Documentary theatre both acknowledges a positivist faith in empirical reality and underscores an epistemological crisis in knowing truth. We read 24 HONORS SEMINARS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYCOLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE HONORS SEMINARS plays about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, terror- ism, the Holocaust, racial clashes, the deposition of Cardinal Law, Oscar Wilde, the murder of Matthew Shepard, Lebanese suicide bombers, the open murder of demonstrators in Greensboro, the cover-up of indus- trial accidents in Poland, honor killings in Holland, and accompanying theoretical essays, as well as look at some performances on video. The questions we will consider include: Can theatre effectively critique social and moral values? What are the implications of the blurring of art and life? Are fiction and nonfiction adequate terms for considering the idea of truth? How might we consider theatre of the real from the vantage point of the contemporary collapse of the distinction between the real, the simulated, and the virtual? Literary Theory and Its Applications FRSEM-UA 355 Maynard. 4 points. Students in this seminar read a selection of essays from major thinkers about literature, mainly from the latter half of the 20th century, to learn to consider different approaches to literature. They complete the course by preparing a discussion of a work of litera-ture using one or more of the conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis is placed on learning how to analyze theoretical problems and improvise in applying them to new situations. Recommended for students interested in any area of the humanities. Welcome to College: The Novel FRSEM-UA 371 Sternhell. 4 points. Starting college can be exhilarating\u2014and terrifying. A chance for intellectual enlightenment\u2014or intense loneliness. An escape from a stultifying small town of narrow-minded people\u2014or a riot of alcohol, sex, and drugs. In this course, we read a selection of col-lege novels from different historical periods, ranging from F . Scott Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise (about life at Princeton just before World War I) to Tom Wolfe's recent bestseller I Am Charlotte Simmons (about the corruption of a brilliant and innocent country girl at a contemporary Ivy university). We discuss these novels from a variety of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition to presenting biographical and historical/cultural reports on at least two of the authors and their novels, students write about their own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres, includ-ing fiction and nonfiction. Together, we explore this important life passage, examining life as we live it. Lethal Passions: Medea and Her Legacies FRSEM-UA 377 Theodoratou. 4 points. The mythic figure of Medea has held our imagination for nearly 2,500 years. What kind of woman is capable of casting such an enduring spell? Best known as the partner of Jason and the murderer of her own children, Medea has been the name of an exploration into the passion and violence, the devastation and vengeance, the complex relations and modes of betrayal that so often punctuate our everyday existence. She has demanded that we think about the relations between the sexes, the meaning of home and exile, the experience of the foreigner, the ethical and moral dimensions of agency and decisions, and the meaning of mother- hood. Because these issues have remained vital, her popularity has outlived the ancient Greek texts in which she was born and has found new expressions in various forms\u2014including tragic drama, poetry, novels, painting, cinema, and music. This course seeks to understand the reasons for her longevity in the rich complexity of her character and actions and to explore the ways in which her story has been revised and recontextualized across the ages for new and different ends. We will consider a range of texts from antiquity to the present to think about how they understand the tensions, contradictions, and conflicting desires embodied and enacted in this mesmerizing figure. Computational Thought FRSEM-UA 385 Prerequisite: AP calculus, discrete mathematics, or some programming experience. Shasha. 4 points. Computational technology and methods lie at the core of modern science, commerce, entertainment, and, regrettably, war. Very powerful ideas underlie the field, with roots in mathematics, linguistics, engineering, and even philosophy. Some of its greatest inventions were born in caf\u00e9s or as responses to a puzzle. Some recent algorithmic methods come from studying ants and evolution. This course introduces computational thinking as it builds on logic, linguis- tics, heuristics, artificial intelligence, and biological computing. The learning style combines straight lecture, interactive discussions of puzzles and games, and short computer programs (in the programming language Python). Students make a few presentations during the semester about topics such as the solutions to computationally motivated puzzles, the relative power of linguistic descriptions, and their very own simulations of a Rogerian psychiatrist. The goal is for students to learn to think about computation from multiple perspectives and to synthesize those perspectives when faced with unsolved challenges.25 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE HONORS SEMINARS HONORS SEMINARS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYComfort and Suffering FRSEM-UA 393 Fulmer. 4 points. The purpose of this seminar is to explore the nature of comfort and suffering as a human experience. We examine related readings through the lens of the health care system paradigm and use case studies to explore the wellness-illness continuum of human experi-ences. Students become familiar with conceptual frameworks used by nurses, physicians, and social workers as they assist patients through the illness experience, which is continually balanced between comfort and suffering. Our discussions on the nature of comfort and suffering focus on writings from the Bible, which are contrasted with contemporary edito- rials and publications, in order to examine historical changes in the way individuals think about these important dimensions of the human experience. Scientific advances create heretofore unimaginable opportunities, choices, and dilemmas for all of us as we seek to discern how to cope with disease, human suffering, and the psychological consequences that are inevitable when illness and care needs create complexity in our lives. We debate the notion of \"self-care,\" now very popular in the health care literature, and con- trast it with the concept of \"patient abandonment.\" Thirteen Masterworks of 20thCentury Classical Music FRSEM-UA 397 Boorman. 4 points. The last hundred years have seen radical changes in classical music, not only in the sound world but also in aesthetic and technique\u2014ranging from the breakdown of tonality and the use of electronic and computer resources in performance to questions of the relationship of composer and performer, of the place of noise, and even of what music is or could be. This course presents outstanding works by a range of composers (among them, Stravinsky, Carter, and Messiaen) both because of their importance and as illustrations of ideas about music. Each composi- tion is explored for itself and also as a stimulus to discussion about one or more of these issues. Each composition is one that has stood the test of time and been hailed as a major work\u2014and those criteria also need discussion. The course involves considerable listening alongside readings. It requires a willingness to reassess conventional views about music and to accept unconventional solutions. Alexis de T ocqueville FRSEM-UA 398 Berman. 4 points. Alexis de Tocqueville published Democracy in America in two volumes, in 1835 and 1840. Those volumes have come to be widely regarded as a masterpiece twice over, the most incisive portrait of the American national character ever written, and a profound reflec- tion on the meaning of democracy itself. Democracy in America is also a beautiful work of literature. This seminar studies Democracy in America in depth. It looks at some of Tocqueville's writings on his own country, France, and glances briefly at his predecessor and kinsman, Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand, who visited America in the 1790s. By reading and discussing Tocqueville and Chateaubriand, students sharpen their ability to think philosophically about democracy, America, France, and other themes and increase their ability to recognize and appreciate the art of good writing. The Meanings of Photography FRSEM-UA 400 Baer. 4 points. We live in an illustrated world, and photographs have come to determine political, personal, and even the most private of decisions. Who is guilty and who is exonerated? Who gets elected and who loses the vote? Whom do you like, will you get to know, or want to be with? Whom you remember and whom will you forget depend on how someone or something has been presented in a photograph. To navigate this maze of images takes special skills. Nowhere more powerfully than in photographs have the lines between reality and fiction, truth and lie, been blurred. There is great danger in this develop-ment and immense potential to free ourselves from existing constraints, too. This interdisciplinary seminar explores how photographic images create meaning and how they help us make the worlds we live in. Particular attention is paid to the way photography marks the often invisible difference between someone's private world and the world at large. We read major theoretical texts on photogra- phy, watch films where photographs play a decisive role, and look at a wide range of photographs from the inception of the medium to the current moment to test theories of photography against the medium's uncanny and unrivaled power to evoke the real. Be prepared to look closely and to think hard. Readings include texts by Siegfried Kracauer, Walter Benjamin, Vladimir Rodchenko, Andr\u00e9 Bazin, Flusser, and Mario Vargas Llosa, as well as images by a plethora of artists, profession- als, and amateurs from around the globe. Guitar Heroes (and Heroines): Music, Video Games, and the Nature of Human Cognition FRSEM-UA 427 Marcus. 4 points. 26 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE HONORS SEMINARS HONORS SEMINARS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYA look at music and video games from the perspec- tive of cognitive and evolutionary psychology. Among the questions we consider: Why are human beings so passionate about music and so easily sucked in by video games? Is our love of music the product of natural selection? Can science tell us anything about what works in music and what doesn't? What is the relationship between music and language? Is there a \"universal grammar\" for music? Will machines ever be able to create satisfying works of music? The primary focus is on the psychology of music, with video games serving as counterpoint. Readings are drawn from a broad range of disciplines, including psychology, linguistics, evolutionary biol- ogy, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience. Written assignments include weekly reaction papers and a final paper proposing a novel experiment. collegIa Te SemINarSThe Cultural Nature of Language COSEM-UA 101 Schieffelin. 4 points. From accents and pronouns to swearing and spell- ing, how one uses language is never value-free. We examine language use as a social practice and analyze how speakers and their language(s) are evaluated and regulated across a range of contexts and cultures. Starting with how children learn to talk, or don't (for example, feral children), we examine speech and silence across a range of societies. We also look at popular attitudes toward language and the practices by which people regulate its use in the media (for example, political correctness), in legal and educational institutions (such as \"English only\"), and in multilingual cities (such as Barcelona and Montreal) to understand how ideas about language are often recruited to nonlinguistic concerns, such as who should be included or excluded. In thinking about the cultural nature of language in this way, we critically explore issues of identity and authority. T errorism, Nihilism, and Modernity COSEM-UA 102 Gilligan. 4 points. The past century has witnessed violence the character and scale of which are so unique and unprecedented that we have had to create a new vocabulary to describe it (genocide, terrorism) and the ideologies that underlie it (totalitarianism, fundamentalism). To understand modern violence, we examine the ori-gin of the modern mind in the 17th century, when science, based on universal doubt, ended the Age of Faith, and the traditional sources of moral, legal, and political authority lost credibility. Nietzsche called this the \"death of God\" (and the Devil); it could also be called the death of Good and Evil, leading to another set of new words (nihilism, agnosticism, anomie, anarchy). We study the origins and implica- tions of these developments by reading Shakespeare and John Donne, Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky, Beckett and Wittgenstein, Simone Weil and Hannah Arendt, as well as modern mass murderers from Hitler to bin Laden. Finally, we ask whether modern human sciences can help us understand how to reverse or at least limit this escalation of violence. In Search of Lost Time COSEM-UA 104 Clements. 4 points. We read Proust (in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also with delectation. A prodigious novel, 4,500 pages long, In Search of Lost Time addresses literature's richest theme: desire\u2014its remembrance, transforma- tion, perversion, defeat, and final resurgence in the form of art. More than 100 years old, often said to be the first modern novel, it remains a dazzling por- trait of the French beau monde and, even more, of the power and elegance of its author's sensibility. It is still unparalleled in how it combines self-examina- tion with social history, extraordinary psychological acuity with the study of glamour and decadence, and how it merges an audacious explosion of form with explorations of memory, attachment, deception, lust, jealousy, ambition, disappointment, and ennui. It is also one of the most pleasurable and elating reads. Although Marcel Proust (1871-1922) is usually assumed to be France's greatest novelist, his prose is so layered and brilliant that, unfortunately, many readers begin at the beginning and never move past the first 50 pages, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. While In Search of Lost Time's prose style (playing on association, evocation, magnifica-tion, punning, rhythm) may have been its most radical contribution to the art of the novel, it cannot be understood until it has been read once in its entirety. In this seminar, we keep moving at a brisk pace through the work, merely glancing at its riches on our way, until we arrive at the uniquely euphoric experience of reading the final volume, Time Regained. Required reading: an average of 350 pages per week.27 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE HONORS SEMINARS HONORS SEMINARS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYAmerican Wars, Past and Present: Vietnam, Iraq (I and II), Afghanistan COSEM-UA 106 Young. 4 points. Considers the last two major wars of the 20th century and the first two of the 21st century. The seminar begins with the history, memory, and subsequent political uses of the Vietnam War. We then move on to examine the Gulf War I (Operation Desert Storm), which was shaped by the way the administration of President George H. W. Bush understood the Vietnam War. The subsequent war in Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom) can be understood in part in terms of what some policymakers believed to be the unfinished business of Gulf War I. Yet it too was fought in the shadow of Vietnam analo- gies. Finally, the war in Afghanistan, launched in response to 9/11, in terms of tactics and goals, has been shaped by all three of the preceding wars. We examine these wars through primary documents and secondary sources, as well as the abundance of documentary and fiction film in which they have all been represented. The overarching concern of the seminar is the ongoing haunting of American politics\u2014military and civilian\u2014by a war fought over three decades ago. There are two connected questions: Can history teach? What does it teach? Zoo\u00ebsis: Animal Acts for Changing Times COSEM-UA 107 Chaudhuri. 4 points. The emerging field of animal studies has already generated neologisms in various disciplines: \"anthrozoology\" (culture studies), \"zoopolis\" (urban social theory), and \"zoontology\" (philosophy). To these the fields of literature and performance studies propose an addition, \"zoo\u00ebsis,\" to refer to the history of animal representation that stretches, in the Western literary tradition, from Aesop's Fables to Will Self's Great Apes; in the Western dramatic tradition, from Aristophanes' The Frogs to Albee's The Goat; in film, from Muybridge's \"zoogyroscope\" to Herzog's Grizzly Man; in popular culture, from Mickey Mouse to Animal Planet; and in popular performance, from gladiatorial contests to Siegfried and Roy. To speak of zoo\u00ebsis is also to acknowledge the manifold performances engendered by cultural animal practices such as dog shows, keeping pets, equitation, rodeo, bullfighting, animal sacrifice, scientific experimentation, taxidermy, hunting, wearing fur, eating meat\u2014each with its own archive and repertory, its own performers and spectators. We study recent films, novels, plays, and cultural events that reveal how our interaction with animals shapes our understanding of the human, our approach to the \"Other\" (including the racial and ethnic \"Other\"), and our attitude toward the world. Matter, Dark Matter, and Dark Energy COSEM-UA 108 Farrar. 4 points. The past several decades have seen tremendous advances in observational cosmology. As a result, we understand in remarkable detail many aspects of the evolution and contents of the universe. This course focuses on three of the most puzzling facts about the universe: Why was there a slight excess of matter over antimatter after the Big Bang? (Otherwise, after matter-antimatter annihilation was complete, no matter would have been left.) What is dark matter? (Although on average in the universe it is five times more abundant than normal matter, we know that it is something not found on earth or, so far, observed in our laboratories.) What is so-called \"dark energy\"? (The expansion rate of the universe is actually accel- erating, rather than slowing down as was expected, a finding attributed to this new component of the universe.) Students enrolling in the seminar should have taken AP Physics, be enrolled in Physics I (PHYS-UA 91), or have permission of the instructor. How We See COSEM-UA 109 Carrasco. 4 points. Do we see the world the way we do because we are the way we are or because the world is the way it is? The ease with which we comprehend the visual world and recognize objects and events makes it tempting to think that the world is just the way we see it and to take our perceptual capabilities for granted. But when we comprehend that we cannot process all the information available in the environment, when we try to build machines that can see, or when we encounter people who have lost some specific visual capability\u2014for example, those who can no longer recognize faces\u2014we realize how extraordinary and intricate are the machinery and mechanisms of sight. This course looks at what we know about vision from multiple scientific perspectives. Perceptual psychology tells us about the process of seeing and provides important insights into the workings of visual mechanisms; neuropsy- chology shows us what happens to perception when these mechanisms malfunction; and neuroscience tells us about processes at the level of cells and neural systems. At the same time, we discuss modes and techniques of scientific inquiry from these different perspectives. How do vision scientists learn? What kinds of experiments do they conduct? How has 28 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE HONORS SEMINARS HONORS SEMINARS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYthe development of new neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, for example) shaped the field? Great Science, Fabulous Science, and Voodoo Science COSEM-UA 111 Mincer. 4 points. Science is often portrayed as following a very clearly defined set of procedures: start with a hypothesis, do an experiment, and, based on the results, reject the hypothesis or adopt it as a working assumption. The actual process, however, is rarely so straightforward. In addition, the stories as usually told or recorded may differ from what really happened. We study some famous and infamous experiments, mainly in the physical sciences, selected to illustrate intellectual tours de force, cases of error, cases of fraud, and the murky boundaries between them. Along the way, issues such as the discarding of \"faulty data,\" theoretical bias, and probabilistic tools for hypoth-esis acceptance and rejection are discussed. To take this course, students should have had high school chemistry, physics, and calculus. Finding New York City COSEM-UA 114 Serrin. 4 points. In this seminar, students explore, read, and write about\u2014and develop a deep understanding of\u2014New York City from diverse perspectives and by means of various media. We venture into different neighbor- hoods, ethnic areas, all five boroughs, out on the Hudson and East rivers, restaurants, parks, and the like. We examine New York history and how the city has changed over the decades, writing several pieces on what we see and read and what people tell us. In the end, all should have an understanding of how New York City began, how it has changed over time, what remains from the old days, what new things are happening, and what the future might be. This is, in short, a course in urban America that takes New York City as its laboratory. The seminar turns to reading the splendid books or sections from the splendid books that deal with important aspects of the history and life of New York City, among them The Island at the Center of the World; Divided Loyalties; Forgotten Patriots; The Devil's Own Work: The Civil War Draft Riots and the Fight to Reconstruct America; Five Points; Positively 4th Street; and A Freewheelin' Time: A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties. It also considers how the image of New York City in the movies has changed over the decades, drawing in part on the book Celluloid Skyline. In addition, it uses parts of the Ken Burns's PBS documentary series New York City.Russia's Multicultural Empire COSEM-UA 116 Burbank. 4 points. From the 16th century to the present, \"Russia\" has been an empire\u2014a state that spread its power over different peoples, with different religious commit- ments, different laws and customs, and different histories. This seminar explores the qualities of Russia's kind of empire. What held the vast ter- ritories and populations, ruled by tsars and later by communists, together? Why has Russia not disintegrated or been torn apart by multiple wars among its many ethnic groups since 1991? (Chechnya is an exception to the quite peaceful breakup of the USSR into 15 states, all of them multiethnic.) We take a historical look at these ques- tions, examining both how Russian leaders ruled their many populations and how people living on the terrain of a succession of Russian empires\u2014the Grand Princedom of Muscovy, imperial Russia, the Soviet Union, and the Russian Federation\u2014have imagined their relations with each other and with these states. Our sources include historians' studies, literature, and documents of many types: games, maps, laws, and films. Each student has the chance to investigate a particular imperial situation, and we work together to understand the origins, habits, and effects of Russia's empires of difference. Impossible Writing COSEM-UA 118 Foer. 4 points. As with any art, literature's form determines what is possible. In this course, we challenge the boundar-ies of the form through a series of \"impossible\" exercises\u2014that is, pieces of writing that are asked to do what writing cannot do. For example, one assignment challenges literature's unique portability by generating \"site-specific\" stories around campus. Another assignment focuses on the lack of explicit tonality and atmosphere in writing by generating oral stories. In our discussions about the work produced, we explore the ways that these radical techniques can be brought into more traditional writing. The course focuses on the production of work, and students are expected to produce a piece of writing every week, usually between two paragraphs and four pages. Facing Fascism: The Spanish Civil War and U.S. Culture COSEM-UA 119 Fern\u00e1ndez. 4 points The Great Depression. Liberal democracy in crisis. On the rise: a spectrum of ideologies ranging from anarchism to fascism, offering solutions to the 29 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE HONORS SEMINARS HONORS SEMINARS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYafflictions of people all over the planet. July 1936: a right-wing military coup attempts to overthrow a democratically elected left-wing coalition govern- ment. All eyes turn toward Spain. This seminar is centered on NYU's Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives (ALBA), a vast collection of materials that chronicles the lives of the 2,800 Americans who, between 1936 and 1939, volunteered to fight fascism in Spain. We explore the place occupied by Spain and the Spanish Civil War in American culture from the 1930s forward; how journalists, writers, artists, and citizens reacted to the war in Spain; and how the legacy of the war has affected U.S. culture over the last 70 years. Each student completes a major research project based on the holdings of ALBA. Utopia and Apocalypse COSEM-UA 120 Borenstein. 4 points. The utopian impulse is the drive to create the perfect world; the apocalypse is the global cataclysm that is often considered utopia's prerequisite. In this seminar, we examine the development of the utopian tradition, as both literary genre and philosophical thought experiment. Among the questions to be considered: What is the relationship between utopia and the novel? How do we get from \"here\" (the imperfect world) to \"there\" (the perfect one), and how is this journey enacted in fiction? Why are the family, gender, and sexuality so central to the uto-pian tradition? What is the utopian conception of pleasure? Utopia is often seen as the culmination of historical progress, the goal toward which humanity has been striving. Later utopian (and anti-utopian) fictions often place their \"perfect\" societies in a post- apocalyptic framework, adding particular moral and temporal dimensions to utopia: not only does utopia become the endpoint of history, but the perfection of the coming world can be invoked to justify the cataclysm that precedes it. Course materials consist of fiction, scripture, philosophy, film, and graphic novels, including the works of Bacon, Campanella, Dostoevsky, LeGuin, Marx and Engels, More, Moore and Gibbons, and Plato. Moral Dilemmas of Work and Care in the 21st Century COSEM-UA 121 Gerson. 4 points. Modern societies have long sought to reconcile the conflict between self-development and caring for others by dividing women and men into different moral categories. Structural arrangements (such as the separation of home and work) and cultural pressures (such as the norms of intensive motherhood and good-providing fatherhood) expect women to find personal fulfillment in caring for others and men to care for others by sharing the rewards of their inde- pendent pursuits. Yet the rise of fluid families and post-industrial workplaces has severely undermined this gender division of \"moral labor.\" As women take on increasing economic responsibilities and men face a dwindling pool of stable jobs, rigid moral categories have given way to new moral dilemmas. In crafting an identity, how do women and men balance work commitments with a personal life? In forming adult relationships, how do they weigh the need for autonomy with the desire for enduring commitment? In caring for children, how do they trade off earning a living with family time? This course examines the link between blurring gender boundaries and the rise of new moral dilemmas of work and care. We examine the institutional roots of these dilemmas, explore the new strategies people are developing to resolve them, and consider the social and political consequences of these revolutionary shifts. Exploring the Mysteries of Behavior COSEM-UA 122 Kiorpes. 4 points. Did you ever wonder how whales navigate flaw- lessly over thousands of miles? Why songbirds sing? This course provides an in-depth look at a variety of organisms that have evolved particular, special behavioral adaptations as solutions to environmental challenges. Each neural system to be studied high- lights a unique combination of behavioral skill and environmental problem to be solved. For example, echolocation in bats is a navigation device and an adaptive hunting system that allows them to success- fully hunt on the wing; infrared sensing in snakes is an effective prey localization and defense mechanism, enhancing their survival in the absence of limbs. Students learn basic principles of sensory, motor, and cognitive neuroscience and study the mechanisms underlying the natural behavior of organisms. Students independently identify unique, species-spe-cific behavioral adaptations and explore the neural mechanisms related to those adaptations. The result- ing investigation forms the basis for a term paper and an oral presentation to the class. A high degree of student participation is expected. A textbook as well as primary research articles will comprise the readings. Students should have a strong background in biology, animal behavior, or psychology. The Mysteries of Paris: Detective Fiction in France COSEM-UA 125 Miller. 4 points. While critics debate the origins of detective fiction, 30 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE HONORS SEMINARS HONORS SEMINARS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYno one questions the central place this literary genre holds in contemporary arts production\u2014not only in novels but also in television, computer games, and film. In France alone, detective (or mystery) fiction accounts for 20 percent of all novels purchased dur- ing the year. The French, in fact, have inflected the genre in very particular ways: For example, thanks to the fascination of the great 19th-century writers Balzac and Hugo with the real-life police detective Vidocq, the \"ambiguous and obsessed\" fictional investigator has become a staple of both French and American detective fiction. The Franco-American connection also inspired author Edgar Allan Poe to situate his mysteries on Paris's Rue Morgue. In turn, his stories prompted a major output of detective fiction during France's Second Empire, many located in the \"City of Lights.\" From Gaston Leroux's and Eug\u00e8ne Sue's urban thrillers of the late 19th century to Daniel Pennac's hilarious multi-cultural adventures in Belleville, the hippest neighborhood of the 21st century, Paris has thus become a site to be decoded and observed, the crucible for questions basic to detective fiction the world over: Why do people commit crimes? What are the consequences for the individual and for society? What is the nature of evil? And what kind of human being dedicates himself or herself to finding out the answers? In this seminar, we analyze what constitutes a detective or mystery novel (and discuss the potential differ- ences between \"detective\" and \"mystery\"), trace the development of the genre in France, and examine why it is that reading such works is so compelling. We focus primarily on novels in which Paris plays a major role, studying how the city has been used to give shape to the underlying questions of the novel. We see, perhaps unsurprisingly, that French-language detective fiction has been as involved in imagining a mysterious Paris as in solving Paris's mysteries. Consuming China, Past and Present COSEM-UA 127 Waley-Cohen. 4 points. Material culture and consumption in China from imperial times to the present. This course explores some of the ways in which commerce and consumerism have flourished in China despite various potentially countervailing factors, including Confucians' presumed aversion to trade, Buddhist and Daoist renunciations of material things, wartime deprivations under the Republic, rising egali-tarianism, and Communist Party denunciations of bourgeois ideals of consumption. We will investigate such aspects as clothing and cosmetics; houses and gardens; art collecting and connoisseurship; books and publishing; food and narcotics; opera and theatre. While illuminating Chinese social and cul-tural life, including aspects of continuity or change over several centuries, the course also introduces students to theoretical concepts about modernity's relationship to the world of goods and consumption, and considers whether and to what extent those concepts, formulated in a largely western context, may or may not be applicable to China. Understanding 9/11 COSEM-UA 128 Gerety. 4 points. Examines the 9/11 attacks from an interdisciplinary perspective, seeking to reach a better understanding of the attack itself, the motivations and backgrounds of the attackers, the failures in the U.S. intelligence community's defenses\u2014and above all, the nature and scope of America's response, at home and abroad. We read studies of terrorism and counter- terrorism, including moral and legal arguments about torture, detention, and targeted killings. We visit various sites in New York City and meet with people with direct experience of the attack and its aftermath, including representatives of both the police and the immigrant communities who have suffered profiling and mistrust from the suspicions aroused by the attack. Looking toward the future, we examine local, national, and international strategies to prevent such attacks and to halt the radicalization that brings fresh recruits to terrorist movements. advaNced hoNorS SemINarSThe History of Disbelief AHSEM-UA 113 Stephens. 4 points. Takes up an extended history of atheism and doubt (in the context of a history of religion). It begins in Greece and then moves on to a brief discussion of anthropological perspectives on belief, before returning to Greece, to the Hebrews and Rome, to India and Baghdad, and then back to Europe during the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the romantic period. Time is spent in England and America in the 19th century, when disbelief was being tied to radical politics, before moving on to the connection between disbe- lief and realism, modernism and postmodernism. The main arguments for and against the existence of God are considered. However, the main purpose 31 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE HONORS SEMINARS HONORS SEMINARS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYof this course is to force students to confront and grapple with some of the most sophisticated and profound human expressions of disbelief. Authors read may include Cicero, Hume, Holbach, Paine, Shelley, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Woolf, and Freud. Varieties of Religious Experience Revisited AHSEM-UA 144 Gilligan. 4 points. Uses but also updates William James's pioneering approach to interpreting and understanding religion in psychological rather than theological terms. Examines how the term \"religion\" is more confusing than helpful when it fails to differentiate between a wide variety of utterly incompatible beliefs and practices at different stages of cognitive and emotional development. Discusses the phenomenon of \"political religions\" (nationalism, totalitarian- ism, apocalyptic fundamentalism) as attempts to reject modernity (the modern scientific mentality), in order to fill the vacuum that Sartre called \"the God-shaped hole in the soul of modern man\" that resulted when the traditional sources of moral, legal, and political authority (God, religion, pure reason) lost their credibility as sources of knowl- edge. Considers that political religions result from psychological regression and contrasts them with the current moment in the evolution of religious consciousness, in which the challenge is to find pro- gressive forms of religious expression, understanding, and experience consistent with the modern scientific mentality, while not being reducible to it. Concludes by examining whether this is the context in which the next major step in the evolution of both culture and personality will need to occur. The 14th Century\u2014When Europe Was Transformed AHSEM-UA 147 Claster. 4 points. The century covered in this course saw disasters of many kinds, some all too familiar to us in the 21st century. It was the century of the Black Death and the decimation of the population on an enormous and unprecedented scale; a time of an economic recession that changed the pattern of prosperity that had existed in the preceding two centuries; a time when the papacy and the Roman Church were faced with the rise of heresy and challenges to religious authority; a time of wars and of rebellions. Yet, in the same era, there was a march forward\u2014toward new ideas, new political forms, vernacular languages, a reawakening that brought changes of immense consequence for all of Europe and for our own culture. Through the darkest periods, the great and beautiful changes that are the beginnings of the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age of Petrarch and Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian painters and writers who trans- formed the nature and conception of literature and art and who informed our own worldview. Overall, we study a century that many historians have under- stood as the most creative and the most terrible of all the centuries until the 20th century. The Making of an Iconic Image AHSEM-UA 148 Cross-listed with Photography and Imaging of the Tisch School of the Arts as PHTI-UT 1120. Willis. 4 points. Iconic images are pictures that become rooted in our personal memory and are stored away for future reference through our experiences with them. Often, the power of an iconic image extends beyond the meaning of its original purpose and takes on another form socially and historically. This seminar explores the range of ideas and methods used by photographers, artists, historians, filmmakers, and critical thinkers in addressing the notion of iconic images within photography, video, and film. It combines historical, contemporary, and theoretical approaches to identity politics and visual culture, and addresses how images are constructed through art, media, advertising, political campaigns, war and disaster, beauty, and popular culture. Class discussions highlight the trends and transformations that have characterized the evolution of the iconic image. Using a series of case studies, we explore the construction of beauty and style, gendered images, race, and pop culture. We also consider issues of representation, display, and reception, as well as the wider social context in which art, music, and culture are experienced in private and public spaces. In addi- tion to classes held on campus, field trips are taken to archives, museums, and galleries. Each week, students discuss a photograph of their own choice. Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber AHSEM-UA 149 Wang. 4 points. The Dream of the Red Chamber is an epic literary classic produced by Cao Xueqin in the middle of the 18th century. Following the traditional form of Chinese fiction, known as \"the chaptered novel,\" it covers a vast terrain of Chinese culture and social life and is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China and a synthesis of Chinese aesthetic and philosophical traditions. With the tragic love story between two teenage members of an aristocratic clan in southern China at its dramatic center, the novel intimately explores 32 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE HONORS SEMINARS HONORS SEMINARS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYthe questions concerning what is eternal and what is ephemeral; love and affection, or \"qing,\" as the heart of being that both animates and destroys life; the nature of individual talent and its fragility; the excesses and decadence of the privileged; as well as the growing, if hidden, social and class tensions. Its manifold structure and intricate plot develop-ment, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters, make this novel the most complex and colorful of all times. Both reading and discussions are conducted in English. Transdisciplinary Investigations Across Multiple Evolutionary Scales AHSEM-UA 154 Volk. 4 points. This TIMES seminar considers the most basic patterns across the realms of nature and mind and searches for common functional principles that create those patterns. The guiding context is the fact that evolution is a form-generating process. In a general sense, evolution occurs on multiple scales: biological (Darwinian evolution), cultural (invention and social selection), and cognition (learning and creativity). All these scales possess unique but also similar subprocesses of replication, variation, and selection. Therefore, where the functional advantages of certain solutions are the same to the challenges of existence across the realms, we should expect to find common patterns as those solutions. (See the instructor's book and papers on \"metapatterns\" for more.) Students find this an exciting area of inquiry and enlarge their intellectual horizons as they engage in research that becomes more self-chosen during the course. Students from all disciplines are encouraged to enroll. Reconstructing World Violence: A Hobbesian Approach AHSEM-UA 156 Klein. 4 points. Humans are as violent as any creature, but we have something in abundance that others may lack: the ability to sustain and glorify our violence by justifying it. After attempting to develop coherent accounts of this phenomenon, students consider ways in which pacifist systems of thought have interacted with violent systems of justification, often but not always with genocidal results. It was in the midst of such a violent crisis that Hobbes initiated what remains an undeveloped approach. If one can extrapolate from Hobbes's nationalist agenda and redirect his approach in a democratic way, one can arrive (as many have) at the following claim: Only when globally sovereign conflict-resolving institutions are fully authorized will any subordi- nate system justifying violence lose its force and coherence, except in the case of violent revolutionary movements that challenge the global authority itself. Partly by examining various fledgling attempts to operate aspects of a future sovereign system, we ask of this claim not so much whether it is practical as whether we resist its implications or suspect its grounding. Edmund Wilson and the Art of Cultural Criticism AHSEM-UA 165 Cross-listed with Journalism as JOUR-UA 401. Berman. 4 points. Edmund Wilson (1895-1972) was the greatest cultural critic that America has ever produced\u2014or so a good many cultural critics of our own time have come to believe. Wilson belonged to a circle of writers from the First World War generation that included John Dos Passos, F . Scott Fitzgerald, and Edna St. Vincent Millay. He wrote novels, poetry, plays, and diaries. But mostly he wrote book reviews and essays on literary, political, and historical topics, which ran in the New Republic, the New Yorker, the New York Review of Books and other magazines. Reading a substantial sampling of Wilson's work, we will examine a series of large topics, including the cultural atmosphere of Greenwich Village early in the 20th century; the rise of literary modernism; the influence of Marxism; the literature of the Civil War; and various traditions of American thought and literature over the centuries. We will pay close attention to Wilson's style of journalistic writing: his emphases on clarity, on conversational ease, and on emotional forcefulness. Students will be asked to apply Wilson's principles of writing to their own compositions\u2014an extremely useful thing to do for any student who seeks to become a better writer. Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in 20thCentury America AHSEM-UA 168 Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 664. Please note that this course does not satisfy the advanced research seminar requirement for the history major. Nash. 4 points. Conflicts over racial equality, freedom of speech, and equal protection under the law that were guaranteed in the Constitution have been contested terrain throughout U.S. history. These struggles sharpened in the 20th century as African Americans fought to end racial segregation, women sought equal rights, business interests resisted labor militancy, while federal and state governments suppressed radicals and other dissenters. This seminar examines the 33 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE HONORS SEMINARS HONORS SEMINARS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYlegal struggles and the social movements that took place as Americans fought for civil rights and civil liberties during periods of war, industrial unrest, and social change. It explores these stories by analyzing legal history through the lenses of political, social, and cultural history. This is an interdisciplinary course. Students study novels, poems, and oral memoirs; view films; and read historical monographs that speak to this big and important subject. The Tamiment Library, one of the most important repositories in the United States documenting the history of radical politics, civil rights, and civil liber- ties, is our laboratory. Students work with archives and other special collections on a weekly basis, learn- ing how to use and evaluate these primary sources, interpret evidence, make analytical arguments, and develop research questions. Commitment and Escape AHSEM-UA 171 Cross-listed with Comparative Literature as COLIT-UA 181. Bishop. 4 points. The seventy-or-so years this seminar examines were among the most turbulent in the history of the world. They start with the butchery of World War II, the Shoah, and atomic devastation, and end with the often violent birth of new nations through the decolonization of African and Asian lands. But they were also years of reconstruction and modernization, leading to booming economies and social improvement. The rise of Arab nationalism and Islamic fundamentalism and the emergence of China as the colossus of the 21st century were among the signposts of a changing world in which peoples demanded\u2014and won\u2014their freedom. Perhaps most revolutionary, women at last attained freedom and equality in many parts of the globe. Many writers and thinkers felt such concern for the world around them that they were inevitably drawn to dealing with contemporary issues. Others focused on broader, more philosophic approaches to the existential problems of man in this world; others still sought escape from commitment in artistic paths, removed from social and political considerations. By working with texts\u2014novels, essays, short stories, plays, and films\u2014that reflect artists' and intel- lectuals' reactions to their times, we will explore and analyze many of the leading creative voices of these turbulent years, including, but not limited to: Arthur Miller, Albert Camus, Assia Djebar, Samuel Beckett, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Betty Friedan, and James Baldwin. The keynote to the seminar will come from Jean-Paul Sartre's What Is Literature? The Spanish Inquisition AHSEM-UA 173 Cross-listed with Spanish as SPAN-UA 952. Black. 4 points. In contemporary media and in the wake of 9/11, the Spanish Inquisition has been used as shorthand to denote intolerance, persecution, fanaticism, and a disposition to cruelty in the pursuit of \"truth.\" While some elements of this reputation are well-earned, the history of the Inquisition is far more complex and interesting. We begin the semester with the heated question of the origins of the Inquisition and its key role in nation building, in order to then turn to the Inquisition's internal organization and standard practices. From there, we consider the various targets of inquisitorial suspicion or persecution from the late 15th through late 17th centuries: Judaism and crypto-Judaism (the conversos), Protestantism, prohibited books, mystics and Illuminati, witches, Islam and crypto-Islam (the moriscos), and those accused of sexual or religious misconduct (blasphemy, bigamy, and sodomy). We close the semester considering what finally brought about the definitive abolition of the Inquisition in 1834. We will read transcripts from Inquisitorial trials, edicts and proclamations, historical chronicles, novels, plays, autobiographies, an Inquisitor's manual with instructions for torture, a witch-hunting treatise, and devotional literature. We also will examine more contemporary reflections: Dostoevsky's 1880 The Brothers Karamazov, Monty Python's 1970 \"Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition\" skit, and the film adaptation of J. K. Rowling's 2003 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.34 AFRICANA S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYmajor The Africana studies major comprises introductory, elective, and research components, which together make up a total of eleven 4-point courses (44 points), as laid out below.

Introduces students to the tools of cultural criti- cism and theory, with particular emphasis on black culture, urban environment, and black people's relationships to a variety of social and cultural institutions and practices. The latter may include the mass media, class and poverty, the police, urban development, education, music, art, and sports. African American 20thCentury Novels and Narratives SCA-UA 139 Offered every year. 4 points. This seminar covers a historicized selection of black writers who over the latter half of the 20th century have inscribed in literature the cultural, social, and political experiences of African Americans in the United States. We critically explore, discuss, and write about a range of works varying from poetry to the short story and the novel. Our studies focus on the key topics, issues, innovations, and themes that have consistently been important to African American literary production. Some examples are the emancipation impulse, \"double consciousness,\" the black struggle for human rights, the rise of black women writers, postmodernism, sexual and gender politics, and contemporary expressions of the slavery motif. The Black Essay SCA-UA 152 Offered every year. 4 points. Examines the urban experience and black life and culture in New York through a series of writing assignments on African American neighborhoods, institutions, issues, and culture. Students are required to travel throughout the black community, conduct interviews, and do research for essays on the black experience in the city. They are introduced to the research and reporting techniques of journal- ism and given the chance to employ these techniques in their papers. The Black Body and the Lens SCA-UA 155 Offered every year. 4 points. This interdisciplinary seminar explores the range of ideas and methods used by critical thinkers in addressing the body in photography, video, music, and film. Central to our discussions is a focus on how the display of the black body affects how we see and interpret the world. Using a series of case studies, we consider the construction of beauty, gendered images, race, and hip-hop culture. The historical gaze has profoundly determined the visual construction of the black body in contemporary society. The interplay between the historical and the contemporary, between self-presentation and imposed representation, is fundamental to our discussions. The seminar centers the student within the contemporary world of image making with an emphasis on the black body. Final projects include an imaging project and/or a written essay. Black Feminism SCA-UA 156 Offered once every two years. 4 points. This course explores the production and practice of black feminist theory in 20th-century America. We examine the written work and the activism of African American women and look at the way that theory and practice historically intersect around questions of race and gender. Because this is a course on feminism, we also spend a good deal of time interrogating power and thinking about the ways in which systems of oppression both produce and block a black feminist consciousness. Language and Liberation: At Home in the Caribbean and Abroad SCA-UA 163 Identical to LING-UA 26. Offered every year. 4 points. 37 AFRICANA S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMAJOR/MINOR IN AFRICANA S TUDIES Explores the linguistic and cultural transformations that took place in the Commonwealth Caribbean from 17th-century slavery and bond servitude to the present day. The focus is on the extent to which Caribbean people were given or demanded the freedom to create and maintain a postcolonial Caribbean identity. Discusses the sociohistorical conditions that led to the creation of new Caribbean languages called \"pidgins\" and \"creoles\" as the English language was transplanted from Britain to the Third World. The Postcolonial City SCA-UA 166 Offered once every year. 4 points. Cities have played an important role throughout African history and in various Afrodiasporic contexts: from the metropolises of ancient Egypt and the urban centers of well-known West African civiliza- tions (such as Ghana, Mali, and Songhai) to cities such as Port-au-Prince, Havana, and Georgetown in the Caribbean and the urban enclaves in the United States. In attending to the way actors constitute wealth and power\u2014in accounting for the way proximity structures interpersonal experiences\u2014this course uses ethnographic, sociological, historical, and literary texts to theorize the Afrodiasporic city. We explore the contours of these urban matrices through special attention to historical categories that prepare us to theorize the way Afrodiasporic populations have experienced and lived history (e.g., the preco- lonial, the colonial, and the postcolonial). As part of our mission, we consider the historical emergence of the Third World as not simply a broad rubric for African and Asian postcolonies, but instead, a project to reverse the course of European exploita-tion. Instead of proceeding strictly chronologically, students consider the Afrodiasporic urban experience thematically, through a diverse array of readings. T opics in Black Urban Studies SCA-UA 180 Offered once a semester. 4 points. Explores specific issues dealing with the black urban experience, focusing on social and cultural institu- tions. Possible themes, which vary from semester to semester, include class and poverty, the police, urban development, education, sports, music, and art. T opics in PanAfricanism SCA-UA 181 Offered once a semester. 4 points. Deals with specific themes of Pan-Africanism and their impact on the modern world. Possible themes, which vary from semester to semester, include African unity, black rebellion, colonialism and racism, the African diaspora and culture, and rela-tionships between Pan-Africanism and movements such as nationalism, Marxism, and Afrocentricity. language c ourses Elementary Swahili I SCA-UA 121 Offered every year. 4 points. Provides students with an elementary understanding of Swahili, a Bantu language with a rich oral and written tradition that is spoken by about 100 million people from Somalia to Mozambique and Zanzibar. After a short presentation of Swahili's history, codi- fication, and relation to other languages, students are drilled in phonetics and grammar. They are also introduced to poems, songs, and oral narratives. Elementary Swahili II SCA-UA 122 Prerequisite: Elementary Swahili I (SCA-UA 121) or permission of the instructor. Offered every year. 4 points. Expands on the basic knowledge of the pro- nunciation, vocabulary, useful expressions, and fundamental grammatical features acquired in Swahili I. Allows essential communication skills to develop into conversational ability using simple and familiar situations. Building on the early grasp of the language, students expand the range of conversational ability and understanding of various grammatical concepts associated with this agglutina-tive language. Intermediate Swahili I SCA-UA 123 Prerequisite: Elementary Swahili II (SCA-UA 122) or permission of the instructor. Offered every year. 4 points. Builds on the basic knowledge of the pronunciation, vocabulary, useful expressions, and fundamental grammatical features already attained at the intro- ductory level. Aims to strengthen reading, writing, and conversation skills by accessing a wide range of grammatical and literary knowledge of the language, its cultural context, and literary genre. Students are required to familiarize themselves with a novel and a play written in Kiswahili. Intermediate Swahili II SCA-UA 124 Prerequisite: Intermediate Swahili I (SCA-UA 123) or permission of the instructor. Offered every year. 4 points.

The Center's teaching and research functions emphasize considerations such as the design of governing institutions, the development and distribution of human capital, and the means by which fundamental policy issues can be resolved or advanced through the promotion of efficient and effective solutions that are sensitive to political, economic, and social realities. The Center offers a number of undergraduate courses in political economy, in addition to a certificate program. certificate The Alexander Hamilton Center Certificate is a unique credential that demonstrates highly developed skills in political economy analysis. Students interested in careers and/or graduate study in policy will benefit from the rigorous training in analytical methodology provided by the certificate course work. Applications to the certificate program are rolling, although students typically apply in the spring of their junior year. (They may apply earlier if they have fulfilled the requirements.) The Center welcomes applica-tions from students of all majors. To be considered for admission to the program, students should have an overall GPA of at least 3.3. Students with lower GPAs will be considered if they have a strong recommen- dation from a faculty member affiliated with the Center. The prerequisites for admission are Quantitative Methods for Political Science (POL-UA 800), a course in microeconomics, and at least one Hamilton seminar. The certificate program consists of four Hamilton seminars, in addition to POL-UA 800. Hamilton seminars taken prior to starting the program will count toward the certificate requirements.

At least one of these four courses must originate in American Studies. Approaches to American Studies SCA-UA 201 Offered every year. 4 points. Offers a survey of American studies as a dynamic field of scholarship. Using a schedule of keywords, the course engages key themes and concerns, includ- ing war's role in social and political development, the meaning of borders, the politics of entertainment, public interest in private affairs, and the interplay of goods and labor in shaping national (and transna- tional) conditions of fulfillment and dignity. It is intended to serve as a gateway to lines of inquiry and analysis currently animating interdisciplinary study of \"America\"; as an opportunity to relate current debates to respective historical contexts; and as an occasion to interrogate presumptions of the United States' exceptionality, at a time when its interrelation with broader worlds becomes ever more clear. Comparative U.S. Ethnic Studies SCA-UA 224 Offered every fifth semester. 4 points. Serves as an introduction to the interdisciplinary study of race and ethnicity in the United States and to the range of identities and issues inherent in American culture. No previous knowledge of ethnic studies is presumed, but the goal of the class is to create a framework for thoughtful discussion and analysis of race and ethnicity for students to use long after the completion of the class. Intersections: Gender, Race, and Sexuality in U.S. History and Politics SCA-UA 230 Can be substituted for Approaches to American Studies (SCA-UA 201). Offered every year. 4 points. Draws on the histories of African, Asian, European, Latino, and Native Americans of both genders and many sexualities to explore the complex and important intersection of gender, race, and sexuality in the United States from the 17th century through the 20th, in historically related case studies. Starting in the period of European imperialism in the Americas, examines the ways that gender, race, and sexuality shaped cultural and political policies and debates surrounding the Salem witch trials; slavery, abolition, and lynching; U.S. imperialism in Puerto Rico and Hawaii; the politics of welfare and reproduction; cultural constructions of manliness, masculinity, and citizenship; and responses to the AIDS pandemic in a global context.erich maria r emarque Professor of literature Harper RalphfacUl TYAmerican studies, which is administered by the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis, is one of the country's leading centers for the study of U.S. culture and society. The core and affiliated faculty members, drawn from many Faculty of Arts and Science and Tisch School of the Arts departments and programs, constitute one of NYU's strongest faculty groupings. The program interprets \"American\" in a broad sense to include assessments of the historical role of the United States in the Americas and, more generally, in world affairs. Inasmuch as the program has a regional focus and a distinctive edge among other American studies programs, special attention is given to studies in urbanism and to New York in particular, a global city that comprises many world cultures.director of american Studies Associate Professor Tuwww.americanstudies.as.nyu.edu 20 Cooper Square, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10003-7112 Phone: 212-992-9650MINOR IN American Studies41 AMERICAN S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMINOR IN AMERICAN S TUDIES Ethnicity and the Media SCA-UA 232 Offered every other year. 4 points. Examines media images in relation to the making of ethnic and racial identities in the United States. Surveys some of the theoretical approaches to the study of images, paying particular attention to the intersection of history and ideologies or representation. Looks into the nature and politics of stereotypes; inquires into their reproduction through discourses, representations, and practices; and then moves to a comparative examination of media images in relation to the making of African American, Asian, Latino, and Native American images in the media, looking specifically at changes and continuities in the representation of these four minority groups in the media. Cultures and Economies SCA-UA 234 Prerequisite: Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA-UA 1) or Intersections: Gender, Race, and Sexuality in U.S. History and Politics (SCA-UA 230). Offered every spring. 4 points. This upper-level seminar focuses on the relationship between the \"the economy\" and \"culture\" in the con- temporary United States. Though political analysts and scholars have often treated economic issues and cultural politics and policies as if they were separate and independent areas for public discussion and debate, this course focuses on their interrelatedness and mutual dependence\u2014on the cultural construc- tion of \"the economy\" and the economic basis for cultural practices and policies. We examine the historical shift during the 20th century from the rise of corporate capitalism, through the depression and the New Deal, to the rise and challenges of neoliberal policy shifts, financialization, and acceler- ated globalization since the 1970s. We will focus particularly on the dynamics of \"crisis,\" both as an economic and as a cultural phenomenon. Marxist Cultural Theory SCA-UA 240 Offered every other year. 4 points. Familiarizes students with key concepts in Marxist cultural theory so that they might (1) begin to appreciate how extensively Marxist thought informs contemporary scholarly criticism and (2) start to use elements of that thought in their own analyti- cal work. We study founding texts in the Marxist critical tradition; review Marxist-oriented analyses of literary, musical, and visual productions; and, finally, consider recent work on the import of culture as lived experience. Students should ultimately emerge not only with enhanced critical skills, but also with a deepened understanding of the significance of culture, broadly conceived. Studies in Popular Culture SCA-UA 251 Prerequisite: Approaches to American Studies (SCA-UA 201) or Literary Interpretation (ENGL-UA 200), or permission of the instructor. Offered every other year. 4 points. Introduces students to the serious study of con- temporary popular culture as it is manifested in several overlapping mass-media formations. More specifically, the course considers the distinct but interrelated functions of various mass-cultural modes (for example, popular music, cinema, television) within an increasingly conglomerated entertainment industry that targets increasingly diversified audience constituencies. Through a highly selective case-study approach, students are quickly familiarized with the specific critical considerations demanded by each form under review. In-depth attention is given to particular genres characteristic of each medium and to the linkages among the different media in their joint constitution of a generalized contemporary mass culture. T opics SCA-UA 280 Offered every year. 4 points. In-depth study of a particular problem or research area within American studies.

The adviser for the minor is responsible for ensuring that each student's pro- gram of study remains coherent and logical, although there is considerable flexibility within the bounds of the requirements. Courses may be selected that deal with different periods and methodological approaches, as well as a variety of geographical areas that the requirements demand. Each student's course of study is designed on an individual basis, in accordance with his or her needs and interests. A number of CAS departments and programs, as well as institutes and centers, are directly involved in this program: Anthropology, Art History, Classics, Comparative Literature, East Asian Studies, English, Hebrew and Judaic Studies, History, Irish Studies, Linguistics, Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies, and the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies. The minor consists of five 4-point courses, which are normally selected from the appropriate offerings of these departments and programs. All five of the courses selected must be offered by departments other than the student's major department, and no more than two may be taken in any one department. Students are furthermore expected to examine at least three different civilizations or cultures in completing this minor. Language courses may not be used to fulfill the requirements of this minor. If desired, students who choose this minor may complete, as a capstone experience, an independent study course, which is normally the fifth course taken for the minor. The adviser for the ancient studies minor may assist students in designing a project and in finding an appropriate faculty member to direct this independent study.adviser Clinical Associate Professor Roth (Art History/Hebrew and Judaic Studies)PROGRAM IN Ancient Studies43 ANIMAL S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYminor To complete a minor in animal studies, students must receive a grade of C (2.0) or better in four of the following 4-point courses: Animals and Society (ANST-UA 200/SOC-UA 970/ENVST-UA 610) Animals in Art and Literature (ANST-UA 300) Ethics & Animals (ANST-UA 400) Animal Minds (ANST-UA 410) Food, Animals, and the Environment (ANST-UA 440/ENVST-UA 0440) Animals and Public Policy (ANST-UA 500/ENVST-UA 630) Topics in Animal Studies (ANST-UA 600) Primate Behavior and Ecology (ANTH-UA 54) Prehistoric Art and Symbolic Evolution (ANTH-UA 212) Zooesis: Animal Acts for Changing Times (COSEM-UA 107) Topics in Performance Studies: Animal Rites (DRLIT-UA 301) Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Animal Humans (MAP-UA 400) Performing Beyond the Human: Ecology, Animal Rites, Theater (THEA-UT 801) Animals, People, and Those in Between (ITPG-UT 2746) The Performing Animal (OART-UT 408) Intro to Topics in Literary Theory: The Animal T urn (ENGL-GA 1957) To declare a minor in animal studies, contact the adviser for animal studies at animal.studies.advising@nyu.edu.ProgramfacUl TYcollegiate Professor; Professor of english and drama Chaudhuri Professor Jamieson (Environmental Studies/Philosophy/Law)assistant Professors Jerolmack (Sociology/ Environmental Studies), Sebo (Environmental Studies)clinical assistant Professors Schlottmann (Environmental Studies/Bioethics) adjunct Professor WolfsonNYU's Animal Studies Initiative promotes and supports research and teaching in the emerging area of animal studies.

Analyzes the ways that animal and human lives intersect and examines how relationships with ani- mals reflect and shape social life, culture, and how people think about themselves. Explores the myriad and contradictory positions that animals occupy in society (e.g., as pets, pests, mascots, and food) and deconstructs the social origins of these seemingly natural categories. (After all, one society's pet is another society's dinner.) Takes a grounded look at what 44 ANIMAL S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMINOR IN ANIMAL S TUDIES actually happens when humans and animals interact, which sheds new light on the nature of human and animal consciousness and troubles some of the assumptions we make about the necessary role of language and symbols in interaction. Fundamentally, students learn how the roles that animals take on in our lives, and the ways that we think about and relate to them, are inherently social processes that are patterned by geography, culture, class, gender, and so on. Central questions include: How do ideas about, and relationships to, animals vary across time and space? What roles do science, literature, and media representations play in shaping how we think about animals? How and why did pets become honorary members of the American family? Why are some animals, but not others, granted moral status and legal protection in society? How do humans and animals coordinate interaction without language? Animals in Art and Literature ANST-UA 300 Chaudhuri. 4 points. The anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss said that animals featured so prominently in myth and ritual \"not because they are 'good to eat' but because they are 'good to think.'\" The history of art and literature suggests that they are also good to paint, to sculpt, to photograph, to film, and to write about. This course uses methodologies and perspectives offered by the emerging field of animal studies to explore how artists use the figure of the animal and the subject of animality in their work. Studies a range of contemporary representations of animals\u2014in fiction, poetry, film, and the visual arts\u2014with a view to understanding how the contemporary cultural imagination configures the ethics, politics, and aesthetics of the relationship between humans and other animals. Ethics & Animals ANST-UA 400 Sebo. 4 points. Examines the morality of our treatment of nonhu- man animals, beginning with the nature of moral rights and duties. What are rights, and where do they come from? How do we resolve conflicts among rights? Do animals have rights? Next, what are obligations, and where do they come from? What makes right actions right? Do we have special obligations to members of our own family, nation, or species? Is there a moral difference between killing and letting die? Do we have group obligations as well as individual obligations? We ask how these issues apply to our treatment of nonhuman animals. Are we justified in treating animals as property under the law? Are we justified in using animals for food, clothing, entertainment, research, or com- panionship? Finally, what are the ethics of animal advocacy? Here we consider abolition vs. regulation, incrementalism vs. absolutism, and legal reform vs. direct action. Animal Minds ANST-UA 410 Sebo. 4 points. Examines the philosophy of cognitive ethology and comparative psychology, beginning by discussing the nature of animal minds. Are animals conscious? Do they experience pain? Do they have beliefs? Do they use language? Are they self-conscious? How can we know? This involves applying concepts from meta- physics and epistemology to research in cognitive ethology and comparative psychology. We discuss more general questions like: Are animals agents? Do they have free will? Do they live meaningful lives? Do they have moral rights? This involves applying concepts from ethics, existentialism, and other areas of philosophy to our conclusions about animal minds. Along the way, we ask how research on animal minds can affect our philosophical theories. For example, should we revise our theories of consciousness, language, agency, morality, and so on if they seem to have implausible implications about animals? Food, Animals, and the Environment ANST-UA 440 Identical to ENVST-UA 440. Schlottmann. 4 points. Students study human interaction with both food and animals and the environmental impacts and ethical issues that arise from such interaction. Focuses on the moral standing of animals, animals as food, and the environmental impacts of agri- culture, transportation, and consumption. Surveys major thinkers in the field, including Michael Pollan, Peter Singer, Jim Mason, Wendell Berry, David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Martha Nussbaum. Students engage in collaborative research projects, with possible field trips to local agricultural sites. Animals and Public Policy ANST-UA 500 Identical to ENVST-UA 630. Offered every fall. Wolfson. 4 points. Provides an overview of public policy with respect to the somewhat contradictory treatment of animals by humans, with a focus on how public policy is created and how social change occurs. We consider what public policy consists of and what actors and 45 MINOR IN ANIMAL S TUDIES ANIMAL S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYfactors play a role in the creation of public policy; how society views animals; the capacities of animals; how ethics relates to animal treatment; how animals are currently utilized by our society; and political and other efforts to improve or alter the current treatment of animals, including the influence of sci- ence, government, business and non-governmental organizations in defining and influencing animal- related policies. We focus on legislation, litigation, regulation, and ballot initiative and consumer campaigns and their effectiveness, as well as other strategies that relate to improving animal welfare. We also discuss the meaning of \"animal rights\" and the success and impact of the modern animal protec- tion movement. T opics in Schlottmann, Jerolmack, Chaudhuri, Sebo, Mitsis. 4 points.

Sociocultural anthropology is interdisciplinary in orientation, analyzing and synthesizing religious, artistic, economic, and political practices through the common medium of culture. T raditionally, cultural anthropology emphasized the study of small-scale societies (often termed \"exotic,\" indigenous, and/or nonliterate peoples). Contemporary sociocultural anthropology maintains such interests but increasingly applies its insights and methods to complex, urban, and industrialized societies and attends more closely to the production of culture. An emphasis of the department is the ethnographic study of cultural, social, and political processes that shape our lives and those of other people, especially as we are drawn together and influence one another in increasingly transnational and global interactions.Professors emeriti Jolly, Lynch david B.

The department considers its greatest assets to be the various individual areas of faculty expertise: archaeological specialties such as medieval archaeology and European, Near Eastern, and South Asian prehistory; biological anthropol- ogy areas such as molecular primatology, primate behavioral ecology, and paleoanthropology; linguistic anthropology foci such as discourse analysis and language socialization; and sociocultural anthropology specialties such as the ethnography of North America, Africa, India, China, the Near and Middle East, the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe, Australia, and the South Pacific. Major theoretical emphasis is on the systems of thought and symbolic representation of the self and society; the relation between female and male domains of interaction; changing patterns of social organization and hierarchy within small-scale societies, urban settings, and bureaucratic institutions; medical anthropology; evolutionary approaches to the study of primate and human origins; religion; art; science studies; race and ethnicity; and the problem of ethnographic representation in film and other media. Departmental resources include an extensive film and video collection, as well as teaching and research labs for archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and biological anthropology, which can be used for research by advanced undergraduates. A departmental colloquium series and an undergraduate student association welcome undergraduate participation. Formal and informal cooperative arrangements with museums, zoos, and other academic institutions in the greater New York area place at students' disposal a group of anthropological scholars, materials, and resources unparalleled in this country.47 DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY ANTHROPOLOGY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYLinguistic anthropology focuses on how language is interpreted and used in cultural contexts. Language use is socially organized, and it is a key to understanding the ways in which speakers create and change social realities. Studied within historical as well as cultural frameworks and in relation to other social institutions (e.g., politics, education, law, medicine), variation in ways of speaking language(s) adds to our understanding of how social categories such as ethnicity, race, and gender are interactionally constituted across contexts, cultures, and societies. Archaeological anthropology uses artifacts and other material remains to understand human culture. It attempts to breathe life into a material record that at first glance appears static and fragmentary. The research interests of anthropological archaeologists range from the earliest production of durable tools 2.6 million years ago to the refuse currently being generated by modern cities. All aspects of past human existence, including art, technology, religion, gender, economic and social organization, and food-getting strategies, are addressed by researchers in anthropological archaeology. Biological anthropology encompasses the study of human and nonhuman primate biological diversity and includes the anatomy, genetics, behavior, ecology, and evolution of humans and other primates. It is linked to the other subfields of anthropology by its commitment to the study of human biology, behavior, and evolution within the context of culture, society, and ecology. Close ties with the American Museum of Natural History, the New York University School of Medicine, and the Wildlife Conservation Society International at the Bronx Zoo facilitate the department's diverse research interests in biological anthropology. The department participates in the University's Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, the Center for Religion and Media, the Center for the Study of Human Origins, the Institute of French Studies, the Institute for Study of the Ancient World, the Program in Museum Studies, the Program in Culture and Media, and the Center for Media, Culture, and History. departmental objectives Anthropology courses contribute to undergraduate education in two ways. First, the scope of the discipline's interests effectively bridges the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences. Anthropology asks basic questions concerning the origins and development of humans and their cultures and divergent systems of thought, belief, and social order. By systematically analyzing various cultural traditions\u2014contemporary as well as historically known\u2014anthropology raises critical questions concerning the bases of both world civilizations. An understanding of the distinctive way anthropology formulates and attempts to answer its basic questions is a necessary component of a comprehensive liberal education. Second, the department offers concentrated programs of study for the minor, major, or honors student. A minor usually emphasizes one of the four subdisciplines, although students are free to select courses from across the subfields. For the major, the department encourages study in all of the subdisciplines, because each supplements and complements the others in presenting humans as both biological and social beings. The honors program includes in-depth research and writing in one aspect of sociocultural, linguistic, archaeological, or biological anthro- pology, as well as the pursuit of additional advanced course work at the senior undergraduate or graduate level. The director of undergraduate studies (DUS) works closely with anthropology majors and minors in designing programs of study that integrate their individual goals with the offerings and intellectual goals of the department and complementary disciplines. Majors should meet with the DUS at least once per semester, typically just prior to registration for the next semester, to discuss their progress through the program, decide on future course work, and discuss postgraduation plans. The department prides itself on its graduate and undergraduate programs' integrated nature, which enables major, minor, and honors students to participate in a variety of challenging graduate courses and seminars. Additionally, an active Anthropology Undergraduate Student Association (AUSA) connects students to one another through events and an e-mail forum. major The major in anthropology consists of 36 points (typically nine 4-point courses), which include the required classes Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1), Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2), Archaeology: Early 48 DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY ANTHROPOLOGY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYSocieties and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3), and Anthropology of Language (ANTH-UA 17; offered only during the spring semester). The remaining elective courses may be selected from any subfield of anthropology. Students must take at least five courses from the Department of Anthropology at New York University in order to receive a major in anthropology from NYU, and a grade of at least C is required in every course to be counted toward the major. Students are not required to focus on any one of the subfields of anthropology represented in the department, but rather are free to choose elective courses that accommodate their interests as narrowly or broadly as they see fit, in consultation with the DUS. Internships approved by the DUS are encouraged, but internship credits may not be applied toward the major. Independent study courses, conducted under the supervision of a departmental faculty member, are also encouraged and can be applied toward the major. Majors should consult regularly with the DUS in order to take full advantage of the seminars and research opportunities open to them. In collaboration with the Department of Classics and the Department of Linguistics, the Department of Anthropology also offers two joint majors. Joint majors consist of 20 points (typically five 4-point courses) in anthropology and 20 points in the joint department. A grade of at least C is required in every course to be counted toward the joint major. Joint majors should consult regularly with the DUS in anthropology and the DUS in the joint department in order to take full advantage of the seminars and research opportunities open to them. Joint major with the Department of Classics: The joint major in anthropology and classics emphasizes the importance of anthropological approaches to understanding the social orders and institutions of the classical world. One anthropology course, Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1), is required, along with four other anthropology electives chosen in consultation with the DUS of each department. T wenty points are required in classics. See Classics in this Bulletin for additional information. Joint anthropology-classics majors should also consult with Professor Rita Wright in the Department of Anthropology and the DUS in the Department of Classics for aid in developing their program of study. Joint major with the Department of Linguistics: The joint major in anthropology and linguistics empha- sizes the complementary nature of anthropological and sociolinguistic approaches to language. Students are required to take 20 points (typically five 4-point courses) each from the Department of Anthropology and the Department of Linguistics, and a grade of at least C is required in every course to be counted toward the joint major. Required courses in anthropology are Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1), Anthropology of Language (ANTH-UA 17), Cultural Symbols (ANTH-UA 48), and two other cultural or linguistic anthropology courses approved by the Department of Anthropology's DUS. Required courses in linguistics are Language (LING-UA 1), Language and Society (LING-UA 15), and at least two of the following: Bilingualism (LING-UA 18); Language, Literacy, and Society (LING-UA 20); Gender, and Language (LING-UA 21); African American Vernacular English: Language and Culture (LING-UA 23); Language and Liberation at Home in the Caribbean and Abroad (LING-UA 26); and Language in Latin America (LING-UA 30). The fifth course in linguistics may be an additional course from the above list or another course that the department offers, chosen in consultation with the DUS in the Department of Linguistics. See Linguistics in this Bulletin for additional information. Joint anthropology-linguistics majors should also consult with Professor Bambi Schieffelin in the Department of Anthropology and Professor John Singler in the Department of Linguistics for aid in developing their program of study. minor The minor in anthropology consists of 16 points (any four 4-point courses) in the department. The \"principles\" courses [Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1), Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2), and Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3)] are recommended as overviews of the discipline and as prerequi- sites for more advanced courses. Minors consult with the DUS to design a program that best accommodates their interests. A grade of at least C is required in every course to be counted toward the minor. Students must take at least two courses from the Department of Anthropology at New York University in order to receive a minor in anthropology from NYU.49 DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY ANTHROPOLOGY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYhonors Program A degree in anthropology is awarded with honors to selected majors who apply for admission to the program through the DUS during their junior year. Honors program candidates are expected to meet all the require-ments for the program and to maintain an overall grade point average of 3.65 and an average of 3.65 in the major. Candidates for the honors program must complete a total of 40 points (typically ten 4-point courses) of anthropology course work, including a two-semester research/thesis writing sequence [Honors Research I (ANTH-UA 950) and Honors Research II (ANTH-UA 951)] taken in the senior year, plus at least one Special Seminar in Anthropology (ANTH-UA 800 or ANTH-UA 801) or a graduate course, typically taken in the junior or senior year. All of these courses count toward the major. In the fall semester of the senior year, all thesis writers from across departmental subdisciplines enroll in Honors Research I (ANTH-UA 950), a seminar course in which research methods will be taught and individualized to fit each student's topic\u2014e.g., assembling a bibliography; constructing hypotheses; using secondary, primary, and occasionally original sources to generate data; and analyzing data. In the spring semester, all thesis writers enroll in Honors Research II (ANTH-UA 951), a seminar course in which students share their evolving theses with the group. Honors candidates are strongly encouraged to formally present posters/papers at the Dean's Undergraduate Research Conference and within the department. Feedback will be offered at different stages by both faculty and learner-peers. In both semesters, it is the responsibility of the thesis writer to consult with his or her departmental faculty mentor who is supervising the honors project and who will serve as the primary thesis reader. Principles Human Society and Culture ANTH-UA 1 Abercrombie, Beidelman, Das, D\u00e1vila, Ganti, Grant, Hansen, Khan, Myers, Rapp, Rogers, Stout. 4 points. Surveys the general aims, methods, and findings of modern cultural anthropology and its ties with the humanities and social sciences. Economic, political, and family organizations and systems of thought, including religion, are covered with equal attention to \"primitive,\" traditional, and modern complex societies, particularly non-Western societies. Human Evolution ANTH-UA 2 Laboratories. Ant\u00f3n, Bailey, Disotell, Harrison, Higham, Williams. 4 points. Investigates the evolutionary origins of humans. The study of human evolution is a multidisci- plinary endeavor involving a synthesis of concepts, techniques, and research findings from a variety of different scientific fields, including evolutionary biology, paleontology, primatology, comparative anatomy, genetics, molecular biology, geology, and archaeology. Explores the different contributions that scientists have made toward understanding human origins and provides a detailed survey of the evidence used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of our own species.Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures ANTH-UA 3 Laboratories. Crabtree, Tryon, White, Wright. 4 points. Introduces contemporary archaeology, its theories, practices, and early societies and cultures. Examines current methodological and theoretical viewpoints of archaeological scholarship within the discipline of anthropology.

Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Khan. 4 points. Human beings have always grappled with some notion of identity, asking questions about who they are, about who others distinguished from themselves are, and about the ways that perceived similarities and differences are meaningful and important (or not) in social relationships. Examines how historical, social, and cultural contexts shape the forms that identities take, looking in particular at ideas about race and racial identity. We work with two premises: (1) race must be understood in relation to other identity categories: gender, class, sexuality, ethnicity, and so on, and (2) race is expressed in both obvious and subtle ways; thus, racial identity is implicit as well as explicitly expressed. We also consider whether race must necessarily be understood as stigma; discuss nonfiction, fiction, and films; and may visit public exhibitions.

Examines the global prevalence of gender violence and the varied meanings of violence against women and changes in terminology over time. Examines ways of theorizing gender and violence, including performative ideas of gender. The creation of gender violence as a social problem is a product of social movements in the United States, Europe, India, and many other parts of the world. It is now understood globally as an important human rights violation. Also examines the forms of intervention that have been developed in the United States and globally for diminishing violence against women, including policing, prosecution, and punishment.

Why do some primates live in large social groups while others are solitary and yet others live in pairs or cooperatively breeding families? Why are strong social hierarchies seen in some primate taxa but not in others? How do multiple species of primates often manage to coexist in the same habitat? Why are social relationships in some primate species characterized by strong bonds among females while such bonds are absent in other primate societies? Why do some species of primates show marked geographic vari- ability in behavior and social structure? The answers to these and other questions lie in understanding the relationships between each species and its ecological and social setting and in understanding each species' phylogenetic history.

There are two majors within the department. In the Art History program, students at the introductory level examine works of art and architecture and learn the critical and historical bases for understanding and analyzing them. At the advanced level, majors and nonmajors investigate style, iconog-raphy, patronage, social and political contexts, and other aspects of the arts in more specific geographical areas and periods. This advanced work, along with foreign language study, provides a solid foundation for those who plan to attend graduate school to prepare for careers in areas such as scholarship, teaching, museums, and writing. The Urban Design and Architecture Studies program offers an interdisciplinary analytic approach to these subjects. The program provides a broad humanistic perspective on cities' physical aspects, as well as pre- professional training for future architects, city planners, public administrators, and writers on urban problems. An internationally renowned faculty and a diverse group of students use the Grey Art Library and Study Center, which includes lecture and seminar rooms, offices, a reference library, computers, and ample space for the study of visual materials.DEPARTMENT OF Art History59 ART HISTORY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ART HISTORY 3.

Major in classics and art history: For details of this interdepartmental major, refer to the description under Classics in this Bulletin. Students can count two courses from any single NYU Study Abroad site toward the major and may count a total of three courses from more than one site. Urban d esign and a rchitecture Studies m ajor The requirement for the major is nine 4-point courses. Students work with the director to achieve career- oriented goals within the major. Course work includes the following: 1. Survey requirement: History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601) and Shaping the Urban Environment (ARTH-UA 661) 2. A combination of core courses and cross-referenced courses, including the following: ARTH-UA 104, ARTH-UA ARTH-UA 663 3. least one seminar chosen from ARTH-UA 670-679, ARTH-UA 681 minor in a rt history or Urban d esign and a rchitecture Studies The requirements are any four 4-point courses in art history or urban design and architecture studies that do not overlap in material. The student may not receive credit for both History of Western Art I (ARTH-UA 1) and Ancient Art (ARTH-UA 3) or Medieval Art (ARTH-UA 4); or both History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2) and Renaissance and Baroque Art (ARTH-UA 5) or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), as their contents overlap. Introductory courses are prerequisites for advanced-level courses. Advanced-level courses are those that carry prerequisites, namely, courses listed in section 1 under the heading \" Art History Major.\" Note: Art history courses taken in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development may not be double-counted for credit toward an art history minor. However, for Steinhardt students taking a minor in art history, the two-semester Steinhardt survey Art and Contemporary Culture is the prerequisite for advanced Renaissance, baroque, and modern courses. Art and Contemporary Culture II may only serve as the prerequisite for advanced modern courses. Studio a rt minor For many majors in art history and urban design and architecture studies, understanding the field can be enhanced by the experience of making art. It is valuable for these majors to be exposed to the materials and methods of the visual arts, to obtain information about technical processes, and to gain a direct hands-on appreciation of problems of form and meaning as they are approached and solved by artists. This minor is also of practical value for art history or urban design and architecture studies majors planning careers in museology, conservation, architecture, city planning, and landmark preservation.60 ART HISTORY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ART HISTORY The studio art minor requires 16 points chosen from courses offered by the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, as summarized below. (Note: Courses at the 1000 level are only open to juniors and seniors.) Required core courses (12 points) include one introductory course each in Drawing, Painting, or Print (4 points); Sculpture or Ceramics (4 points); and Media (4 points). For an elective (4 points), select any introductory course in the areas listed above that has not been used to satisfy a core requirement. Students may also take certain intermediate-level courses in the Department of Art and Art Professions if they have completed the introductory level prerequisite(s).

Students who wish to have a MAP Expressive Culture course (MAP-UA 720, MAP-UA 721, or MAP-UA 722) count for credit toward the art history major must secure the permission of the director of undergraduate studies for art history or the director of the urban design and architecture studies program. Internship Policy Under exceptional circumstances, the Department of Art History gives academic credit (2 points) for an internship accompanied by an independent study. Students must find a professor willing to supervise this study. Course work may include a written diary recording the student's work experience and will include a term paper relevant to the internship, to be approved by the supervising professor. The independent study must also be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. Please request an independent study form from the departmental office in Silver Center, Room 303. graduation with h onors Students may graduate with departmental honors in art history or in urban design and architecture studies by successfully researching and writing a senior thesis. This represents the culmination of the work for the major and provides excellent preparation for graduate school. To be eligible for the honors program, students must have a GPA of 3.65 or higher at the conclusion of the junior year, both overall and in art history or urban design and architecture studies. A student wishing to write an honors thesis must apply for admission to the program via the department Blackboard site in early March of the junior year. For a complete description of all the honors thesis requirements, please visit our departmental Blackboard site for honors-track students. Work toward the senior thesis consists of two 4-point honors courses (ARTH-UA 801 and ARTH-UA 804) focusing on research methods and writing, accompanied by regular meetings with the supervising professor. The completed thesis, at least 40 pages in length, is read by a committee of three faculty members, including the supervising professor. The committee meets with the student for a thesis defense at the end of the academic year. Satisfactory completion of the thesis, in the committee's judgment, earns an honors degree. These two honors courses may replace the two electives required for the major.61 ART HISTORY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ART HISTORY art history Survey c ourses No previous study is required for admission to the following courses.

Painting and sculpture in Italy, 1580-1700. Highlights major developments in the visual arts and the work of leading artists including Caravaggio, Carracci, Bernini, and Poussin. Focusing on the often para- doxical nature of Baroque art, the course examines the blurring of boundaries between the real and the imaginary, the instantaneous and the infinite, the imitative and the innovative. Special attention is paid to the creative process and the influences on it: the role of the patron, the logistics of site, and the artist's own thought process as revealed through preparatory drawings and sketches. The course is designed to help students develop the skills necessary to \"read\" works of art in all their rich complexity of form and meaning. Dutch and Flemish Painting, 1600-1700 ARTH-UA 311 Identical to MEDI-UA 311. Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Renaissance and Baroque Art (ARTH-UA 5), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered periodi- cally. 4 points. In Antwerp, Rubens overturned all previous concepts of painting. The first to deserve the term \"Baroque,\" he dominated Flanders. Van Dyck, his pupil, took Rubens's style to England. Dutch painters, including Hals, Rembrandt, and Vermeer, moved in a different direction, addressing every aspect of their country and society: the peasant, the quiet life of the well-ordered household, the sea and landscape, views of the cities, and church interiors.

Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Renaissance and Baroque Art (ARTH-UA 5), or permission of the instructor. Offered periodically. 4 points. The first third of this course focuses on the major figures in the development of early modern Spanish art: El Greco in Italy and Toledo, Vel\u00e1zquez, Zurbar\u00e1n, Murillo, Ribera, Vald\u00e9s Leal, and others. Lectures on still life painting and polychrome wood sculpture are also included. The 18th century (the Tiepolo family, Mel\u00e9ndez) is then discussed. The focus then shifts to the art of Francisco de Goya and the projection of Spanish art into the modern era. This course also seeks to define Spain in the 16th and 17th century as a global power and thus empha- sis is also placed on art in such New World centers as Mexico City and Lima in the colonial era. Latin American Art: From Colonial to Modern ARTH-UA 316 Identical to MEDI-UA 316 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Renaissance and Baroque Art (ARTH-UA 5), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

Not a traditional survey, this course opens with a brief consideration of the achievements of the great pre-Hispanic civilizations (Aztec, Maya, Inca, and others) prior to contact with the Iberian world. Major emphasis is given to colonial painting, sculpture, and architecture in Mexico and Central America, the Caribbean, and the Andes. Painting and sculpture 67 ART HISTORY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ART HISTORY of the 19th century and the secularization of Latin American art is then examined before a discussion of the establishment of modernism that comes about with the formation of academies and the travels of many artists from all parts of Latin America and the Caribbean to Europe and the U.S. from 1900 onward. Important modern artists such as the Mexican muralists, Frida Kahlo, Joaqu\u00edn Torres-Garc\u00eda, Tarsila do Amaral, Wifredo Lam, and the surrealists will bring the course up to approximately 1950. advanced c ourses in m odern a rt and architecture American Art ARTH-UA 404 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

New York City provides major collections of painting and sculpture, as well as outstanding examples of architecture. Early Modern Architecture: 1776-1914 ARTH-UA 408 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), or Expressive Culture: Architecture in New York Field Study (MAP-UA 722), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered periodically. 4 points. Focusing on the creation of modern building types such as the bank, state capitol, museum, railroad station, and skyscraper, the course begins in the later 18th century with the idealistic designs of Ledoux and Boull\u00e9e. After considering the forms and meanings associated with neoclassicism, the course examines the Gothic revival and subsequent 19th-century movements (e.g., high Victorian Gothic, Second Empire, beaux-arts classicism) as efforts to find appropriate expressions for diverse building forms. Students consider changes resulting from the Industrial Revolution, including develop- ments in technology, and the reforms of art nouveau and secession architecture. Works of Adam, Soane, Jefferson, Schinkel, Pugin, Richardson, and Sullivan; McKim, Mead, and White; Mackintosh, early Frank Lloyd Wright, and others.Modern Architecture: 1914 to the Present ARTH-UA 409 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or Early Modern Architecture: 1776-1914 (ARTH-UA 408), or History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), or Expressive Culture: Architecture in New York Field Study (MAP-UA 722), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points. Chronological account of architecture and ideas since 1914.

Includes ideological and political considerations and works by Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Louis Kahn, Alvar Aalto, Philip Johnson, James Stirling, Frank Gehry, and Santiago Calatrava, among others. Neoclassicism to Realism ARTH-UA 411 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points. The Enlightenment shaped the visual arts in two seemingly antithetical ways. On the one hand, the period's valorization of cool rationalism contributed to the rise of neoclassicism as a dominant style during the 18th century. The other course of Enlightenment thinking, exemplified by the writings of J. J. Rousseau, celebrated emotion as the purest form of intellectual as well as spiritual expression. Romanticism, with its emphasis on subjectivity and intense emotionalism, is as much a product of the Enlightenment as neo-classicism. Following on the heels of romanticism, realism has been alternately described as a rejection of romanticism and as an extension of it. Focusing on these three stylistic movements, this course examines how late 18th- and early 19th-century artists negotiated not just the aesthetic ideas of the Enlightenment but its political consequences as well. Impressionism to Expressionism ARTH-UA 412 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points. Beginning by considering how impressionism refined and redirected the artistic aims of 19th-century 68 ART HISTORY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ART HISTORY realism, this course follows the development of progressive art to the brink of cubism and pure abstraction in the first years of the 20th century. Following impressionism and post-impressionism, close attention is paid to symbolism, aestheticism, art nouveau, the Arts and Crafts movement, fau- vism, and expressionism. The aesthetic aims of these movements are analyzed in tandem with the social and cultural conditions that generated them. Cubism to Abstract Expressionism ARTH-UA 413 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points. After analyzing the invention of cubism by Picasso and Braque, this course examines its international reverberations, including Italian futurism, the later phases of German expressionism, the de Stijl movement in the Netherlands, and suprematism and constructivism in revolutionary Russia. The dada movement in the period during and after World War I is examined as a reaction to the apparent bankruptcy, cultural and artistic, of Western civilization. However, this nihilistic impulse is followed by a \"return to order\" in the 1920s. The course then examines the tensions in the multiple currents of surrealism: metamorphic, academic, and abject. Painting after World War II, from Pollock to Dubuffet, is analyzed as an extension and transfor- mation of prewar trends. Postmodern Art and Contemporary Art ARTH-UA 414 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points. Surveys art in the postmodern era, ca. 1955 to the present. After examining the innovations of the neo-avant-garde generation (1955-75), our focus shifts from the radical innovations in mediums, materials, and techniques to the expanded field of critical engagement that contemporary art encompasses. Discrete \"early\" developments sometimes dubbed neo-dada, such as op, pop, and fluxus, but also mini-malism, conceptual art, and arte povera, radically diversified the look of art and forced the dissolution of stylistic and formal categorization in favor of a classification based on a particular question, medi- atic intervention, or mode of critique. If the late 20th century brought a new emphasis on gender, race, and a number of newly pressing political forces and motivations, as we enter the 21st century, post-studio (and perhaps also \"post-critical\") artistic practices increasingly tend to be reoriented toward technology and globalism, further complicating our idea of art's relationship with its own present. Aesthetic History of Photography ARTH-UA 431 Identical to PHTI-UT 1102. Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

Beginning with the medium's invention and the early fights of its practitioners to establish themselves as fine artists, the course describes photographers' unique attempts to negotiate their relationships with both artistic movements and the media culture of which they are a part. Robinson, Cameron, Emerson, F . Holland Day, Stieglitz, Moholy-Nagy, Rodchenko, Weston, \u00c1lvarez Bravo, Lartigue, De Carava, Cahun, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, and Cindy Sherman (among others) are seen within the context of their respective art worlds, so the impact of art move- ments, cultural attitudes, and new technologies on photographers during different historical periods can be assessed.

East Asian Art II: China, Korea, Japan from 1000 C.E. to Present ARTH-UA 511 Identical to EAST-UA 92. Offered periodically. 4 points. An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. The course emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art. South Asian Art I: Indus Valley to 1200 ARTH-UA 530 Offered periodically. 4 points. An introductory survey of the history of South Asia from 2000 B.C.E. to 1200 C.E., with an emphasis on the Indian subcontinent. From the Indus Valley culture to the present day, artistic production has played a critical role in the transmission of religious beliefs and the development of cultural systems in and around South Asia. Diverse regions were linked by trade, politics, and cultural relationships, and interaction can be charted through the chang- ing forms and functions of art. We consider the historical circumstances surrounding the production of South and Southeast Asian art, as well as the problems that art historians face when trying to interpret the surviving evidence. We look at art in a variety of media, including, but not limited to, architecture, urban form, sculpture, painting, and performance. South Asian Art II: 1200 to Present ARTH-UA 531 Offered periodically. 4 points. An introductory survey of the history of South Asian art from ca. 1200 C.E. to the present.

It follows the cultivation of new tastes in the Mughal and Rajput courts through the vigorous interaction among Persian, Indic, and European artists and elites. Finally, it turns to the colonial and postcolonial artistic responses to South Asia's complex past(s). By looking at art in a range of media\u2014including, but not limited to, painting, sculpture, architecture, and photography\u2014this course considers the ways in which art actively served as expressions of political authority and cultural identity.70 ART HISTORY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ART HISTORY Art in the Islamic World I: From the Prophet to the Mongols ARTH-UA 540 Offered periodically. 4 points.

The period saw the initial formation of an Arab empire stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean, a decline in centralized authority, and the rise to political prominence of various North African, Iranian, and Central Asian dynasties from the 10th century onward. These political develop- ments are reflected in the increasingly heterogeneous nature of Islamic material culture over this time span. Art in the Islamic World II: From the Mongols to Modernism ARTH-UA 541 Offered periodically. 4 points. An introduction to the arts of Islam during a period of dynamic cultural and political change in the Islamic world. Beginning with the Mongol invasions of the 13th century, traces the development of Islamic art and architecture through the eras of Timur, the \"gunpowder empires\" (the Mughals, Ottomans, Safavids), and European colonialism, to the art of the nation-state in the 20th century.

One of six programs in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA), it provides an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the history and contemporary experiences of Asian/Pacific Americans in the Americas. The category of Asian/Pacific American includes people of East Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands living in the United States, as well as in other parts of the Americas. The two main areas of concentration are urban studies and diaspora studies. Urban studies examines the formation of Asian/Pacific American communities in relation to the various cultural, social, and political institutions in urban settings, with special emphasis on the New York metropolitan area. Diaspora studies investigates the processes that enable Asian/Pacific American communities in the United States and the Americas to sustain ties with communities throughout the world. The analysis of cultural production\u2014 social, political, and economical processes\u2014is a central theme, as is cross-cultural conflict and collaboration. In coordination with A/P/A Studies, the A/P/A Institute engages important artists, scholars, writers, and activists to campus. This provides the opportunity for discussion, performance, and reflection with students, faculty, and community members.www.apa.as.nyu.edu 20 Cooper Square, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10003-7112 Phone: 212-992-9650MAJOR/MINOR IN TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMAJOR/MINOR IN A SIAN/P ACIFIC/ AMERICAN S TUDIES courses in sociolinguistics; studying a language other than English beyond the minimum level required by the College of Arts and Science; studying languages especially germane to the department's fields of study; pursuing community-based internship fieldwork necessitating the development and use of specific language skills; or undertaking study or research abroad in contexts entailing the exercise of key language or linguistic capabilities. minor Five courses (20 points) are required for the minor in A/P/A studies, distributed as follows: One introductory course\u2014either Approaches to the Asian/Pacific/American Experience (SCA-UA 301) or the Morse Academic Plan course Cultures and Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures (MAP-UA 539)\u2014plus four electives from the A/P/A studies course offerings. honors Majors who have completed 48 points of graded work in CAS and have a 3.65 GPA or higher (both overall and in the major) are encouraged to register for Senior Honors Seminar (SCA-UA 92) in the fall semester of their senior year.

Offered every year. 4 points. This overview course examines the production of Asian American writing and literary/cultural criti- cism up to the present. Focuses on significant factors affecting the formation of Asian American literature and criticism, such as changing demographics of Asian American communities and the influence of ethnic, women's, and gay/lesbian/bisexual stud- ies. Included is a variety of genres (poetry, plays, fiction and nonfiction, literary/cultural criticism, and nontraditional forms) by writers from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Explores the ways in which the writers treat issues such as racial and ethnic identity, immigration and assimilation, gender, class, sexual- ity, nationalism, culture and community, history and memory, and art and political engagement. Cinema of Asia America SCA-UA 310 Identical to EAST-UA 314, CINE-UT 315. Offered every other year. 4 points. Begins with a critical history of misrepresentation and discrimination of Asians in Hollywood, then creates an arc of study that documents resistance and ultimately an undeniable and empowered presence. The second half of the semester focuses on a critical appreciation of contemporary Asian and Asian American film. Uses both screenings and readings and is divided into four areas of concentration: the history of misrepresentation in Hollywood films; the appropriation of Asian paradigms by Hollywood; the achievements of contemporary Asian American films; and the achievements of exemplary Asian filmmakers who have transcended regional and artistic borders. History and Literatures of the South Asian Diaspora SCA-UA 313 Identical to HIST-UA 326. Offered every year. 4 points. Introduction to the history of the South Asian diaspora in the United States. Highlights work on South Asian immigrant communities in the United States and the little-known history of South Asian immigrants on the east coast of the United States in the context of historical migration to the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean. Offers a multi-disciplinary perspective and uses classic as well as new works on South Asians in the United States from history, anthropology, sociology, and cultural studies. Asian/Pacific American Popular Culture SCA-UA 320 Offered every third year. 4 points. Examines the ways in which Asian/Pacific Americans have constituted and positioned their identities through various mediums of popular culture from the 1930s to the present. In particular, emphasizes popular institutions of representation, including music, theatre, fashion, television, and film, to examine the complex relationship between Asian/ Pacific American representational practices and their material experiences in sociopolitical locations. In addition, considers the multiple and differentiated interpretive strategies of Asian American consumers of popular culture. How are Asian/Pacific American consumption and reception practices constituted differently across lines of class, gender, and sexuality? Multiethnic New York SCA-UA 363 Offered every two years. 4 points. As a global city, New York is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse places in the world. In particular, the growth of migrant populations from Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean is driving the transformation of New York's economic, social, and political landscape. This course both explores the global socioeconomic conditions that facilitate and sustain these migrations and examines the cultural practices, imaginaries, and strategies of migrants as they become part of the city.79 ASIAN/P ACIFIC/ AMERICAN S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMAJOR/MINOR IN A SIAN/P ACIFIC/ AMERICAN S TUDIES The Constitution and People of Color SCA-UA 366 Identical to POL-UA 801, LWSOC-UA 327. Offered every year. 4 points. Examines how the American legal system decided constitutional challenges affecting the empowerment of African, Latino, and Asian American communi- ties from the 19th century to the present. Topics include the denial of citizenship and naturalization to slaves and immigrants, government-sanctioned segregation, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the prison industry, police brutality, post-9/11 detention issues, and voting rights. Course requirements include attendance at a community function involving constitutional issues, a midterm, and an interactive oral and written final project comparing a present-day issue affecting racial minorities in New York City and proposing measures to collectively address the issue. Reading Race and Representation SCA-UA 368 Parikh. Offered every year. 4 points. Much contemporary public discourse characterizes race as a problem that some individuals \"have,\" or, even, a \"card\" that some people \"play.\" It is rarely recognized as a structural or material dimension that comprises everyday experience and knowledge. In this course, we ask what it means to \"read\" race in objects, spaces, and events that for the most part do not seem to be \"about\" race per se. The course is organized around a series of such topics, which we consider from an interdisciplinary perspective, engaging historical and legal texts, literature, and film, as well as scholarship from anthropology, soci- ology, and history. Over the course of the semester, we address concepts and themes related to U.S. ethnic studies and critical race theory, including citi- zenship, rights, segregation, whiteness, colonialism, labor, migration, and alienness. The course provides an introduction to critical American studies as a field of scholarship that challenges our sense of the nation as socially and politically exceptional by asking what is forgotten or excluded in such a self-image. \"Chinatown\" and the American Imagination: A Field Research Course SCA-UA 370 Identical to IDSEM-UG 1229. Offered every other year. 4 points. What is a \"Chinatown\"? The word alone evokes many images, sounds, smells, and tastes from many different sensibilities. For recent immigrants, it can be a home away from home; for \"outsiders,\" an exotic place for cheap eats; for male action-flick fans, Chow Yun-Fat (or Mark Wahlberg) in The Corruptor; and for you? (Fill in the blank.) We explore the nooks and crannies of Chinatown in the American imagination and in its New York real- time, nonvirtual existence. How do we know what we know and do not know? What does Chinatown have to do with the formation of normative \"American\" identities? What are the possibilities (and limits) of crossing cultural divides? Class members individually and/or in groups research, experience, and document a chain of persons, places, and/or events, creating their own narrative \"tour\" of this place's meanings. Novels, history books, tourist guides, films, and pop culture supplement the primary \"text\" of New York's Chinatown. This is a collaborative, discussion-intensive, field-research- driven class. The Immigrant Imagination SCA-UA 371 Offered every year. 4 points. Examines contemporary immigration through the lens of visual culture. Explores a variety of expressive forms produced by migrant subjects\u2014including film, photography, art, and fashion\u2014and considers how these work to narrate the experiences of travel and displacement; home and exile; leisure and labor. In doing so, students consider how these visual representations seek to express the conditions of contemporary immigration in ways that co-exist with and counter dominant depictions. We ask: How do visual practices\u2014from filmmaking to graffitiing\u2014operate within immigrant communities as a mode of story-telling or world-making? How have immigrants employed visual culture to narrate their cross-cultural movements, community-building efforts, political struggles, and cultural memories? T opics in A/P/A Studies SCA-UA 380 Offered every semester. 4 points. Specific topics vary from semester to semester. Former topics have included \"Yellow Peril\": Documenting and Understanding Xenophobia; T ransnational Feminism; Cultural Politics of Food; and Politics of Fashion in the Asian Diaspora. language c ourses Elementary Filipino I, II SCA-UA 321, 322 Offered every semester. 4 points per term.

The major in biology is an integrated yet diverse program that builds a solid foundation in four foundational areas of modern biology: genomics and systems biology, developmental biology, molecular and cellular biology, and evolution and environmental biology. These four foundational areas cover the basic elements of molecular and cellular biology, genetics, evolution, organ systems, and population studies. Students are exposed to modern concepts, 82 BIOLOGY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY state-of-the-art approaches, and current methods of experimentation in molecular biology, biochemistry, genom- ics, and bioinformatics through introductory courses taken at the very outset of their studies. Intermediate courses then provide in-depth exploration of the major areas of biology, including molecular genetics, develop- mental biology, genomics and bioinformatics, and evolution and environmental biology. Advanced students may register for graduate-level courses, which are most often given in the specialized areas of faculty research. The department also offers a series of discrete minors in the life sciences, specifically in the areas of molecular and cell biology, genetics, genomics and bioinformatics, and environmental biology. Each minor is designed to hone skills in a particular contemporary area of biology and requires a laboratory experience. The minors permit students to create a course of study that will meet their unique academic and career goals. This program provides outstanding preparation for careers in research, academia, medicine, dentistry, and related fields. Graduates of the department have a remarkable record of success in acceptance into professional schools and in establishing notable careers in the biomedical sciences. Other courses offered by the department are designed to acquaint nonscience majors with contemporary issues in biology. Such courses are often topical, addressing problems such as environmental pollution, limits of the earth, and human physiology. Outstanding and highly motivated students are offered special opportunities for honors work, independent study, summer laboratory research, internships, and other enhancements. Upper-level students may become involved in research projects in faculty laboratories through the many formal and informal opportunities afforded by the department. The department has a tradition of important research accomplishment and contains several specialized research and laboratory facilities that are integrated into the educational programs. These include undergraduate labs in molecular biology, cell biology, experimental physiology, genomics and informatics, and ecological analysis. Field studies are carried out at many regional sites. Department faculty are also affiliated with the NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, the NYU Center for Developmental Genetics, NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, the NYU School of Medicine, the NYU College of Dentistry, the American Museum of Natural History, the New York Botanical Garden, and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Students with questions about majoring in biology or minoring in a specific area of biology should visit the office of the Department of Biology. Those declaring a major in biology are assigned a faculty adviser from the department; students meet with that professor to design a program of study, determine course selections, and discuss career goals.

S. cerevisiae is a unicellular eukaryote, better known as baker's yeast, that is a widely used biochemical and genetic model organism. Affinity chromatography is used to produce purified prepara-tions of wild-type and mutant protein complexes. The purified protein complexes are compared using a wide variety of biochemical techniques, including silver-stained SDS-PAGE, western blot, colorimetric enzymatic assay, and protein interaction assays. Yeast expressing the same mutants is used in genetic experiments to evaluate the importance of the protein complex in cell growth and gene regulation in the cell.

If there are overlap- ping requirements with a major or other minor (as indicated below), students will need to take one or more additional courses. caS courses Economic Principles I (ECON-UA 1, 4 points) Economic Principles II (ECON-UA 2, 4 points) Note on the economics requirement: Advanced Placement credit in macroeconomics and/or microeconomics is not accepted towards the business minor. Calculus chosen from the following four options: Mathematics for Economics I and II (MATH-UA 211 and 212; 8 points total) Calculus I (MATH-UA 121, 4 points) AP credit in Calculus (Mathematics AB or BC, with a score of 4 or 5) Calculus II (Polytechnic Institute of NYU, MA 1124, 4 points) Statistics as chosen from the following three options (prerequisite: completion of the calculus requirement. CAS students are advised to take their statistics credits in the College. Advanced Placement credit is not accepted): Statistics (ECON-UA 18, 4 points); students not majoring in the economics policy track must also take Regression and Forecasting Models (ECON-UA 19, 2 points; same as STAT-UB 3) Statistics for Business Control (Stern, STAT-UB 1, 4 points); students not majoring in the econom-ics policy track must also take Regression and Forecasting Models (Stern, STAT-UB 3, 2 points; same as ECON-UA 19) Statistics for Business Control and Regression and Forecasting Models (Stern, STAT-UB 103, 6 points). Note on the statistics requirement: Students pursuing both the business minor and the policy track in the economics major will cover regression analysis in the required major course Topics in Econometrics (ECON-UA 380); therefore, they are not required to take an additional 2-point course in regression and forecasting for the business minor.Program aNd coUrSeSA broad liberal arts education, which includes a general education component (the Morse Academic Plan) and a major in a liberal arts discipline or interdisciplinary field, provides a sound foundation for many careers in business. The skills and perspectives of the liberal arts are practical as well as personally enriching. Liberal arts students can enhance their preparedness for business by also completing a small number of rel-evant courses. In consultation with the Undergraduate College of the Leonard N. Stern School of Business, the College of Arts and Science has identified a set of such courses, some offered by CAS and some offered by Stern. By completing the business studies minor, students acquire the core knowledge and quantitative skills that are invaluable assets for success in the business professions. Intended especially for students interested in the humanities, the minor in business studies is administered by the College of Arts and Science and is available to all students in the University. Students considering the minor should consult with the business studies adviser in the College Preprofessional Advising Office in the Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 901; 212-998-8160; cas.business@nyu.edu. This person's responsibilities include advising prospective and declared minors, evaluating the applicability of transfer credit, approving course substitutions when warranted, and liaising with Stern.www.business.cas.nyu.edu Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 901, New York, NY 10003-6688 Phone: 212-998-8160 MINOR IN Business Studies97 BUSINESS S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMINOR IN BUSINESS S TUDIES However, economics policy majors who wish to take Foundations of Finance (FINC-UB 2) and/or Competitive Advantage from Operations (OPMG-UB 1) for the business minor (see below) should note that these two courses have as their prerequisite a course in regression and forecasting. Therefore, they may only be taken after Topics in Econometrics. Economics policy majors may, if they wish, take the 2-point regression course ECON-UA 19.This is not required for the economics policy major, but it allows economics students to take FINC-UB 2 and/or OPMG-UB 1 earlier in their undergraduate careers. Stern courses Principles of Financial Accounting (ACCT-UB 1, 4 points) One of the following courses: Management and Organizations (MGMT-UB 1, 4 points) or Introduction to Marketing (MKTG-UB 1, 4 points) or Information Technology in Business and Society (INFO-UB 1, 4 points) or Operations Management (OPMG-UB 1, 4 points). Prerequisites: completion of the statistics requirement and a course in regression and forecasting. Please note that no more than two of the required courses for the business studies minor may also be used to satisfy requirements for a major or other minor. Students pursuing a major (such as economics) that specifically requires three (or four) of the required business studies courses must complete one (or two) of the additional courses listed below. (For example, Economics policy majors are required to take ECON-UA 1, 2, and 18 for both their major and this minor; with this overlap of three courses, they are therefore required to take one extra course from the list below, for a total of three courses in Stern.) Principles of Managerial Accounting ACCT-UB 2 2 points. Prerequisite: Principles of Financial Accounting (ACCT-UB 1). Foundations of Finance FINC-UB 2 4 points. Prerequisites: Economic Principles II (ECON-UA 2) and statistics plus a course in regression and forecasting; corequisite: Principles of Financial Accounting (ACCT-UB 1).

Operations Management OPMG-UB 1 4 points. Prerequisites: Economic Principles II (ECON-UA 2) and statistics plus a course in regression and forecasting; corequisite: Principles of Managerial Accounting (ACCT-UB 2). A minimum grade of C is required for all courses intended to count toward the minor, and the minimum over- all GPA required in the minor is 2.0. AP credit is only accepted for calculus. No credit toward the minor can be granted for internships. All transfer credit must be evaluated by the Preprofessional Advising Center in order to determine its applicability toward the minor; submit course syllabi and transcripts to cas.business@nyu.edu. CAS students should note that all courses taken in Stern for this minor will count toward the 16-point limit on course work in the other divisions of NYU. Students seeking additional non-CAS, non-liberal arts credits beyond the 16-point limit must file a petition with the Academic Standards Committee in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909B.98 CHEMISTRY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYdepartmental objectives Chemistry is the central natural science interfacing physics and mathematics with the life sciences. Knowledge of chemistry has always been fundamental to the investigation of the physical world, as well as to an in-depth understanding of living systems. Modern chemistry spans chemical physics, materials science, and molecular biology, merging the traditional divisions of analytical, organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry. Recently, the department has focused its growth on physical, biophysical, and bioorganic chemistry, exploiting interdisciplin- ary areas of theory, nanoscience and materials, and biological and biomedical chemistry. The department has a large and active theoretical group in the areas of chemical physics and biomolecular modeling. Graduates of the department find rewarding careers and achieve distinction in all phases of scientific life, from basic research to commercial product development. The late Gertrude Elion, a 1941 M.S. in chemistry from New York University, shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for her research in pharmaceutical chemistry. The department offers majors in chemistry and in biochemistry. A selection of elective advanced courses, undergraduate and graduate, can be combined to provide a broad, varied program of study in chemistry. The department also offers a number of courses for nonscience students and service courses for students in the other schools of NYU. The programs of study in chemistry prepare students for graduate work toward the master's degree or the doctorate for careers in research, development, and teaching and/or for further study in areas such as medicine, dentistry, basic medical sciences, and allied health fields (including forensic science).

Professor John W. Draper, the first president of the society and chair of the department, was an early pioneer in photography, working with Samuel F . B. Morse. The department has undertaken a major development plan, strengthening its faculty, instructional laboratories, course offerings, and research facilities in the areas of physical, biophysical, bioorganic, and biomedical chemistry, as well as in chemical biology, nanoscience, and materials sciences. Qualified undergraduates are strongly encouraged to participate in research as early as their sophomore year of study. The department houses state-of-the-art laboratory facilities for its undergraduate chemistry courses. Majoring in chemistry at the College of Arts and Science provides strong preparation for graduate study in chemistry and biochemistry; professional education in medicine, dentistry, or patent law; and careers in industrial or pharmaceutical chemistry and biotechnology.chair of the department Professor Ward director of Undergraduate Studies Professor k ahrwww.chemistry.as.nyu.edu Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 1001, New York, NY 10003-6688 Phone: 212-998-8400DEPARTMENT OF Chemistry99 CHEMISTRY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY both majors prepare students for alternative careers, especially when paired with a minor in economics or busi- ness studies: for example, patent law, technology investment, or management in the chemical industry. The department offers an honors track that satisfies the first-year chemistry sequence required both for majors and for the prehealth curriculum in medicine, dentistry, and basic medical sciences. Students need permission from the department to register for this honors course. Permission is based on several factors, including background in both mathematics and physics, performance in high school chemistry courses, and a placement examination. majors Students thinking of majoring in chemistry or biochemistry are strongly urged to seek course advisement from the director of undergraduate studies as early in their academic careers as possible. Chemistry is a sequential subject with courses building on earlier courses. Delay in taking certain key prerequisite courses can make it impossible to complete a major in four years without summer attendance. A grade of C or better in chemistry and the other mandated courses is required for the fulfillment of the chem- istry or biochemistry major in the department. Students who do not have an average of 2.0 in departmentally required courses by the time they have completed 64 points in all courses will be asked to change their major. The major in chemistry or biochemistry builds on a core of required courses in chemistry, physics, and math- ematics. The six required core courses (32 points) in chemistry are: General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 125) General Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 126) Organic Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 225) Organic Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 226) Physical Chemistry: Quantum Mechanics and Spectroscopy (CHEM-UA 651) Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics and Kinetics (CHEM-UA 652) The advanced and/or majors versions of the general and organic sequences\u2014CHEM-UA 127, CHEM-UA 128, CHEM-UA 227, and CHEM-UA 228 (see course descriptions)\u2014substitute for CHEM-UA 125, CHEM-UA 126, CHEM-UA 225, and CHEM-UA 226, respectively. In addition to these chemistry courses, the chemistry and biochemistry majors require four courses (18 points) in mathematics and physics: Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) General Physics I (PHYS-UA 11) General Physics II (PHYS-UA 12) Calculus III (MATH-UA 123) and Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140) are strongly recommended as preparation for both Physical Chemistry: Quantum Mechanics & Spectroscopy (CHEM-UA 651) and Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics & Kinetics (CHEM-UA 652), as well as for students interested in pursuing chemistry on the graduate level or who have an interest in theoretical chemistry. The following sequence covers the content of Calculus II and III (MATH-UA 122, 123) as well as Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140) in two semesters, and carries a pre-requisite of Calculus I or equivalent: MATH-UA 221 Honors Calculus I: Accelerated Calculus with Linear Algebra I MATH-UA 222 Honors Calculus II: Accelerated Calculus with Linear Algebra II The core, described above, provides a basic background in chemistry. Students normally are required to complete the courses in general chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, and calculus prior to entry into CHEM UA-651, 652 (physical chemistry) in the third year. Alternative programs are also possible. It is strongly advised, however, that an advanced-level chemistry course be taken in the third year of study, allowing at least three more semes- ters to complete all major requirements. Undergraduate specialization in organic, biochemical, physical, or theoretical chemistry may be accomplished through combinations of advanced elective undergraduate and graduate courses open to undergraduates. These courses should be chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies.100 CHEMISTRY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY For students interested in preparation for careers in the chemical industry, several alternatives are available\u2014for example, pairing the major in chemistry with a minor in economics or business studies. Students interested in careers in medicine, dentistry, or basic medical sciences may wish to consider the major in biochemistry. Additional courses in biology may be desirable for such students. The appropriate preprofessional adviser should be consulted for details. The Department of Chemistry offers the following majors:Major in Chemistry, B.A. The minimum major requirements, in addition to the core courses cited above, are completion of the Physical Chemistry Laboratory course (CHEM-UA 661), Inorganic Chemistry (CHEM-UA 711), and one advanced chemistry elective course for the B.A. degree. Major in Biochemistry The minimum requirements, in addition to the core courses cited above, are Biochemistry I and II (CHEM-UA 881, 882), Experimental Biochemistry and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 885), and Advanced Biochemistry (CHEM-UA 890). Students in this major are reminded that these courses must be taken in the proper order. Careful course planning is required to ensure that this can be done within a normal four-year program. Biochemistry students are strongly encouraged to take Cellular and Molecular Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 21, 22) along with Biochemistry. This is especially important for those students wishing to enter graduate programs in biochemistry. In addition to these majors, the department offers several programs and options that may be of interest to students: Program in Chemistry and Engineering The College of Arts and Science offers a joint B.S/B.S. program with the Polytechnic Institute of NYU. For stu - dents interested in chemistry, the program leads to the B.S. degree from New York University and the B.S. degree in chemical and biomolecular engineering from Polytechnic. Further information is available from Joseph Hemmes in the College Advising Center, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130. Bachelor of Science (B.S.) Degree Students who complete the required core courses as outlined above, as well as the Physical Chemistry Laboratory course (CHEM-UA 661), Inorganic Chemistry (CHEM-UA 711), three advanced electives in chemistry, and at least two semesters of Advanced Independent Study and Research (CHEM-UA 997, 998) or Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996) will graduate with the degree of Bachelor of Science (B.S.) instead of the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.). Students should note that the B.S. program is very difficult to complete within a normal four-year academic program and that it confers no particular advantage to students in premedical or predental programs. minor Completion of the following four 6-point courses constitutes a minor in chemistry: CHEM-UA 125 or 127, 126 or 128, 225 or 227, and 226 or 228. Only three of the four courses may also be used to satisfy another department's major. No grade lower than C will count toward the minor, and an average of 2.0 or better in all chemistry courses is required. general Information Laboratory courses in chemistry: Due to the potential hazard of any chemical experimentation, safety goggles, laboratory coats, and other protective gear must be worn at all times in the laboratories. Laboratory equipment, which is lent to the student for the duration of the course, must be replaced by the student if it is damaged or broken. Students who do not return borrowed laboratory equipment at the end of a course are charged an additional fee, and their grade may be recorded as incomplete and not released until \"checkout\" is completed. Research: The department endeavors to make research opportunities available during the summer and the academic year to well-qualified students at all levels. We strongly urge students who are interested in research to begin as early as freshman year. Students are encouraged to apply for the FAST and DURF grants awarded by 101 CHEMISTRY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY the College. To participate in research in the department, students must both meet the prerequisites and register for the research courses Advanced Independent Study and Research (CHEM-UA 997, 998) or, if eligible, Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996). In either case, permission of the director of undergraduate studies is required before registering in these courses. honors Program The honors program in chemistry is composed of several elements, starting with Advanced General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 127) and culminating with two semesters of Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996). Students may graduate with honors without having Advanced General Chemistry or Majors Organic Chemistry courses. However, by the time the student is in the sophomore year, he or she is encouraged to engage in experimental or theoretical research. Depending on the number of credits the student is registered for, the initial exposure to research may or may not be for credit. But there must be, at minimum, one semester of registered Advanced Independent Study and Research (CHEM-UA 997 or CHEM-UA 998) before entering the senior year and conducting senior honors research. Please contact Carol Hollingsworth, academic program administrator, or Professor Bart Kahr, director of undergraduate studies, for more detailed information. Candidates for a degree with honors in chemistry must have an overall GPA of 3.65 and a GPA of 3.65 in required courses for the chemistry or biochemistry degree. They must take two semesters of Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996). A senior thesis based on this work must be prepared, approved by the adviser, and presented in a seminar format during the spring term of the senior year. Students desiring entry into the honors program must obtain the approval of the director of undergraduate studies prior to the end of their junior year. For general requirements, please see the section Honors and Awards in this bulletin. coUrSeS The following courses are lectures unless otherwise indicated.

Some courses have prerequisites, as speci- fied below. Child and Adolescent Psychopathology (CAMS-UA 101) is the foundational course upon which students will complete the requirements for the minor. The program offers a variety of courses, along with numerous options for independent study. Additional courses and opportunities are currently in development. Many of the CAMS courses have no prerequisite and are open to all undergraduates. Child and Adolescent Psychopathology CAMS-UA 101 Prerequisite: Introduction to Psychology (PSYCH-UA 1). Offered in fall, spring, and summer. Shatkin, Evans. 4 points. While psychopathology courses are commonplace among undergraduate psychology curricula, courses focusing on child and adolescent psychopathology are relatively rare. Through lecture presentations and discussions, this course focuses on disease etiology, epidemiology, phenomenology, nosology, and diagnosis. It engages students in a critical review of common child and adolescent psychopathology and challenges social and cultural assumptions of what constitutes \"normal\" versus \"pathological\" behavior, cognition, and emotion. Students also complete one practicum by participating with a clinician (psychologist or psychiatrist) during the evaluation of a child or adolescent patient at the NYU Child Study Center. The Treatment of Child and Adolescent Mental Illness CAMS-UA 102 Prerequisite: Child and Adolescent Psychopathology (CAMS-UA 101). Offered in the spring. Shatkin, Evans. 4 points. Provides students with an overview and under- standing of the current methods employed in the coUrSeSThe minor requires five courses. At least three of the classes taken toward the minor must be from within the CAMS program, and one of these three must be the foundational course, Child and Adolescent Psychopathology (CAMS-UA 101). The final two classes can be taken from among the CAMS offerings or chosen from a list of approved courses in other departments (see under Course Offerings). Courses taken for the CAMS minor cannot be applied to another major or minor. Psychology majors in the College of Arts and Science and social work majors within the Silver School of Social Work, however, are allowed to count one course from their major toward the minor, thereby requiring only four unique courses (at least three from within CAMS) to complete the minor.Programdirector of Undergraduate Studies in child and adolescent mental health; vice chair for e ducation, NYU child Study c enter Jess P.

For most of the past century, treatments for children and adolescents suffering from mental illness relied primarily on open-ended psychotherapies, which have not consistently demonstrated a beneficial effect. Over the past 25 years, however, a variety of new evidence-based treatments have emerged, including behavioral psychotherapies such as cognitive behavior therapy for anxiety and depres- sion, dialectical behavior therapy for personality disorders, and parent management training for children with oppositional and defiant disorders. In addition, we now have strong evidence support-ing the use of various pharmacological interventions for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mood and anxiety disorders, and autism. Students investigate each of these treatments by reading and analyzing much of the original research that estab- lished their efficacy. This course builds upon Child and Adolescent Psychopathology (CAMS-UA 101). Complementary and Alternative Mental Health CAMS-UA 103 Offered every year. Chai, Zolovska. 4 points. Complementary and alternative treatments comprise the most rapidly expanding segment of American healthcare. This course examines the role of non-conventional care in the mental wellness of children, adolescents, and young adults. We survey the historical, clinical, and scientific aspects of mind-body treatments, biologically based alternative therapies, spirituality, and the traditional medi-cal systems of China and India. In addition, we investigate the social, political, and economic forces influencing the role and status of complementary and alternative practices in America. Students assess these practices by participating in class discussion, reviewing research literature, and engaging in several group experiential exercises. When the Nightmare Is Real: Trauma in Childhood and Adolescence CAMS-UA 104 Offered in the fall and spring. Mathewson, Weder. 4 points. Every childhood is fraught with complications, but some children are exposed to traumatic experiences that have a lasting impact on their development and health. Many children in New York City are still reeling from the effects of September 11, yet these numbers pale in comparison to the more than three million reported cases of child abuse and neglect in the United States annually, in addition to the many more cases that go unreported. This course examines the neurobiological and psychological effects of trauma on children, adolescents, and their families. We investigate the impact of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse and neglect, war, terrorism, natural disasters, bereavement, and medical illness. In addition, we explore the concepts of vulnerability and resilience to discover why most affected children successfully traverse their trauma. Finally, we discuss the treatment modalities commonly employed with traumatized children, adolescents, and their families. The Science of Happiness CAMS-UA 110 Offered in the fall and spring. Schlechter. 4 points. Examines the state of college-student mental health and wellness on a personal and systems level. As undergraduate university students approach the end of adolescence, they often reevaluate the beliefs, values, and assumptions with which they left home. Young adulthood is a time of great promise, but the transition from child to adult is never easy. We look at how individuals can create positive change by reinterpreting their goals and identifying steps toward a successful college experience. Key findings from the fields of neuroscience and positive psychology are referenced to inform our study of the biopsychosocial underpinnings of success and hap- piness. Through lectures and discussions, students learn about a variety of wellness topics that include mindfulness, relationships, and self-esteem. The final project requires students to promote an area of mental wellness on campus. Risk and Resilience in Urban T eens: Mental Health Promotion and Practicum CAMS-UA 111, 112 Prerequisite: for CAMS-UA 111; for CAMS-UA 112: completion of CAMS-UA 111 with a grade of B or higher. CAMS-UA 111 is offered in the fall; CAMS-UA 112 is offered in the spring. Shatkin, Diamond. 4 points per term. Three decades ago, prevention approaches emerged seeking to cultivate psychological well-being among youth before the manifestation of pathology or problem behaviors. Since then, theory-based prevention programs targeting behavioral risk factors have demonstrated reductions in drug use, aggres- sion, early sexual activity, depression, and anxiety in adolescents. Still, 35 percent of 14- to 17-year-olds engage in one or two high-risk behaviors, another 30 percent engage in multiple high-risk behaviors, and 20 percent of youth experience a major psy-chiatric disorder by the end of high school. In this two-semester course, students examine school-based 109 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMINOR IN CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH S TUDIES mental-health promotion practices, positive youth development, resilience and risk-taking among urban adolescents. They will master a strength-based curriculum addressing cognitive distortions, stress management and reduction, drug and alcohol use, and healthy relationships, among other topics, and then deliver this 11-session curriculum to 9th- and 10th-grade students at high schools in New York City. Skepticism and Proof: Research Methods in Child Mental Health CAMS-UA 120 Offered in the fall and spring. Lucas. 4 points. Clinical practice and public policy in child mental health is too often driven by the media, conventional wisdom, or prejudice rather than scientific data. Evidence-based clinical care seeks to guide practitio- ners in the critical appraisal of data on risk factors, prevention, and treatment. This course promotes the development of analytic skills that allow students to understand published research, compare and contrast their knowledge with media reports, and draw their own conclusions. The research techniques and methods taught focus on the knowledge and skills needed to design, carry out, and evaluate a research study. Students work to design their own unique hypothetical research protocols, receiving individual and small group feedback, and present these at the end of the course in a simulation of the research-funding application process. Lively seminar discussions of topical \"hot-button\" issues, such as the apparent \"epidemic\" of certain diagnoses, the influence of the environment or culture on child mental health, and the risks/benefits of widely prescribed medications, are combined with a systematic review of the existing evidence base on current empirically supported treatments for child mental health problems. Behavioral Interventions for Children with Disruptive Behavior Disorders: Practicum CAMS-UA 131, 132 Offered every summer. Abikoff, Fleiss. 3 points per session. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly diagnosed neurobehavioral childhood disorder, affecting between 5 and 7 per- cent of the population. It is a complex disorder that impacts a child's functioning across multiple settings. Although medication is often the first-line treat- ment, a multimodal approach, including behavioral interventions, is often necessary to address deficits in social skills, classroom behavior, and parent-child relations. This two-part summer course begins with an intensive didactic that helps students obtain a broader understanding of the impact of ADHD on children's functioning and how behavioral treat- ments are employed to improve children's social, academic, and home life. The first course provides a foundation in social learning theory, and the second course engages students in a practicum at the NYU Child Study Center's Summer Program for Kids, where they gain supervised, hands-on experience in applying behavioral principles and procedures. Ongoing discussion with supervisors regarding the clinical expression of symptoms and treatment response takes place daily. Students also gain consid-erable insight into the challenges clinicians face in treating children afflicted with this disorder. Finally, students learn how to employ these same behavioral treatments for children affected by commonly comorbid conditions, such as oppositional defiant and conduct disorder. Disruptive Behavior and Sociopathy in Children and Adolescents CAMS-UA 133 Offered in the fall and spring. Hopperstad. 4 points. How do we conceptualize \"bad behavior\" in children? This course examines the spectrum of childhood disruptive behaviors, ranging from the defiance of the fictional literary character Huck Finn to the sociopathy of Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris. It explores both historical and contemporary perspectives, from the age-old idea of the \"bad seed\" to the current biological, psychological, and sociological theories. The first half of the course surveys central ideas in the study of childhood disruptive behaviors. The second half applies these ideas to better understand challenges in diagnosis and treatment, as well as gender, racial, and cultural differences in the manifestation of these behaviors. The course uses scientific and theoretical sources, clinical case material, and fictional and real media depictions to explore this topic and its tremendous impact on the individual, family, and society. Behavioral Problems in School: Impairment to Intervention CAMS-UA 134 Offered in the fall and spring. Verduin, Diaz. 4 points. This course reviews typical children's behavior problems in school settings and offers a primer in evidence-based behavior-management tools. The class addresses common causes of disruptive behav-ior, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related conditions. Students will be 110 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMINOR IN CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH S TUDIES instructed in effective behavior-management strate- gies appropriate for such settings as schools, camps, and sports programs. Techniques will include selec- tive attention, behavioral daily report cards, token economies, and limit setting. The theoretical and research bases for these strategies will be explored. Students will practice skills with live coaching from the instructors. One required field trip to the NYU Child Study Center will allow students to view how these tools are used in real-life clinical settings. This course is of particular interest to those considering careers in child psychology or psychiatry, pediatrics, or general or special education, especially those seek-ing experience as student aides, camp counselors, or Special Education Itinerant Teachers (SEITs). Child and Adolescent Brain Development: Applications from Neuroscience to Practice CAMS-UA 141 Offered in the fall and spring. Montalto. 4 points. Covers the fundamentals of human brain develop- ment from birth to young adulthood. The focus is on normal brain functioning, but illustrative patho-logical development and dysfunctional conditions are reviewed as well, such as developmental dyslexia, autistic disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Once students have developed a founda- tional knowledge of neurocognitive functioning, the course addresses three additional sections that reflect methods of examining brain-based activity: observation, assessment, and intervention. At the end of each section, students will have a greater understanding of the neurocognitive developmental perspective and be able to apply their knowledge of brain-based skill sets to understanding the environ-mental demands that children and teens confront, including learning in school, handling complex social interactions, remembering autobiographical experiences, and managing emotional reactions. Students read a sampling of research articles, relevant clinical materials, and textbook chapters. The Adolescent Paradox: Emotions, Behavior and Identity CAMS-UA 142 Offered in fall, spring, and summer. Soffer, Nagula. 4 points. Adolescence is a remarkable time of growth and development; in just a few years, children transition dramatically towards adulthood across multiple domains. While adolescence is physically the healthiest period of the lifespan, it is also marked by an enormous rise in morbidity and mortality. This seeming paradox can be explained, in part, by biological and psychological changes during puberty that affect emotion regulation, cognition, and consequent risk-taking behavior. At the turn of the twentieth century, adolescence was described as a developmental period inevitably filled with \"storm and stress.\" In what ways does this vision of adolescence still apply? How should current scientific findings inform our understanding of the propensity for risk-taking behavior during this period (including substance use, increasing sexual activity, and disordered eating)? In exploring the factors that shape emotions, behavior, and emerging identity during adolescence, this course examines such questions from biological and psychosocial perspectives. Sex Matters: Identity, Behavior, and Development CAMS-UA 143 Offered in the fall and spring. Shuster, Janssen. 4 points. Sexual identity is central to our sense of who we are and how we relate to the world. The development of this identity is essential to becoming a well-rounded, effective, and high-functioning adult, and failure to develop a cohesive sexual identity can lead to dysfunction. Sexual development involves a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and sociologi-cal components. Sexual differentiation begins in utero, as the fetus is exposed to hormones and growth factors. As children age, their primary and secondary sex organs develop, and their ideas about the function, use, and meaning of these organs change. At each stage the environment, social milieu, and hormones, among other factors, influence the direction of these changes. In this course we explore the impact of sexual identity development on the mental health of children and adolescents. Looking Back on Growing Up CAMS-UA 144 Offered in the fall and spring. Liaw, Hirsch. 4 points. What is the impact of our upbringing? This course provides an overview of child development with the goal of understanding the complexity of human growth, adaptation, and responses to adversity. To this end, we trace a variety of overlapping trajectories, including the development of cognitive, emotional, interpersonal, and moral capacities. The course reviews historical and modern-day developmental theories, as well as more complex interpersonal constructs, such as family systems, peer relations, gender and sexual identity, and cultural variation. Special emphasis is placed upon examin- ing the dynamic interplay between biology and 111 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMINOR IN CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH S TUDIES environment. The course consists of two interactive lectures per week based upon introductory readings on child development. Students are also assigned one film to view at home each week to illustrate the myriad ways in which human beings evolve and adapt through life's transitions and challenges. Morality in Childhood CAMS-UA 145 Offered in the fall and spring. Gerson, Kerlek, Shaffer. 4 points. How do children learn right from wrong? Today's youth face an onslaught of mixed messages about morality. Parents and teachers champion honesty, integrity, and empathy, while sports stars use steroids, music and video games glorify sexual violence, and politicians pander for votes based on prejudice and fear. At the same time, children are confronted with uniquely modern moral challenges, as they navigate bullying and privacy invasion on the Internet, easily accessible drugs, and gang and relationship violence. This course examines how children negotiate these challenges and learn moral principles, using perspectives from developmental neurobiology, evolutionary biology, philosophy, and multiple theoretical frameworks within cognitive and social psychology. Topics include gender, cul-ture, socioeconomic status, education, and parenting and their influence on moral development from infancy through adolescence. Children and the Media CAMS-UA 150 Offered in the fall and spring. Foubister, Glawe. 4 points. Consuming media has far outstripped reading storybooks or playing make-believe as the aver- age American child's favorite pastime. Children between the ages of 2 and 18 years spend an average of five-and-a-half hours a day using some form of media. This course reviews the current literature on how media use affects children's mental health, as well as their cognitive, emotional, and social development. Designed for those who wish to learn to think critically, this course provides a comprehen- sive, research-oriented review of how children and adolescents are influenced by the media. Discussions include an examination of controversial issues, such as media's effects on children's violent behavior and substance use, as well as the potential benefits of media. The Art and Science of Parenting CAMS-UA 161 Offered in fall, spring, and summer. Gallagher. 4 points. After spending our early lives with our parents, what can we say about how they influenced our person-alities and development? How have our parents affected what we learn, how we act, and how we manage our health? Just as you have wondered about these questions, so have scientists and profession- als. We study parenting styles in detail to identify qualities that foster healthy child development. The course reviews research on the importance of parenting practices within a family context. Students also learn how to interact effectively with parents, how to mobilize parents, and what efforts have been successful in changing detrimental parenting actions. This course is for the curious and those interested in careers in education, health, and mental health. Children of Divorce CAMS-UA 162 Offered in the fall and spring. Charuvastra. 4 points. Provides an overview of current research on divorce in American families. The instructor is a child and adolescent psychiatrist who has researched trauma and resilience and has worked clinically with children and families affected by divorce. The course emphasizes how divorce affects children and their capacity to grow into loving, well-functioning, relationship-forming adults. Theories of attachment, intimacy, and communication are examined in the context of successful and failed marital relationships. While You Were Sleeping CAMS-UA 170 Offered in the fall and spring. Shatkin, Baroni. 4 points. Sleep is somewhat akin to the ocean\u2014it surrounds us, and we could not live without it, yet it remains a mystery whose secrets we are only now beginning to unfold. Scientific research into sleep and dreams began in earnest about 50 years ago. Since that time, the small and burgeoning field of sleep medicine has taught us a great deal about how and why we sleep. This course provides students with a comprehensive introduction to sleep and dreams throughout the life cycle. Our study includes a focus on normal sleep behavior and physiology, the evolution of sleep, circadian and biological rhythms, dreams, and the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. Through exercises and assignments, students learn about the importance of sleep for mental and physical well- being and how to best establish a healthy sleep routine. Drugs and Kids CAMS-UA 180 Offered in fall, spring, and summer. Kamboukos, Bruzzese. 4 points. Approximately 72 percent of youth in the United 112 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMINOR IN CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH S TUDIES States report using alcohol at least once, and 47 percent report using illicit drugs at least once by the time they reach 12th grade. While the major- ity of youth who use substances will not develop a substance-abuse disorder, substance abuse and addiction are major public health problems affecting approximately 9 percent of the U.S. population age 12 and older. Most individuals with substance abuse disorders began using substances during adolescence or even childhood. This course briefly reviews the classes of psychoactive substances, including alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs and their basic neurophysi- ological effects before exploring the historical, social, and psychological factors related to substance use and abuse in adolescents and children. The second half of the course considers substance-abuse preven-tion, treatment, and policy related to children and adolescents. The Literature of Children and Adolescents CAMS-UA 191 Offered in fall, spring, and summer. Marcus, Montalto. 4 points. Considers children's and adolescents' literature as a rich, untapped source of insight into child develop- ment for students of psychology, child development, and related disciplines. Over the last century, a vibrant, many-faceted literature for young people has grown in tandem with our understanding of child and adolescent psychology to present young readers with an increasingly finely calibrated perspective on such basic developmental issues as the formation of trust, the emergence of a sense of autonomy, and the complexities of family and peer relationships. Students explore these and other topics as they read and discuss a wide range of picture books, longer fiction, and relevant professional literature. Advanced Seminar: Autism Spectrum Disorders CAMS-UA 201 Prerequisite: Child and Adolescent Psychopathology (CAMS-UA 101) or permission of the instructor. Offered in fall, spring, and summer. Nishawala, DeGeorge. 4 points. Provides students with an in-depth exposure to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Beginning with etiological theories, various biological, behavioral, and cognitive paradigms are examined in an effort to help students conceptualize the developmental links between brain and behavior. Epidemiology, diagnostic and treatment strategies, and finally issues of public policy are then reviewed in detail. All students must also engage in a supervised experien-tial lab practicum at the NYU Child Study Center's Asperger Institute or an affiliated school where they work directly with children and adolescents with ASDs for three hours each week. Primary sources for the course include scientific papers, individual accounts by people living with ASDs, and reviews of current popular media and websites. Advanced Seminar: Global Perspectives in Child and Adolescent Mental Health CAMS-UA 202 Prerequisite: Child and Adolescent Psychopathology (CAMS-UA 101). Offered in the spring. Liaw, Henry. 4 points. Worldwide studies suggest that up to 20 percent of children and adolescents suffer from a significant mental illness, but how mental health and illness are perceived varies greatly around the world. Through lectures, discussions, readings, and films, this course provides a global overview of the scope and magnitude of child and adolescent mental health issues. The most commonly identified child and adolescent mental illnesses, including mood and anxiety, post-traumatic stress, disruptive behavior, and substance-abuse disorders, are examined from various cultural perspectives. The ways in which geo-socio-politico-economic factors, specifically war and conflict, child exploitation, structural violence and poverty, and HIV/AIDS, affect child develop-ment and mental health are also studied. Finally, the course addresses the dearth of resources allocated to children's mental health, as well as the barriers to care, such as stigma and education. Selected case studies from the Americas, Africa, Europe, Southeast Asia, East Asia, and the Middle East are used to illustrate key concepts. Advanced Seminar: Family Systems and Child and Adolescent Mental Health CAMS-UA 204 Prerequisite: Child and Adolescent Psychopathology (CAMS-UA 101). Offered in the fall and spring. Roffman. 4 points. Until the mid-20th century, the fields of psychiatry, psychology, and mental health were dominated by individually oriented theories of human experience, development, and psychopathology. Family systems theory emerged as a response to the limitations of that paradigm, offering a radically different way both of thinking about individuals and doing psychother- apy. This emerging model views human experience as irreducibly relational. From a systems perspective, an individual is always an individual embedded in networks of significant relationships, the most central of which is the family. This course presents family systems theory as a powerful tool for under- standing families and for working with children and 113 CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMINOR IN CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH S TUDIES adolescents and includes various clinical experiences. Special emphasis is placed throughout on multicul- tural dimensions of theory and practice. Independent Study: Advanced T opics in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Studies CAMS-UA 997, 998 Offered every semester. 1 to 4 points. The independent study program offers upper-division students the opportunity to investigate an advanced topic with a faculty member in the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

Tier I consists of a core curriculum of five courses taken in sequence. Tier II consists of elective small lecture courses in the areas of film auteurs, genres, historical movements, national cinemas, television studies, and special topics. Tier III consists of large survey courses in American and international cinema. Majors are required to complete five courses (20 points) in Tier I: Introduction to Cinema Studies (CINE-UT 10) Film History: Silent Cinema (CINE-UT 15) Film Theory (CINE-UT 16) Television: History and Culture (CINE-UT 21) One undergraduate Advanced Seminar (CINE-UT 7XX) In addition, majors must complete a three-course distribution requirement in film history: one course in U.S. cinema and two courses in non-U.S. cinema. Students wishing to complete honors in this major may apply during their junior year if they have maintained an overall GPA of 3.65, as well as a 3.65 GPA in their cinema studies major. Requirements of the honors program include (1) the successful completion of one graduate-level cinema studies class, (2) the writing of a 40-page honors thesis of suitable quality for conference presentation and/or publication, (3) the completion of an additional 4-point research-writing seminar (beyond the standard 40-point major) in which students revise and extend earlier work to complete the honors thesis, and (4) maintenance of the above GPAs until graduation. Zhenassistant Professor Choi affiliated f aculty Ginsburg (Anthropology), Stoney (Film and Television)chair of the department Professor Allen director of Undergraduate Studies Associate Professor StraayerDEPARTMENT OF Cinema Studies www.cinema.tisch.nyu.edu 721 Broadway, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10003-6807 Phone: 212-998-1600 The Department of Cinema Studies at the Tisch School of the Arts holds a preeminent place among cinema studies programs in the country. Its approach to cinema focuses on the processes of understand- ing film and the moving image in its multiple cultural and interdisciplinary contexts. The undergraduate program treats the study of cinema both as an art form and as a form of mass culture. The study of film, as an art, is concerned with the relationships among film style, narrative form, and the material practices that shape the medium. The study of film as mass culture explores how film reflects societal values and processes of social change. The department offers courses in the history, theory, aesthetics, and criticism of film, as well as film genres and techniques. Certain film courses given in the College of Arts and Science (CAS) may also be approved for the major or minor. Most of the Tisch courses include extensive film screenings and are supplemented by a weekly cin\u00e9math\u00e8que. Students have access to certain Moving Image Archiving and Preservation (MIAP) courses and the Orphans Symposium. Students also have access to extensive film and film-related resources in the department's George Amberg Study Center. The video collection in the Bobst Library's Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media provides additional resources. Finally, various New York City institutions make this an extraordinary environment for cinema studies.115 CINEMA S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF CINEMA S TUDIES Tier I: c ore c ourses Tier I courses are for cinema studies majors only and should be taken in sequence. Introduction to Cinema Studies CINE-UT 10 First semester of study. Allen. 4 points. Designed to introduce the basic methods and concepts of cinema studies to new majors. The first goal is to help students develop a range of analytical skills in the study of film. By the end of the semester, they are fluent in the basic vocabulary of film form, understand the social questions raised by dominant modes of cinematic representation, and grasp the mechanics of structuring a written argument about a film's meaning. The second goal of the course is to familiarize students with some of the major critical approaches in the field (for example, narrative theory, feminism, cultural studies, and genre). To this end, readings and screenings also provide a brief introduc- tion to some critical issues associated with particular modes of film production and criticism (such as documentary, narrative, and the avant-garde). Film History: Silent Cinema CINE-UT 15 Second semester of study. Lant. 4 points. Examines the question of how the history of cinema has been studied and written by taking the period of silent film as its case study. Explores the historical and cultural contexts that governed the emergence of film as art and mass culture. Investigates the different approaches to narrative filmmaking that developed internationally in the silent period. Screenings include early cinema, works of Hollywood drama and comedy, Russian film and Soviet montage cinema, Weimar cinema, and silent black cinema. Film Theory CINE-UT 16 Third semester of study. Straayer. 4 points. Closely examines a variety of theoretical writings concerned with aesthetic, social, and psychological aspects of the medium. Students study the writing of classical theorists such as Eisenstein, Bazin, and Cracauer, as well as such contemporary thinkers as Metz, Mulvey, and Baudrillard. Questions addressed range from the nature of cinematic representation and its relationship to other forms of cultural expression to the way in which cinema shapes our conception of racial and gender identity. T elevision: History and Culture CINE-UT 21 Fourth semester of study. Choi. 4 points. Examines the background, context, and history of radio, television, video, and sound. Topics include politics and economics of media institutions, audi- ences and reception, cultural and broadcast policy, and aesthetic modes and movements. Advanced Seminar CINE-UT 7XX 4 points. Involves in-depth study of a specific topic and encourages the student to produce original research. Tier II See the Department of Cinema Studies section of the Tisch School of the Arts Bulletin for a list and descriptions of Tier II courses.Approval of the thesis subject, evaluation of the thesis, and the decision to award honors are made in consulta-tion with the faculty member teaching the research-writing seminar. In order to declare the cinema studies major and/or be cleared for registration for the forthcoming semester, students must schedule an appointment with the departmental CAS liaison during the following periods: fall semester entrance/clearance, March 15 to April 15; spring semester entrance/clearance, October 15 to November 15. If a student does not meet with the department during these periods, he or she will be asked to declare during the next semester. Students must also have one year of residency at CAS prior to declaring the major; incoming freshmen and transfers are not eligible for immediate declaration upon entrance to the University. minor A total of 16 points is required for the minor. This typically takes the form of four 4-point courses. The first course must be either Expressive Culture: Film (MAP-UA 750), recommended for CAS students, or Introduction to Cinema Studies (CINE-UT 10). An additional 12 points must be taken in CINE-UT (cinema studies) courses, or courses from elsewhere in the University and pre-approved by the Department of Cinema Studies. Included in these 12 points must be one course on international cinema and one Tier II cinema studies course.

Issues of conservation, preservation, and ethics are considered through case studies that focus on sites, monuments, and materials. Team-taught with physical chemistry professor Norbert S. Baer of the Institute of Fine Arts Conservation Center, this course reviews a range of applied technologies used in the analysis of ancient objects: radiocarbon dating, thermoluminescence, dendrochronol- ogy, stable isotope analysis, dedolomitization, and elemental analysis. Authenticity and forgery, dating and provenance, and the sourcing of ancient materials are among the issues examined. The use of coins, inscriptions, and stamped amphora handles and ceramics is evaluated as criteria for establishing absolute and relative chronologies. Consideration is given to the role that stylistic analysis and connois- seurship have played in our understanding of ancient art. This interdisciplinary course is ideal for students who are interested in the intersection of classical archaeology with law, science, ethics, public policy, cultural resource management, and the environ-ment. We track developments in global cultural property laws, international conventions, and the repatriation of cultural materials.

This seminar explores the history and culture of Egypt's western oases, especially of Dakhleh Oasis. In the course of this month, as we travel physically around Dakhleh and Kharga and chronologically from deep prehistory to the advent of Christianity, we address issues of insularity and connectivity with respect to the Nile Valley, as well as the relationship between humans, technology, and the natural envi-ronment. Inhabitants of the oases always enjoyed a rather precarious existence, because of the difficulty of travel, the ever-present risk of salinization, hostile desert raiders, and general remoteness; thus, we are alerted to the ways in which the realities of living on an oasis provoked identifiable and to some degree recurrent cultural dynamics. The Archaeology of Egypt's Nile Valley CLASS-UA 9356 Prerequisites: The Oases 9355) and Field Work in Egypt (CLASS-UA 9357). Offered in the spring. 4 points. In this traveling seminar, students leave Dakhleh Oasis for the Nile Valley to place what they have studied into a wider cultural context. During the course of the month, students visit temples, tombs, settlements, and other sites throughout Egypt, from Aswan to Alexandria. Seminar sessions and class presentations focus on themes related especially to Egypt's ever-evolving religious and funerary beliefs, as well as the complex, often multicultural, nature of Egyptian civic life at various periods.Field Work in Egypt CLASS-UA 9357 Prerequisite: The Oases of Egypt (CLASS-UA 9355). Offered in the spring. 4 points. This intensive course is largely field-based, with additional time spent processing, recording, and ana-lyzing materials at the excavation house. Students are involved in almost every aspect of the archaeological field process. Specialists offer instruction in survey techniques, in the drafting of archaeological plans, and in the interpretation of ceramics and other highly indicative artifacts. As the bulk of excavation in Egypt is undertaken by local workmen, students receive training as a site supervisor (with all of the necessary background in archaeological methodology that this entails). Independent Project: Excavation at Amheida CLASS-UA 9358 Prerequisite: participation in the NYU Archaeology and History in Egypt program. Offered in the spring. 4 points. For this independent project, students produce origi- nal research on some aspect of the material culture so far unearthed at Amheida. Students may choose to specialize in a type of artifact (such as pottery, flints, or coins), choose to analyze specific contexts in depth, or develop a specific project based on their own interests and backgrounds. In all cases, they are encouraged to formulate and test hypotheses. Once completed, independent projects are archived in the library for the use of all other archaeologists who work at Amheida. Research undertaken while at Dakhleh is facilitated by our online database, by col-lections stored on site, and by the dig house library. graduate c ourses o pen to Undergraduates Courses in classics offered in the Graduate School of Arts and Science are open to all undergraduates who have reached the required advanced level of Greek or Latin language instruction.127 COMPARATIvE LITERATURE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYdepartmental objectives The major provides an ideal intellectual site for students to draw connections across cultures, periods, genres, and disciplines in a rigorous yet individually designed way. Building from the assumption that the study of single texts and cultures is enriched by a knowledge of surrounding texts and cultures, we view literature from a broad and inclusive perspective. We explore the intersections of literature with philosophy, politics, anthro- pology, history, and literary theory; we illuminate crucial comparisons suggested by drama, music, the visual arts, and modern media; and we examine works not ordinarily seen as literary, tracing their effect on cultural representations of gender, race, and class. general Information The guidelines of our program allow students great flexibility in shaping a course of study suited to their own intel- lectual goals. While all majors must take four courses originating in the Department of Comparative Literature, our commitment to a global and interdisciplinary outlook means that the remaining six courses required for the major can be taken in other departments or even, by taking advantage of NYU study away opportunities, on other continents. All students planning to major in comparative literature register with the director of undergraduate studies, who works closely with them to develop a coherent sequence of courses suited to their individual interests. Periodical advising sessions with the director of undergraduate studies and a remarkably low student-faculty ratio help our students make the most of the wide range of possibilities that define the major. A comparative literature major could lead to the advanced study of literature at the graduate level but could just as readily be a strong basis for advanced degrees and/or careers in journalism, publishing, international relations, ProgramfacUl TYchair of the department Professor Lezra director of Undergraduate Studies Assistant Professor v atulescu Professors emeriti Braithwaite, Chioles, Javitch, Reiss University Professor; literature and a fricana Studies DiawaraUniversity Professor; Professor of omparative literature and RonellProfessors Baer, Iampolski, Sanders, Sieburth, Basterra, Dopico, Garcia assistant Professors Bianchi, v aculty Bishop, York, NY 10003-4573 Phone: 212-998-8790DEPARTMENT OF Comparative Literature Comparative literature is an innovative major that encourages students to follow their passion for literature by venturing beyond national and disciplinary boundaries. In the spirit of our times, students delve into literature from all over the world and explore its intersections with other media and disciplines, such as cinema studies, art history, philosophy, politics, anthropology, history, and linguistics. Comparative literature departmental course offerings include classes in world literature and interdisciplinary studies that allow stu- dents to work intensively with a distinguished faculty of scholars in African, African American, Caribbean, Chinese, Classical, European and Anglo American, Latin American, Middle Eastern and Islamic, and Russian and Eastern European literary and cultural studies. At the same time, the major encourages students to take advantage of the rich offerings of courses in other NYU departments and/or study away sites.128 COMPARATIvE LITERATURE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF C OMPARATIvE LITERATURE international law, cultural studies, medicine, philosophy, education, public policy, film and entertainment, and the information industries of computer software and the World Wide Web. declaration of m ajor To take full advantage of the opportunities provided by comparative literature, students are encouraged to declare the major as early in their academic career as possible.

The introductory workshop and summer intensives may be taken only once for credit. All other workshops may be taken up to three times for credit. The minor must be completed with a minimum grade point average of 2.0 (C). No credit toward the creative writing minor is granted for grades of C-minus or lower, although such grades will be computed into the grade point average of the minor, as well as into the overall grade point average. No course to be counted toward the minor may be taken on a pass/fail basis. The program recommends that all creative writing minors contact the undergraduate programs manager in the semester prior to graduation to verify that their minor declaration is on record and that they have fulfilled (or have enrolled in) all of the appropriate courses for the minor. T o declare the minor: Students in the College of Arts and Science may declare a creative writing minor by visit- ing the Program in Creative Writing at the Lillian Vernon Creative Writers House (58 West 10th Street) or by completing the minor declaration form on the program's website. Students in other NYU schools may declare their minors on Albert or as directed by their home schools. Course substitution policy: Students may petition to apply a maximum of one outside course toward the minor, either as the introductory prerequisite (equivalent to CRWRI-UA 815) or as an elective. An outside course is any creative writing course offered outside of the CAS Program in Creative Writing. To petition to substitute an outside course, students must submit the course's description and syllabus (including course read- ings and assignments), as well as a brief note explaining whether they would like to substitute the course for the introductory prerequisite workshop or for one of the minor electives. The program will review the submitted syl-labus to verify course level and determine substitution eligibility. Students are encouraged to petition for course substitution prior to registration, and should submit materials to: Undergraduate Programs Manager NYU Program in Creative Writing Lillian Vernon Creative Writers House 58 West 10th Street, Room B001 New York, NY 10011-8702 creative.writing@nyu.edu If an outside course is approved for substitution, we will count it toward the minor\u2014provided NYU approves the course credit for transfer and the student receives a grade of C or better. Fulfilling minor requirements while studying abroad: Students wishing to begin the creative writing minor while studying abroad at one of the NYU sites should register for Creative Writing (CRWRI-UA 9815) or (if studying abroad in the summer) for one of the 8-point intensives offered in Paris and Florence (CRWRI-UA 9818, 9819, 9828, or 9829). These courses are not considered outside courses and will automatically be counted toward the creative writing minor. All other creative writing courses taken abroad require a petition for substitu- tion and approval by the program. coUrSeS The NYU Program in Creative Writing offers introductory courses in poetry and fiction, as well as upper-level courses that focus on specific elements of formal and experimental poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction.

The first semester covers the major periods of Greek and Roman drama; Japanese classical theatre; medieval drama; theatre of the English, Italian, and Spanish Renaissance; and French neoclassical drama. The second semester begins with English Restoration and 18th-century comedy and continues through romanticism, naturalism, and realism to an examina-tion of antirealism and the major dramatic currents of the 20th century, including postcolonial theatre in Asia, Africa, and Australia. advanced e lectives in d ramatic literature Acting Medieval Literature DRLIT-UA 35 Identical to MEDI-UA 868. 4 points. Presents medieval literature as a set of springboards to performance rather than as a series of \"books\" to be read. In this strongly performance-oriented course, students approach this \"literature\" as works that were acted out, sung, and narrated from memory as part of a storytelling tradition. Students are invited to draw on their dramatic and musical skills and interests, and stage medieval works. For their final project, students participate in staging and putting on a play, perform a substantial piece of narrative poetry, sing or play a body of medieval songs, or a similar endeavor. Naturalism DRLIT-UA 113 Identical to THEA-UA 705. 4 points. A study of the origins and development of the most influential dramatic movements of the 20th century.

A study of the various formal movements that developed in reaction to realism. After examining several 19th-century antecedents, including B\u00fcchner, we study the most important experimental styles of each successive era: symbolism, expressionism, surrealism, epic theatre, the theatre of the absurd, and postmodernism. Authors covered include Maeterlinck, Kaiser, Pirandello, Lorca, Beckett, Genet, Bond, Handke, Muller, and Benmussa. The philosophical context is explored through read- ing Freud, Marx, Sartre, and Derrida; theoretical readings include essays by Artaud and Brecht. While the class focus is on the many styles that evolved in the 20th-century search for a more expressive form, some attention is given to how this search still very much influences theatre artists today. Theory of Drama DRLIT-UA 130 Identical to ENGL-UA 130. 4 points.

Theories are examined through theoretical essays and representative plays. Gay and Lesbian Theatre DRLIT-UA 137 Identical to THEA-UA 624. 4 points. A survey of contemporary lesbian and gay plays from The Boys in the Band to Angels in America. The goal is to familiarize students with lesbian and gay plays written since 1968 as a discrete body of work within the field of contemporary theatre. The course focuses on plays and playwrights that have had a significant impact in the representation of homosexual life onstage. In addition, students consider the historical, political, and cultural developments from which gay theatre emerged and, through independent research projects, examine the communities that emerged in the process of creating gay theatre. Popular Performance DRLIT-UA 138 Identical to THEA-UA 621. 4 points. A reevaluation of a wide variety of European and American forms that, beginning in the 16th century, were separated from \"high culture\" theatre. These include fairground circus, pantomime, minstrel shows, vaudeville, and carnival, puppet, and mask theatre. Exploration of what popular performance does dif- ferently than \"high culture\" theatre, how it does so, and to whom it addresses itself. A study of character- istic forms and techniques of popular performance, the connection between Western and non-Western forms, and the central role of popular performance in 20th-century theatre. T opics in Italian Culture: Futurism in Italy DRLIT-UA 174 Identical to ITAL-UA 173. 4 points. Arguably the first avant-garde movement of the 20th century, futurism saw itself as a violent explosion that would drastically redefine not only the artistic land-scape but reality as a whole. The futurists produced a theoretical program to overhaul literature, painting, theatre, architecture, music, politics, and even cooking. The approach of the movement's 100th birthday is an opportunity to assess its relevance for our understand-ing of modernity. This is an interdisciplinary course. Tragedy DRLIT-UA 200 Identical to ENGL-UA 720, COLIT-UA 110. 4 points. Historical and critical study of the idea and practice of tragedy from Greek times to the present.

Comedies of Greece and Rome DRLIT-UA 211 Identical to CLASS-UA 144. 4 points. Study of early comedy, its form, content, and social and historical background. Covers the Old Comedy of fifth-century Athens through the Attic New Comedy and Roman comedy.

Restoration and 18thCentury Drama DRLIT-UA 235 4 points. The Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 brought an end to a 20-year period of civil war and military rule in England. As a postwar culture, Restoration England was a divided society, but also a 145 DRAMATIC LITERATURE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMAJOR/MINOR IN DRAMATIC LITERATURE society ripe for social change and cultural innovation. The London public theatres in this period, reopened after twenty years of prohibition, can be variously characterized as progressive vanguard and conserva-tive rearguard, both an open forum for new ideas and subversive critique of the dominant culture, and a bastion of aristocratic privilege and state hege-mony. This course considers the cultural activity of the Restoration public theatres from both outlooks. Embracing the divided nature of the art and culture of this period, the readings are organized into a series of unlikely pairings: urban comedies and classical tragedies, closet dramas and box-office successes, propaganda pieces and broad satires, puritan reform and libertine excess. Playwrights include Dryden, Davenant, Etherege, Wycherley, Rochester, Centlivre, Shadwell, Otway, Feminism and Theatre DRLIT-UA 240 Identical to THEA-UA 623. 4 points.

This course (different each time) explores one or more distinctive theatrical genres, such as tragedy, comedy, melodrama, satire, or farce, or plays of distinctive theatrical types, such as theatre of the absurd, the documentary play, or theatre of witness. Since theatrical genres and theatrical types come into being because playwrights respond to historical necessity by visualizing specific worldviews, the course presents a study of the role and function of the theatre within societies, as a response to histori- cal, psychological, and spiritual forces. Modern U.S. Drama DRLIT-UA 253 Identical to ENGL-UA 650, THEA-UA 608. 4 points. A study of drama and theatre in the United States since 1900, including Eugene O'Neill, Susan Glaspell, Sophie T readwell, Elmer Rice, Clifford Odets and the Group Theatre, Thorton Wilder, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Edward Albee, Emily Mann, Sam Shepard, David Mamet, Maria Irene Fornes, Adrienne Kennedy, August Wilson, Lorraine Hansberry, David Henry Hwang, David Rabe, Luis Valdez, and Tony Kushner. We explore these writers and their texts as they relate to the page, to the stage, and to U.S. culture at large. We discuss how these writers (and others) represent themselves and notions of \"American-ness\" in their dramatic works. We include important works from the margins, as well as those that represent the mainstream. Does modern U.S. drama lead or follow U.S. culture? Does it tend to be a design for living or a reflection of custom? We also explore the role of gender in culture as demonstrated in these works. Does U.S. drama question the status quo or reinforce it? These and other interrogations inform our readings, discussions, and written assignments. Major Playwrights DRLIT-UA 254 Identical to ENGL-UA 652, THEA-UA 618. 4 points. This course (different each time) focuses on two or three related major playwrights, for example, Brecht and Shaw, Chekhov and Williams, Churchill and Bond, Beckett and Pinter, Strindberg and O'Neill.

Wolfe, Ntozake Shange, August Wilson, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Anna Deavere Smith. The sociohistorical context of each author is also briefly explored. Asian American Theatre DRLIT-UA 256 Identical to THEA-UA 606. 4 points. Acts as both an introduction to the genre of Asian American theatre and an interrogation into how this genre has been constituted. Through a combination of play analysis and historical discussion\u2014starting with Frank Chen's The Chickencoop Chinaman, the first Asian American play produced in a mainstream venue\u2014the class looks at the ways Asian American drama and performance intersect with a burgeon- ing Asian American consciousness. We review the construction of Asian American history through such plays as Genny Lim's Paper Angels and more recent works such as Chay Yew's A Language of Their Own. We also read theoretical and historical texts that provide the basis for a critical examination of the issues surrounding Asian American theatre. Orientalism, media representation, and theories of genealogy inform our discussion. Political Theatre DRLIT-UA 258 Identical to THEA-UA 622. 4 points. Major forms, plays, and theories of socially engaged theatre exemplifying performance as a site of resistance, social critique, and utopianism. While the course provides an examination of the historical development of political theatre, focus may vary semester to semester, from an examination of activist forms including agit-prop, pageantry, epic theatre, documentary, street theatre, and women's performance art, to major theoretical perspec- tives and their practical translations since Brecht, including Boal and feminist and queer theory, to plays and productions by the Blue Blouse, Clifford Odets, Bertolt Brecht, the Living Theatre, Bread and Puppet, El Campesino, and others. Comparative Study: 20thCentury Drama DRLIT-UA 261 4 points. The two decades or so following World War II were a particularly exciting period in the history of drama in Europe and America. This course focuses on five playwrights\u2014Samuel Beckett, Tennessee Williams, Jean Genet, Adrienne Kennedy, and Peter Weiss\u2014whose engagements with postwar history and politics shaped the form and content of their works for the stage. Questions include modes of represent-ing historical experience, theatre and historical forms of spectatorship, and challenges to genre. The pre- sumption is that we cannot know in advance what it means to describe a play as \"political.\" Readings include Beckett's Waiting for Godot, Endgame, and selected shorter plays; Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire and Orpheus Descending; Balcony, The Blacks, and The Screens; Kennedy's Funnyhouse of a Negro, The Owl Answers, and A Movie Star Has to Star in Black and White; and Weiss's Marat/Sade and The Investigation. 17thCentury Theatre DRLIT-UA 290 4 points. Explores plays written by Shakespeare's collabora- tors, rivals, and followers\u2014English drama in the age of Shakespeare written by playwrights other than Shakespeare. These are plays about world- conquering heroes, murderous conspirators, riotous good-fellows, and star-crossed lovers; they are also about the fast-changing culture of early modern England, dealing with new patterns of urban life, emergent notions of republican politics and personal liberty, the discovery of new worlds and new sci- ences, and the increasing pressures of European war, revolution, and civil war. A different play each week. Plays by Beaumont, Brome, Dekker, Fletcher, Ford, Jonson, Marlowe, Massinger, Middleton, Milton, Shirley, and Webster. Theatre of Latin America DRLIT-UA 293 Identical to THEA-UA 748. 4 points. An introduction to the history, theories, and prac-tices of Latin American drama, focusing on the 20th century.

Through the plays of leading dramatists\u2014including Jorge D\u00edaz, 147 DRAMATIC LITERATURE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMAJOR/MINOR IN DRAMATIC LITERATURE Egon Wolff, and Sergio Vodanovic (Chile); T significance of modernist and postmodernist dra- matic forms in cultures where industrial modernity is an insecure social context. We study the wealth of oppositional theatre in Latin America\u2014exemplified by Augusto Boal's \"theatre of the oppressed\"\u2014in relation to the historical use (or abuse) of theatrical spectacle as a political means to control peoples, from the early Spanish conquerors to recent authoritarian state leaders. We read postcolonial Latin American theories of culture and art, such as hybridity, transculturation, Brazil's modernist and anticolonial antropofag\u00eda, and the \"aesthetics of hunger,\" drawing on the work of Fernando Ortiz, Angel Rama, and N\u00e9stor Garc\u00eda Canclini, among others.

Contemporary European Theatre DRLIT-UA 609 4 points. The European theatre scene of the last two decades has witnessed the emergence of a new wave of dramatists who share a dark, desperate, depressive, yet humorous Weltanschauung and style. They have encountered controversy and shock in reception but could not be ignored, gradually gaining a signifi- cant place in recent theatre history. We study and discuss work by Sarah Kane, Mark Ravenhill, Havel, Mrozek, et al.148 DRAMATIC LITERATURE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMAJOR/MINOR IN DRAMATIC LITERATURE Irish Dramatists DRLIT-UA 700 Identical to THEA-UA 603, IRISH-UA 700. 4 points.

Playwrights covered include John Millington Synge, Sean O'Casey, Samuel Beckett, Brendan Behan, Brian Friel, Tom Murphy, Frank McGuinness, and Anne Devlin. Issues of Irish identity, history, and postcoloniality are engaged alongside an apprecia- tion of the emotional texture, poetic achievements, and theatrical innovations that characterize this body of dramatic work. Gender and Performance in the Italian Theatre DRLIT-UA 720 Identical to ITAL-UA 720. 4 points. Examines plays that explicitly highlight and question the status and performance of gender, as well as selections from political treatises, books of manners, and historiography of the early modern period (1350-1700). Topics such as cross-dressing, the emergence of the actress and commedia dell'arte troupes, the dynamics of spectatorship, the develop- ment of perspective in painting and theatre, and court power relations are considered, as well as the \"revisions\" that women playwrights and writers made to a largely male-dominated canon. 20thCentury Drama DRLIT-UA 730 4 points T ransportable Drama: Stock character types, dramatic figures, and archetypal plots are to a certain extent independent and transportable terms that appear and reappear in multiple play texts, versions of those texts, and in diverse media. Beyond that, the experience of what we call \"drama\" is not limited to play texts and their presentation; it is present in fiction, news, film, television, the visual and electronic arts, and advertising. In this course, we explore how the dramatic impulse of several plots, figures, and characters is expressed in play texts and other media across several historical periods. For example, we may choose to look at Zola's novel and play of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin, followed by Marcel Carn\u00e9's 20th-century film adaptation. Or, we might examine one or more of the historical Don Juan plays in combination with the Byron poem, the Mozart opera, and/or a modern film treatment. Similarly, Shakespearean texts have been widely adapted to the present day, not only in theatrical spin-offs and films, but also through renderings by visual artists. A play based upon a news event, such as T readwell's Machinal, may be examined in light of the original reportage and public records. By looking at clusters of related works in tandem, rather than as freestanding objects of study, we will gain a greater understanding of drama as a transportable art form and of adaptation in both its practical and theoreti- cal aspects.

This course (different every time) introduces students to the specific choices that a director must make to transform the \"printed word\" into a visual auditory experience. For example, point of view becomes a challenge of camera shots; a described room becomes a matter of lighting, color, and sound; and the sense of time becomes a product of editing, rhythm, music, and splicing. Throughout the course, we pit a director's view against an author's view to examine how the same story may express different agendas, depending on the render-ing. Works may include Paul Schrader's T axi Driver (Scorsese), Virginia Woolf's Orlando (Potter), and Thomas Hardy's T ess (Polanski). Creative exercises required along with three five-page papers.

The intern's duties on-site should involve some substantive aspect of work in drama. The student is expected to fulfill the obligation of the internship itself, and a written evaluation is solicited from the outside sponsor at the end. The grade for the course is based on a final project submitted to a faculty director with whom the student has been meeting regularly over the semester to discuss the progress of the internship. Independent Study DRLIT-UA 997, 998 Prerequisite: permission of the director of undergraduate studies. May not duplicate the content of a regularly offered course. Intended for qualified upper-class majors or minors in this depart- ment, but may not be used to fulfill the minimum requirements of either the major or the minor. 2 or 4 points per term. Requires a paper of considerable length that should embody the results of a semester's reading, thinking, and frequent conferences with the student's director. The paper should show the student's ability to investigate, collect, and evaluate his or her material, finally drawing conclusions that are discussed in a sound and well-written argument. In the 2-point course, the student is held to the same high standard as is the student who is working for 4 points, but the investigation and the paper are of proportionate length. honors Seminar The subject of the Honors Seminar changes each year and is decided on by the faculty member teaching the seminar. The seminar is a small class (limited to 12) that ideally prepares students for the senior thesis; the primary focus is on research and the application of critical methodologies. Each year, one of the Department of English Junior Honors Seminars is also designated as the drama studies Honors Seminar, with at least a partial focus on drama. Drama studies majors normally take this seminar to complete the seminar require-ment. (English majors in honors may also take this designated seminar if they choose to, subject to the 12-student limit.) Dramatic literature majors in honors may also satisfy the seminar requirement by taking, with the instructor's permission, the Honors Seminar in the undergraduate Department of Drama at Tisch School of the Arts. Admission to the drama studies honors program is competitive. The Honors Seminars are limited to 12 students. The minimum GPA for admission to any College of Arts and Science honors program is 3.65 or better (both overall and in the major). In addition, students must have completed the two core courses History of Drama and Theatre I and II (DRLIT-UA 110 and 111) by the end of the semester in which they apply for the honors track.151 EAST A SIAN S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYmajor The major in the Department of East Asian Studies (EAS) consists of nine 4-point courses (36 points).

Notes (applying to both major tracks): Courses must have an East Asian Studies course number (EAST-UA) to count toward the EAS major. An upper limit of 16 points can be transferred from outside NYU and applied to the major. This includes non-NYU study abroad credits, as well as credits from other universities in the United States. T ransfer students from other universities should meet with the director of undergraduate studies (DUS) to discuss the number of points they can transfer from their previous institution toward the major. Cantonese, Vietnamese, and Tibetan languages may not be counted toward either major or minor requirements. NYU in Shanghai and Beijing civilization courses are counted toward the major only contingently. Students must contact the DUS to discuss the courses before or during the process of applying. The director gives final approval for major points after the course has been successfully completed and the student's work is reviewed. Courses listed as \"electives\" on the EAS departmental website course listings do not count toward the major; Freshman Honors Seminars may count toward the major, although the specific seminar must be approved by the DUS. No double-counting of courses will be permitted. Courses to be counted toward the EAS major must be exclusive to the EAS major, whether or not they are cross-listed with another department. minor The minor consists of 16 points.

The aim of this introductory course is to develop a comparative understanding of the national indepen- dence movements in China, India, and Vietnam, as well as the context within which they unfolded, in the period 1885-1962. The course will introduce students to some of the figures in modern Asian history who played a major role in the transition of India and Vietnam from colonial subordination to independent nationhood and of China from its semi-colonial status to liberation. The principal figures whose writings are studied and compared are Mohandas Gandhi, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh in order to develop a third angle of comparison. The course gives due attention to other relevant figures, such as Gokhale, Tilak, Jinnah, and Nehru in the case of India; Li Hongzhang, Sun Yatsen, Chen Duxiu, La Dazhao, and Chiang Kai-shek in the case of China; and Phan Boi Chau in the case of Vietnam. Seminar: Cold War in Asia EAST-UA 552 Offered every year. 4 points. Focuses on U.S. foreign policy in Asia since 1945. The ways U.S. global interests and concerns sought to shape Asian realities (and were shaped in turn by them) are the touchstone for examining the Cold War in Asia. We examine the following topics: the occupation of Japan and early U.S. global economic visions; the U.S. and the Chinese revolution before the Korean War; the Korean War and the isolation of China; the Vietnam War and the Kennedy/Johnson years; Nixon's global geopolitical vision and his policies towards Vietnam, China, and Japan; Carter and the meaning of human rights diplomacy in Asia; Reagan and the Asian issues involved in an intensi- fied Cold War against Russia; George H. W. Bush and Asia's place in \"a New World Order\"; and finally, the Clinton and George W. Bush years. Throughout the course, we examine key declassified National Security documents, interpreting their meaning and 158 EAST A SIAN S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF EAST A SIAN S TUDIES language, while carefully assessing the arguments used to justify American policy. Cultures of National Division: The Koreas and Others EAST-UA 567 4 points. Asks how the fact of national division, as the founding moment of the postwar Korean states, has affected the way that national life is lived and nar- rated. It examines the myriad ways in which division has been formulated in literature, film, historiogra- phy, and popular discourse. Topics covered include gendered tropes of division, imagined reunifications, and division in the global culture industry. The main focus is on the two Koreas, but also looks compara- tively and historically at the experiences of East/West Germany and India/Pakistan. History of Modern Korea EAST-UA 609 Offered periodically. 4 points. Starting in the late 19th century, and proceeding through the colonial period (1910-45), national partition (1945), the Korean War (1950-52), and the establishment of a \"division system,\" we look at how various writers wrote about and mobilized around issues of national sovereignty, class and gender, and democracy, issues that many saw as structurally linked. Reading primary and secondary sources on modern Korean history, we also locate the issues being addressed within a broader, East Asian/global context, to better understand how and to what extent texts, practices, and ways of seeing and remembering were shaped by and were reactions to colonialism, the Korean War, the Cold War, and late capitalism. Korean Modernism EAST-UA 610 4 points. Considers the problem of colonial modernism through a close reading of literary and other cultural texts from early 20th-century Korea. Asks what it means to enter modernity under colonial rule by questioning the relationship among imperialism, writing, and subjectivity in particular. Through intensive reading of works from 1920s and 1930s Korea, students obtain an idea of the parameters of modern Korean literature and of the main issues involved in the discussion of modernity in Korea. 20thCentury Korean Literature in Translation EAST-UA 611 4 points.

Japanese Cinema EAST-UA 613 Offered every year. 4 points. Examines key theoretical and methodological issues in the study of Japanese cinema, such as the connec- tions between Japanese films and cultural traditions, the effect of Americanization and modernization, the formation of national identity and specificity, and the \"otherness\" of Japanese cinematic form. Japanese Cinema in the International Context EAST-UA 614 Yoshimoto. 4 points. Studies Japanese cinema from a comparative perspec- tive, examining the interactions between Japanese and non-Japanese film authors. Cross-cultural interactions, translations, and creative \"misunder- standings\" are analyzed by comparing films from a variety of national cinemas, historical periods, and genres. Some directors studied are Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Takeshi Kitano, Kenji Tarantino, the Wachowski brothers, Hou Hsiao-hsien, and John Ford. Aesthetics and Politics of Vision in Premodern Japan EAST-UA 615 Looser. 4 points. Offers a broad cultural history of Japan, roughly from the eighth century through the mid-19th. The focus is on visual regimes\u2014differing conventions and practices of seeing\u2014and on changing roles for what is now thought of as aesthetics; these visual regimes are then taken as a means of understanding fundamental transformations in structures of power, community, and subjectivity. Draws on a range of materials, from literature to landscape gardens, visual arts, architecture, and technologies, as well as on a diversity of disciplinary perspectives. New Japanese Cinema EAST-UA 616 Yoshimoto. 4 points. Focuses on Japanese cinema from 1989 to the present, or the so-called \"new Japanese cinema.\" Major questions considered include why Japanese cinema has succeeded in reinventing itself after 20 years of hiatus; how the resurgence of genres such as yakuza movies and J-horror has contributed to the reinvention; who are some of the major players of the new cinema; what specific roles socioeconomic conditions have played in the radical transforma- tion of Japanese cinema; and how globalization is 159 EAST A SIAN S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF EAST A SIAN S TUDIES fundamentally affecting the production, distribu- tion, and consumption of films in Japan now. Students closely watch and analyze films by Takeshi Kitano, and other directors. Approaches to Chinese Cinema EAST-UA 618 Button. 4 points. The development of the cinema in 20th-century China is inextricably linked to the emergence of the modern Chinese nation-state. As early as the 1920s, film became a vital and influential site of cultural production. This course emphasizes the thematic, cultural, and historical content of films, as well as formal issues of filmmaking techniques. All periods of Chinese film are explored, from the earliest Chinese cinema to contemporary fifth- and sixth- generation film, Hong Kong, and contemporary transnational Chinese cinema. Mass Culture: Japan EAST-UA 707 Looser. 4 points. Looks at transformations in the basic terms and conditions of mass culture in Japan, largely from the early 20th century to life in Japan today. It includes considerations of differing theoretical positions on mass culture, everyday life, and modernity in Japan. Materials taken up in the course include examples from cinema, animation, literature, and theatre, as well as new media and the fine arts. Although the focus is on Japan, a comparative perspective with the rest of Asia and with the West is retained throughout. Japanese Animation and New Media EAST-UA 708 Looser. 4 points. Looks at the terms and conditions of Japanese animation (primarily, though not exclusively, anime) as, in many ways, a new and unique mode of expres- sion. Examines the ways in which anime might, or might not, shift earlier modes of expression (both lit- erary and animated): the prevalence of mythology in animation and the tension between mythology and ideology; the importance of genre; and the impact of \"old\" and \"new\" media on narrative structure and reception. Implications of these conditions for think-ing about \"Japanese\" culture are also considered. Anime EAST-UA 709 Yoshimoto. 4 points. Introduces students to the rich world of Japanese animation or anime, its form and style, history, popular genres and themes, major authors, and fan culture. Explores the popularity of anime in relation to the cultural conditions of contemporary Japan and that of the world. T opics in Japanese Literature EAST-UA 719 4 points. Topics vary semester by semester. Modern Japanese Literature in Translation II EAST-UA 721 4 points. Exposes students to some of the most provocative and entertaining novels written in Japanese since the end of the Second World War. Students see how the collapse of totalizing ideologies brought by Japan's defeat led to an extremely fertile, yet somewhat atomized, literary landscape. In this new postwar terrain, it became increasingly difficult to think of literature in terms of \"schools\" or \"influences,\" as questions of cultural and individual identity became harder and harder to answer in a world of material prosperity and cultural hybridization. Readings in Chinese Philosophy and Culture EAST-UA 722 Formerly Introduction to the Civilization of Imperial China. Roberts. 4 points. Covers Chinese thought during the period ca. 500 B.C.E. to 280 C.E., starting from the era of Confucius (d. 479 B.C.E.) down to the unification of the realm in 206 B.C.E., the pre-imperial period that is also known as the warring states. During this time the main schools of Chinese philosophy (except Buddhism) were established. For this portion of the course, we read seven original works in translation. We begin with the Analects to establish the key elements of Confucius' ethical and political philosophy and to explore the implications of his main philosophical terms. We then proceed to examine his critics and followers: the utilitarian Mozi, the metaphysicians Laozi and Zhuangzi, and the legalist Han Feizi are the critics. Mencius elaborates the thought of Confucius, and Xunzi is both a follower and a critic. This brings us to the transition (ca. 200 B.C.E.) from the pre-imperial to the imperial periods. The course ends with two historical readings: Sima Qian's Record of the Historian (excerpts) and the novel The Three Kingdoms. The former addresses the moment of transition and the establishment of the Qin and Han dynasties; the latter chronicles the fall of the Han dynasty some four centuries later in 220 C.E. and the reconstitution of a unified realm in 280 C.E. Historical Epics of China and Japan EAST-UA 726 Roberts. 4 points. Mainly, a comparative study of four major narratives. We compare two military epics of China and Japan, 160 EAST A SIAN S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF EAST A SIAN S TUDIES The Three Kingdoms and The T ale of the Heike; and then two romantic epics, The T ale of Genji and The Dream of Red Mansions. These four readings (of which The T ale of Genji alone was written by a woman) are thematically central to their respective cultures. The military epics raise crucial questions about the nature of dynastic rule and the qualifications for kingship, about the relationship of the ruling dynasty to the territory and the people that it rules, and about how diplomatic and military strategies interact. The romantic epics deal with the intrigues of the royal court and the noble elite, the observations and roles of the female characters, and the problem of generational continuity. The course begins with two short readings: the Vietnamese national classic, T ale of Kieu, which is based on Chinese works, and the Chinese fantasy travelogue Monkey (abridged). Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism play a large role in these complex narratives, and due attention is given to how the ideals and doctrines of these three ways of thinking inform the motives and the fates of the characters and the larger design of the authors. T opics in East Asian Classics EAST-UA 728 Offered every two years. 4 points. Topics vary semester by semester. Traditional Drama of China & Japan EAST-UA 729 Roberts. 4 points. Compares a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatri-cal traditions. Attention is given to the historical background of each work and to the social condi- tions and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also considered. Where possible and appropriate, scenes or entire plays are screened for the class or assigned for viewing. 20thCentury Chinese Literature in Translation EAST-UA 731 Offered every year. 4 points. Explores the changing trends in literary writing and how it relates to the social and historical contexts of the period. Students study the literature to reflect on the culture and self-understanding of modern China. Japan Through Its Literature EAST-UA 734 No knowledge of Japanese required. Roberts. 4 points. Introduces undergraduate students to approximately 10 major Japanese literary works, starting with the 11th-century T ale of Genji, which became a national classic. We go on to read the Zen diary Essays in Idleness, texts of Noh plays, the Chushingura, and plays of Chikamatsu. In the second half of the course, we read a series of modern novels starting with Ukigumo (Japan's first modern novel), followed by The Broken Commandment, Sound of the Mountain, and The Waiting Years. Brief response papers to each reading are required, in addition to exams and a longer paper. Vietnam: Its History EAST-UA 737 Identical to HIST-UA 737. Offered every year. 4 points. Focuses on the American War in Vietnam\u2014its origins, its development, and the ways it was fought. It examines how and why American geopolitical and military strategies led to, and shaped, the course of the war. Historical accounts are regularly supplemented with a reading of parts of the Pentagon Papers and an oral history of those involved in the Vietnam War as told from all sides.The course begins by examin-ing Vietnamese cultural and national identity and the impact of French colonialism. We then examine in greater detail the following topics: the war from 1946-54 between the French and the Viet Minh; the early American OSS links with Ho Chi Minh and the reasons for the T ruman administration's deepen- ing commitments to the French; the policies of the Eisenhower administration\u2014from Dien Bien Phu and the Geneva Conference in 1954 to the decision to back Ngo Dien Diem; the deepening commit-ment of the Kennedy administration; the escalating war of the Johnson years; and the end of the war under Nixon and Ford. We conclude by discussing the legacies of the war and interpretations of them. United States in Korea, 1945-Present EAST-UA 741 4 points. Undertakes an examination of both modern Korea and of the U.S. role in Korea. Those who see South Korea as an American success story assume that the United States created and maintained the conditions for South Korea's security, democracy, and economic prosperity. Others point out that the United States bears considerable responsibility for the partitioning of Korea after 1945, creating the conditions for the Korean War and four decades of authoritarian rule. By examining the histories of resistance and collaboration during the Japanese colonial period, revolutionary movements that preceded the Korean War, and South Korean nationalism and the struggle for democracy, this course provides a deeper understanding of both modern Korean history and the history and culture of American intervention in Korea/East Asia.161 EAST A SIAN S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF EAST A SIAN S TUDIES Introduction to Buddhism EAST-UA 832 Identical to RELST-UA 832. 4 points.

If a student fails a course required for the major, the course must be retaken in the department; a course taken outside the University will not be allowed to substitute for a failed course. No course for the major may be taken pass/fail. A grade of C or better is required for a course to be counted toward the major in economics, as well as to satisfy the mathematics prerequisites. Students are strongly urged to pay close attention to the prerequisites for each course. Students who do not meet the minimum C requirement in the prerequisite courses will be de-enrolled at the beginning of each semester. A grade of P , I, or W does not count as satisfying the minimum grade requirement.ProgramfacUl TYchairman of the department Professor Lizzeri director of Undergraduate Studies Professor GaleDEPARTMENT OF Economics www.econ.as.nyu.edu 19 West Fourth Street, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10012-1119 Phone: 212-998-8900 Professor emeritus kirzner Paulette goddard Professor of Political e conomy Benhabib henry and lucy moses Professor of economics Gertler Jay gould Professor of economics NadiriWilliam r.

Lieberman, Storchmannclinical associate Professor Paizisclinical assistant Professor Thapar global distinguished Professor LjungqvistThe Department of Economics prepares students to understand individual and group decision making, the structure of markets and economies, and the relationship between regions within the global economy. The faculty at New York University is particularly strong in economic theory, macroeconomics, international economics, and economic growth and development. Although the department is large, its students enjoy an excellent student-faculty rapport. Many of the faculty members are associated with distinguished research institutions. By being able to study with faculty who are actively engaged in research, students learn not only about the fundamentals of economic theory but also how such theory is utilized. They have the opportunity to conduct research on their own. Honors students are required to write an honors thesis under direct faculty supervision. Students majoring in economics have many options open to them after graduation. The major prepares them for graduate school in economics, business management, or public administration. Preprofessional students will find that an economics major not only fosters the discipline medical or law school demands, but provides a solid foundation for these and other careers. Employers and professional schools appreciate the skills acquired by economics students and hire economics majors because they can think quantitatively, qualitatively, and analytically. Studying economics at New York University is especially rewarding because of the urban environment. Students often find career opportunities on Wall Street, at the United Nations, or in various corporate, financial, governmental, agency, and nonprofit institutional settings.163 ECONOMICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS T ransfer students should note that normally the only courses that will be accepted toward the major in econom- ics are courses that have been passed with a grade of C or better at universities with an intensive four-year program. While AP credit in economics with a grade of 5 is acceptable, it does not reduce the total number of courses required for the major or minor. Note that AP credit in statistics is not acceptable for economics majors, and that AP credit does not apply to the theory concentration course Introduction to Economic Analysis (ECON-UA 5). The Economics Department requires that all economics majors take an exit exam before they graduate. No preparation is necessary for the exam, and the grade has no impact on a student's academic record. The exam takes only one hour. Students are contacted by the department in their senior year with logistical details. The results will be used by the department to evaluate the major. description of the Two c oncentrations Policy Concentration The policy concentration is intended for the student who is primarily interested in applying economic analysis to an understanding of economic problems and policies. The introductory and intermediate courses provide the student with a solid foundation of economic theory with an emphasis on economic applications. The elective courses allow students to focus on specific problems and topics that match their interests and career plans. The policy concentration corresponds most closely to the economics major that is offered by other leading colleges and universities. Mathematics is used to build an understanding of economic theory. This concentra- tion is particularly well suited for students planning careers in law, public policy, business, or any other field in which a thorough understanding of the economic way of thinking would be beneficial. However, students in the policy concentration can also pursue a Ph.D. in economics or finance if they supplement their course work with additional courses in mathematics. Beginning Fall 2012, new rules for the policy concentration in the economics major will apply. Students who entered NYU prior to Fall 2012 will be grandfathered under the old rules. Former Requirements (only applicable for students who entered prior to Fall 2012) At least 42 points (10 courses) are to be taken in the Department of Economics. Six core courses: Economic Principles I (ECON-UA 1), Economic Principles II (ECON-UA 2), Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10), Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12), the 6-point Statistics (ECON-UA 18), and International Economics (ECON-UA 238), plus four electives. Of these four electives, at least two must be numbered ECON-UA 300-399. A possible sequence of courses consists of the following: by the end of sophomore year, Economic Principles I (ECON-UA 1), Economic Principles II (ECON-UA 2), and Statistics (ECON-UA 18); by the end of junior year, Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10), Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12), and International Economics (ECON-UA 238); by senior year, four electives. Note: Students considering honors in the major should speak to an economics adviser as soon as possible. Statistics is to be taken as early as possible. Senior-level courses (300 level and above) presume a knowledge of statistics. Students are strongly advised to pay close attention to the prerequisites for each course, as they will be strictly enforced. Students should be aware that Algebra and Calculus (MATH-UA 9), or its equivalent, is required for the principles classes, Economic Principles I (ECON-UA 1) and Economic Principles II (ECON-UA 2). Students intending to major in economics must have a strong working knowledge of algebra and introductory calculus. Furthermore, Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) is the prerequisite for both Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) and Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12). A grade of C or better is needed to pass both the economics and the mathematics requirements. Both Economic Principles I (ECON-UA 1) and Economic Principles II (ECON-UA 2) are required for Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12). Requirements Beginning Fall 2012 (only applicable for students who enter Fall 2012 or later) At least 40 points (10 courses) are to be taken in the Department of Economics for the policy concentration. Seven core courses are required: Economic Principles I (ECON-UA 1), Economic Principles II (ECON-UA 2), Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10), Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12), Statistics (ECON-UA 18), International Economics (ECON-UA 238), and Topics in Econometrics (ECON-UA 380). 164 ECONOMICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS Majors must also take three electives in the department. Of these three electives, at most one can be numbered ECON-UA 200-299 and at least two must be numbered ECON-UA 300-399. In addition, policy concentration students are required to take Mathematics for Economics I and Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 211, 212). These two mathematics courses are designed especially for economics majors and must be taken at NYU by all economics policy majors. We strongly recommend that students take Economic Principles II (ECON-UA 2) and Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) in the same semes-ter to obtain the maximum benefit from these courses. Note that Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) is a prerequisite for Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 212). Students are strongly advised to pay close attention to the prerequisites for each course, as they will be strictly enforced. Students should be aware that Algebra and Calculus (MATH-UA 9), or its equivalent, is required for both Economic Principles I (ECON-UA 1) and Economic Principles II (ECON-UA 2). Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 212) is the prerequisite for the two intermediate courses, Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) and Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12). A grade of C or better is needed to pass both the economics and the mathematics requirements. Economic Principles I (ECON-UA 1), Economic Principles II (ECON-UA 2), Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211), and Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 212) are all required for Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10). Intermediate Microeconomics is the prerequisite for Intermediate (ECON-UA 12). Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10), Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12), and Statistics (ECON-UA 18) are not open to seniors. Given the sequential nature of the major, students are strongly advised to begin the major as early as possible. Ideally, six full semesters are required to complete the major. It is impos-sible for students to complete the economics major in fewer than five semesters. Theory Concentration The theory concentration is intended for the student who wishes to begin the formal study of economic reason- ing with an emphasis on mastering the analytical tools. This concentration relies on a higher level of abstraction and focuses on techniques of economic analysis rather than on the understanding of specific economic problems or institutions. It is particularly well suited for students who intend to pursue a Ph.D. degree in economics or higher degrees in quantitative fields such as finance. The first-year core courses in the theory concentration will NOT be offered in the 2012-13 academic year. Please refer to the online course bulletin for updated information. At least 40 points (10 courses) are to be taken in the Department of Economics: Introduction to Economic Analysis (ECON-UA 5), Mathematics for Economists (ECON-UA 6), Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20), Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11), Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13), and Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266), plus four economics electives. At least two of these electives must be courses numbered ECON-UA 300-399 and designated as theory classes. Students are strongly advised to pay close attention to the prerequisites for each course, as they will be strictly enforced. Furthermore, students must complete Calculus I (MATH-UA 121), Calculus II (MATH-UA 122), and Calculus III (MATH-UA 123). These calculus courses should be completed before or during the student's first year in the program. A grade of C or better is needed to pass both the economics and the mathematics requirements. A typical sequence of courses consists of the following: by sophomore year, Introduction to Economic Analysis (ECON-UA 5), Mathematics for Economists (ECON-UA 6), and Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20); by junior year, Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11), Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13), Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266), and one elective; by senior year, three electives. Changing Concentrations Students with permission from the director of undergraduate studies may change from the policy concentration to the theory concentration, or vice versa; however, certain rules apply. In either case, no course may be taken for which the student does not have the appropriate prerequisites; this includes the mathematics prerequisites.165 ECONOMICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS T ransferring between concentrations after students have completed any of the intermediate courses is very difficult, more so in going from the policy to the theory concentration. Students who are unsure about which concentration to take should seek departmental advice before beginning their major. For those switching into the theory concentration from policy, Economic Principles I (ECON-UA 1) or Economic Principles II (ECON-UA 2) can be substituted for a 200-level elective. For those switching from theory to policy, Introduction to Economic Analysis (ECON-UA 5) may substitute for Economic Principles II (ECON-UA 2). Joint m ajor in e conomics and m athematics A joint major (eighteen courses/72 points) is offered by the Departments of Economics and Mathematics. In the economics department, joint majors with mathematics may only take the theory concentration. Nine courses must be taken from each department. The economics requirements (nine courses/36 points) are as follows: Introduction to Economic Analysis (ECON-UA 5) Mathematics for Economists (ECON-UA 6) Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11) Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13) Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20) Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266) Plus any three economics elective courses, at least two of which must be theory electives numbered ECON-UA 300-399. Of the nine mathematics courses (36 points), six are required: Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) Calculus III (MATH-UA 123) Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140) Analysis I (MATH-UA 325) Analysis II (MATH-UA 326) Three additional courses must be completed from the following choices (see Mathematics in this Bulletin for course titles and descriptions): MATH-UA 141, MATH-UA 282, MATH-UA 343, MATH-UA 344, or MATH-UA 363. Interested students should consult with the director of undergraduate studies in both departments for additional information. Joint m ajor in e conomics and c omputer Science This is an interdisciplinary major (twenty-two courses/88 points) offered by the Department of Economics with the Department of Computer Science. Only those students that are following the theory track in economics are eligible to pursue the joint ECCS major. This major has requirements in three departments, including math- ematics. A grade of C (2.0) or better is necessary in all courses used to fulfill joint major requirements. The economics requirements (nine courses/36 points) are as follows: Introduction to Economic Analysis (ECON-UA 5) Mathematics for Economists (ECON-UA 6) Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11) Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13) Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20) Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266) Plus any three economics elective courses, at least two of which must be at the 300 level. One of these electives may be replaced by Introduction to Database Systems (CSCI-UA 444).166 ECONOMICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS The computer science requirements (nine courses/36 points) are as follows: Introduction to Computer Science (CSCI-UA 101) Data Structures (CSCI-UA 102) Computer Systems Organization (CSCI-UA 201) Operating Systems (CSCI-UA 202) Basic Algorithms (CSCI-UA 310) Plus four computer science electives at the 400 level. One of these electives may be replaced by Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140), or by ECON-UA 310, ECON-UA 337, ECON-UA 365, or ECON-UA 375. The mathematics requirements (four courses/16 points) are as follows: Discrete Mathematics (MATH-UA 120) Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) Calculus III (MATH-UA 123) Interested students should consult with the director of undergraduate studies in both departments for additional information. minor Students may minor in economics in either concentration. A minor enables a student to acquire a useful understanding of economic concepts and analysis without the same degree of coverage as would be obtained in a major. A grade of C or better is required for a course to be counted toward the minor in economics. Note: If a student fails a course required for the minor, the course must be retaken in the department; a course taken outside the University will not normally be allowed to substitute for a failed course. No course for the minor may be taken as pass/fail. Policy Minor At least 24 points (six courses) to be taken in the Department of Economics, including Economic Principles I (ECON-UA 1), Economic Principles II (ECON-UA 2), Statistics (ECON-UA 18), International Economics (ECON-UA 238), and two additional 4-point courses numbered ECON-UA 200-299. Theory Minor At least 24 points (six courses) to be taken in the Department of Economics, including Introduction to Economic Analysis (ECON-UA 5), Mathematics for Economists (ECON-UA 6), Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20), either Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11) or Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13), and any other two electives in the theory sequence for which the student has the prerequisites. honors Program Honors may be taken in either concentration. Obtaining honors in economics provides students with the unique opportunity of engaging in a fulfilling capstone experience to their major. Honors students have the opportunity to take courses that are challenging and small in size, enabling students to form close relationships with the faculty in the economics department. Students interested in going to graduate or professional schools are especially urged to take honors. A 3.65 overall GPA and a 3.65 average in economics courses are required.Students who wish to obtain honors register for a three-course sequence usually beginning no later than the spring semester of their junior year: Topics in Econometrics (ECON-UA 380) or Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266), Honors T utorial (ECON-UA 410), and Honors Thesis (ECON-UA 450). Students pursuing Honors are strongly encouraged to take Advanced Econometrics (ECON-UA 402). Interested students must consult with the director of undergraduate studies. Ideally, students should speak to the economics department advisers early in their sophomore year to begin planning for honors. Honors students will be required to take at least 44 points in the policy concentration or at least 44 points in the theory concentration. Students will need to begin the process during the spring semester of their junior year.167 ECONOMICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS Students who wish to pursue honors would take the following courses, depending on their chosen concentration. Honors in Policy Concentration: Economic Principles I (ECON-UA 1) Economic Principles II (ECON-UA 2) Statistics (ECON-UA 18) Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12) International Economics (ECON-UA 238) Topics in Econometrics (ECON-UA 380) T wo electives (at least one of which must be a 300-level elective) The two honors courses, Honors T utorial (ECON-UA 410) and Honors Thesis (ECON-UA 450) Honors in Theory Concentration: Introduction to Economic Analysis (ECON-UA 5) Mathematics for Economists (ECON-UA 6) Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20) Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11) Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13) Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266) Three electives (at least two of which must be 300-level electives) The two honors courses, Honors T utorial (ECON-UA 410) and Honors Thesis (ECON-UA 450) coUrSeS Note: Students are encouraged to review the Department of Economics website (www.econ.nyu. edu) for more information about the economics major. Students should speak with an adviser in the department to help them plan their major. Advisers are located at 19 West Fourth Street, Rooms 836 and 837. In the list of courses below, some courses are designated either \"P\" or \"T\" (or both). \"P\" alone represents courses to be taken only by students in the policy concentration; \"T\" alone represents courses to be taken only by students in the theory concentration; and \"P , T\" represents courses that may be taken by students in either concentration. Economics courses for majors fall into several categories: first- and second-year core courses; elective courses at the 200 and 300 level; and special honors courses. Students must pay careful attention to prerequisites, as they are strictly enforced in this sequential major. first-Year c ore c ourses Economic Principles I (P) ECON-UA 1 Prerequisite: Algebra and Calculus (MATH-UA 9) or equivalent.

Designed to familiarize students with a modern approach to industrial organization economics. The modern approach relies extensively on the use of game-theoretic tools to model strategic market behavior and the use of econometric methods for testing hypotheses regarding firm conduct and mar-ket performance. In particular, the course analyzes profit-maximizing business strategies of firms with market power, as well as strategic interactions among firms in various types of imperfectly competitive markets. The course addresses both static modes 172 ECONOMICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS of competition as well as dynamic competition in research and development and product design. The course also examines the scope of effective public policies designed to improve market performance. Throughout the course, mathematical-based models are used to develop the relevant concepts and test the pertinent theories of firm behavior. Risk and Fluctuations in Financial Markets (T) ECON-UA 320 Prerequisites: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11) and Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13). Offered every year. 4 points. Focuses on the role of market participants' expecta-tions in driving risk and long swings in asset prices. Three approaches are discussed: the dominant Rational Expectations Hypothesis, behavioral-finance models, and recently proposed models of risk and fluctuations that place \"imperfect knowledge\" at the center of the analysis. Beyond comparing the three approaches from both the theoretical and empirical points of view, the course examines their implications for the reform of our financial system aiming to limit its vulnerability to future crisis. Economic Development (P , T) ECON-UA 323 Prerequisites: ECON-UA 10, 238; or ECON-UA 11 and ECON-UA 13. Offered every semester. 4 points.

Topics covered include, but are not restricted to, prospect theory, mental accounting, other-regarding preferences, and hyperbolic discounting. We usually approach a topic by examining evidence of some departure from the assumptions made in the canonical economic model. We then ask how such departures can be formalized theoretically and how the resulting models can be tested empirically. Political Economy (T) ECON-UA 345 Prerequisite: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered in the spring. 4 points. Introduces the emerging field of formal political economy. The variety of ways in which economists and political scientists think about political science and the interplay of political science and economics are analyzed. The first part of the course focuses on the formal modeling of political behavior and political institutions; the theory of social choice (how groups of rational individuals make decisions) and collective action (how groups of rational individuals take action) are analyzed. The second part of the course discusses the connection between politics and economics and investigates the effect of political variables on the determination of economic outcomes. Some questions that are answered: How can special groups of individuals enhance their well-being by political action? What is lobbying? What is the effect of contributions on political outcomes?

Offered in the spring. 4 points. Experimental economics is predicated on the belief that economics, like other sciences, can be a laboratory science where economic theories are tested, rejected, and revised. This course reviews the methodology of doing such laboratory experi- ments and investigates the use of experiments in a wide variety of fields. These include competitive markets, auctions, public goods theory, labor economics, game theory, and individual choice theory. The course functions as a research seminar in which students present their work as it progresses during the semester. Students also get exposure to the experimental laboratory in the Department of Economics and the research performed there.

Students who rank near the top of their class and who have done well on standardized tests, particularly in mathematics, are especially well suited. Students should have completed a rigorous college preparation program, including mathematics (through trigo- nometry), chemistry, and physics and exhibited substantial extracurricular activity and leadership. Students are usually admitted to the program as freshmen and must be prepared to begin with Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) in the first semester of college. Given the highly structured curricula, transfer into the program after the first DUAL -DEGREE PROGRAM IN Engineering (with the Polytechnic Institute of NYU) Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 905 New York, NY 10003-6688 Phone: 212-998-8130 director of the Program at New York University To be announced director of the Program at the Polytechnic Institute of NYU Associate Provost k alkhoran assistant to the dean for engineering Students Mr. HemmesSince the fall of 2010, the College's dual-degree program in science and engineering with the Polytechnic Institute of NYU has offered highly qualified and motivated students who are technically oriented the opportunity to pursue both a liberal arts program with a major in science and a traditional engineering program. The program is ideal for the student interested in science and engineering who is also eager for a liberal arts experience before entering an undergraduate engineering environment. Upon completion of this five-year program, students receive the Bachelor of Science degree from the College of Arts and Science at New York University and the Bachelor of Science degree from the Polytechnic Institute of NYU. Students with this combination of degrees are likely to find excellent employment opportunities. The available dual-degree combinations are as follows: B.S. in biology/B.S. in chemical and biomolecular engineering B.S. in chemistry/B.S. in chemical and biomolecular engineering B.S. in computer science/B.S. in computer engineering B.S. in computer science/B.S. in electrical engineering B.S. in mathematics/B.S. in civil engineering B.S. in mathematics/B.S. in computer engineering B.S. in mathematics/B.S. in electrical engineering B.S. in mathematics/B.S. in mechanical engineering B.S. in physics/B.S. in civil engineering B.S. in physics/B.S. in computer engineering B.S. in physics/B.S. in electrical engineering B.S. in physics/B.S. in mechanical engineering Students in the program complete all of the Morse Academic Plan (MAP) requirements, with the excep-tion of the foreign language requirement, from which they are excused. (Their required mathematics and science courses automatically satisfy the MAP's Foundations of Scientific Inquiry requirements.) There is usually some flexibility concerning the semester in which a given course can be taken, and students with Advanced Placement credit may be able to lighten some of their semester course loads and/or have room for more electives. Detailed programs of study for each of the curricula are available from Mr. Joseph Hemmes, the adviser for all students in the various programs. He may be contacted at the College Advising Center, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905, 212-998-8130. Application materials for this dual-degree program may be requested from New York University, Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339.177 ENGINEERING C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDUAL -DEGREE PROGRAM IN ENGINEERING year is very difficult. Students must maintain satisfactory performance and must complete the required courses in a timely fashion to remain in the program. Their records are reviewed yearly by a faculty committee. The Program Students accepted into the program spend their first three years of study in the College of Arts and Science at New York University. In the first year at the College, the different curricula call for many of the same courses. This gives students time to consult with faculty at both schools before committing themselves to a particular science/engineering major. For their second and third years of study at New York University, students select a major area from the disci- plines of biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics. In their first year, students will have the opportunity to decide upon or change this major and to reflect on their choice of an engineering major. In the spring of the third year, an orientation program helps students prepare for the transition to Polytechnic in the fourth year. In the first three years of the program, students satisfy their MAP requirements and also take some of the Polytechnic courses required for their choice of engineering major. The final two years of study are undertaken at the Polytechnic Institute of NYU in downtown Brooklyn, across the East River and a short subway ride from New York University's Greenwich Village campus. At Polytechnic, students complete the remaining technical courses required for their engineering major. Programs in engineering available to students in the NYU-Polytechnic dual-degree program include chemical and biomo- lecular engineering, civil engineering, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. Students may elect to withdraw from the dual-degree program in engineering and complete only the College of Arts and Science general and major requirements at New York University.178 ENGLISH C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYobjectives The department offers a full and varied curriculum in literary history, critical theory, dramatic literature, theatre history, and literary culture. Its courses enable students to immerse themselves in literary works that reflect the values and aspirations of our diverse cultural traditions. Qualified majors may apply for admission to the honors program in English for an opportunity to do advanced independent work. The department also offers a minor in English and American literature.Students should consult the department's website (english.fas.nyu.edu) at registration time for a list of courses that satisfy the requirements outlined below and for more detailed descriptions of the particular courses offered in a given term.Programchair of the department Professor Chaudhuri director of Undergraduate Studies Associate Professor Waterman director of the honors Program Associate Professor McLanewww.english.as.nyu.edu 13 University Place, New York, NY 10003-4573 Phone: 212-998-8800 Professors emeriti Carruthers, Greene, Harrier, maria r emarque Professor of literature Harperhenry James Professor of english and american l etters University Professor Donoghuelewis and l oretta glucksman Professor of american l etters DoctorowSamuel rudin University Professor in the humanities; Professor of english PooveySilver Professors; Professors of english Guillory, Young University Professor; Professor of english Stimpson Tiro a.

By learning to read critically and write with analytical precision, students who major in English prepare themselves to participate intelligently in their culture while forging a lifelong, enriching relationship with literature. The department's offerings are bolstered by the strong literature collections available on campus at the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library, which also houses the Fales Collection of English and American Literature. Students are also encouraged to make use of the research opportunities presented by the excellent collec- tions of the New-York Historical Society and the New York Public Library. The department provides opportunities for specialized research through seminars, independent study courses, and an honors program that culminates in the writing of an honors thesis during the senior year under the supervision of a faculty member. The department also offers elective credit for internships in publishing, at literary agencies, and at other professional offices. The rich cultural life of New York City, and of Greenwich Village in particular, makes NYU an ideal location for the study of English and American literature.DEPARTMENT OF English179 ENGLISH C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH major in e nglish and a merican l iterature A minimum of ten 4-point courses (40 points), distributed as follows: Four required core courses.

Restriction: Students can take only one 200-level science elective toward their science track. Offered in the spring. Killilea. 4 points. Over half of the human population lives within 100 km of a coast, and coastlines contain more than two- thirds of the world's largest cities. As a result, the world's natural coastal environments have been sub-stantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and ecological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams will use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University ini-tiative, this course is being offered simultaneously in New York and Abu Dhabi, and students collaborate extensively with students from their sister campus through the duration of this course.

Prerequisite: Environmental Systems Science (ENVST-UA 100), or Principles of Biology I (BIOL-UA 11 or BIOL-UA 13 [Honors] or BIOL-UA 9011 [London]) and Principles of BIOL-UA 14 [Honors] or BIOL-UA 9012 [London]), or permission of the instructor. Killilea. 4 points. Biogeochemistry is the study of biological controls on the chemistry of the environment and geochemi- cal regulation of ecological structure and function. This course introduces the fundamental principles of biogeochemistry. Additionally, we utilize the scientific literature from peer-reviewed journals to explore specific case studies on the global change of biogeochemistry (e.g., acid precipitation, nitrogen deposition, eutrophication of the oceans) from the field of biogeochemistry. At the Bench: Ecological Analysis with Geographical Information Systems ENVST-UA 372 Identical to BIOL-UA 64. Prerequisite: Environmental Systems Science (ENVST-UA 100), or Principles of Biology I (BIOL-UA 11 or BIOL-UA 13 [Honors] or BIOL-UA 9011 [London]) and Principles of BIOL-UA 14 [Honors] or BIOL-UA 9012 [London]), or permission of the instructor. Killilea. 4 points. Being able to organize and analyze ecological data is an essential research tool. Geographic informa-tion systems (GIS) are computerized systems for the capture, storage, management, analysis, and display of geographically referenced data and their attributes. Students learn the basic principles and applications of GIS, including coordinate systems, data transformations, spatial analysis, and accuracy assessment. Laboratory exercises use ecological data and examples to provide extensive hands- on experience with ArcGIS, a professional GIS software package. Ethics and the Environment ENVST-UA 400 Identical to PHIL-UA 53. Offered in the fall. Jamieson, Sachs. 4 points. Environmental philosophy is a large subject that involves questions in metaphysics, the philosophy of science, and the history of philosophy, as well as in such normative areas as ethics, aesthetics, and political philosophy. This course is primarily devoted to these normative areas. Beginning with some basic concepts in value theory, the goal is not to arrive at definite solutions to specific environmental problems, but rather to improve students' ability to think critically, read closely, and argue well about environmental issues. The course also introduces stu-dents to some major controversies in environmental philosophy. The ultimate aim is to aid students in arriving at their own rational, clear-minded views about the matters under discussion.198 ENvIRONMENTAL S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYPROGRAM IN ENvIRONMENTAL S TUDIES Economics and the Environment ENVST-UA 410 Offered in the spring. Damon. 4 points. Students study how the earth's scarce resources are allocated by individuals and society, and how economic tools can contribute toward solutions to environmental challenges. Broad concepts consid-ered include market failure; sustainability; valuation of social benefits provided by the environment; estimating social costs and benefits of alternate environmental policies; determining desirable levels of pollution control and choosing policies to achieve it; and managing natural resources, both renewable (e.g., forests, fisheries, and water) and nonrenewable (e.g., oil and minerals). The course format consists of lectures, discussions, and group projects. Environmental History of the Early Modern World ENVST-UA 415 Identical to HIST-UA 115. Appuhn. 4 points. From the perspective of environmental history, the early modern period (ca. 1500-1800) marks a moment of sudden and unprecedented global transformation. Rising core populations created increasing demand for food and natural resources, which in turn led to major alterations to the landscape as states and individuals sought to derive greater benefits from nature. This course analyzes the ways in which this process unfolded in different parts of the world, while familiarizing students with basic problems in environmental history, including the changing human relationship to the natural world, the relationship between environmental change and human societies, and the importance of biotic exchange in world history. The course is divided into two parts. In the first part, we consider what can be called the \"Eurasian Advantage\" or \"Biological Conquest Model\" made popular by Jared Diamond. In the second part, we consider parallel developments in other parts of the world that cast doubt on this account. Environmental History of New York City ENVST-UA 420 Identical to HIST-UA 275. Needham. 4 points. This course investigates topics in the environmental history of New York City from the 17th century to the present. Environmental history is a relatively new field of history that attempts to take nature and natural forces seriously as key components of historical change. Through readings, site visits, and writing assignments, the course introduces students to the field of environmental history and investigates the history of our immediate environ- ment. As a history-department workshop, the course also introduces students to the key elements of the discipline of history: finding and reading articles, conducting research, and evaluating primary and secondary sources. History of Ecology and Environmentalism ENVST-UA 425 Offered in the fall. Anker. 4 points. Students trace the history of ecology and environ-mentalism back to natural history collected in the 18th century. The global history of ecological concern stays at the center of this course, which discusses environmental worries in the British, German, Scandinavian, African, and American contexts in subsequent centuries. The chief focus is on more recent U.S. experience in trying to deal with pol- lution, asthma, and global warming, among other issues. Various ecological understandings of human philosophy, race, gender, fear, religion, sociology, and economy are subject to critical discussion. Readings include texts by scientists such as Carolus Linnaeus, Arthur Tansley, and Julian Huxley, as well as social and philosophical writings of authors such as H. G. Wells, John Muir, Jan Smuts, and Arne Naess. Education and the Environment ENVST-UA 430 Schlottmann. 4 points. This course (1) discusses major topics and schools of thought in environmental education, (2) analyzes the ethical, practical, and conceptual implications of this, and (3) assesses these various approaches for clarity and practicality. Students address four primary questions: What forms does environmental education take? What values inform environmental education? What might an ethically defensible, effective form of environmental education look like? How much do concepts and arguments matter in better understanding and implementing environmental education? The course aims to advance our integrative and practical thinking about complex and multifac-eted environmental topics, as well as to understand environmental values as they relate to education. Food, Animals, and the Environment ENVST-UA 440 Identical to ANST-UA 440. Offered in the spring. Schlottmann. 4 points. Students study human interaction with both food and animals, as well as the environmental impacts and ethical issues that arise from such interaction. Focus is on the moral standing of animals, animals as food, and the environmental impacts of agricul-ture, transportation, and consumption. The course 199 ENvIRONMENTAL S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYPROGRAM IN ENvIRONMENTAL S TUDIES also surveys major thinkers in the field, including Michael Pollan, Peter Singer, Jim Mason, Wendell Berry, David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Martha Nussbaum. Students engage in col-laborative research projects, and we hope to schedule field trips to local agricultural sites. T opics in Environmental Values and Society ENVST-UA 450 Prerequisite: Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101) or permission of the instructor. Offered every semester. Anker, Damon, Rademacher, Sachs, Schlottmann. 4 points. An intermediate course for students in the major or minor in environmental studies in the environ- mental values and society track. The aim of the course is to advance understanding of a specific topic concerning the social aspects of environ- mental problems. Familiarity with social aspects of environmental problems is assumed. Topics include Thinking Globally, Acting Locally; Economics and the Environment; History of Ecology and Environmentalism; Environmental Education; and Food and Animals. European Environmental Policy ENVST-UA 460 Prerequisite: Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101). Offered in the fall. 4 points. This course offers an introduction to European environmental policy. The European Union (EU) is often seen as a leader in environmental policy, and it is a major player in international environmental policy making. But how does the EU, a unique economic and political union of 27 states, actually make and implement environmental policy? In this course, we explore these questions by focusing on different aspects of European environmental policy. The first part provides a historic overview of the emergence and development of European environ- mental policy and law. Who are the central actors? Which institutions are involved in policy making? What are the basic regulation principles? The second part concentrates on the EU policy-making process, and on the implementation of environmental policy in the Member States. A third part deepens these aspects by discussing case studies such as the regulation of chemicals, waste management, air pollution, and GMO. A fourth part concentrates on challenges for European environmental policy and sets it into an international context: How to cope with the enlargement of the EU? What is EU Climate Change policy, and how does the European Emissions T rading System work?Climate and Society ENVST-UA 470 Prerequisite: Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101). Recommended: Climate Change (ENVST-UA 226). Offered in the fall. Schlottmann. 4 points. An intermediate environmental studies elective about how societies understand and respond to climate change. We analyze the values, assumptions, and perceptions that contribute to our understand- ing of climate change. The main topics are: ethics, justice and responsibility; definitions of nature; cost-benefit analysis the geo-engineering; contrarianism; and communication; social engagement; and Central questions include: Is climate change a tech- nical or social problem? What makes climate change uniquely challenging to understand and respond to? Which ethical and perceptual frameworks are best suited for both understanding and responding to climate change? Who is responsible, and what moral implications does this have? What assumptions about values, behavior, economics, and nature do we make when discussing climate change? How does climate change challenge our conceptions of nature, morality, society, and economics? Does climate change pose a special challenge to society, or does it simply amplify existing challenges? Journalism and Society: Covering the Earth (Journalism) ENVST-UA 503 Identical to JOUR-UA 503. Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. Fagin. 4 points. As Web-based platforms increasingly dominate mass media, what specific forms should the \"new\" environmental journalism take? This course traces the development of traditional environmental journalism from John Muir to John McPhee and looks closely at how the field is adapting to a fast-changing media landscape. With the help of guests and timely readings, we confront thorny questions about environmental advocacy, citizen media, issue framing, risk balancing, and the scientific process. We produce stories that matter on the biggest news beat of all. This advanced seminar includes intensive journalistic writing assignments, as well as extensive readings for in-class discussion. Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Eco Criticism ENVST-UA 510 Identical to ENGL-UA 735. Chaudhuri. 4 points. An introduction to the emerging field of eco- criticism and an exploration of some of its main 200 ENvIRONMENTAL S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYPROGRAM IN ENvIRONMENTAL S TUDIES questions, issues, methods, and texts. We trace the origins and development of key tropes of ecological thought\u2014such as wilderness, pastoralism, pollu- tion, and catastrophe\u2014in literary and cultural texts ranging from the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh to the Hollywood eco-blockbuster Avatar. We apply the lenses of environment and species to classics like Euripides' The Bacchae, Shakespeare's The T empest, and Thoreau's Walden, as well as to works that exemplify new conjunctions between ecological thought and contemporary discourses on globaliza- tion, environmental justice, and queer theory, such as novels like Animal's People by Indra Sinha and Lives of the Animals by J. M. Coetzee, and films like Brokeback Mountain and The Yes Men Fix the World. Animals and Society ENVST-UA 610 Identical to ANST-UA 200 and SOC-UA 970. Jerolmack. 4 points. Analyzes the ways that animal and human lives intersect. Specifically, this course examines how relationships with animals both reflect and shape social life, culture, and how people think about themselves. We explore the myriad and contradic- tory positions that animals occupy in society (e.g., as pets, pests, mascots, and food) and deconstruct the social origins of these seemingly natural categories. (After all, one society's pet is another society's din- ner.) We also take a grounded look at what actually happens when humans and animals interact, which sheds new light on the nature of human and animal consciousness and troubles some of the assumptions we make about the necessary role of language and symbols in interaction. Fundamentally, students learn how the roles that animals take on in our lives, and the ways that we think about and relate to them, are inherently social processes that are patterned by geography, culture, class, gender, and so on. Central questions include: How do ideas about, and relation- ships to, animals vary across time and space? What roles do science, literature, and media representa-tions play in shaping how we think about animals? How and why did pets become honorary members of the American family? Why are some animals, but not others, granted moral status and legal protection in society? How do humans and animals coordinate interaction without language?Animals and Public Policy ENVST-UA 630 Identical to ANST-UA 500. No prerequisites. Offered in the fall. 4 points. Provides an overview of public policy with respect to the somewhat contradictory treatment of animals by humans, with a focus on how public policy is created and how social change occurs. We consider what public policy consists of and what actors and factors play a role in the creation of public policy; how society views animals; the capacities of animals; how ethics relates to animal treatment; how animals are currently utilized by our society; and political and other efforts to improve or alter the current treatment of animals, including the influence of sci- ence, government, business, and nongovernmental organizations in defining and influencing animal-related policies. We focus on legislation, litigation, regulation, and ballot initiative and consumer campaigns and their effectiveness, as well as other strategies that relate to improving animal welfare. We also discuss the meaning of \"animal rights\" and the success and impact of the modern animal protec-tion movement.201 EUROPEAN AND MEDITERRANEAN S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYProgramfacUl TY2012-2013 max Weber chair for german and european Studies Lemke Professors Fleming (History), Schain (Politics), Wolff (History)associate Professor Shaw (European and Mediterranean Studies/Philosophy)assistant Professors/f aculty fellows Mincyte (European and Mediterranean Studies), Santarelli (European and Mediterranean Studies)director of the c enter Professor Wolffwww.cems.as.nyu.edu 285 Mercer Street, 7th Floor, New York, NY 10003-6653 Phone: 212-998-3838 major With the help of the European and Mediterranean Studies adviser, students prepare a preliminary program outline at the time they declare their major. Although there are no formal tracks, courses are normally organized around the interests of a student in one of two ways: an emphasis on contemporary European and Mediterranean societies\u2014their problems and policies; or an emphasis on contemporary European and Mediterranean cultures\u2014their ideas, values, and artistic and literary trends. The program enables students to organize their courses around a practical or theoretical problem in contemporary European society or culture that is applicable to one or several countries. A typical problem might include such subjects as the changing impact of politics on culture and social cleavages; changing patterns of religious expression in Europe; literary expression and changing society in Europe; the European approach to urban problems; migration and ethnicity in Europe; equality and inequality in Europe; and democratic transition in Europe. The problem, for which the tools of several academic disciplines should be applicable, will be the basis for the major research project. Ten 4-point courses beyond the introductory level that deal with Europe and the Mediterranean are required: T wo courses in history T wo courses in literature (preferably in the language of specialization) T wo courses in the social sciences T wo courses in philosophy, art history, or cinema studies One senior honors seminar in European studies One independent study during the final semester, for completion of the graded senior thesis A sequence of courses might begin with two advanced history courses and two literature courses in the sopho- more and/or junior years, followed by two social science and two philosophy, art history, and/or cinema studies courses. The interdisciplinary senior honors seminar should be taken during the first semester of the senior year. Majors are also required to complete at least one semester of study abroad. Students may petition the director of the center for exemption from this requirement.CENTER FOR European and Mediterranean Studies The Center for European and Mediterranean Studies offers an interdisciplinary major and minor in European and Mediterranean studies focusing on contemporary patterns of politics, culture, and society, as well as on historical developments in Europe. Both the major and minor are designed for students seeking preprofessional training for careers in international business and finance, diplomacy, international law, and cultural organizations dealing with Europe. Although open to all students, the minor is especially suited to majors in European languages, history, or the social sciences. The Center offers and supports a wide array of activities, including lectures, workshops, and conferences dealing with both Western and Eastern Europe. New York City, which is an international center for diplomacy, finance, media, and cultural exchange, is an ideal setting for the Center and enriches its programs.202 EUROPEAN AND MEDITERRANEAN S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYCENTER FOR EUROPEAN AND MEDITERRANEAN S TUDIES Majors in European and Mediterranean studies must have or attain advanced-level knowledge of a major European language other than English (such as French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German, Greek, or Russian). To dem- onstrate this knowledge, students must successfully complete an advanced-level language course. The alternative to this is to pass the College of Arts and Science (CAS) proficiency exam prior to graduation. minor All students minoring in European and Mediterranean studies must demonstrate proficiency in at least one European language above the intermediate level (such as French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, or Greek). They must also take five 4-point courses as follows: one course in modern European history; one course in European politics, anthropology, or economics; and three additional courses distributed across at least two of the following areas: modern European history; studies; Hellenic studies; and Italian, French, German, or Spanish civilization. No more than two of these courses may focus on any one specific country. All course programs must be designed in consultation with the center's undergraduate program adviser. B.a./m.a. Program This program offers qualifying majors in European and Mediterranean studies the opportunity to earn both the B.A. and the M.A. degrees at reduced tuition cost. By completing some of their graduate requirements while still undergraduates, students can finish the program in five years. In the graduate portion of the program, students can qualify for a scholarship that covers up to half of the tuition for the courses required for the M.A. European and Mediterranean studies majors may apply for admission to the program after they have completed at least 48 points in the College, but not more than 96 credits or six semesters. Students apply for admission to the B.A./M.A. program through the CAS Advising Center. Applications are reviewed by the Graduate Admission Committee of the Center for European and Mediterranean Studies, using the normal criteria for the M.A. program, except that applicants are not required to take the GRE. The committee bases its decision on students' undergraduate records and recommendations of NYU instructors. A working knowledge at an advanced level of a European language (other than English) is required to complete the program, and knowledge of a second European language is encouraged. Students must spend at least one semester in an approved academic program in Europe, normally during their junior year. Students are also required to write a senior honors thesis and a master's thesis or special project (see below) to earn the two degrees. The program requires a total of eighteen courses: ten undergraduate courses and eight graduate courses. For the first four years, students focus their work on a \"problem area\" that will eventually become the subject of their master's thesis, should they choose this option. The senior honors thesis is an integrative project within the problem area developed by the student and his or her adviser. It may be an expansion of a research paper written for an undergraduate course. The graduate portion of the degree comprises three tracks\u2014European politics and policy, European culture and society, and Mediterranean studies\u2014and students must choose one of these by the beginning of their fifth year. Of the eight graduate courses, two are required: a graduate research seminar in European and Mediterranean Studies, as well as the introductory graduate course What Is Europe? (EURO-GA 2301). Students select six additional graduate courses in their chosen track. A 4-point internship, approved by the Center, is recommended. Each student's program is organized with his or her adviser at the time that the student enters the program. The first draft of the thesis is developed in the Undergraduate Research Seminar (EURO-UA 300), taken in the fall semester of the fourth year. The master's thesis may be a revision of this project and is further developed in the graduate Research Seminar (EURO-GA 3000), taken in the spring semester of the fifth year. The M.A. thesis or special project will be defended at an oral examination during the spring semester of the fifth year. eUroSI m EUROSIM is an annual model European Union simulation designed to enhance students' classroom knowl- edge of the workings of a politically and economically integrated Europe. The simulation exercise models 203 EUROPEAN AND MEDITERRANEAN S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYCENTER FOR EUROPEAN AND MEDITERRANEAN S TUDIES the legislative procedure of the European Union from the introduction of a draft resolution by the European Commission to the acceptance (or rejection) of an amended document by the European Council. Each year, New York State colleges and universities send a delegation of undergraduate students to EUROSIM to represent one of the member states of the European Union and the European Commission. The legislation on which delegates work is focused on one main theme chosen for its relevance to current European issues. Students individually play the roles of real-life government ministers, members of the European Parliament, and members of the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. EUROSIM is held in alternating years in the United States and in Europe. In addition, several European univer- sities send students to be part of their respective member-state delegations alongside the American students. In this way, U.S. students receive a \"home-grown\" perspective on the issues that they are debating. coUrSeS Europe Since 1945 EURO-UA 156 Identical to HIST-UA 156. 4 points.

Cannot substitute for International Writing Workshop I or II (EXPOS-UA 4 and 9). 4 points. These two courses, designed for students plan- ning to apply to a degree program in the United States, prepare students to function comfortably in university-level classes and other situations in which formal writing is required. Workshops help students develop their ability to summarize, discuss, analyze, and comment on their reading. Students read authentic nonfiction materials from newspa-pers, magazines, and books and write critical essays. Courses provide assistance in grammar and editing.Proficiency examination The Expository Writing Program administers the Proficiency Examination to students who receive a C- or lower (including F) in Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1) or International Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 9). EWP also administers the exam to all external transfer students, who must take and pass the examination to graduate. All students who fail the exam will be placed in Writing T utorial (EXPOS-UA 13).208 FOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYdirector of the morse academic Plan To be announced associate director of the morse a cademic Plan for f oundations of contemporary culture Clinical Associate Professor Renziwww.map.cas.nyu.edu Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 903, New York, NY 10003-6688 Phone: 212-998-8119 ProgramFOUNDATIONS OF Contemporary Culture During their first year, students normally complete a class from Texts and Ideas (MAP-UA 4XX) and one from Cultures and Contexts (MAP-UA 5XX), in either order. In the sophomore year, students choose classes from Societies and the Social Sciences (MAP-UA 6XX) and from Expressive Culture (MAP-UA 7XX), again in either order. Prerequisites Students should complete the first-year FCC classes and the expository writing requirement before proceeding to the sophomore-level classes. Students in the International Writing Workshop sequence should not start their course work in the FCC until they have completed International Writing Workshop I (EXPOS-UA 4). Exemptions and Substitutions Because of the importance the faculty places on assuring every student a core experience in the Foundations of Contemporary Culture, there are no exemptions or substitutions for Texts and Ideas or Cultures and Contexts. Students who complete a designated major or minor program in the social sciences are exempt from Societies and the Social Sciences. Those who complete a designated major or minor program in the humanities are exempt from Expressive Culture. Students who complete majors in each area, who complete a joint major designated in both areas, or who complete a major in one area and a minor in the other, may satisfy both components. A list of the area designations of major and minor programs in the College of Arts and Science (CAS) may be found on the MAP website. CAS students can also satisfy Societies and the Social Sciences by completing an approved departmental course. For a current list of approved courses, consult the MAP website. The Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the Morse Academic Plan (MAP) seeks to provide students with the perspective and intellectual methods to comprehend the development of our human cultures. The four FCC courses introduce students to the modes of inquiry by which societies may be studied, social issues analyzed, and artistic activity explored. Together, they give undergraduates a broad methodological background on which to draw when later engaged in the more focused work of their major courses of study. As a result, students receive a richer education than any single major could provide. Through this core experience in humanistic and social-scientific inquiry, the FCC framework allows students to enter into dialogue with one another despite differences in their course schedules, and in this way also encourages lifelong habits of intellectual curiosity and engagement. As they learn the sound employment of the academic approaches at the center of their FCC classes, students develop their abilities to read critically, think rigorously, and write effectively. By building these skills and an appreciation of the diversity of human experience, the FCC seeks to prepare students for their continued learning in and beyond college, for active participation in their communities, and for lives in a rapidly changing world. All FCC courses are taught by regular faculty, including some of the University's most distinguished profes- sors. In addition to two lectures a week, every FCC course includes weekly recitation sections, allowing for small-group discussion of the readings, close attention to students' written work, and personal concern for students' progress.209 FOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYFOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE In addition to the information listed below, detailed descriptions of each year's course offerings may be found on the MAP website. Texts and Ideas In addition to the traditional lecture/recitation format, selected sections of Texts and Ideas are also offered in writing-intensive versions in conjunction with Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1). Consult the MAP website for each year's schedule. T exts and Ideas: T opics MAP-UA 400 Offered every semester. 4 points. Recent topics include: Objectivity, Liberation, the Deliberating Citizen, Animal Humans, Utopias and Distopias, Freedom and Opression, and Literature in Wonderland. Consult the MAP website for descrip-tions of each term's offerings. T exts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Middle Ages MAP-UA 401 Offered occasionally. 4 points. Readings: Hebrew Scriptures and Christian New Testament, ancient Greek drama and philosophy, Vergil, and Augustine. Continues with Dante's Inferno, selections from Paradiso, and other texts from the Middle Ages. T exts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance MAP-UA 402 Offered every semester. 4 points. Readings: Hebrew Scriptures and Christian New Testament, ancient Greek drama and philosophy, Vergil, and Augustine. Continues with Machiavelli's Prince, a Shakespearean play or Milton's Samson Agonistes, and other texts from the Renaissance. T exts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment MAP-UA 403 Offered every semester. 4 points. Readings: Hebrew Scriptures and Christian New Testament, ancient Greek drama and philosophy, Vergil, and Augustine. Continues with Pascal's Pens\u00e9es, Rousseau's Confessions, and other texts from the Enlightenment. T exts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century MAP-UA 404 Offered every semester. 4 points. Readings: Hebrew Scriptures and Christian New Testament, ancient Greek drama and philosophy, Vergil, and Augustine. Continues with Marx's Communist Manifesto, selections from Darwin, Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality, or Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents, and other texts from the 19th and early 20th centuries.T exts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance\u2014Writing Intensive MAP-UA 412 Offered in the fall. 4 points. The same as MAP-UA 402, but with additional emphasis on writing. Students read and write about the course texts both for the lecture course and in their linked section of Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1). T exts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century\u2014Writing Intensive MAP-UA 414 Offered in the fall. 4 points. The same as MAP-UA 404, but with additional emphasis on writing. Students read and write about the course texts both for the lecture course and in their linked section of Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1). cultures and c ontexts Cultures and Contexts: Islamic Societies MAP-UA 502 Offered every year. 4 points. Examines the common base and regional variations of Islamic societies. An \"Islamic society\" is here understood as one that shares, either as operative present or historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances, but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical, topical, and regional. The emphasis in the premodern period is first on the Quran and then on law, political theory, theology, and mysticism. For the more recent period, the stress is on the search for religious iden-tity. Throughout, students are exposed to Islamic societies in the words of their own writings. Cultures and Contexts: Africa MAP-UA 505 Offered every year. 4 points. Key concepts related to understanding sub-Saharan African cultures and societies, concentrating in particular on teaching students how to think critically and consult sources sensibly when studying non-Western cultures. Topics include problems in the interpretation of African literature, African history, gender issues, the question of whether African thought and values constitute a unique system of thinking, the impact of the slave trade and colonialism on African societies and culture, and the difficulties of and means for translating and inter- preting the system of thought and behavior in an African traditional society into terms meaningful to Westerners. Among the readings are novels, current philosophical theory, and feminist interpretations of black and white accounts of African societies and coUrSeS210 FOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYFOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE the place of women in them. Issues are approached with the use of analyses from history, anthropology, sociology, literary theory, and philosophy. Cultures and Contexts: The Chinese and Japanese Traditions MAP-UA 506 Offered every other year. 4 points. Essential aspects of Asian culture\u2014Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Shintoism\u2014studied through careful reading of major works of phi-losophy and literature. A roughly equal division between Chinese and Japanese works is meant to give a basic understanding of the broad similarities and the less obvious, but all-important, differences among the cultures of Confucian Asia. One reading is a Vietnamese adaptation of a Chinese legend. The last two readings, modern novellas from Japan and China, show the reaction of the traditional cultures to the Western invasions. Cultures and Contexts: Japan\u2014A Cultural History MAP-UA 507 Offered every other year. 4 points. A consideration of the prehistory to Japan's modern- ist transformation through an analysis of key literary, religious, and artistic texts. Concentrates on the historical experiences that produced elements of a national culture before there was a nation and on the consciousness of being Japanese before there was a \"Japan.\" Examines how key cultural elements were used to make a modern nation-state. Cultures and Contexts: The Pacific Islands MAP-UA 508 Offered occasionally. 4 points. The Pacific Island region sweeps from Easter Island in the East to Papua New Guinea in the West, a vast \"sea of islands\" that has been a crucial space of exchange: of perspectives, materials, people, and ideas. What can we learn from the study of this region, a set of islands with both commonalities and differences that is often imagined as one \"place\"? We examine the cultures of the Pacific Islands, moving from the first migrations of indigenous naviga-tors through the age of European exploration and colonialism, to the local experience of World War II and contemporary engagements with globalization. We also study the area's unique cultural configura-tions of ritual practice, cosmology, and society. Along the way, we engage directly with the voices of Pacific islanders, from those who participated in the voyages of Captain Cook, to indigenous artists who reflect on these complex and entangled histories. Other primary sources include museum collections, film, painting, and other visual representations. This comparative approach enables us to understand debates about colonial encounter, primitivism, cannibalism, cargo cults, nuclear testing, resource extraction, and the morality of diet, from a Pacific perspective. Cultures and Contexts: Middle Eastern Societies MAP-UA 511 Offered every other year. 4 points. The popular American picture of the Middle East as a place of violence, veiled women, and oil wealth portrays none of the richness or complexity of most people's lives in the region. How can we make sense of these seemingly unfamiliar societies and think critically about Western images of the unfamiliar? Questions examined in depth include the following: What variety of sources do people in the Middle East draw on to define their sense of who they are\u2014as members of particular households, regions, nations, or religious communities? How do women and men construct their gender identity? In what ways are village, town, and city lives being trans- formed? Do people of the Middle East experience their region's politics the way it is portrayed in the West? What are some of the causes of political repression, armed struggle, or terror? How did European colonialism reshape the lives of people in the region, and how do they today encounter the cultural and economic power of the United States and Europe? Readings are drawn from history, anthropology, political economy, and the contempo-rary literature of the region. Cultures and Contexts: China MAP-UA 512 Offered every other year. 4 points. Fundamental concepts and practices of Chinese society and culture, examined using primary sources in translation whenever possible. By studying the social, political, religious, ideological, ritual, economic, and cultural life of the Chinese, students gain a sense of the core values and issues of Chinese civilization and how these have affected and continue to have an impact on the way people think and live. Cultures and Contexts: Ancient Israel MAP-UA 514 Offered every semester. 4 points. The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200 B.C.E. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century B.C.E. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the areas of law and social organiza-tion, prophetic movements, Israelite religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring 211 FOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYFOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times. The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of Israelite mono- theism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the mother religion of Christianity and Islam. Cultures and Contexts: Latin America MAP-UA 515 Offered every other year. 4 points. Explores the cultural, social, and political organiza- tion of indigenous people before the period of European colonization. Studies the dynamics of the colonial encounter, focusing on such themes as indigenous responses to European rule, the formation of \"Indian\" society, and the interaction of Europeans, Africans, and indigenous people. Considers postcolonial Latin America, focusing on themes such as political culture, competing ideologies of economics and social development, and the construction of collective identities based on region, race, ethnicity, gender, and class. Readings consist mostly of primary sources and allow students to hear diverse voices within Latin American society. Works by European conquerors, Inca and Aztec descendants in the colonial period, and African and creole slaves are studied. Novels, short stories, films, photographs, and music are also included. Cultures and Contexts: India MAP-UA 516 Offered every other year. 4 points. Considers the paradoxes of modern India: ancient religious ideas coexisting with material progress, hierarchical caste society with parliamentary democracy, and urban shantytowns with palatial high-rises. Integrates research on India's cultural values with social-scientific perspectives on their contemporary relevance. Examines problems such as protective discrimination for lower castes and cultural nationalism. Shows how democracy involves difficult choices among competing, often opposed, ancient and modern cultural values. Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures MAP-UA 529 Offered every year. 4 points. Examines the growth and development of \"Latino\" as a distinct category of identity out of the highly diverse populations of Latin American background in the United States, paying particular attention to the social processes shaping its emergence. Provides a detailed examination of the processes of cultural creation behind the rising growth of transnational cultures and identities worldwide, and of the forces that are fueling their development. Begins by explor- ing the immigration of Latin American peoples to U.S. cities, then turns to three case studies of emerging Latino communities, and ends by examin- ing contemporary issues involving Latinos in urban centers such as New York. Cultures and Contexts: The African Diaspora MAP-UA 532 Offered every year. 4 points. The dispersal of Africans to various parts of the world and over time, examining their experiences and those of their descendants. Regions of special interest include the Americas and the Islamic world, centering on questions of slavery and freedom while emphasizing the emergence of cultural forms and their relation-ship to both African and non-African influences. Cultures and Contexts: Indigenous Australia MAP-UA 536 Offered every other year. 4 points. The indigenous people of Australia have long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively \"other\"\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the \"primitive.\" These representations\u2014in feature films about them such as Walkabout and Rabbit-Proof Fence, in New Age literature, or in museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film, and other media, and consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and constructed. Cultures and Contexts: Modern Israel MAP-UA 537 Offered every year. 4 points. Despite its small size and population, Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years are examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20 percent) in Israeli society is discussed. The special role of religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew- speaking culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace movement, gender issues, 212 FOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYFOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE and the role of the army in everyday life are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched on, the focus is on the character of Israeli society and the impact on everyday life of living in the international limelight. Cultures and Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures MAP-UA 539 Offered every year. 4 points. Major issues in the historical and contemporary experiences of Asian Pacific Americans, includ-ing migration, modernization, racial formation, community-building, and political mobilization. Asian Pacific America encompasses a complex, diverse, and rapidly changing population of people. Particular attention is given to Asian Americans' use of cultural productions (films, literature, art, media, and popular culture) as an expression and reflection of their cultural identities, historical conditions, and political efforts. Cultures and Contexts: New World Encounters MAP-UA 541 Offered every year. 4 points. What was America before it was called America? How did indigenous cultures understand and document their first encounters with Europeans? We focus on peoples, events, and cultural expressions associated with the conquest and colonization of the Americas, con - centrating on three key areas: central Mexico, home to several pre-Columbian societies, most notably the Aztec Empire, and later the seat of Spanish power in northern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of New Spain); the central Andes, home of the Incas and later the site of Spanish power in southern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of Peru); and finally, early plantation societies of the Caribbean, where the violent history of enslaved Africans in the new world unfolded. On one hand, we explore how those subjugated by conquest and colonialism interpreted, resisted, and recorded their experience. On the other, we ask what new cul-tural forms emerged from these violent encounters, and consider their role in the foundation of \"Latin American\" cultures. Readings balance a range of primary documents and art created during the \"age of encounter,\" including maps, letters, paintings, and testimonials, along with historical and theoretical texts. Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs MAP-UA 545 Offered every year. 4 points. The archaeology, literature, and art of ancient Egypt all offer insights into its culture. Subjects of special interest are ancient Egyptian religious experiences and ethics, as well as constructions of gender, class, and ethnicity. Settlements that are particularly well documented through both archaeological and textual remains\u2014such as Kahun and Deir el-Medina\u2014yield extensive information about the varieties of social experience in these societies. Lives differed tremendously based on gender, profession, and locality (both spatial and temporal). Likewise, we explore how Egyptians, regardless of social standing, attempted to alter their socio-political circumstances through avenues such as concerted political action, magic, revolt, or the construction of well-crafted satire. Primary sources include letters, wisdom literature, love poetry, ancient house plans, tomb scenes, and physical anthropology. Cultures and Contexts: Global Asia MAP-UA 546 Offered every other year. 4 points. Explores the expansive transformation of Asian cultures from ancient times to the present, focus- ing on networks of mobility, interaction, social order, and exchange that form the particularity of Asian cultures through entanglements with others. Beginning in the days of Alexander the Great and the formation of the Afro-Eurasian ecumene, follows the tracks of Buddhist, Confucian, Hindu, and Muslim expansion and then turns to the age of early modern landed empires, Ottoman-Safavid-Mughal-Ming/Ching, and their interactions with seaborne European expansion. Studies truly global formations of culture in the flow of goods, ideas, and people among world regions, during the age of modern empires and nationalism, including the rise of the nation as a cultural norm, capitalism in Asia, and Japanese expansion around the Pacific Rim. Concludes by considering cultural change attending globalization since the 1950s, focusing on entanglements of Asian cultures with the globalizing culture of the market, consumerism, and wage labor, and transnational labor migration, as well as Asian cultural spaces in and around New York City, including our nearby Chinatown. Cultures and Contexts: Globalizing the Americas MAP-UA 550 Offered every other year. 4 points. The idea of \"America\" has long been dissected and reconstituted by a number of ideologues, theorists, policymakers, artists, activists, and ordinary people. Each has sought to craft a new existence that distinguished itself from \"Old World\" tyranny and tensions, significantly through the creation of imag- ined communities of identity and belonging, based 213 FOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYFOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE on various cultural, political-economic, and social criteria. We focus on studies of selected communities (e.g., the concept and experience of race in Brazil, homophobia in the West Indies) and historical events (e.g., 19th- and 20th-century migrations of Asians to Central America) and explore how global visions and international movements as, for example, Negritude, Pan-Americanism, Pan-Africanism, cosmopolitanism, and mestizaje/cr\u00e9olit\u00e9 emerge from local currents and practices. Cultures and Contexts: Immigrant America in the 19th Century MAP-UA 551 Offered occasionally. 4 points. The \"long nineteenth century,\" from the 1820s through the 1920s, saw the arrival of no fewer than 50 million immigrants to the United States. Coming primarily, although not exclusively, from Europe, their migrations not only transformed the places they left, but profoundly altered American society. These migrations, all of which involved a high degree of choice on the part of their participants, took place within the context of family and communal decision making, which in turn impacted significantly on the women and men who made these journeys, allowing\u2014 or forcing\u2014them to create new kinds of identities, institutions, and cultures. Indeed, as a result of their migrations, they became new people. They became \"ethnic,\" as they had to redefine themselves both in terms of what they left, what they \"brought\" with them, and what they encountered in America. We explore how their journeys led to the creation of a set of ethnic communities in America, which we can see as specific and unique and yet resembling each other in notable ways, focusing on three seemingly very different 19th-century groups: Irish, Italian, and Jewish immigrants, and the ethnic cultures they created. Cultures & Contexts: T opics\u2014Empires and Political Imagination MAP-UA 552 Offered every other year. 4 points. Comparative study of empires, from the Romans to the present, and the ways that empires have inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging, and power. Throughout history, few people lived for very long in a state that consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom they shared a language and culture. Empires\u2014polities that maintained social and cultural distinction even as they incorporated different people\u2014have been one of the most common and durable forms of political organization. An examination of the variety of human cultures must take account of how people lived in empires\u2014 sometimes seeking higher degrees of autonomy, sometimes accommodating to rulers' authority, sometimes trying to extend their own power over others. The study of empire expands our ideas of citizenship and challenges the notion that the nation- state is natural and necessary. We investigate how empires were held together\u2014and where they were weak\u2014from perspectives that focus on political and economic connections over long distances and long time periods. We also explore how scholars have approached the topic of empires, examining their methods and their interpretations. Readings include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese, Mongol, Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as well as primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial polities. Societies and the Social Sciences Note that the prerequisite for all Societies and the Social Sciences courses is completion of Texts and Ideas (MAP-UA 4XX) and Cultures and Contexts (MAP-UA 5XX), as well as completion of (or exemption from) Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1), Writing II (WRI-UF 2002), or International Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 9). Societies and the Social Sciences: T opics in Interdisciplinary Perspective MAP-UA 600 Offered occasionally. 4 points. Examines social phenomena that cross the boundar- ies among the various social-scientific disciplines. Topics vary each term and may include, for example, human migration, religion, fascism, or colonialism. By considering the methodologies appropriate to the study of these topics, students learn to appreciate the characteristic approaches of the social sciences, their power to help us understand such phenomena, and their limitations. expressive culture Note that the prerequisite for all Expressive Culture courses is completion of Texts and Ideas (MAP-UA 4XX) and Cultures and Contexts (MAP-UA 5XX), as well as completion of (or exemption from) Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1), Writing II (WRI-UF 2002), or International Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 9). Expressive Culture: Words MAP-UA 710 Offered occasionally. 4 points. What is literature or the literary? Is there a liter- ary language that works differently from ordinary 214 FOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYFOUNDATIONS OF C ONTEMPORARY CULTURE language? What is literary style and form? What is the position of the writer or artist in relation to society, and what is the function of the reader? Is literature a mirror of the world that it describes, an attempt to influence a reader's ideas or opinions, an expression of the identity of the writer, or none of these? Expressive Culture: The Graphic Novel MAP-UA 711 Offered occasionally. 4 points. Examines the interplay between words and images in the graphic novel, a hybrid medium with a system of communication reminiscent of prose fiction, anima- tion, and film. What is the connection between text and art? How are internal psychology, time, and action conveyed in a static series of words and pictures? What can the graphic novel convey that other media cannot? Authors include Alan Moore, Art Spiegelman, Peter Milligan, Charles Burns, and Carla Speed McNeil. Expressive Culture: Images MAP-UA 720 Offered occasionally. 4 points. What is the place of art in an image-saturated world? We begin by considering the power and taboo of images and the ways in which individuals and institutions that constitute \"the art world\" classify some of these images as works of art; turn to explore the visual and conceptual challenges presented by major works of sculpture, architecture, and painting; and conclude with a selection of problems raised by art today. Students develop the vocabulary to both appreciate and question the artistic \"gestures\" of society in various places and times. Expressive Culture: Painting and Sculpture in New York Field Study MAP-UA 721 Offered every spring. 4 points. New York's public art collections contain important examples of painting and sculpture from almost every phase of the past, as well as some of the world's fore- most works of contemporary art. Meets once a week for an extended period and combines on-campus lectures with group excursions to the museums or other locations where these works are exhibited. Expressive Culture: Architecture in New York Field Study MAP-UA 722 Offered every fall. 4 points. New York's rich architectural heritage offers a unique opportunity for firsthand consideration of the concepts and styles of modern urban architecture, as well as its social, financial, and cultural contexts. Meets once a week for an extended period and combines on-campus lectures with group excursions to prominent buildings. Consideration is given both to individual buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century architecture, as well as to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper and the adaptation of older buildings to new uses. Expressive Culture: Sounds MAP-UA 730 Offered every semester. 4 points. Our lives pulsate with patterns of sounds that we call music. We encounter these sounds in our homes, cars, stores, and exercise salons; they accompany us to the grocery store, the dentist's office, and the movies. Yet we rarely think consciously about what they mean. Through a series of specific case studies, we investigate the function and significance of music and the musician in human life. We raise basic questions about how music has been created, produced, perceived, and evaluated at diverse histori- cal moments, in a variety of geographical locations, and among different cultural groups. Through aural explorations and discussion of how these vivid worlds \"sound\" in time and space, we assess the value of music in human experience. Expressive Culture: Performance MAP-UA 740 Offered occasionally. 4 points. Examines \"performance\" both as a practice and as a theoretical tool with which to understand today's world. The broad spectrum of live performance is explored by means of lectures, discussions, and field trips. Students look at theatre and dance, performance in everyday life, rituals, popular entertainments, and intercultural performance. On the theoretical level, students are to \"speech acts,\" \"restored behavior,\" \"ritual process,\" and \"play.\" Students see a broad variety of performances, such as Native American powwow, Indian Hindu ritual drama, off-Broadway theatre and dance, African American gospel, street performers, and courtroom trials. Expressive Culture: Film MAP-UA 750 Offered every semester. 4 points. Film is a medium that combines a number of arts. It lies at the intersection of art and technology and of art and mass culture, and at the boundaries of the national and the global. Film is also a medium that coincides with and contributes to the invention of modern life. By exploring the expressive and repre- sentational achievements of cinema in the context of modernity and mass culture, students learn the concepts to grasp the different ways in which films create meaning, achieve their emotional impact, and respond in complex ways to the historical contexts in which they are made.215 FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INqUIRY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYProgramdirector of the morse academic Plan To be announced associate director of the morse a cademic Plan for f oundations of Scientific Inquiry Clinical Associate Professor Jordanwww.map.cas.nyu.edu Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 903, New York, NY 10003-6688 Phone: 212-998-8119FOUNDATIONS OF Scientific Inquiry In the FSI sequence, students choose one course in Quantitative Reasoning (MAP-UA 1XX), followed by one in the physical sciences from the Natural Science I grouping (MAP-UA 2XX), and then one in the biological sciences from the Natural Science II grouping (MAP-UA 3XX). Completion of or exemption from Quantitative Reasoning is a prerequisite for both Natural Science I and II. It is recommended that students complete Natural Science I before Natural Science II. Exemptions and Substitutions Students who major in a natural science, who complete the prehealth curriculum, or who complete the combined dual-degree program in engineering are exempt from the FSI requirements. In addition, Quantitative Reasoning, Natural Science I, and Natural Science II can each be satisfied by appropriate Advanced Placement (AP) credit or by substituting specific courses, as listed below.

Quantitative reasoning Students will take an examination to determine their exemption from the Quantitative Reasoning requirement. The examination is offered in the summer and each semester. The requirement can also be satisfied by one of the following options: AP credit in calculus (Mathematics AB or BC, 4 or 8 points) AP credit in statistics (4 points) Completion of one of the following: Quantitative Reasoning (MAP-UA 1XX) Statistics (ECON-UA 18) Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20) Calculus for the Social Sciences (MATH-UA 17) Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) Honors Calculus I (MATH-UA 221) Quantitative Methods in Political Science (POL-UA 800) Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10)Science and technology play such a central role in the modern world that even individuals not directly engaged in scientific or technical pursuits need to have solid skills in quantitative and analytical reasoning and a clear understanding of scientific investigation. Even more than their forebears, citizens of the 21st century will need competence and confidence in dealing with the approaches and findings of science if they are to make informed decisions on vital political, economic, and social issues. Rather than striving for encyclopedic coverage of facts, Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) courses in the Morse Academic Plan (MAP) stress the process of scientific reasoning and seek to illustrate the role of science and mathematics in our understanding of the natural world. The objectives of the FSI sequence are to give students who will not be science majors a positive experience in scientific inquiry and to encourage learning about how science is done. The quantitative component of these courses emphasizes the critical role of mathematics in the analysis of natural phenomena. The courses within FSI are collected into three groups: Quantitative Reasoning, Natural Science I, and Natural Science II. All lectures are taught by regular faculty, including some of the University's most distinguished professors, and each course includes a weekly workshop or related laboratory section.216 FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INqUIRY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYFOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INqUIRY Natural Science I and II This sequence may be satisfied as follows: AP credit for Biology (8 points), Chemistry (8 points), Physics B (10 points), or both Physics C-Mech (3 points) and Physics C-E&M (3 points) Completion of one of the following sequences: Natural Science I and II (MAP-UA 2XX and MAP-UA 3XX) Principles of Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 11, 12) General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 125) and General Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 126) Advanced General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 127) and Advanced General Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 128) General Physics I and II (PHYS-UA 11, 12) Physics I and II (PHYS-UA 91 and 93) and Introductory Experimental Physics I and II (PHYS-UA 71, 72) Natural Science I This MAP requirement may be satisfied as follows: AP credit for Physics C-Mech (3 points) or Physics C-E&M (3 points) Completion of one of the following: Natural Science I (MAP-UA 2XX) General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 125) Advanced General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 127) General Physics I (PHYS-UA 11) Physics I (PHYS-UA 91) and Introductory Experimental Physics I (PHYS-UA 71) Natural Science II This MAP requirement may be satisfied by completion of one of the following: Natural Science II (MAP-UA 3XX) Principles of Biology I (BIOL-UA 11) Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) coUrSeS In addition to the information listed below, detailed descriptions of each year's course offerings may be found on the MAP website.

Natural Science I: From Quarks to Cosmos MAP-UA 209 Offered every year. Adler, Cranmer, Mincer, Weiner. 4 points. Modern science has provided us with some under- standing of age-old fundamental questions, while at the same time opening up many new areas of inves-tigation. How old is the universe? How did galaxies, stars, and planets form? What are the fundamental constituents of matter, and how do they combine to form the contents of the universe? We consider how 218 FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INqUIRY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYFOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INqUIRY measurements and chains of scientific reasoning have allowed us to reconstruct the Big Bang by measur- ing little wisps of light reaching the earth, to learn about subatomic particles by use of many-mile-long machines, and to combine the two to understand the universe as a whole from the subatomic particles of which it is composed. Natural Science I: How Things Work MAP-UA 214 Offered every year. Adler, Grier, Stein. 4 points. Do you know how electricity is generated? How instruments create music? What makes refrigerator magnets stick? For that matter, why ice skating is possible, how wheels use friction, and why someone can quickly remove a tablecloth without moving any dishes? All of the devices that define contemporary living are applications of basic scientific discoveries. The principles underlying these devices are fascinat-ing as well as useful and help to explain many of the features of the world around us. Covers basic principles of physics by examining selected devices such as CD and DVD players, microwave ovens, the basic electronic components of computers, lasers and LEDs, magnetic resonance imaging as used in medicine, and even nuclear weapons. In learning the basic physics behind these modern inventions, you develop a deeper understanding of how the physical world works and gain a new appreciation of everyday phenomena.

We are currently witnessing a revolution in human genetics, where the ability to scrutinize and manipulate DNA has allowed scientists to gain unprecedented insight into the role of heredity. Begins with an overview of the principles of inheri-tance, where simple Mendelian genetics is contrasted with the interactions of genes and environment that influence complex physical or behavioral traits. Descending to the molecular level, we investigate how genetic information is encoded in DNA and examine the science and social impact of genetic technology, including topics such as cloning, genetic testing, and the human genome project. Concludes by studying how genes vary in populations and how geneticists are contributing to our understanding of human evolution and diversity. Natural Science II: Human Origins MAP-UA 305 Offered every year. Anton, Bailey, Disotell, Harrison. 4 points. The study of \"human origins\" is an interdisciplinary endeavor that involves a synthesis of research from a number of different areas of science. Introduces students to the various approaches and methods used by scientists to investigate the origins and evo-lutionary history of our own species. Topics include reconstructing evolutionary relationships using molecular and morphological data; the mitochon-drial Eve hypothesis; ancient DNA; human variation and natural selection; the use of stable isotopes to reconstruct dietary behavior in prehistoric humans; solving a 2,000-year-old murder mystery; the impor- tance of studies of chimpanzees for understanding human behavior; and the four-million-year-old fossil evidence for human evolution. Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior MAP-UA 306 Offered every semester. Glimcher, Hawken, Kiorpes, Suzuki. 4 points. Explores the relationship of the brain to behav- ior. Begins with the basic elements that make up the nervous system and how electrical and chemical signals in the brain work to affect behavior. Examines how the brain learns and how it creates new behaviors, together with the brain mechanisms that are involved in sensory experience, movement, hunger and thirst, sexual behaviors, the experience of emotions, perception and cognition, and memory and the brain's plasticity. Other key topics include whether certain behavioral disorders like schizophre- nia and bipolar disorder can be accounted for by changes in the function of the brain and how drugs can alter behavior and brain function. Natural Science II: The Body\u2014How It Works MAP-UA 309 Offered every year. Goldberg. 4 points. The human body is a complex system of mutually interdependent molecules, cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems. Examines the human body with the goal of understanding how physiological systems operate at these varying levels. Examples include the circulation of blood, the function of our muscles, the utilization of oxygen in respiration, and how our immune system detects and fights foreign invaders. Disturbing the delicate balance of these systems 219 FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INqUIRY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYFOUNDATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC INqUIRY can produce various human diseases, which are also examined throughout. Laboratory work provides firsthand experience with studying molecular processes, cell structures, and physiological systems. Natural Science II: The Molecules of Life MAP-UA 310 Offered every year. Jordan, Kallenbach. 4 points. Our lives are increasingly influenced by the availabil- ity of new pharmaceuticals, ranging from drugs that lower cholesterol to those that influence behavior. Critical to the function of such biomolecules is their three-dimensional structure that endows them with a specific function. Examines the chemistry and biology of biomolecules that make up the molecular machinery of the cell. Begins with the principles of chemical binding, molecular structure, and acid-base properties that govern the structure and function of biomolecules. Applies these principles to study the varieties of protein architecture and how enzymes facilitate biochemical reactions. Concludes with an overview of molecular genetics and how recent information from the Human Genome Project is stimulating new approaches in diagnosing disease and designing drug treatments. Natural Science II: Lessons from the Biosphere MAP-UA 311 Offered every year. Volk. 4 points. Provides a foundation of knowledge about how earth's biosphere works. This includes the biggest ideas and findings about biology on the global scale\u2014the scale in which we live. Such knowledge is especially crucial today because we humans are perturbing so many systems within the biosphere. Major topics: (1) Evolution of Life: How did life come to be what it is today? (2) Life's Diversity: What is life like today on the global scale? (3) Cycles of Matter: How do life and the nonliving environ- ment interact? (4) The Human Guild: How are humans changing the biosphere, and how might we consider our future within the biosphere? Includes laboratory experiments and an exploration at the American Museum of Natural History.Natural Science II: The Brain: A User's Guide MAP-UA 313 Offered every year. Azmitia. 4 points. The human brain is the most complex organ. Despite the central position it has in nearly every aspect of our daily lives, it remains to many a mystery. How does it work? How can we care for it? How long will it function? We learn about the func-tions of the cortex in higher learning and memory, as well as discuss the basic work of the brain stem in regulating the internal environment of the body. The importance of nutrition on neurotransmitter synthesis, the function of sleep on memory and why we need so much of it, and the effects of alcohol and drugs on brain harmony and the meaning of addic- tion are covered. We look at brain development and the special needs of children, as well as brain aging and illness and the difficulty of helping. Laboratories provide hands-on experience in exploring the structure of the brain, as well as learning how to measure brain function. Natural Science II: Genomes and Diversity MAP-UA 314 Offered every year. Siegal. 4 points. Millions of species of animals, plants, and microbes inhabit our planet. Genomics, the study of all the genes in an organism, is providing new insights into this amazing diversity of life. We begin with the fun- damentals of DNA, genes, and genomes. We then explore microbial diversity, with an emphasis on how genomics can reveal many aspects of organisms, from their ancient history to their physiological and ecological habits. We follow with examinations of animal and plant diversity, focusing on domesticated species, such as dogs and tomatoes, as examples of how genomic methods can be used to identify genes that underlie new or otherwise interesting traits. Genomics has also transformed the study of human diversity and human disease. We examine the use of DNA to trace human ancestry, as well as the use of genomics as a diagnostic tool in medicine. With the powerful new technologies to study genomes has come an increased power to manipulate them. We conclude by considering the societal implications of this ability to alter the genomes of crop plants, livestock, and, potentially, humans.220 FRENCH C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYmajor in french The prerequisite for admission to the program is a satisfactory knowledge of the French language.

Attendance at New York University in Paris counts toward such residence. The student must maintain a general GPA of at least 3.65 and a major average of 3.65 or higher. Students who wish to pursue honors should apply to the departmental director of honors during their junior year. Requirements for Honors: Completion of all major requirements (above). In addition to enrollment in a Senior Seminar (FREN-UA 991, 992), candidates for French honors must enroll in Honors Thesis (FREN-UA 995), a 4-point course taken over both semesters of the senior year (2 points in the fall, 2 points in the spring). This Honors Thesis course sequence cannot count toward completion of the credit requirements for the French major. The honors thesis should be a work of scholarship and/or criticism in the field of French literature, culture, or Francophonie. The thesis is ordinarily written in French (25 pages minimum); exceptionally, students may petition to write it in English (40 to 60 pages). The seminar professor and the thesis adviser determine based on this work and an oral defense whether to recommend the student for an honors degree. A grade of at least A- is required for the award of honors in French. Internships In addition to the basic requirements for the major, students also have the opportunity to participate in intern- ships sponsored by the Department of French. Recent internships have been completed at the French cultural services office, the French music office, and the French film office. For more information, please contact the undergraduate administrative aide. Internships and independent studies do not count toward the French major, except with special permission of the department. accelerated B. a./m.a. Program in f rench or f rench Studies The Department of French and the Institute of French Studies offer qualified students the opportunity to earn the B.A. and M.A. degrees in a shortened period of study. While still undergraduates, students enrolled in the program may earn up to 12 points toward the M.A. by completing three graduate courses in the Department of French or at the Institute of French Studies. To earn advanced standing, these points may not be counted toward an undergraduate degree, but must be in excess of the 128 points required for the B.A. Under normal circumstances, this can be achieved by students who register for the maximum allowable number of points in their senior year. Earned in this manner, advanced standing has the additional advantage of enabling qualified students to start graduate work at an earlier stage and in the most cost-efficient way. Admission to the program is open to students who have completed between 48 and 96 credits with a GPA of at least 3.5 and a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher in the major. Application to the program can be made through the director of undergraduate studies in French. Final acceptance into the graduate sequence of the program 223 FRENCH C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF FRENCH is contingent on successful completion of the B.A., formal admission into the Graduate School of Arts and Science, and acceptance of the student's application.

The chaotic Weimar period (1918-33) began with a revolution and ended with the takeover by the Nazis. During these few years, German modernism evolved from expressionism to the aesthetics of new sobriety (Neue Sachlichkeit). From the more traditional (Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse) to the experimen- tal and revolutionary (Bertolt Brecht, Anna Seghers), the works of this period draw into question its subsequent glorification as the golden '20s. Readings include works by Brecht, Hesse, Roth, Seghers, Klaus Mann, and Thomas Mann. Minority Discourses GERM-UA 475 Offered periodically. 4 points. In recent years, literary productions have emerged that fall under the heading of \"minority\" literatures, often understood as texts written in German by so-called foreigners. This course examines this notion critically and also analyzes the impact of individual works in relation to current debates on multicultur-alism, integration, and national identity. Seminar on 19thCentury Authors GERM-UA 487 Offered periodically. 4 points. Seminar on 20thCentury Authors GERM-UA 488 Offered periodically. 4 points.

After a brief theoretical introduction to foodways literature, we examine cookery and culinary representation in the classical Islamic period as background for the modern era. Colonialism and a transition in the economic position of the Middle East transformed both the culinary preferences of the region's inhabitants and relations between indigenous Jews and other religious communities. By the mid-20th century, most Middle Eastern Jews had immigrated to Europe, the United States, or Israel, further impacting their foodways.

Differences between traditional and modern cultural uses of the Bible are highlighted.Honors Seminar: Jewish Representations of Christianity HBRJD-UA 802 Prerequisite: admission to the depart- mental honors program. Offered every three years. 4 points. Explores the various ways that Christianity has been represented in Jewish sources from late antiquity through the Middle Ages. Particular attention is paid to the complex interface of the two traditions and the polemical attempts to draw sharp lines distinguishing them. The exploration of the status of alterity is a key factor in determining the boundaries that set the contours of identity of a given group. In this way, studying the representation of Christianity in Jewish sources discloses much about the cultural formation of Judaism.

How is it that the dead speak? In what way can the past be said to survive in the present\u2014tragically? These are the questions around which Yannis Ritsos's The Fourth Dimension is organized. Composed of a series of dramatic monologues that move between the past and the present, the dead and the living, Ritsos's poem demands that we think about the relations between memory, history, and language. This course traces Ritsos's poetic strategies by reading and reconstructing the classical intertexts that inform The Fourth Dimension. In each instance, it seeks to analyze the reasons behind his appropriations, distortions, revisions, and translations of these classical texts. Greek Diaspora: Odyssean Metaphors from Homer to Angelopoulos HEL-UA 333 Identical to COLIT-UA 333. Offered every other year. 4 points. Greek stories and myths of dispersal, settlement, and return have provided Western culture with some of its foundational fictions.

It is also a method of thinking characterized by its attention to the contexts in which people have lived and worked. By mastering this method of thinking, students of history gain invaluable skills and techniques. They learn to analyze and interpret many different kinds of evidence (cultural, social, economic, and politi-cal), as well as to organize it into a coherent whole and present it clearly and with style in written or oral form. In doing so, students also learn to justify and question their own and others' conclusions, for history is always an argument about what actually happened. Indeed, rethinking and revising accepted historical conclusions is one of the most important\u2014and most interesting\u2014tasks of the historian. Notable among the department's areas of scholarly strength are American urban, social, labor, and ethnic history; medieval, early modern, and modern European history; Latin American history; sub-Saharan African history; early and modern Asian history, and American and European women's history. The department also pays particular attention to the transnational and global aspects of the discipline. At the core of the undergraduate experience are Historical Studies: Theory and Practice (HIST-UA 101) and the advanced seminar. In Historical Studies 101, students learn about the practice of history through both lectures and an intense workshop experience. In the advanced seminar, usually taken in the senior year, students research and write an original paper (typically 25 pages). Through independent study and the honors program, students find challenging opportunities for special concentrations and individual research. The internship program enables students to engage in special kinds of supervised historical projects for credit. Many of the projects are at cultural institutions in New York and at the United Nations. The University's Elmer Holmes Bobst Library is rich in works of history, and students also may also utilize the collections of the New York Public Library, the historical societies and museums in New York City, and neighboring universities.DEPARTMENT OF History260 HISTORY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF HISTORY major The major requires a minimum of nine 4-point courses (36 points) with a grade of C or better in each course. All majors must take Historical Studies: Theories and Practice (HIST-UA 101). The remaining eight courses are to be distributed among three fields of history\u2014American, European, and non-Western (Latin American, Near Eastern, African, or Asian)\u2014so that the student will complete at least two courses in each field. Students must also take one advanced research seminar (prerequisite: HIST-UA 101). One course must be in a period before 1800. No student may take more than three introductory courses (numbered below HIST-UA 100). Note that transfer students must take at least five history courses (20 points) in this department. Certain courses in the Morse Academic Plan (MAP) may also count toward the history major as introductory courses. These are Texts and Ideas and Cultures and Contexts, if they are taught by professors in the Department of History. Also, majoring in history exempts students from taking the Societies and the Social Sciences component of MAP . T wo Liberal Studies courses, Social Foundations I and II, may count toward the major and fulfill the pre- 1800 and a European requirement. No other LS courses may count toward the major. These courses count as introductory. Students must be enrolled in or have already taken Historical Studies: Theories and Practice (HIST-UA 101) to declare the major. minor The minor requires at least four 4-point courses (16 points), of which three courses (12 points) must be taken in the Department of History. No more than one 4-point course may be chosen from the designated related courses offered in other departments. No more than 4 points may be taken in introductory-level courses. Advanced placement credit does not count toward the minor. Note: Students should consult the director of undergraduate studies for possible minor programs, course offer- ings, and course descriptions. A complete listing of history courses currently offered may be found in the current class schedule available in the department. honors Program Students with strong academic records (a GPA of 3.65 in history and 3.65 overall) may apply to the director of undergraduate studies for admission to the history honors program. Students must be declared history majors or have already taken Historical Studies: Theories and Practice (HIST-UA 101) to apply for the program. If students successfully complete the program, they are awarded honors in history, which designation will appear on their diploma. This two-course, 8-point program affords qualified students the opportunity to work closely with faculty members and to conduct extensive research on a topic of their choice. The program is completed in two consecutive semesters and consists of a small Honors Seminar (HIST-UA 994), followed by an individualized Honors T utorial (HIST-UA 996). Normally, the Honors Seminar (which satisfies the advanced research seminar requirement for the major) is taken in the first semester of the senior year. In the seminar, students define a thesis topic of their choice, develop a bibliography, read broadly in background works, and begin their research. A substantial part of the research, usually including a rough draft of the thesis, should be completed by the semester's end. The Honors T utorial, in which students work on a one-to-one basis with a faculty director, follows in the second semester. The honors thesis varies in length from 30 to 70 pages, depending on the nature and scope of the subject. The completed thesis, approved for defense by the director, is defended before a committee consisting of the director and at least one additional faculty member. A grade of at least A- on the thesis is required for the award of honors in history. Students who receive a lower passing grade are simply awarded 8 points toward the major.Program261 HISTORY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF HISTORY Study a way Some courses offered by NYU for study away, as well as other approved programs outside NYU, may be eligible for inclusion in the history major.

As the program is demanding, the number of students who can be admitted is limited to 25 to 30 per year. Therefore, interested students need to submit a formal application by October 15 of their sophomore year. Application forms can be found at the International Relations website: www.politics.as.nyu.edu/page/internationalrelations. Criteria for admission include a strong academic record at NYU (GPA of 3.65 or better), completion of International Politics (POL-UA 700) and either Economic Principles I (ECON-UA 1) or II (ECON-UA 2), and commitment to the field. All majors must complete a total of fourteen 4-point courses (56 points). They must complete four core courses, plus four courses in the international relations environment. Students must also demonstrate proficiency in a foreign language, take two courses in a regional specialization, and complete a semester in a study abroad program. Finally, students must complete the two-course senior honors sequence. In the junior or senior year, students are also encouraged, but not required, to take an internship at one of the many international institutions or agencies located in New York City. Students can only receive academic credit for internships in their junior or senior year. Internships do not count directly toward the IR major. Internship credit is given as general College of Arts and Science credit. Students can pursue internship possibilities through the Department of Politics, the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis, the NYU Wasserman Center for Career Development, and internship opportunities posted on the International Relations website.

It provides students with an opportunity to study the complex web of transnational politics in an in-depth, interdis- ciplinary fashion. The breadth of courses is designed to match the breadth of knowledge and skills that the field requires. Fluency in a foreign language and a semester of study abroad are required of all majors to help ensure that they acquire a deeper understanding of a country's culture and institutions. In their junior or senior year, majors are also encouraged, though not required, to take advantage of the many internship opportunities that are available in New York City to students of international relations.279 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMAJOR IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS IR should meet with the IR undergraduate student adviser (in the Department of Politics) to have their records reviewed and to receive a preliminary assessment of their prospects of being admitted to this major. foreign l anguage Students may satisfy this requirement by completing two courses beyond the intermediate level. It is recom- mended that the language be related to the regional specialization and/or the study abroad site (but not, for example, if the site is London), but it is not required. We encourage students who are already fluent in English and another language to study an additional language at the advanced level. If a student considers himself or herself fluent in a foreign language, he or she can 1) complete the requirement with a third language or 2) take two advanced courses (literature or advanced translation) in the foreign language of the student's fluency. In either case, the student would have to take the two courses past the intermediate level. regional Specialization Majors must complete two 4-point courses focusing on a particular world region in a variety of disciplines, including economics, history, politics, sociology, and area studies. These courses are normally taken during the term abroad. Whether taken at NYU or abroad, both courses must be approved in advance by the director or the undergraduate adviser for IR. Study a broad Students must spend a semester at an NYU program abroad or at one of the universities around the world with which NYU has an exchange agreement. For the most up-to-date information on study abroad opportunities, please see http://www.nyu.edu/global.html. Permission to study at any other site must be petitioned in advance in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students (Silver Center 909, 212-998-8140), after approval by the IR program. Students may study abroad for an entire year, so long as the year abroad will still permit the student to complete the necessary requirements for the major. The student should consult the undergraduate adviser for IR to discuss the possibility of an entire year abroad. Due to the yearlong senior honors sequence, students will not be able to study abroad in their senior year. Senior honors The major constitutes an honors track with emphasis on quantitative methods and techniques, and students must complete the requirements for departmental honors by taking the senior seminar and writing a thesis (INTRL-UA 990, 991). Ir Briefing Session A briefing session on the IR honors major takes place every September. Freshmen and sophomores wishing to apply to the IR honors major should attend the briefing session to learn more about the application process and requirements. coUrSeS core c ourses Students are required to complete International Politics (POL-UA 700) and either Economic Principles I (ECON-UA 1) or Economic Principles II (ECON-UA 2) prior to application.

The study of Irish society and culture provides students with an understanding of Ireland's historical experience: its colonial past; its contribution to literature, both medieval and modern; its far-reaching effect in the modern world through its diaspora; and its dual-language tradition and rival national narratives. The Irish studies minor at NYU offers an interdisciplinary program providing students with the opportunity to study and pursue directed research in the history and culture of Ireland and Irish America, exploring such areas as literature, history, drama, politics, art, cinema studies, music, and the Irish language. A faculty of internationally renowned scholars is supplemented by the regular presence of prominent visiting professors. In addition to the program at Washington Square, NYU in Dublin gives students the opportunity to study in Ireland during the summer. Through the generosity of Lewis L. and Loretta Brennan Glucksman, two landmark houses at Numbers One and T wo Washington Mews were renovated to serve as the home for Ireland House. Since its official opening in 1993, Glucksman Ireland House has become one of the most vibrant centers of Irish and Irish American arts and learning in North America. It offers a lively array of programs that are free to students, including evening courses, public lectures, conferences, films, exhibits, and readings.282 IRISH S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMINOR IN IRISH S TUDIES If accepted, B.A./M.A. candidates will take a graduate course, Irish Studies Seminar I, in the fall semester of their senior year.

We want to educate those who agree. Opportunities abound in the media world, but the opportunity to do compelling work that informs, engages\u2014and matters\u2014is what drives our faculty, motivates our students, and informs our entire approach. Great journalism has always come from the great cities of the globe, and there is no better place to learn the craft than the city of New York\u2014where power and wealth concentrate, news and culture originate, and daily events fascinate. The Institute immerses students in the richness and vitality of the city, while attracting to campus many of the leaders and thinkers in the journalism profession. New York City is our laboratory\u2014and our inspiration. The very first lesson we offer students is this: Tap into it, with our help. NYU students study as interns in almost every major news organization in the city. They often graduate to jobs in newspapers, magazines, broadcast outlets, and online operations headquartered in New York, though some choose to go elsewhere. And every day, students move outward from the classroom to the city, on assignments that take them all over town. The full-time faculty is itself of national stature in the journalism world. As writers, reporters, produc- ers, and critics, NYU professors continue to practice the journalism they teach and preach, holding the profession to its highest standards of public service. Course work begins with the basic skills of reporting, writing, and research, but simultaneously students are taught what journalism at its best can be\u2014and what it should accomplish in a free and democratic society. They are also encouraged to publish their work, with assignments, internships, and online projects geared to this end. Housed within the arts and sciences core of a leading university, the Institute sees journalism as an essential strand in the liberal arts tradition and a critical factor in public culture. But we also recognize that news these days is a business. When our skilled graduates enter that business, they are prepared to improve and enliven it. Institute facilities include seven state-of-the-art newsrooms, new broadcast production facilities, and an array of multimedia equipment, including video cameras, still cameras, digital recorders, and all that is necessary in a rapidly changing news environment.ARTHUR L. CARTER Journalism Institute Program major The Institute offers a B.A. in either journalism or media criticism. In both concentrations, the major consists of eight or nine 4-point courses, for a total of 32 to 36 credits, plus a mandatory second major in another CAS department or program. Thus, all journalism majors are double majors. Students cannot take more than 36 points in journalism, unless they pursue honors, which allows them to take 40 points.297 JOURNALISM C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYARTHUR L. CARTER JOURNALISM INSTITUTE Within the journalism concentration, students choose either the print/online sequence or the broadcast sequence. Journalism students must successfully complete five required courses in their declared print/online or broadcast sequence, as well as three or four Institute-approved or Institute-offered electives. Students in media criticism must successfully complete five required courses in their concentration, one seminar, and two or three electives from a specified list of journalism offerings. All majors must complete a capstone piece in Advanced Reporting, which will allow us to assess their progress at the conclusion of their major. Students in either the journalism or media criticism concentration may also take the new track in computational and digital journalism. The track is in addition to the second major in CAS that is required for all majors, and students still must complete all the required courses in their journalism or media criticism concentration. For students taking this track, the major increases from a minimum of eight 4-point courses (32 points) to eleven 4-point courses (44 points). For honors students pursuing the track in computational and digital journalism, the required minimum for completing the major increases by 4 points.

Students earning grades lower than C must either repeat the course or take an equivalent course, if permitted. Computational and Digital Journalism Track This new sequence of courses responds to an important trend in the news industry and journalism profession: the shift from print and broadcasting to a digital base. There is huge demand for people who have the traditional skills and aptitude of a journalist and enough technical knowledge to redesign a website, create an interactive data feature that can run online, or build a mobile application for a news company. Almost all the employers who have traditionally hired our graduates are experiencing a severe shortage of technical talent. Undergraduate students with ambitions to work in journalism who would like to acquire programming and web skills are perfect candidates for following this track. In addition to acquiring programming, database, and web-design skills, the students will work on projects that test their skills against real-world problems. For journalism majors, the track is in addition to the required second major in CAS; these students must still complete all the required courses of their journalism or media criticism concentration. For students pursuing the computational and digital journalism track, the journalism major increases from a minimum of 32 points to 44 points. (For honors students, the required minimum increases by 4 points.) Journalism students may count up to three courses from this track as electives for their major. The computational and digital journalism track consists of six 4-point courses (24 points): Introduction to Computer Programming (CSCI-UA 2) Introduction to Web Design and Computer Principles (CSCI-UA 4) Database Design and Web Implementation (CSCI-UA 60) Computational Knowledge Management (CSCI-UA 70) Media Technology Projects (CSCI-UA 72) Data Journalism and Investigative Reporting (JOUR-UA 204) For descriptions of CSCI-UA courses, please see the Computer Science section in this Bulletin. honors Juniors and seniors who have maintained a 3.65 overall GPA and a 3.65 in the journalism major are eligible for the two-course, 8-point honors program. Students take a special section of Advanced Reporting (JOUR-UA 351) followed by the Senior Seminar (JOUR-UA 352) to complete a two-semester capstone project. Students enrolled in honors may take a maximum of 40 credits in journalism.299 JOURNALISM C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYARTHUR L.

Latinos are studied in comparative perspective (comparisons within Latino groupings and with other ethnic groups), as well as in transnational perspective in the Americas. Among central issues in Latino studies are the following: race and racialization across the spectrum of African American, white, and indigenous; sexuality and gender formation; immigration and migration in a climate of increased policing of international borders; electoral politics as the Latino vote has increased numerically; social movements for labor, education, and language rights; Latino/a presence in media and film; expressive and popular culture in music and the arts; language retention and invention in the United States in relation to English, Spanish, indigenous languages, and their combinations; and the failures and successes of schooling for Latinos, including bilingual education and levels of educational attainment.MAJOR/MINOR IN Latino Studies307 LATINO S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMAJOR/MINOR IN LATINO S TUDIES Americas by any of the following means: taking elective courses in sociolinguistics; studying these languages beyond the minimum level required by the College of Arts and Science; pursuing community-based internship fieldwork necessitating the development and use of specific language skills; or undertaking study or research abroad in contexts entailing the exercise of key language or linguistic capabilities. minor Five courses are required for the minor in Latino studies: either Approaches to Latino Studies (SCA-UA 501) or Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures (MAP-UA 529), plus four other courses listed by the program.

The 4-point internship program complements and enhances the formal course work of the Latino 308 LATINO S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMAJOR/MINOR IN LATINO S TUDIES studies major. Students intern at agencies dealing with a range of issues pertaining to Latino studies and take a corequisite seminar that enables them to focus the work experience in meaningful academic terms. The goals of the internship are threefold: (1) to allow students to apply the theory they have gained through course work, (2) to provide students with analytical tools, and (3) to assist students in exploring professional career paths. The internship is open to juniors and seniors and requires an interview and permission of the director of internships. elective c ourses Latino/a Art and Performance in New York City SCA-UA 532 4 points. Looks at the history of Latino/a art and performance in the context of New York City. In particular, students study Latino/a aesthetic practices within and against the social-political environment of their enactment. Latinos' role in the continually redefined realm of hip-hop, the extensive history of Latino contributions to the artistic vitality of the Lower East Side, and the theatrical production of Latino-specific community theatres represent a few of the areas that are explored. Students consider contemporary Latino art, and the institutions that support it, from the perspective of the changing Latino demographic of New York City. Furthermore, students examine and analyze the specific ways that artists utilize the city as a site for artistic possibility. This course brings together both an investigation of the aesthetics of Latino performance and an inves- tigation of democratic possibilities of urban space. In addition to the weekly seminar meeting, students are required to attend several performances, visit art galleries, and execute a research project profiling a particular artist or institution. Latino/a Popular Culture SCA-UA 534 4 points. Latinos are at the heart of numerous genres of popu- lar culture production: music, film, graphic novels, performance. This course examines contemporary popular culture products by and for Latinos, looking in particular at issues of production, circulation, and consumption. Is popular culture a site of Latino/a cultural expression, how and in what ways? How is it circulated and consumed, how is it mediated by different culture industries? What do we even mean by Latino/a popular culture? These and more questions are considered through a range of interdisciplinary studies.Latino/a Sexualities SCA-UA 536 4 points. Examines the study of sexuality as it pertains to the production and representation of Latino/a identities. Students consider the integral roles scholarship and literature on/about Latino/a sexuality have played in the history of the broader U.S. feminist movement, feminist theory, and GLBTQ studies. The course begins with the examination of classic Chicana feminist texts and the anthropological study of Latino sexual practices in light of their influential interventions in U.S. studies on gender and sexuality since the 1980s and early 1990s. Students then explore more recent contributions by Latino scholars that disrupt the simplistic ways in which Latino/a sexuality has been taken up as an exotic and radical departure from foundational work on sexuality. Students engage sexuality in its plurality, examining multiple imaginings of Latino/a sexuality through fiction, performance theory, queer Latino/a critiques, and studies on emerging Latino masculinities. The Latinized City, New York and Beyond SCA-UA 540 Prerequisite: Approaches to Latino Studies (SCA-UA 501), an introductory course in the social sciences, or a MAP Cultures and Contexts course. D\u00e1vila. Offered every year. 4 points. Examines the Latinization of urban landscapes in New York City and beyond. Considers the economic and political factors that have historically fueled the immigration of Latin American peoples to U.S. cit- ies, their incorporation into U.S. society and culture, and the impact of global economic restructuring of U.S. cities on urban race/ethnic relations and cultural politics. Other topics include the contesta-tion of space and power in the global cities, issues of immigration and citizenship, and the politics of languages. Students also develop fieldwork projects geared to discovering the history and present-day landscapes of Latino New York. T opics in Latino Studies SCA-UA 541 4 points. Possible issues, which vary from semester to semester, include race and racism, politics, migration and immigration, language, assimilation, education, labor, citizenship, social movements, and expressive culture. Cultural Spaces of Latinidad SCA-UA 557 4 points. Examines the contemporary production and mean- ings of Latino/Hispanic identities in the United States. Looks at the spaces and institutions where 309 LATINO S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMAJOR/MINOR IN LATINO S TUDIES this identity is produced and contested and explores how its definition has changed since it was first felt and then officially recognized by the U.S. census. Also examines representations of Latino/a identity in relation to the very real Latino/a populations that now make up the largest \"minority\" in the United States. For most of the course, explores differences and similarities in the politics of Latinidad in four important, yet not exclusive, \"spaces\" involved in the production and representation of Latinidad: the culture industries, urban politics, transnational processes, and contemporary polemics that reach the \"mainstream.\" In other words, this course is designed to theorize Latinidad, in particular \"fields of cultural production,\" whether geographic, institutional, or imaginary. Discusses students' individual research projects for the remainder of the course. Asks students to select a particular \"space\" involved in the production of Latinidad for further study. AfroLatino Culture and History SCA-UA 565 Offered every fall. 4 points. Examines the profound sociological and cultural implications of the growing Afro-Latino presence in light of recent theorizing on race and diasporas. After an overview of the historical background of African-descended peoples in the Spanish-speaking Americas, we then trace the longstanding social experience of black Latinos in the United States. Along with a discussion of migration patterns and community formations, we focus on narrative accounts of Afro-Latino life and on the traditions of cultural expression. Special attention is paid to Afro-Latino poetry and to the rich history of Afro-Latino music through the generations, from rumba, mambo, and Cubop to salsa, Latin soul, and hip-hop. Finally, we turn to the possible theoretical and political consequences of this increasingly self-conscious transnational identity formation. Caribbean Women Writers SCA-UA 570 4 points. Focuses on texts by Latinas of Caribbean origin whose work explores the intersections between history, gender, nation, and sexuality. Analyzing how contemporary Caribbean-origin literature by Latinas can be read as a manifestation of the complex histories of colonialism, military intervention, and political maneuverings between the United States and the Caribbean in the 20th century, the course considers the ways in which the \"tropicalized\" Latina body came to represent an insidious and seductive threat to the U.S. domestic landscape. The course addresses questions such as, What are the politics behind demeaning, fetishizing, and vilifying Latinas in the U.S. media? What role do women of Caribbean origin play in propagating, preserving, or undermining U.S. domestic life? Readings include prose, poetry, film, and music by authors and artists of Cuban, Dominican, Haitian, and Puerto Rican origin, emphasizing the diverse ways in which Caribbean-origin Latinas affect and are affected by the United States. This course is based on students' active participation in class discussion, weekly response papers, presentations, and a research paper. Postmodern Travel Fictions SCA-UA 572 Offered in the spring. 4 points. This is a study of travel narratives by post-World War II authors/filmmakers of the Americas. Designed to investigate relationships existing between travel narratives and legacy of colonialism in the Americas; between the concept of \"freedom\" embodied in travel writing and the ideology of con-quest engraved in historical memory; and between lost idealism of youth and melancholic romps across continents; and between literary representation and the perpetuation of racialized myths about North and South America. Emphasis on gendered dynamic of travel writing. How are notions of freedom and mobility tied to sexuality? Why do the protagonists of novels and films\u2014white, black, Latino, Asian American, or indigenous\u2014\"go West,\" South, East, or North? Why do they ping-pong among these geographic and symbolic poles? What are the evalua- tive meanings assigned to the cartographically given spaces these protagonists choose to visit and these authors/directors choose to revise in their novels and films? related courses amerIcaN S TUdIeS Comparative U.S. Ethnic Studies SCA-UA 224 Offered every fifth semester. 4 points.

The requirements are as follows: One core course, chosen from: Law and Society (LWSOC-UA 1 001), cross-listed with Politics (POL-UA 335) Law and Society (LWSOC-UA 1 002), cross-listed with Sociology (SOC-UA 413) Four elective courses selected from \"Elective Courses\" under Course Offerings below. To ensure the minor's interdisciplinary character, no more than two of these four may be from any one department. Since the subject for Topics in Law and Society (LWSOC-UA 251 or LWSOC-UA 252) varies from semester to semester, students may take more than one topics course. With special permission, exceptional students may be allowed, in their senior year and in consultation with the minor adviser, to substitute one of the following for one of the four elective courses: (1) an independent study involving a research paper or project, (2) an apprenticeship with a faculty member doing relevant research (with permission of faculty), or (3) a relevant graduate course (with permission of faculty). Note: Courses applied to this minor cannot be double-counted toward a major or another minor.

The law and society minor, administered by the Department of Sociology, offers undergraduates a meaningful cluster of these courses. The requirement of five courses allows this interdisciplinary minor to be substantial; the inclusion of a core course enhances its coherence. In addition, the minor gives capable and ambitious students attractive opportunities to pursue advanced or specialized study. While prelaw students may well wish to take it, this minor is not aimed specifically at them. Students wishing to declare this minor should see Jamie Lloyd, Student Services Administrator for the Department of Sociology, 295 Lafayette Street, Room 4168.PROGRAM IN Law and Society core c ourses Law and Society LWSOC-UA 1 001 Identical to POL-UA 335. Offered once a year, usually in the fall. 4 points. An introduction to the study of law as a political practice. We treat law as a political practice from multiple disciplinary standpoints, examining how law and a range of legal institutions embody and constitute political, cultural, economic, and social forces. We examine the mobilization of rights, the use of litiga- tion, and vernacular legal discourse, largely within coUrSeS312 LAW AND SOCIETY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYPROGRAM IN LAW AND SOCIETY the context of the United States, but with reference to transnational struggles. In the course of doing so, we study the relationship between making social policy and the use of litigation by social movements. Specifically, we study litigation strategies at the appel- late and trial levels by focusing on three sociolegal movements: the civil rights movement, the women's movement, and class-action tort cases. What are the political dimensions of legal arguments and legal remedies for racial and gender discrimination and toxic torts? Under what conditions is law an empow- ering and/or effective political resource? What are the limits of legality in the making of social change?

Three courses freely chosen from the offerings of the department, except for the courses recommended for nonmajors. It is highly recommended that majors and joint majors take the courses in the first three groups first, since other courses have these as prerequisites or generally presuppose their content. No grade lower than C may be counted toward the major or toward a joint major. All linguistics majors, joint majors, and combined majors must register for linguistics courses through the direc- tor of undergraduate studies in the linguistics department.

It seeks to determine that which is necessary in human lan- guage, that which is possible, and that which is impossible. While linguists work to determine the unique qualities of individual languages, they are constantly searching for linguistic universals\u2014properties whose explanatory power reaches across languages. The discipline of linguistics is organized around syntax (the principles by which sentences are organized), morphology (the principles by which words are constructed), semantics (the study of meaning), phonetics (the study of speech sounds), phonology (the sound patterns of language), historical linguistics (the ways in which languages change over time), sociolinguistics (the interaction of language with society), psycho- linguistics, and neurolinguistics (the representation of language in the brain). Current research by faculty members extends across the field, including topics in the interaction of syntax and semantics, phonetics and phonology, languages in contact, pidgin and creole languages, urban sociolinguistics, and computer analogies of syntactic processes.DEPARTMENT OF Linguistics314 LINGUISTICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS If any course fulfills the major or minor requirements in any other department or program at NYU, it may not be used simultaneously to fulfill the requirements for any of the linguistics majors.

If any course fulfills the major or minor requirements in any other department or program at NYU, it may not be used simultaneously to fulfill the requirements for the linguistics minor. recommended Work o utside the d epartment To meet standards currently set in the linguistics field, as well as graduate school admission requirements, stu- dents majoring in linguistics are advised to gain competence in the following areas during their undergraduate studies: (1) one or more foreign languages, (2) psychology, for issues of language and the mind, and anthropol- ogy, for issues of language and culture, (3) mathematics or logic, for an understanding of modern algebra and mathematical logic, (4) philosophy of language, and (5) one or more computer languages. Majors and minors should avail themselves of the NYU study away programs. Note that any course substitution or transfer credit toward a required course for the major must be confirmed by a letter from the director of undergraduate studies. honors in l inguistics The Department of Linguistics, in accordance with the requirements for departmental honors that was passed by the Faculty of Arts and Science in spring 2005, offers an honors degree in linguistics. The requirement for graduation with honors in linguistics is an honors thesis of 40 to 50 pages, typically the culmination of a year's work, and two advanced courses chosen with the honors thesis adviser.317 LINGUISTICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS Students who are excelling in the linguistics major are highly encouraged to develop an Honors project as early as the second semester of their sophomore year, even though students do not officially apply to the Honors Program until the second semester of their junior year. It is expected that students who pursue Honors work in the Department of Linguistics have sufficient preparation and background (i.e., high-level coursework) in a field of linguistics, which is not always the case for joint majors in French/German/Italian/Spanish and Linguistics. Admission to the honors program requires an application in the second semester of junior year. It normally requires a GPA of 3.65 overall, as well as in linguistics, but this requirement can be waived by the College of Arts and Science director of college honors in exceptional circumstances by petition from the director of undergraduate studies. The application must be made by April 15 to the director of undergraduate studies. The application consists of an application form and a one- to two-page description of the topic that the student wishes to investigate in the thesis. The student must identify a faculty member in Linguistics who has agreed to work with the student. The description of the thesis is written in consultation with the faculty adviser. The student will be notified by May 1 about acceptance into the Honors program. If the student is accepted, the faculty member who has agreed to supervise the student's honors thesis will become the student's honors adviser, and the two courses for honors will be chosen jointly by the student and the adviser. Joint honors The Department of Linguistics offers joint honors in all programs for which it offers joint majors: language and mind, anthropology and linguistics, French and linguistics, German and linguistics, Italian and linguistics, and Spanish and linguistics. For the requirements of joint honors in anthropology and linguistics, students should see Professor John Singler. For the requirements of language and mind, students should follow the same procedure for honors in linguistics, except that their proposal should identify faculty members from two departments in the language and mind major (linguistics, philosophy, and psychology), and these two faculty members will be co-advisers. The thesis topic, needless to say, should reflect contributions to both disciplines. Students interested in pursuing joint honors in linguistics and French, German, Italian, or Spanish should consult with the director of undergraduate studies for linguistics, as well as the other department, in the second semester of their junior year. coUrSeS Language LING-UA 1 Offered every semester. Baltin, Collins, Gallagher, Gouskova, Szabolcsi. 4 points. Nature or nurture? Linguistics is a science that systematically addresses this puzzle, and it offers a uniquely interesting support for the answer: both. Language is a social phenomenon, but human languages share elaborate and specific structural properties. The conventions of speech communities exist, exhibit variation, and change within the strict confines of universal grammar, part of our biologi- cal endowment. Universal grammar is discovered through the careful study of the structures of individual languages, by cross-linguistic investiga- tions, and the investigation of the brain. In this way, linguistics mediates between cognitive science and social science. This course introduces some funda- mental properties of the sound system and of the structure and interpretation of words and sentences, set into this context. Communication: Men, Minds, and Machines LING-UA 3 Offered every year. Dougherty. 4 points. Examines signs and symbols in the communication of humans, primates, birds, computers, automata, simulata, and more and discusses definitions of such concepts as sign, symbol, intelligence, artificial intel- ligence, mind, cognition, and meaning. Concerns the matter expressed by the symbol systems and the manner in which the matter is expressed: literally, abstractly, metaphorically, as a simile, by insinuation, and other methods.318 LINGUISTICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS Introduction to Semantics LING-UA 4 Prerequisite: Language (LING-UA 1), Language and Mind (LING-UA 28), or permission of the instructor. Offered every year. Barker, Szabolcsi. 4 points. Focuses on the compositional semantics of sentences. Introduces set theory, propositional logic, and predicate logic as tools and goes on to investigate the empirical linguistic issues of presuppositions, quan- tification, scope, and polarity. Points out parallelisms between the nominal and the verbal domains. Introduction to Psycholinguistics LING-UA 5 Offered occasionally. Davidson. 4 points. We easily recognize printed and spoken words, understand novel and complex sentences, and produce fluent speech thousands of times each day. It is also remarkable that children seem to learn the sounds and structures of their native languages with little effort. Psycholinguistics aims to understand the mental processes that underlie both the representa- tion and acquisition of language. Topics covered include language acquisition, speech perception, lexical representation and access, sentence produc- tion, and the relationship between phonology and orthography. Sound and Language LING-UA 11 Offered at least every fall. Davidson, Gallagher, Gouskova, Guy. 4 points. Introduction to phonetic and phonological theory at an elementary level. Topics include the descrip- tion and analysis of speech sounds, the anatomy and physiology of speech, speech acoustics, and phonological processes. Students develop skills to distinguish and produce sounds used in the languages of the world and to transcribe them using the International Phonetic Alphabet. Phonological Analysis LING-UA 12 Prerequisite: Sound and Language (LING-UA 11) or permission of the instructor. Offered at least every spring. Davidson, Gouskova. 4 points. Introduction to phonology, the area of linguistics that investigates how languages organize sounds into highly constrained systems. The fundamental questions include the following: What do the sound systems of all languages have in common? How can they differ from each other? What is the nature of phonological processes, and why do they occur? Students develop analytical skills by solving phonological problems based on data from a wide variety of languages.Grammatical Analysis LING-UA 13 Prerequisite: Language (LING-UA 1), Language and Mind (LING-UA 28), or permission of the instructor. Offered at least every fall. Baltin, Collins, Harves. 4 points. What determines the sequencing of words in a given language? How can we explain word-order variation within and across languages? Are there universal syntactic properties common to the grammar of all languages? This course presents the motivation for the modern generative approach to the scientific study of language and systematically develops a model that will account for the most basic syntactic constructions of natural language. Skills in scientific argumentation and reasoning are developed by analyzing problems in the syntax of English and a number of other languages. Language Change LING-UA 14 Offered every other year. Costello. 4 points. Introduces students to the methods of genealogi-cal classification and subgrouping of languages. Examines patterns of replacement in phonology, morphology, and syntax. Focuses on internal and comparative phonological, morphological, and syntactic reconstruction. Considers phonological developments such as Grimm's, Grassmann's, and Verner's Laws, in detail. Language and Society LING-UA 15 Identical to SCA-UA 701. Offered every year. Guy, Singler. 4 points. Considers contemporary issues in the interaction of language and society, particularly work on speech variation and social structure. Focuses on ways in which social factors affect language. Topics include language as a social and political entity; regional, social, and ethnic speech varieties; bilingualism; and pidgin and creole languages. Grammatical Analysis II LING-UA 16 Prerequisite: Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13). Offered every other year. Harves. 4 points. A continuation of Grammatical Analysis, offering an in-depth examination of various topics in syntax. The primary course objective is to introduce students to primary literature in syntactic theory in order to further develop their critical reading and writing skills so that they may carry out an independent research project of their own. Topics will vary from year to year and may include (but are not limited to) binding theory, control, case theory, constraints on 319 LINGUISTICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS movement, antisymmetry, argument structure and applicatives, ellipsis, and derivation by phase. The IndoEuropean Family LING-UA 17 Offered occasionally. Costello. 4 points. Presents the phonological and morphological systems of Proto-Indo-European and considers the development thereof in the major branches of the Indo-European family of languages, in particular Indic, Hellenic, Slavic, Italic, and Germanic. Bilingualism LING-UA 18 Offered occasionally. Blake, Singler, Vrzic. 4 points. Examines bilingualism and multilingualism in New York City and around the world, at the level of the individual and of society. Considers the social forces that favor or inhibit bilingualism, as well as the edu-cational consequences of bilingual education (and of monolingual education for bilingual children). Also examines the impact of bilingualism on the languages involved. Special attention is paid to code switching, the practice of using two languages in a single speech event, with particular reference to its psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic aspects. Structure of English Vocabulary LING-UA 19 Offered occasionally. Costello. 4 points. Deals with the origins of structures of English words. Whereas 97 percent of the vocabulary of Old English was Germanic, over 80 percent of the present-day vocabulary is borrowed. This course focuses on the portion that is borrowed from the classical languages (Latin and Greek) either directly or indirectly through French. Examines the historical and sociolinguistic circumstances of borrowing and the stem-affix structure of borrowed words, together with the regularities of their pronunciation and meaning. Relies on elementary phonology, morphol-ogy, and semantics; recommended for nonmajors. Sex, Gender, and Language LING-UA 21 Identical to SCA-UA 712. Offered in the spring. Vasvari. 4 points. Examines gender from a multidisciplinary perspec- tive and in particular as a sociolinguistic variable in speech behavior. How do linguistic practices both reflect and shape our gender identity, and how do these reflect more global socio-cultural relation-ships between the sexes? Do women and men talk differently? To what degree do these differences seem to be universal or variable across cultures? How do dominant gender-based ideologies function to constrain women's and men's choices about their gender identities and gender relationships? How does gendered language intersect with race and class-linked language? How is it challenged by linguistic \"gender bending\"? What impact does gendered language have on the power relationships in given societies? Also examines gendered voices\u2014 and silences\u2014in folklore and in literature. Asks how particular linguistic practices contribute to the production of people as \"women and men\"? African American English I: Language and Culture LING-UA 23 Identical to SCA-UA 799. Offered every other year. Blake. 4 points. Introduces the language behavior of African Americans. Discusses African American Vernacular English in terms of its linguistic and cultural distinc-tiveness, both intrasystemically and in comparison with other dialects of American English. Relates the English vernacular spoken by African Americans in urban settings to creole languages spoken on the South Carolina Sea Islands (Gullah), in the Caribbean, and in West Africa. Also approaches the subject from the perspective of the history of the expressive uses of African American Vernacular English, and the educational, attitudinal, and social implications connected with the language. Computational Principles of Sentence Construction LING-UA 24 Prerequisite: Language (LING-UA 1) or Language and Mind (LING-UA 28). Offered every year. Barker, Dougherty. 4 points. Introduces students to the basic computational tools available for formulating linguistic and psycholin-guistic models of competence and performance. Discusses classical problems in perception and description of verb-particle constructions, questions, passives, and garden-path sentences. Considers how parsers operate in structurally different languages such as Chinese and English. Students learn suffi-cient computer skills (Unix, Lisp, and Prolog) to run public domain programs that model a human being's language production and perception capacities. Students have computer accounts and obtain hands- on experience with artificial intelligence and expert systems programs using symbolic logical-based computer languages. They may base their research on existing programs or write their own. Languages in Contact LING-UA 25 Prerequisite: Language (LING-UA 1), Language and Mind (LING-UA 28), or permission of the instructor. Offered occasionally. Singler. 4 points. Language contact changes languages. This course 320 LINGUISTICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS presents a typology of contact, organized both by the nature of the contact and by its linguistic consequences. We consider the impact that contact can have on existing languages, and we pay special attention to the kind of contact that gives rise to new languages and also to the kind that kills languages. Topics include borrowing, bilingualism, language maintenance and language shift, language birth and language death, code switching, diglossia, pidginization and creolization, new Englishes, and mixed languages. Language and Liberation: At Home in the Caribbean and Abroad LING-UA 26 Identical to SCA-UA 163. Offered every other year. Blake. 4 points. Explores the linguistic and cultural transformations that took place in the Commonwealth Caribbean from 17th-century slavery and bond servitude to the present day. Focus is on the extent to which Caribbean people were given or demanded the freedom to create and maintain a postcolonial Caribbean identity. We first discuss the socio-historical conditions that led to the creation of new Caribbean languages called \"pidgins\" and \"creoles\" as the English language was transplanted from Britain to the Third World. We then explore the relationship of the English-based creoles to the social, cultural, political, and literary/expressive aspects of the contexts in which they existed and in which they continue to exist today in the Caribbean as well as in Britain and the United States. As far as possible, par-allels are drawn to French- and Spanish-influenced Caribbean communities. Grammatical Diversity LING-UA 27 Prerequisite: Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13) or permission of the instructor. Offered every year. Collins, Kayne. 4 points. Introduces the syntax of languages quite different from English, from various parts of the world. Considers what they may have in common with English and with each other and how to characterize the ways in which they differ from English and from each other. Language and Mind LING-UA 28 Identical to PSYCH-UA 27. Offered every year. Baltin, Davidson, Marcus, McElree, Murphy, Pylkk\u00e4nen, Szabolcsi. 4 points. Introduces students to the field of cognitive science through an examination of language behavior. Begins with interactive discussions of how best to characterize and study the mind. These principles are then illustrated through an examination of research and theories related to language representation and use. Draws from research in both formal linguistics and psycholinguistics. Morphology LING-UA 29 Offered occasionally. Collins. 4 points. An introduction to the study of the internal structure of words. The two main problems in morphology are (1) how to account for the surface variability of formatives (allomorphy) and (2) how to account for their combinatorial properties (morphosyntax). Beginning from the techniques and problems of structuralist morpheme analysis, two major approaches to allomorphy are introduced: the morpheme-based model and the word-based model. In morphosyntax, we concentrate on the question of to what extent morphological combination is a matter of syntax versus the lexicon. Emphasis is on constructing morphological hypotheses and linguis- tic argumentation. The assignments involve in-depth analyses of data from various languages. Language in Latin America LING-UA 30 Offered every other year. Guy. 4 points. Examines the diversity of language usage in modern Latin America and considers historical perspec-tives as to how the present situation came about. Considers the dialectology of Latin America: how and why American varieties of Spanish and Portuguese differ from European varieties, as well as the distribution and nature of dialect differences in different regions of the Americas. Examines sociolin-guistic issues, such as class and ethnic differences in Spanish and Portuguese in the Americas, the origin and development of standard and nonstandard varieties, and the effects of contact with Amerindian and African languages. Considers Spanish- and Portuguese-based creoles and the question of prior creolization in the popular speech of Brazil, Cuba, and other areas with a substantial population of African descent. Other topics include bilingualism, code switching, language attitudes, the impact of contact with English, and the present status of indigenous languages. Form, Meaning, and the Mind LING-UA 31 Prerequisites: Introduction to Semantics (LING-UA 4) or permission of the instructor, and Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13). Offered every other year. Baltin. 4 points. Deals with the relationship between cognitive organization on the one hand and the interaction 321 LINGUISTICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS between syntax and semantics in natural language. Focuses on the debate within cognitive science as to whether or not the mind is modular (divided into distinct faculties, such as language, vision, and perhaps others). Discusses the relationship of this debate to the debate within linguistics as to whether or not syntax is an autonomous component of a grammar that feeds semantics but does not depend on semantics itself for its functioning. Examines works in cognitive science about modularity and works in linguistics that bear on the question of the autonomy of syntax. Writing Systems of the World LING-UA 33 Offered occasionally. Costello. 4 points. Discusses how various writing systems relate to lan-guage and questions whether writing affects language (and if so, how). The fundamental characteristics of writing are discussed: the communicative purpose of writing, the application of graphical marks on a durable surface, and the achievement of communica- tion by virtue of the marks' conventional relation to language. The evolution of writing is traced. Students compare the writing systems that evolved in Central America, China, Sumer, and Egypt\u2014and their descendants\u2014with respect to their relative advantages and disadvantages, from the points of view of acquisition, the representation of language, and the effective achievement of communication. Meaning and Time LING-UA 34 Offered occasionally. 4 points. We live embedded in the passage of time and conceive of time as the dimension of change. Our languages typically have various ways to refer to time, to distin- guish between past and future, to describe sequences of events, and to set up temporal reasoning patterns. This course deals with the expression of time and tense in different languages and the linguistic, philosophical, and psychological questions that this investigation raises. Issues include the logic of time, temporal metaphors, different kinds of situations, presentation of situations, the semantics of tense, and time, tense, and aspect in narrative discourse. Propositional Attitudes LING-UA 35 Prerequisite: Philosophy of Language (PHIL-UA 85), Introduction to Semantics (LING-UA 4), or permission of the instructor. Offered occasionally. 4 points. Advanced seminar. Investigates the nature of linguistic meaning through an examination of the semantics of sentences that report beliefs and other attitudes toward propositions, such as \"Galileo believed that the earth moves.\" Such sentences have arguably proven problematic for all theories of meaning. We read and discuss pertinent papers by linguists and philosophers; background lectures are given on related issues, such as the semantics of proper names, pronouns, and demonstratives. Registered students are required to make two substantial class presenta- tions and write a detailed research paper. IndoEuropean Syntax LING-UA 36 Offered occasionally. Costello. 4 points. Students are introduced to the study of comparative (Proto-)Indo-European syntax. Methods of recon- structing a protosyntax are presented and compared. The course deals with recent explanations concern-ing the origin and development of a number of parts of speech, including adverbs and prepositions, and syntactic constructions, including absolute, relative, and periphrastic verbal constructions (for example, the passive) in Proto-Indo-European and its descen- dant languages. Reanalysis and grammaticalization are addressed in some detail. Questions concerning the motivation of innovations and their implications for the overall evolution of language are discussed. The Syntax/Semantics Interface: Hungarian LING-UA 37 Prerequisite: Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13) or permission of the instructor. Introduction to Semantics (LING-UA 4) is recom-mended but not required. Offered occasionally. Szabolcsi. 4 points. Hungarian is known as a language that wears its semantics on its syntactic sleeve. Word order transparently identifies the topic and the focus of the sentence and disambiguates the scopes of operators such as \"always,\" \"not,\" and \"everyone.\" This course studies Hungarian from the perspective of theoreti- cal linguistics and asks what this language tells us about how the syntax/semantics interface works in universal grammar. It reviews the fundamentals of Hungarian morphology and syntax and discusses current literature. Not a language course. Pidgin and Creole Languages LING-UA 38 Prerequisite: Language (LING-UA 1), Language and Mind (LING-UA 28), or permission of the instructor. Offered every other year. Singler. 4 points. Examines the pidginized and creolized languages of the world. Addresses three central questions: (1) how pidgins/creoles (P/Cs) come into being, (2) why P/Cs have the properties they do, and (3) why P/Cs\u2014regardless of the circumstances of 322 LINGUISTICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS their genesis\u2014share so many features. Examines P/Cs vis-\u00e0-vis other types of languages, considers the linguistic and social factors that contribute to the genesis of individual P/Cs, and investigates the linguistic characteristics of P/Cs. Geographic focus is on the Atlantic (creoles from the Caribbean and pidgins from West Africa), but pidgins/creoles from the Pacific are also discussed. Language in Use LING-UA 41 Offered occasionally. Guy. 4 points. Living languages in use by a community of speakers are diverse and dynamic. Individuals and groups of speakers differentiate and identify themselves by the way they use language, people can adapt their speech to different listeners in social settings, and speakers develop their linguistic capabilities as they grow older. The language as a whole changes across time. This course examines language not from the standpoint of abstract structural description but from the perspective of how it is actively used in a speech community. We consider theoretical issues, such as how to model diversity in language use, and methodological issues, such as how to study language change while it is under way. We study appropriate quantitative methods for investigating variation across linguistic contexts, speakers, settings, and time. This course has a strong practical focus; students learn how to plan and conduct their own research on language use. Romance Syntax LING-UA 42 Prerequisite: Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13) or permission of the instructor. Offered occasionally. Kayne. 4 points. Introduces the syntax of Romance languages, primarily French, Italian, and Spanish, but also various Romance dialects. Considers what they have in common with each other (and with English) and how best to characterize the ways in which they differ from each other (and from English). Neural Bases of Language LING-UA 43 Identical to PSYCH-UA 300. Prerequisite: Language (LING-UA 1), Language and Mind (LING-UA 28), PSYCH-UA 25, PSYCH-UA 29, or permission of the instructor. Offered every year. Pylkk\u00e4nen. 4 points. What are the brain bases of our ability to speak and understand language? Are some parts of the brain dedicated to language? What is it like to lose language? Provides a state-of-the-art survey of the cognitive neuroscience of language, a rapidly developing multidisciplinary field at the intersection of linguistics, psycholinguistics, and neuroscience. Lectures cover all aspects of language processing in the healthy brain, from early sensory perception to sentence-level semantic interpretation, as well as a range of neurological and development language disorders, including aphasias, dyslexia, and genetic language impairment. Field Methods LING-UA 44 Identical to LING-GA 44. Prerequisite: Phonological Analysis (LING-UA 12), Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13), or permission of the instructor. Offered every year. Collins, Gouskova, Singler. 4 points. A hands-on approach to learning linguistics. Every year, a different language is chosen to investigate. Students interview a native speaker of an unfamiliar language, usually a nonlinguist, to study all aspects of the language's grammar: phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics. They learn to evaluate and organize real, nonidealized linguistic data and to formulate generalizations that then serve as the basis for a research proposal. A unique opportunity to obtain a rich and complete set of data on a new topic of theoretical interest in any field of linguistics. Evolution of Intellectual Complexity LING-UA 45 Offered occasionally. Dougherty. 4 points. How do human perception, cognition, language, and communication relate to the abilities of animals, fossil records, anthropological and archaeological research, cave painting, and physiology? We broadly try to answer the following: What is a likely scenario for human evolution from animal origins? We argue (with Chomsky, Darwin, D'Arcy, Thompson, T uring, Lorenz, Gould) that evolution proceeds in large jumps (saltations) and that slow, gradual evolution via natural selection (per Pinker, Hauser, Fitch, Lieberman) cannot account for human cogni- tive evolution. Readings focus on original works by Darwin, Wallace, D'Arcy, Thompson, Freud, Chomsky, Galileo, and Pinker and include studies by zoologists, linguists, anthropologists, archaeolo-gists, and psychologists. African American English II: Language and Education LING-UA 46 Identical to SCA-UA 800. Offered occasionally. Blake. 4 points. African American English is a distinct dialect of American English that has influenced U.S. and 323 LINGUISTICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS world cultures. Yet, from an educational perspective, its speakers have faced well-documented educational challenges. Explores contemporary, social, linguistic, and educational issues that arise for speakers of African American English in the United States. Topics covered include a history of African American language behavior, politics, and policies around the language, teacher education, language attitudes, culture and curriculum, and controversies about African American English in the schools. Also con-siders how educational issues surrounding African American English compare to other languages and dialects of English. Students have an opportunity to conduct original research. The Language of America's Ethnic Minorities LING-UA 47 Offered every other year. Blake, Singler. 4 points. Examines the role of language in communities in the United States, specifically within African American, Asian American, Latino, and Native American populations. Explores the relationship of language to culture, race, and ethnicity. In particular, looks for similarities and differences across these communities and considers the role that language experiences play in current models of race and ethnicity. Linguistics as Cognitive Science LING-UA 48 Identical to LING-GA 48. Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. Offered every year. Marantz. 4 points. Examines the place of linguistics within cognitive science from multiple perspectives. Foundational questions for a science of linguistics are addressed both from within linguistics and from philosophy and psychology. Issues include the nature of the evidence for constructing grammars, the interpreta- tion of grammatical rules as cognitive or neural operations, the significance of neo-behaviorist approaches to language and computational modeling for a cognitive theory of language, the connection between linguistics theory and genetics, and the importance of sociocultural and historical variation for understanding the nature of language. Students are expected to engage in debate over these issues, bringing to the table their own backgrounds in one of the relevant disciplines, as well as what they learn from the assigned readings. Guest speakers with complementary expertise join the primary instructor for several of the lectures.Endangered Languages LING-UA 50 Offered every other year. Collins. 4 points. The languages of the world are dying off at an alarming rate. We attempt to answer the following questions during the semester: Why do languages die off? If a language dies, does a culture die with it? How is the structure of a language (phonology, morphology, syntax) affected by language death? Why should we care about language endangerment, and is there anything we can do about it? Each student \"adopts\" an endangered language and looks into it extensively during the course of the semester. Attempts to Model Mind and Brain Using Computers LING-UA 53 Prerequisite: Language (LING-UA 1), Language and Mind (LING-UA 28), or permission of the instructor. Offered occasionally. Dougherty. 4 points. We examine the possibility that in the evolution of human and animal brains, no selectional pressure existed for any brain to evolve to understand its own principles of operation. Brain tissues, and the functional capacities correlated with them, evolved to increase perceptual, cognitive, and language capacities to aid in eluding predators, capturing prey, mate selection, nest building, infant rearing\u2014all novel evolved complexity-yielding survival advan- tages. We argue that no survival advantage correlates with the brain's ability to introspect and understand its own operation. We examine novel \"graphically orientated\" computer models of self-replicating machines called \"cellular automata\" by Wolfram (A New Kind of Science) and Kurzweil, which define \"complexity\" that correlates with languages, cognition, and perception. We study Darwin's idea of \"monstrosities\" in relation to human evolution from earlier primates. No hard math is required. Lectures use computer-generated graphics, sound, and animation. Learning to Speak: The First and Second Language Acquisition of Sound LING-UA 54 Prerequisite: Sound and Language (LING-UA 11) or Phonological Analysis (LING-UA 12). Offered occasionally. Davidson. 4 points. Focuses on the acquisition of sound systems by first- and second-language learners. In some ways, these tasks are very similar, but they differ in other crucial aspects. We discuss scientific data from both first- and second-language acquisition of sound systems to understand how humans learn language both in infancy and adulthood. Presupposes an introduction to phonetics, phonology, and/or psycholinguistics.324 LINGUISTICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS Introduction to Morphology at an Advanced Level LING-UA 55 Identical to LING-GA 1029. Prerequisites: Sound and Language (LING-UA 11) and Phonological Analysis (LING-UA 12). Offered every year. Marantz. 4 points. Examines the building blocks of words and sentences: the atomic units of word structure, their hierarchical and linear arrangement, and their phonological realization(s). Provides an introduction to fundamental issues in morphology, including allomorphy, morpheme order, paradigm structure, blocking, and cyclicity. The field of morphology currently embraces much of what goes on in lin-guistics as a whole; syntax, morphology, phonology, semantics, and variation all play an essential role, and their interactions are highlighted here. Introduction to English Grammar LING-UA 56 Offered occasionally. Collins. 4 points. An introductory overview of the grammar of English. No prior knowledge of linguistics is assumed. We survey the major areas of English grammar, including the following: parts of speech (verb, noun, adjective, preposition, adverb), parti- ciples, auxiliary verbs, count and noncount nouns, definite and indefinite articles, subjects, objects, predicates, types of clauses (declarative, interroga- tive, exclamative, imperative), passive versus active verbs, negation, and relative clauses. The course is of interest to students of English literature, English grammar, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, and psychology. Also useful to people thinking of going into language teaching and those interested in improving their writing through greater attention to English grammar. Note: This is not an English as a Second Language (ESL) course. Students are expected to be native speakers of English or to have a very high level of proficiency in English. A Cultural History of Computers, Robots, and Artificial Intelligence LING-UA 51 Offered every year. Dougherty. 4 points. Considers primary source material on the mind- body problem and on linguistic criteria for intelligence, starting with Galileo and Descartes and continuing up to the present day. Examines mechanical analogies of mind developed since 1500. Readings from Galileo, Descartes, Voltaire, Huxley, Darwin, on Chomsky's Cartesian linguistics and the claim that current ideas concerning mind, lan-guage, and intelligence parallel closely those of the Cartesians of the 17th century.Etymology LING-UA 76 Identical to CLASS-UA 23 and MEDI-UA 76. Offered every other year. Costello. 4 points. T races the origin and development of English words. Discusses ways in which new words are created. Introduces concepts of phonological and semantic change, which students apply in identifying cognates linking English with other languages, in particular, but not limited to, Latin and Greek. Seminar: Research on Current Problems in Linguistics LING-UA 102 Prerequisite: permission of the instruc- tor. Offered occasionally. 4 points. Course content varies; see the description of each offering at the department's home page. Internship LING-UA 980, 981 Prerequisite: permission of the director of undergraduate studies.

It is specifically designed for students wishing to work in more than one field of specialization and to develop individualized programs of study around their own interests rather than those of a single departmental major. Individual advisement enables students to develop a coherent course of study that suits their needs and interests. Among the fields of concentration from which students may draw to develop their programs are (1) language and literature: classics, comparative literature, English, French, Italian, Middle Eastern (Arabic), Hebrew and Judaic, and Spanish and Portuguese, (2) art history, (3) history, (4) music, and (5) philosophy and religion. Other more specialized programs of study may be designed in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Available to majors and minors are the Marco Polo T ravel Award (granted to an outstanding student each year to allow her or him to travel abroad for research), as well as a field prize for outstanding work in the major.ProgramfacUl TYwww.marc.as.nyu.edu 13 University Place, Room 219, New York, NY 10003-4573 Phone: 212-998-8698 director of the Program Professor Rust Professors emeriti Alexander (Art History), Bonfante (Classics), Carruthers (English), Claster (History), Hyman (Art History), Ivry (Hebrew and Judaic Studies), Javitch ( Comparative Literature), P.

It focuses on the history, institutions, languages, literatures, thought, faith, art, and music of Europe, the Atlantic, and the Mediterranean world from the collapse of Roman authority to about 1700 C.E. It is during this important period\u2014which shaped and transmitted the classical heritage\u2014that the social, artistic, intellectual, and scientific culture of present-day Europe and the Middle East was formed. The curriculum in medieval and Renaissance studies links undergraduates with NYU's outstanding humanities faculty; with the superb libraries, museums, and collections in the New York area; and with musical and theatrical performances of works from this period that are given regularly in the city. It also enriches students' intellectual and artistic experience in College of Arts and Science programs abroad. Students design their own programs in consultation with the program director and faculty; they thus receive individualized attention from a center of excellence situated within the rich offerings of a great university and a vibrant city.PROGRAM IN Medieval and Renaissance Studies338 MEDIEv AL AND RENAISSANCE S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYPROGRAM IN MEDIEv AL AND RENAISSANCE S TUDIES Many majors in the medieval and Renaissance studies program have gone on to graduate work in medieval stud- ies, early modern studies, Celtic studies, archival and/or museum studies, religious studies, history, art history, English, foreign language literatures and cultures, and music. Other majors have gone on to professional schools (medicine, law, management), as well as to careers in business and education. major Ten courses (40 points) in medieval and Renaissance studies, of which at least five must be in a single field of concentration; three courses in one or more secondary field(s) of concentration; and at least one interdisciplin- ary seminar. In addition, students are expected to show proficiency through course work or examination in a classical language (Latin, ancient Greek, Arabic, or Hebrew) and in another foreign language appropriate to their field of concentration. Students who work in later periods and for whom knowledge of two modern foreign languages is advantageous may petition the director of undergraduate studies to substitute the ancient language requirement with a second modern foreign language. minor Five courses (20 points), of which at least two must be in a single field of concentration, one in each of two other fields of concentration, and an interdisciplinary seminar. Program a pproval and a dvisement The director meets with students to discuss their general educational and career aims, as well as the specific opportunities provided by the Program in Medieval and Renaissance Studies. All major and minor programs require the approval of the director of the program. honors Program To qualify for the honors program in medieval and Renaissance studies, students must maintain at least a 3.65 cumulative average and a 3.65 major average. The honors track is a yearlong 8-point program, during the course of which students write and orally defend an honors thesis. The thesis is an extended research paper written on a topic of the student's choice related to his or her course of study and directed by a faculty adviser. During the fall semester of their senior year, students who qualify for honors enroll in the Senior Honors Seminar (MEDI-UA 998), a colloquium for thesis writers; in the spring semester, they enroll in Honors Independent Study (MEDI-UA 999). The Senior Honors Seminar guides students through the research and writing of the thesis, covering such areas as choosing a topic, compiling a bibliography, conducting library and web-based research, properly documenting sources, and developing research and writing methods for graduate-level study. In Honors Independent Study, students complete their thesis projects under the supervision of a faculty mentor. Students interested in pursuing the honors program should consult with the director of the program by the second semester of their junior year. The requirements of the honors program are as follows: completion of the major's requirements; successful completion of the honors seminar; completion of an honors thesis; and an oral presentation on the honors thesis and its bibliography. Study a way MARC prepares and encourages its students to complement their work in medieval and Renaissance studies at one of NYU's Global programs in Florence, London, Madrid, Paris, and Prague or at one of the Western European exchange universities.

T wo introductory courses\u2014may be taken in any order: Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA-UA 1) Approaches to Metropolitan Studies (SCA-UA 601) Six elective courses: Four designated metropolitan studies electives T wo common electives: a list will be available each semester Three research core courses: Strategies in Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA-UA 20) Internship Fieldwork (SCA-UA 40) and Internship Seminar (SCA-UA 42), related to metropolitan studies Senior Research Seminar (SCA-UA 90) A note about language/linguistic competency: The type of rigorous intercultural study promoted within the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis requires students to recognize the complex modes of communica-tion at work both within and across different social groups. The department therefore strongly encourages its students to develop advanced skills in language and linguistics by any of the following means: taking elective courses in sociolinguistics; studying a language other than English beyond the minimum level required by the College of Arts and Science; studying languages especially germane to the department's fields of study; pursuing Metropolitan studies, part of the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA), is an interdisciplinary undergraduate major focused on the study of cities and metropolitan regions in historical and contempo-rary perspective. Students use New York City and other global metropolitan centers as their laboratories for understanding the processes of urban and regional development, the major institutions of urban life, urban social movements, urban cultural dynamics, and the socio-environmental consequences of worldwide urbanization. The program draws on the expertise of a wide range of urban scholars within SCA and in complementary departments at NYU. In addition, faculty active in the city's government, community, and nonprofit agencies provide a unique resource for understanding the city. The major provides particularly valuable preparation for students interested in law, health, teaching, journalism, social work, architecture, city and regional planning, public policy, public administration, nonprofit administration, and community organization. An accelerated B.A./M.P .A. and B.A./M.U.P . arrangement exists with NYU's Robert F . Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.

A gateway to all majors offered by the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis. It focuses on the core concepts that intersect the constituent programs of SCA: Africana Studies, American Studies, Asian/ Pacific/American Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Latino Studies, and Metropolitan Studies. The course surveys basic approaches to a range of significant analytical concepts (for example, property, work, technology, nature, popular culture, consumption, knowledge), each one considered within a two-week unit. Because the course is team-taught and the instruc- tors vary from semester to semester, there may be slight alterations in the concepts covered in different terms. Approaches to Metropolitan Studies SCA-UA 601 Offered in the fall. 4 points. A broad and interdisciplinary introduction to the field of urban studies, surveying the major approaches deployed to investigate the urban experience in the social space of the modern city. Explores the historical geography of capitalist urbanization with attention to North American and European cities, to colonial and postcolonial cities, and to the global contexts of urban development. Major topics include urban politics and governance; suburban and regional development; urban social movements; urban plan- ning; and the gendering of urban space and racial segregation in urban space. research core Strategies in Social and Cultural Analysis SCA-UA 20 Prerequisite: Approaches to Metropolitan Studies (SCA-UA 601).

Independent Study Independent Study SCA-UA 997, 998 Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 2 to 4 points per term. elective c ourses Cities in a Global Context SCA-UA 602 Offered in the spring. 4 points. What is a global city? How does a global perspective shape our understanding of urban spaces and the politics of creating social and spatial order in cities? This course draws on ethnographic examples from a range of cultural and geographic contexts to explore 21st-century urbanization. Through examples that range from London to Shanghai, the course traces how issues like equity, migration, violence, ecology, and citizenship can inform an understanding of modern cities. Urban Cultural Life SCA-UA 608 4 points. Few cities enjoy as rich a cultural life as New York City, with its galaxy of neighborhoods, museums, galleries, theatres, concert halls, and alternative spaces. Through walking tours, attendance at cul- tural events, and visits to local cultural institutions, students explore the definition of urban culture. Sites include the familiar and the unfamiliar, the Village and the outer boroughs. Students examine the attributes that constitute culture and community from an interdisciplinary perspective. Readings and films expand their understanding of these concepts. Law and Urban Problems SCA-UA 610 Offered in the fall. 4 points. Interdisciplinary introduction to the law as it inter- acts with society. Focuses on problems in areas such as housing, zoning, welfare, and consumer affairs, emphasizing the underlying social, economic, and political causes of the problems and the responses made by lawmakers and courts. Readings are drawn from the law and social science. No specific knowledge of law is required. Work and Wealth in the City: The Economics of Urban Growth SCA-UA 612 Offered every other year. 4 points. The financing of complex American cities raises related issues about the changing character of work in the city and the organization of wealth and city finances in contemporary urban America. This course examines a diverse set of questions about the forms of capital needed to maintain a city, the economics of regional development, the role of taxes in supporting services and urban development, the job structure of a metropolitan area, and the types of incentives necessary to maintain a diverse labor force. Community Empowerment SCA-UA 613 Offered in the spring. 4 points. Empowerment is defined as those processes, mechanisms, strategies, and tactics through which people, as well as organizations and communities, gain mastery over their lives. It is personal as well as institutional and organizational. This course addresses these issues in a wide variety of community settings. The course is designed to be challenging and rewarding to those students interested in help- ing people work together to improve their lives. Culture of the City SCA-UA 620 Offered in the spring. 4 points. Urban culture is a complex, fantastic part of daily life, encompassing everything from vaudeville, the public library, opera, and dance to the local bar, social club, and graffiti. By considering cities to be sources of cultural invention, this course explores, through literature, history, social science, 348 METROPOLITAN S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMAJOR/MINOR IN METROPOLITAN S TUDIES and student experience, the evolution of high and popular culture, both modernist and postmodernist. Emphasis is on how cultures create bonds between specific interest groups and on how culture becomes the arena for acting out or resolving group conflict. New York City in Film SCA-UA 623 4 points. Analyzes the way New York has been portrayed in some of the classic films about the city. In turn, the course examines how these stories have helped shape the city's image of itself. The goal is to see how each particular film originated at distinct moments both in the city's history as well as in the history of filmmaking. In so doing, the course combines the perspectives of both urban studies and film studies, placing films within their cultural, political, and artistic content. Landscapes of Consumption SCA-UA 625 Offered every year. 4 points. Consumption of objects, images, and places is central to the culture and economy of metropolitan life. The class explores how the relationship between consumption and cities has developed by examining three key moments: the late 19th century and the invention of urban commodity spectacles, post-war America and the rise of suburban consumer spaces, and contemporary America and the selling of the commodity city. The class addresses three questions: Why do we want things? How does landscape organize our consumer desires? How does place become an object of consumption? We begin with an examination of classic theoretical works that probe the relationships between people, things, and cities. We then embed these in discussions of changing forms and practices of consumption and urbanism. The empirical cases we examine range from the development of the department store, to the fashioning of the commodity city, to the work of shopping, and to the emergence of a thriving urban debt industry. Urban Environmentalism SCA-UA 631 Offered every other year. 4 points. Examines some of the many environmental issues facing people living in cities and towns around the world. It focuses on the practical, everyday reali- ties of these issues, why they exist, and what can and should be done to change them. It uses these particularities to consider larger questions about the relationship between human society and the natural world in the urban context. Employing the analytic tools of sociology, the course grapples with ideas from economics, political science, philosophy, geog- raphy, and natural science to develop a theoretical framework for understanding environmental issues facing cities today. related courses Multiethnic New York SCA-UA 363 4 points.

The major is equally ideal for students seeking careers requiring a solid liberal arts background and strong analytical and critical skills, and for students interested in the humanities but for whom sonic culture is a central element. The music major cultivates the ability to interpret and analyze music as both text and performance. As such, the major program of studies and our faculty's specializations offer superb foundations for further advanced studies in music and disciplines such as American studies, anthropology, comparative lit- erature, linguistic and cultural anthropology, Native American studies, popular culture, gender studies, Western and Central European culture and history, Slavic studies, Latin American and Latino studies, media studies, performance studies, and theatre. major A total of ten courses (40 points) is required for the music major: Harmony and Counterpoint I-IV (MUSIC-UA 201-204) T wo courses on the history of European music (MUSIC-UA 101-104) Four additional courses numbered above MUSIC-UA 100 (except MUSIC-UA 505-508), one of which must be in the area emeriti Bailey, Burrows, Chusid, Fennelly, Roesner Boorman, archinassociate Professors Hoffman, Professor Professor Muelleradjunct f aculty Panofsky affiliated associate kapchan (Tisch, Performance Studies)chair of the department Professor Beckerman director of Undergraduate Studies Professor Boormanwww. music.as.nyu.edu Waverly Building 24 Waverly Place, Room 268, New York, NY 10003-6789 Phone: 212-998-8300 Since its establishment in 1923, the Department of Music at New York University has occupied a central position in American music scholarship. It has since grown into one of the country's most exciting, intellectually vibrant centers for the interdisciplinary study of music and sound. Undergraduate students in the department study, create, and perform music in an environment that combines the benefits of a well-rounded liberal arts education with the resources of a major research university. University resources include a large number of rehearsal and practice rooms, and the department has its own intimate, loftlike performance space that serves as a recording studio and as a venue for recitals and concerts. The department hosts the Washington Square Contemporary Music Society, the Collegium Musicum, and the Washington Square Harp and Shamrock Orchestra, the only Irish music ensemble in any university in the United States. The department's greatest asset, however, is its location in the heart of New York City, one of the world's great cultural centers. Many of our courses are structured around live performances at venues ranging from the city's top concert halls to its most obscure performance spaces. We also encourage our students to take advantage of our location by pursuing internships with New York City-based recording companies, music magazines, or major performing arts organizations.DEPARTMENT OF Music359 MUSIC C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF MUSIC Students who are pursuing Departmental Honors must take the Proseminar in Musical Research (MUSIC-UA 200).

Students wishing to graduate with honors must take the department's Proseminar in Music (MUSIC-UA 200); they then register for a semester or more of Independent Study (MUSIC-UA 997 or 998) in which they complete a capstone project in musicol-ogy or music history, ethnomusicology, analysis, or composition. This might take the form of an analytical or historiographic study of a major work or group of works, the writing of a musical composition of substantial dimensions, or a biographical study of a composer, all under the guidance of a faculty member. Finally, students must maintain a GPA of 3.65 both in the major and overall. For general requirements, see the Honors and Awards section of this bulletin. A student wishing to pursue departmental honors should apply to the director of undergraduate studies. There are also three departmental prizes that the department awards to exceptional students. These are listed in the Awards and Prizes section of this Bulletin. Performance Students pursuing a major or minor in music, and indeed all students in the College of Arts and Science, are encouraged to participate in musical performance, lessons, and ensembles. We believe that the joys of making music, the dedication and study necessary to perform music, and the collective effort required of ensemble participants constitute an inimitable experience that should have a central place in a liberal arts education. Students can participate in the Collegium Musicum early music ensemble, the NYU Orchestra, and many of the lesson programs and ensembles associated with the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human 360 MUSIC C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF MUSIC Development's Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions.

Note: Neural science majors in the honors track must register for both the lecture and the laboratory (4 and 2 points, respectively), but these need not be taken synchronously; nonmajors and non-honors-track students may only register for the lab section with permission of the instructor. A grade of B or better in Introduction to Neural Science (NEURL-UA 100) is required for entrance to the laboratory section. Registration is controlled for all students and requires approved access by the director of undergraduate studies and departmental authorization for enrollment.coUrSeS365 NEURAL SCIENCE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYCENTER FOR NEURAL SCIENCE Development and Dysfunction of the Nervous System NEURL-UA 305 Prerequisites: Introduction to Neural Science (NEURL-UA 100) and Molecular and Cell Biology I (BIOL-UA 21). Offered in the spring. Sanes. 4 points. Explores how the nervous system develops in normal animals, and how genetic and epigenetic factors can disrupt these processes. Lectures on normal developmental mechanisms are interleaved with those on disorders to provide a solid foundation for our discussions of abnormal events during matura- tion. The lectures on normal development cover a broad range of topics, including differentiation, axon outgrowth, synapse formation, specificity of con- nections, and plasticity. The lectures on dysfunction include autism, dyslexia, mental retardation, specific language impairment, hearing loss, blindness, ADHD, demyelinating or neurodegenerative disor-ders, and axon regeneration. The major goals of the course are to understand the extent to which current theories can explain the etiology of each disorder and to learn how basic research can best facilitate advances in our knowledge and, ultimately, lead to treatments or cures.

The four main branches are metaphysics (What is the ultimate nature of reality? What really exists and what is mere appearance?), epistemology (What, if anything, can be known and how?), logic (What are the principles of correct reasoning?), and ethics (What is moral value? And what moral values should we adopt?). Other, more specific branches of philosophy address questions concerning the nature of art, law, medicine, politics, religion, and the sciences. Everyone tends to have or assume answers to these questions. The aim of the department is to enable stu- dents to identify, clarify, and assess these answers, both ancient and modern. Philosophy prepares students for a more reflective life, for advanced studies in the subject, and for professions that emphasize analytic thinking and argumentation, such as law, business, and programming.DEPARTMENT OF Philosophy367 PHILOSOPHY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY All students should begin with one of the introductory courses. Satisfactory completion of any one course at the introductory level is a prerequisite for all of the other courses required for the major, except Logic. It is recom- mended that those considering a major also take Logic as soon as possible. No credit toward the major is awarded for a course with a grade lower than C. Joint m ajor in l anguage and m ind This major, intended as an introduction to cognitive science, is administered by the Departments of Linguistics, Philosophy, and Psychology.

These four courses must include one (and only one) introductory course (PHIL-UA 1-5), and one course from each of the department's three groups of courses: Group 1: History of Philosophy Group 2: Ethics, Values, and Society Group 3: Logic, Epistemology, Metaphysics, Mind and Language No credit toward the minor is awarded for a course with a grade lower than C. Independent Study A student may register for an independent study course (PHIL-UA 301, 302) if he or she obtains the consent of a faculty member who approves the study project and agrees to serve as adviser. The student must also obtain the approval of either the department chair or the director of undergraduate studies. The student may take no more than one such course in any given semester and no more than two such courses in total, unless granted special permission by either the department chair or the director of undergraduate studies. honors Program Honors in philosophy will be awarded to majors who (1) have an overall GPA of 3.65 and an average in philoso- phy courses of 3.65 and (2) successfully complete the honors program. This program consists of the following three courses. (Note: of these courses, only the first two may be counted toward the ten courses required for the major.) The Junior Honors Proseminar (PHIL-UA 200) should be taken in the spring semester of junior year. This course will play the dual roles of introducing students to core readings in some of the main areas of current philosophy and of giving them an intensive training in writing philosophy. Admission to this course usually requires a GPA, both overall and in philosophy courses, of at least 3.65, as well as the permission of the director of undergraduate studies. The department will try to make alternative arrangements for students who wish to participate in the honors program but who will be studying abroad in this semester of their junior year. Next, the Senior Honors Seminar (PHIL-UA 201) should be taken in the fall semester of senior year. Here, students begin to develop their thesis projects, meeting weekly as a group under the direction of a faculty mem-ber and presenting and discussing their thesis arguments. Students will also select, and begin to meet separately with, their individual thesis advisers\u2014faculty who work in the areas of students' thesis projects. Entry to this seminar depends on satisfactory completion of the Junior Honors Proseminar\u2014or on the special approval of the director of undergraduate studies. It also usually requires a GPA of at least 3.65. Finally, Senior Honors Research (PHIL-UA 202) should be taken in the spring semester of senior year. The seminar no longer meets, but each student continues to meet separately with his or her individual thesis adviser, producing and discussing a series of rough drafts of the thesis. The final version must be submitted by a deadline to be determined, in April. It must be approved by the thesis adviser, as well as by a second faculty reader, for honors to be awarded. The student must also finish with a GPA of at least 3.65 both overall and in the major\u2014and here no exceptions will be made. In addition, the thesis advisers will meet after the decisions by the readers have been made and award some students highest or high honors, based on thesis quality and other factors (including GPA in philosophy courses). course Prerequisites The department treats its course prerequisites seriously. Students not satisfying a course's prerequisites must seek the permission of the instructor to register.369 PHILOSOPHY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY Introductory courses Central Problems in Philosophy PHIL-UA 1 Formerly PHIL-UA 10.

They provide good preparation for graduate school; indeed, many of our students go on to some of the world's best graduate programs. They develop a range of technical skills, most of which relate to the challenging intellectual problems of building quantitative theoretical models and making precise measurements of physically interesting phenomena. The programs are also designed to satisfy curiosity about the fundamental laws that govern every aspect of the world, from the interactions of subatomic particles to the origin and behavior of the entire universe. The programs are simultaneously very deep and very broad. Course work includes both theoretical subjects and experimental activity in laboratories. The programs are designed to give students flexibility in years three and four to pursue interdisciplinary activities, spend time abroad, or delve into greater depth in a subject or into original research. The department is a collegial place where faculty and students get to know one another well. There are regular formal and informal seminars, as well as a thriving Society of Physics Students, and students and faculty often collaborate on original research problems. Many of the students participate in original research and coauthor scientific publications.

It is concerned with understanding the world on all scales of length, time, and energy. The methods of physics are diverse, but they share a common objective to develop and refine fundamental models that quantitatively explain observations and the results of experi- ments. The discoveries of physics rank among the most important achievements of human inquiry and have had an enormous impact on human culture and civilization. Members of the department carry out research in the fields of astrophysics, biophysics, cosmology, elementary particle physics, gravitation, hard and soft condensed matter physics, and statistical physics. Experimental work is carried out in state-of-the art laboratories in the department and at national and international facilities such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and large astronomical observatories. The educational programs of the department are aimed at providing a range of courses to meet the needs of different student groups. For undergraduate physics majors, there is a rigorous core program, exposure to current frontiers, and opportunities for research. For science majors outside of physics, there are technical courses that emphasize the fundamental physical laws that underpin other sciences; and for nonscience majors, non-technical courses introduce some of the most important concepts of physics and their impact on the contemporary world.DEPARTMENT OF Physics374 PHYSICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS well prepared for a wide range of activities\u2014not just in scientific research, but also in professional and engineer- ing pursuits, or any area where abstract thinking and quantitative modeling of real systems are necessary and rewarded. Nonmajors For nonscience majors, there are nontechnical courses that introduce some of the concepts and events that are most important to understanding physics and its impact. For science majors outside of physics, there are technical courses that provide a breadth of ideas about the fundamental laws that underpin the other sciences. The department provides courses designed to meet the preprofessional goals of prehealth students and students in engineering disciplines. Minors Students who are interested in obtaining significant exposure to the ideas of physics without committing to the major or without obtaining a comprehensive mathematical background can minor in physics or astronomy. Programs for m ajors in Physics Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) Program The major in physics consists of the following courses: Year 1: Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) Physics I (PHYS-UA 91) and Introductory Experimental Physics I (PHYS-UA 71) Physics II (PHYS-UA 93) and Introductory Experimental Physics II (PHYS-UA 72) Year 2: Calculus III (MATH-UA 123) Physics III (PHYS-UA 95) and Intermediate Experimental Physics I (PHYS-UA 73) Classical and Quantum Waves (PHYS-UA 105) and Intermediate Experimental Physics II (PHYS-UA 74) Mathematical Physics (PHYS-UA 106) Years 3 and 4: Advanced Experimental Physics (PHYS-UA 112) Quantum Mechanics I (PHYS-UA 123) Electricity and Magnetism I (PHYS-UA 131) Thermal and Statistical Physics (PHYS-UA 140) T wo advanced physics electives Mathematics: The calculus requirement is satisfied by taking either the Calculus I, II, III sequence (MATH-UA 121-123) or the sequence Honors Calculus I, II: Accelerated Calculus with Linear Algebra I, II (MATH-UA 221, 222). Potential physics majors should begin their calculus sequence in the fall semester of their freshman year. Variations may be constructed with the approval of the director of undergraduate studies. In addition, students are advised to take advanced mathematics courses\u2014such as Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140)\u2014as they proceed in the major. Double major including physics: The major offers flexibility to complete the requirements for a second major in the College. Students may wish to combine a major in physics with a major in a field such as mathematics, computer science, chemistry, economics, or biology.

It offers several courses of particular interest to prelaw students, such as The American Constitution, International Law, Law and Society, and Politics of Administrative Law. In addition, the faculty has expertise in the politics of a wide range of countries and regularly offers courses on Latin America, Western Europe, Africa, Russia, India, the Middle East, and China. The department's honors program provides an opportunity for outstanding students to undertake special- ized advanced work and independent research during their senior year. Graduates of the Department of Politics have gone on to accept positions with governments, international finance groups, multinational corporations, law firms, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and other institutions. Graduates have also attended law school and graduate programs in international affairs, campaign management, public policy, and political science at highly competitive universities.WILF F AMILY DEPARTMENT OF Politics381 POLITICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYWILF F AMILY DEPARTMENT OF POLITICS The following internship and reading and research courses do not count toward the major in politics: Internships in Politics and Government I, II (POL-UA 970, 971) and Readings and Research (POL-UA 990). The department also administers the major in international relations. For a description of this major, see the section on international relations in this Bulletin. honors Program For admission to and completion of the department's honors program, students must have a GPA of 3.65 both overall and in the major. The deadline for applying to the honors program is March 1 in the spring of the junior year. To be eligible for application to the honors program, students must have completed, or be currently enrolled in, Quantitative Methods in Political Science (POL-UA 800) and at least one undergraduate field seminar, honors seminar, or 1000- or 2000-level graduate (POL-GA) course. Once admitted to the honors program, students register for Senior Honors I (POL-UA 950), to be taken in the fall of their senior year. In this course, honors students prepare a research proposal for their thesis, which they write in the spring of their senior year while taking Senior Honors II (POL-UA 951). The thesis must be approved by both the instructor teaching Senior Honors II and the second reader of the thesis, including approval of an oral defense. Successful completion of all honors requirements permits students to graduate with honors in politics. Detailed information about the program may be obtained from the department. minor The minor requires five 4-point courses (20 points) in the department, chosen in consultation with politics departmental advisers and completed with a grade of C or better. A minor program may reflect a special emphasis in one of the department's four fields or subfields. No special emphasis on a particular subfield is required for the minor, however, nor is a choice of subfield reflected on a student's academic record or transcript. Only courses with a POL-UA number not also counted toward another major or minor can be counted toward the politics minor. Prelaw Although law schools do not require any particular major or course of study, political science is an especially useful field for students planning legal study and a career in law. For this reason, it is not surprising that, over the years, more law students have majored in this field than in any other. The Association of American Law Schools has suggested that among the areas of importance in prelegal education are the study of the political organization of societies, the democratic processes of Western societies, the freedom of individuals, and the art of peaceful, orderly adaptation to change. The association also suggests that students develop the power to think both creatively and analytically. We recommend that students interested in a prelaw course of study choose courses in consultation with the College of Arts and Science prelaw adviser in Silver Center, Room 901; 212-998-8160. Undergraduate Field Seminars Undergraduate field seminars are offered in each of the fields below each year, with topics chosen by the instructor. They are advanced seminars for juniors and seniors who are politics majors. To take any undergraduate field seminar, students must first have completed four courses in politics, one of which must be the core in that subfield. They must also have a 3.0 cumulative GPA or the permission of the instructor. Enrollment is limited.analytical Politics Quantitative Methods in Political Science POL-UA 800 Offered every semester. 4 points. Introduces students to the use of quantitative methods in the study of politics. Begins with a brief review of the basic elements of scientific thinking and their application to the social sciences. Next, students are introduced to probability theory and statistics with a view to testing hypotheses about politics. Students learn to use statistical software to organize and analyze data.coUrSeS382 POLITICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYWILF F AMILY DEPARTMENT OF POLITICS Political Engineering: The Design of Institutions POL-UA 810 Offered every year. 4 points. Institutions are the rules by which societies govern themselves. The tools of economic theory, game theory, and social choice theory are applied to the rational choice analysis of political institutions, whose consequences for society are derived from assump- tions about what individuals seek to maximize. Introduction to Political Psychology POL-UA 812 Offered every year. 4 points. Offers a broad overview of political psychology, a field that uses experimental methods and theoretical ideas from psychology as tools to help understand political processes. It introduces important concepts from psychology, offering new ways of thinking about subjects as varied as personality, the dynamics of social groups, and the ways in which emotion affects decision making, and then applies these concepts to various topics within political science, including the media and political advertising, race relations, the legitimacy of government institutions, and the formation of opinions and ideologies. In addition, by describing political psychology experimentation in detail, the course teaches about how the scientific method can be applied to the study of politics. Introduction to Game Theory in Political Science POL-UA 840 Offered every year. 4 points. Game theory is a mathematical tool used to study strategic interactions. Whenever the choices made by two or more distinct decision makers have an effect on the others' outcomes, the interaction between them is game-theoretic in nature. As suggested by its recent emergence into popular culture, game theory has been applied widely, in attempts to address phenomena in a variety of academic disciplines, including political science, economics, and biology. Because much of politics is about allocation of scarce goods, such as power and wealth, and the competi- tion for these goods, much of politics would seem to be a natural fit for the language of game theory. Doing Political Economy: Approaches to Public Policy POL-UA 842 Offered every semester. 4 points. Political economy is a field of inquiry that has made great strides in recent years in explaining politi-cal and economic behavior by characterizing the incentives of actors and the context in which these actors make decisions and influence outcomes. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to these theoretical approaches and show how they can be used to address contemporary policy questions. Games, Strategy, and Politics POL-UA 844 Offered every year. 4 points. Theories of political strategy with emphasis on the theory of games. Uses of strategy in defense and deterrence policies of nations, guerrilla warfare of revolutionaries and terrorists, bargaining and nego- tiation processes, coalitions and the enforcement of collective action, and voting in committees and elections. Secrecy and deception as political strate- gies and the uses of power, with some applications outside political science. Social Choice and Politics POL-UA 845 Offered every other year. 4 points. Introduces students to social choice theory applied to political science. It focuses on (1) individual choice, (2) group choice, (3) collective action, and (4) institutions. It looks at models of individuals' voting behavior, the incentive structures of interest groups, and the role of institutions. The emphasis is analytical, though students are not expected to have a background in formal mathematics. Experimental Methods in Political Science POL-UA 846 Prerequisites: Quantitative Methods in Political Science (POL-UA 800) or equivalent. Offered every other year. 4 points. Designed to provide an introduction to experimental methods in political science.

T opics in Modern Political Thought: 1500 to the Present POL-UA 120 Offered every year. 4 points. Examines the development of political thought from Machiavelli to Nietzsche through a careful study of primary works. Authors include Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche. Ethics, Politics, and Public Policy POL-UA 130 Offered once a year. 4 points. Students systematically evaluate ethically controver-sial public policy issues using concepts of normative political theory. In the first half of the course, we consider the means by which policy is implemented: Under what conditions, if any, might we permit political actors to do bad in order to do good? In the second half, we consider the ends of public policy: What is it that we want the state to accomplish, and at what cost? Substantive policy topics vary from semester to semester. Theories of Justice POL-UA 138 Prerequisite: Political Theory (POL-UA 100). Offered every year. 4 points. Aims to help students think more rigorously about questions of justice by examining the strengths and weaknesses of competing contemporary theories of justice. We survey a range of influential approaches to understanding justice, including those advocated by libertarians, utilitarians, egalitarians, feminists, communitarians, and Marxists. This course should help students to (1) recognize that political convic-tions rest on underlying moral assumptions; (2) learn how to interrogate, challenge, and defend these assumptions; and (3) gain some appreciation of how these issues have been addressed by major figures in contemporary political theory. Socialist Theory POL-UA 140 Offered in the fall. 4 points. Concentrates on those socialist schools\u2014Christian socialism, utopian socialism, Marxism, Fabianism, and anarchism\u2014that have proved to be the most successful. Presents their major theories and examines the usefulness of such theories in helping us to understand and, in some cases, alter the world in which we live.Nationalism and Ethnic Conflict POL-UA 150 Prerequisite: Political Theory (POL-UA 100). Offered every year. 4 points. Seeks to explain the varied forms of nationalism and extremism. To that end, we bring various psycho- logical, economic, anthropological, and sociological theories to bear on the origins and development of nationalist movements. We attempt to understand the historical phases of nationalist development, from the early cases of Great Britain and the United States, through the later cases of Europe and Latin America, the anticolonial cases of Africa and much of Asia, and, finally, the often religiously-based movements of the present era. We also read some of the normative literature that has tried to justify nation- alism, both in the abstract and in particular cases. Democracy and Dictatorship POL-UA 160 Offered every other year. 4 points. Democracy and dictatorships have traditionally been analyzed in terms of their apparently different institutional characteristics and legal foundations. Examines these traditional interpretations but leans heavily toward ideological and contextual factors. Challenges traditional distinctions between democracy and dictatorship. American Political Thought POL-UA 170 Prerequisite: Political Theory (POL-UA 100). Offered every year. 4 points. Study of American political ideas and debate from colonial times to the present. Topics include Puritanism, revolution and independence, the fram-ing of the Constitution, Hamiltonian nationalism, Jeffersonian republicanism, Jacksonian democracy, pro-slavery and antislavery thought, Civil War and Reconstruction, social Darwinism and laissez-faire, the reformist thought of populism, progressivism and socialism, legal realism, the New Deal and 20th-century liberalism, modern conservatism, civil rights, and war protest. Readings and discussion are based on original and interpretative sources. Undergraduate Field Seminar: Political Theory POL-UA 195 Prerequisites: Political Theory (POL-UA 100) and three other politics courses, junior or senior standing, and a minimum 3.0 GPA, or permis- sion of the instructor.

Public Policy POL-UA 306 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered in the fall. 4 points. Introduction to public policymaking in American federal government. The issues politicians address at election time often have little to do with what they actually do in office. The course examines the way the agenda is set and issues are processed in Washington. Covers Congress, the bureaucracy, program implementation, policy analysis, and budgeting. Students do a special project on an important current issue. In recent years, these issues have included Social Security reform, Medicare, and illegal immigration. The Presidency POL-UA 310 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every other year. 4 points. Study of the American presidency, its origins, and roles, including those of commander-in-chief; director of foreign policy; leader in legislation, administration, and party affairs; manager of the economy; and dispenser of social justice. The president is also viewed as a decision maker and compared with the heads of other governments. Readings include the works of presidents and their associates, analytical commentaries by observers of the presidency, and biographies.

The approach is similar to that used in microeconomics, except that transactions are made through voting institutions rather than through economic exchange. Honors Seminar: Courts, Rights, and Politics POL-UA 396 Prerequisites: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300), three other politics courses, junior or senior standing, and a minimum 3.5 GPA. Offered every year. 4 points. 387 POLITICS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYWILF F AMILY DEPARTMENT OF POLITICS When we look at the protection of civil rights and liberties in the United States, we typically restrict our attention to prominent cases decided by the Supreme Court. We do so on the theory that rights and liberties are generally abused by legislative majorities, and protected by independent courts. But many important rights and liberties in the U.S. have been protected by legislative majorities, not by the federal courts. The federal courts have in fact blocked many efforts by legislatures to protect rights and liberties. Using a variety of materials, this seminar reexamines the premise that rights are best protected by independent courts. We look at the record of rights protections both in the United States and more globally. We read court cases, historical accounts, works of political theory, and statistical analyses. We also collect our own data and conduct analyses of that data. U.S. Foreign Policy POL-UA 710 Offered every year. 4 points. See \"International Politics,\" below.

The U.S. elections are used as the frame of reference for examining the effect of institutions and voting behavior. Other countries are discussed to illustrate how cross-national differences in voting behavior and institutions can affect the electoral processes. This comparative perspective provides a better way to understand the U.S. electoral process. Western European Politics POL-UA 510 Identical to EURO-UA 510.

We then analyze the impact of this transformation on attempts by European states first to maintain control of their frontiers, and then to incorporate immigrants into the national com- munity.

Cognitive psychologists focus on perception, memory, attention, language, and thinking. Social psychologists determine how social beliefs, attitudes, and decisions are formed and maintained. Cognitive neuroscientists study features and functions in the brain as they relate to certain mental processes. Developmental psychologists seek to understand factors that affect and influence individuals across various ages. These many perspectives are reflected in undergraduate course offerings, all of which emphasize the scientific basis of psychology. In addition to its course offerings, the department encourages advanced undergraduates to become involved with the research of individual faculty through the Research Experiences and Methods course and the honors program. Highly qualified students are admitted to the honors program in their sophomore or junior year, take honors seminars, participate in primary research, and write an honors research thesis under close faculty supervision. NYU psychology majors graduate with an excellent academic foundation in psychology and are well prepared for graduate study in the field. Graduates are accepted by top programs throughout the country. Others go on to careers in law, business, medicine, and education.DEPARTMENT OF Psychology394 PSYCHOLOGY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10) and may count it toward the major. Those with a score of 4 are exempt from this statistics course, but the AP credit does not count toward the ten courses required for the major. In addition, selected courses in other departments can be counted toward the major or minor. A list is available from the Department of Psychology's Office of Academic Affairs. major Ten 4-point courses (40 points) constitute the requirements for the major. The required courses are as follows: Introduction to Psychology (PSYCH-UA 1) Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10) Data Analysis and Experimental Design (PSYCH-UA 11) T wo courses from Core A (psychology as a natural science) T wo courses from Core B (psychology as a social science) One laboratory course from Core C T wo advanced electives The course Developmental Psychology (PSYCH-UA 34) can be selected by a student to count as either a Core A or Core B requirement (but not both). To declare a major in psychology, a grade of C or better must be earned in both Introduction to Psychology (PSYCH-UA 1) and Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10). Credit toward the major is not given for courses completed with a grade of less than C. The curriculum involves a variety of possible sequences of courses that proceed from introductory to advanced levels. It is best that Introduction to Psychology be taken first, preferably in the freshman year. Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences should be taken next, as it lays the methodological groundwork for the research to be discussed in the core courses. Statistics must be among the first four psychology courses taken, and Data Analysis and Experimental Design should be taken early on as well. Core A and B courses of greatest interest to the student should be taken as soon as possible as preparation for the relevant Core C laboratory course and advanced electives that follow. For instance, if a student expects to do graduate work in the area of perception, then the Core A course Perception should be taken in the sophomore year, so that Laboratory in Perception and Advanced Seminar in Perception can be taken later. In general, it is advisable that students complete their Core C laboratory course requirement before taking advanced courses, preferably by the spring of the junior year. general recommendations Students interested in graduate training in psychology should become involved in research. Research Methods and Experience (PSYCH-UA 999) offers students the opportunity to participate in faculty research, providing students with a supervised research experience, as well as training in research presentation and criticism. This course is of great assistance to students in deciding about career directions and, because of the direct contact with faculty involved, can result in a letter of recommendation that graduate schools are likely to take very seriously. Pursuing an Interest in Clinical Psychology Students who are particularly interested in graduate work in clinical psychology are encouraged to include Personality (PSYCH-UA 30), Laboratory in Clinical Research (PSYCH-UA 43) or Laboratory in Psychopathology (PSYCH-UA 48), and Abnormal Psychology (PSYCH-UA 51, formerly PSYCH-UA 35) among their course selections. Developmental Psychology (PSYCH-UA 34) is also an appropriate choice. The department provides special advisement for students interested in graduate work in clinical areas of psychology and related fields. Contact the undergraduate program office for details. Experimental Psychology and Industrial and Organizational Psychology If a student plans to pursue a research career (particularly in Core A areas), in addition to the relevant courses in the major, courses in mathematics, chemistry, biology, physics, and computer science may be most useful. If a career in business or organizational psychology is the goal, then in addition to Social Psychology (PSYCH-UA 395 PSYCHOLOGY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY 32) and Laboratory in Social and Organizational Psychology (PSYCH-UA 38), courses in economics, sociology, and mathematics may be most useful. minor A minor in psychology comprises four 4-point courses (16 points): Introduction to Psychology (PSYCH-UA 1) One course from the Core A group One course from the Core B group One advanced elective The course Developmental Psychology (PSYCH-UA 34) can be selected by a student to count as either a Core A or Core B requirement (but not both). To declare a minor in psychology, students must have earned a grade of C or better in Introduction to Psychology.

Joint majors should consult with the respective directors of undergraduate studies of the contributing departments. honors Program The honors program affords students in the major an opportunity to engage in closely supervised yet indepen- dent research and scholarship. This program both prepares students for graduate-level work in psychology or related professional fields such as business, law, or medicine and provides them with experiences and skills that may be helpful in reaching their career objectives. Students must apply for admission to the honors program in their sophomore or junior year, with occasional exceptions for late transfer students. Admission is based on grades (a minimum overall and major GPA of 3.65) and the ability to benefit from a program that emphasizes independent research projects and seminars that focus on current research topics and issues. Honors students take the Honors Seminar sequence in either their junior or senior year: Honors Seminar I (PSYCH-UA 200) in the fall and Honors Seminar II (PSYCH-UA 201) in the spring. An honors research the-sis, usually based on an expansion of a research project ongoing in a faculty laboratory and serving as evidence of individual thought and creativity, is submitted for faculty approval near the end of the junior or senior year. Details and application forms are available from the Academic Affairs Office, Department of Psychology, New York University, 6 Washington Place, Room 158, New York, NY 10003-6634.

First, students study the theories and methods by which religion is analyzed today, including psychological, sociological, anthropological, philosophical, historical, legal, and literary approaches. They also approach the study of \"religion\" as a concept, which has itself been an intellectual object of inquiry and has played a key role in the development of the social and human sciences. Second, students learn empirically about religion in dif- ferent times and places, either through historical or ethnographic study, using textual, visual, and audio sources. Third, approached as lived practices, religions present us with a valuable lens through which many realms in social life can be examined: gender and sexuality, race, the nation-state, violence, memory, ethics, emotions, politics, economy, power, art, literature, and media. These realms, in turn, have an impact on religions. The Program in Religious Studies is closely affiliated with the Center for Religion and Media. It should be stressed that the program is oriented toward the academic analysis of religious phenomena and does not promote or endorse either religious belief itself or the views and practices of any particular religious tradition.402 RELIGIOUS S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYPROGRAM IN RELIGIOUS S TUDIES Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion RELST-UA 1 Offered in the fall. 4 points.

Students focus on the ways that various problems (material, intellectual, political) have served as catalysts for the formation and dissolution of communities of interpretation and practice and reexamine the multiple pasts of South Asia without projecting modern categories onto those traditions. Belief and Social Life in China RELST-UA 351 Identical to ANTH-UA 351, EAST-UA 351. Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points. The Chinese word for religion means \"teaching.\" \"Teaching\" immediately implies someone else besides the self. Belief in China has always been theorized and practiced as mediated by the presence of others, miracu-lous and mundane. The course explores what Chinese people \"taught\" themselves about the person, society, and the natural world and thus how social life was constructed and maintained. It examines in historical perspective the classic texts of the Taoist and Confucian canon and their synthesis; Buddhist, especially Ch'an (Zen) practices in China; issues of gender in past and present practice; and religion's relation to the state.

T races the different uses and forms \"the confession\" has taken in Western culture. How has the confes- sion evolved from a specifically religious practice to become a genre of self-making in a putatively secular modernity? A consistent concern is the way confessional practices have increasingly become linked to sex and sexuality. The range of texts and genres surveyed includes philosophical and religious treatises, political pamphlets, legal history of confession, psychoanalytic case studies, feminist consciousness-raising, coming-out stories, self-help literature, tell-all celebrity autobiographies, TV talk shows, YouT ube, and film/video. What can we learn from the differences and similarities between these confessional modes, their cultural locations, their historical moments, and their ideological effects?

Students acquire a basic knowledge of the early history of Judaism and Christianity. However, on the theoretical level, the course aims to provide students with a forum for asking some of the questions most relevant to religious studies: Are we to use self-definition, typology, or both in our formulating religious categories? How do certain categories help and hinder our understanding of religious and other social phenomena? What is the relationship between ideology and the social world? How do we learn about the \"real\" world from literary evidence? Religion, State, and Politics RELST-UA 613 Offered periodically. 4 points. Introduces students to the debate on secularism by 404 RELIGIOUS S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYPROGRAM IN RELIGIOUS S TUDIES following a comparative approach. Students first gain basic knowledge related to the emergence and development of the secularization paradigm. In a second step, they confront it with empirical data. Concretely, this course introduces different examples of state-religion relationships and discusses the impact of the respective historical experiences and religio-cultural backgrounds on them. This agenda serves to develop a critical overview on the scope and limits of secularization theory and provides students with basic tools to situate current debates on religion in a broader theoretical frame. Religion and Media RELST-UA 645 Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points. Introduces the long-standing and complex connec-tion between religious practices and various media. Analyzes how human hearing, vision, and the perform- ing body have been used historically to express and maintain religious life through music, voice, images, words, and rituals. Attention is then devoted to more recent electronic media such as radio, film, television, video, and the Internet. An anthropo-logical/historical perspective on studying religion is pursued. Prior course work in religious studies, anthropology, or media studies would be helpful, but it is not necessary if you are willing to work hard. Religion, Sexuality, and Public Life RELST-UA 646 Offered periodically. Pellegrini. 4 points. This country was founded on the promise of religious freedom, and yet U.S. laws and policies regulat-ing sexual life derive much of their rationale from specifically religious notions of \"good\" versus \"bad\" sex, what bodies are \"for,\" and what kinds of human relationships are valuable. How are we to understand this apparent contradiction? If sexual life is a special case, what makes it so? Finally, what are the implica-tions, for both sexual and religious freedom, of treating sexual life as a special case? Course materials are designed to introduce students to critical approaches to the study of religion in society, as well as to familiarize them with important work in the inter- disciplinary areas of gender and sexuality studies. T opics in Religious Studies RELST-UA 650 4 points. The emphasis of this course varies each year and is designed to allow flexibility in course offerings from visiting scholars and specialists in particular fields.

An introduction to Tibetan Buddhism doctrine and practice. Approaches the subject from historical and thematic perspectives, beginning with a close study of one of the classic Tibetan guides to Tibetan Buddhism for a solid foundation in the principles of the tradi- tion. Proceeds along a historical track, beginning with the seventh-century arrival of Buddhism in Tibet to the present-day encounter with Western devotees of exiled Tibetan lamas. Topics include doc-trinal innovation, ritual, myth, art, sacred geography, revelation, and the role of Buddhism in Tibet's relationship with its neighbors. Readings consist of primary texts in translation and secondary literature on the study of religion and Tibetan Buddhism.The Sufis: Mystics of Islam RELST-UA 863 Identical to MEIS-UA 863.

This course in the Morse Academic Plan (MAP) examines the common base and regional variations of Islamic societies. An \"Islamic society\" is here under-stood as one that shares, either as operative present or historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances, but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical, topical, and regional. The emphasis in the premodern period is first on the Quran and then on law, political theory, theology, and mysticism. For the more recent period, the stress is on the search for religious identity. Throughout, students are exposed to Islamic societies in the words of their own writings.406 ROMANCE LANGUAGES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYThe Romance languages major requires a total of nine 4-point courses (36 points) distributed between two languages, with five courses (20 points) taken in one language and four courses (16 points) taken in the other. The following six combinations of languages are offered: French-Italian French-Spanish French-Portuguese Italian-Spanish Italian- Portuguese Spanish-Portuguese In each track, students begin by honing their skills in speaking and writing past the intermediate level. They then build on this solid foundation by delving into more advanced courses in literature and/or culture. To declare the major and receive advisement on their course of study, students should meet with the directors of undergraduate studies in the relevant departments. French and Italian For this major track, nine courses are required. Students take these five required courses (20 points): Written Contemporary French (FREN-UA 105) One of the following: French Phonetics (FREN-UA 103) T ranslation (FREN-UA 107) Acting French (FREN-UA 109)Programdirectors of Undergraduate Studies Professor Bernard (French), Assistant Professor Ferrari (Italian), Associate Professor Lane (Spanish and Portuguese) associate director of Undergraduate Studies Clinical Assistant Professor D\u00e1vila (Spanish and Portuguese) director of french language Programs Clinical Associate Professor Moran director of Italian language Programs Doctor Cipani director of Spanish language Programs To be announcedThe Romance languages are the group of related tongues that emerged from spoken Latin after the fall of the Roman Empire in the fifth century. In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance they developed and evolved into languages that we recognize as the basis of (among others) modern French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. The great works of literature produced in these centuries became the foundation of the national literatures of their respective cultures. The major in Romance languages in the College of Arts and Science is a nine-course major administered by the Departments of Italian, French, and Spanish and Portuguese. Students choose a combination of any two of these four languages, taking five courses in one and four in the other. Thus, majors in Romance languages are able to take advantage of the rich course offerings and resources of our world-renowned language departments and learn from distinguished scholars in two fields. The major stresses competence in speaking and writing before moving into literary and cultural course work. To improve students' facility with their two languages and promote cross-cultural understanding and exposure, study away at NYU Buenos Aires, Florence, Madrid, and Paris is encouraged. While they are at Washington Square, students can take advantage of talks, exhibits, films, and other events sponsored by the Departments of French, Italian, and Spanish and Portuguese and NYU's Maison Fran\u00e7aise, Casa Italiana, and King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center, as well as by cultural institutions in New York City. A major in Romance languages is applicable to careers in international law and business, communications, education, fine arts, tourism, and diplomacy. It also complements majors in such fields as art history, cin-ema studies, comparative literature, history, international relations, linguistics, medieval and Renaissance studies, and music.MAJOR IN Romance Languages www.french.as.nyu.edu www.italian.as.nyu.edu www.spanish.as.nyu.edu 13-19 University Place, New York, NY 10003-4573 (French; Spanish and Portuguese) 24 West 12th Street, New York, NY 10011-8604 (Italian)407 ROMANCE LANGUAGES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMAJOR IN ROMANCE LANGUAGES Business French (FREN-UA 110) Advanced Conversation (FREN-UA 9102, offered at NYU Paris) Advanced Review of Modern Italian (ITAL-UA 30) One of the following: Conversations in Italian (ITAL-UA 101) Italian Through Cinema (ITAL-UA 107) One of the following: Creative Writing in Italian (ITAL-UA 103) Advanced Composition (ITAL-UA 105) One of the following French courses (4 points): Readings in French Literature I: From the Middle Ages to the French Revolution (FREN-UA 120) Readings in French Literature II: From 1800 to the Present (FREN-UA 121) Approaches to Francophone Literature (FREN-UA 145) French Society and Culture from the Middle Ages to 1900 (FREN-UA 163) Contemporary France (FREN-UA 164) One of the following Italian courses (4 points): Readings in Medieval and Renaissance Literature (ITAL-UA 115) Readings in Modern Italian Literature (ITAL-UA 116) Introduction to the Middle Ages (ITAL-UA 117) And two advanced courses (8 points), at least one of which must be in French, selected in consultation with the directors of undergraduate studies in the language departments.

Readings include Plato, More, Bellamy, Marx, Zamyatin, Orwell, Huxley, LeGuin, and Revelation. Chekhov RUSSN-UA 837 Offered every other year. 4 points. Study of major techniques in Chekhov's short story writing; analysis of his influence on the develop- ment of the Russian and European novella; a close analysis of Chekhov's drama (Three Sisters, The Cherry Orchard, and Uncle Vanya) and its impact on Russian playwrights of the 20th century, as well as its relation to the development of Stanislavsky's Moscow Art Theatre. Dostoevsky RUSSN-UA 839 Offered every other year. 4 points. The major philosophical and religious themes of Dostoevsky as they are reflected in his works. Notes from the Underground, Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, The Brothers Karamazov, and major short stories form the main part of the course. Examines Dostoevsky's concepts of freedom, history, and Christianity. Theory of the AvantGarde, East and West, 1890-1930 RUSSN-UA 841 Identical to COLIT-UA 841, ENGL-UA 730. Offered every other year. 4 points. Theory and practice of the European avant-garde in art and literature, 1890-1930. General cultural and historical approach to the avant-garde, with close readings of some of its key productions. Topics: cubism, Italian futurism, Russian cubo-futurism, imagism and vorticism, dadaism, constructivism, and surrealism. Stresses aesthetic, historical, and political interconnections between the Russian avant-garde and the West. Readings are in English, but comparative literature majors are encouraged to read works in the original language. Russian Literature in the Original I RUSSN-UA 847 Prerequisite: at least one semester of Advanced Russian or near-native fluency in Russian. Offered in the fall. 4 points. Students read Russian prose and poetry in the original language. Class discussions and papers are also in Russian. Russian Literature in the Original II RUSSN-UA 848 Prerequisite: at least one semester of Advanced Russian or near-native fluency in Russian. Offered in the spring. 4 points. Students read Russian prose and poetry in the 414 RUSSIAN AND SLA vIC S TUDIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF RUSSIAN AND SLA vIC S TUDIES original language. Class discussions and papers are also in Russian. Introduction to Soviet Cinema RUSSN-UA 850 Offered every year. Iampolski. 4 points. An examination of the history of Russian cinema from its beginnings. The main focus is on landmarks of cinematic art and on the cultural specificity of Russian cinema. The survey also includes questions of cinema and politics (cinema as a propaganda tool), and cinema and the market. Artists discussed include Eisenstein, Vertov, Pudovkin, Kuleshov, Barnet, Shub, Kozintsev, T rauberg, and Tarkovsky. Topics include cinema and revolution, the cinema of the Russian avant-garde and constructivism, cinema and totalitarianism, and socialist realism in film. Soviet and PostSoviet Literature RUSSN-UA 852 Offered every other year. Borenstein. 4 points. An introduction to Russian 20th-century fiction, concentrating on the two periods of greatest cultural ferment: 1920s modernism and late/post- Soviet postmodernism. After the 1917 revolution, Bolshevik ideology held that the Old World would be utterly destroyed, to be replaced by a new society populated by New Soviet Men. The experience of Russia in the 20th century can be viewed as the failed attempt to put radical theory into everyday practice, a grand scheme of social engineering that would inevitably be reflected in the country's literature. Legacies of Serfdom and Slavery in Russian and American Literature RUSSN-UA 854 Offered every other year. Lounsbery. 4 points. Readings and discussions address how American slaves and Russian serfs wrote and were written about in the two countries' literary traditions. Topics include both the ways in which subjugated people attempted to represent themselves to the dominant culture and the difficulties that members of the dominant culture confronted in writing about people whose experiences were largely inaccessible to them. Particular attention is paid to how categories such as \"slave,\" \"peasant,\" \"white,\" and \"black\" have changed over time and to how unfree people worked to turn what were perceived as cultural lacks into aesthetic advantages. 20thCentury Russia: T error, Survival, and Beautiful Dreams RUSSN-UA 859 Offered every other year. 4 points. Encompasses the last years of the tsars and the Russian Revolution. Major events and phenomena are carefully analyzed through general readings and use of diverse media such as film, literature, visual art, and music: Lenin and communism; Stalinism; the Second World War; the end of Communism and the transition to capitalism. Paradox is at the center of this analysis: a fundamentally humanistic ideology of Communism produced one of the most murderous regimes of the century; an international movement became increasingly chauvinistic and nationalistic; a full-blown welfare state also oppressed its population in unprecedented ways. The Unquiet Dead: Imagining the Afterlife in Film and Fiction RUSSN-UA 870 Offered every other year. 4 points. Explores the connections between narrative and imagined scenarios for the afterlife. As we examine the literary and cinematic treatments of vampires, ghosts, zombies, and, in particular, posthumous nar- rators, we will look at the political and ideological deployment of afterlife narratives, investigating ques-tions of cultural and sexual purity, collective guilt, and socioeconomic anxiety. Particular attention is paid to the folklore and fiction of the Slavic world, as well as to contemporary American reinterpreta- tions. Readings will include texts by Nabokov, Gogol, Ovid, Stoker, and Morrison, accompanied by selected films. Internship and Independent Study courses Open only to students majoring in the department. Internship RUSSN-UA 980 1 to 6 points per term. Native speakers of Russian may obtain internship credit by working with Russian language students and assisting language instructors. See the director of undergraduate studies for further details. Internship credit in other settings and organizations requires a description of duties and approval of the director of undergraduate studies, as well as a final paper. Independent Study RUSSN-UA 997, 998 2 to 4 points per term. A maximum of 8 points of independent study may be counted toward an undergraduate major (not toward a minor). Before registering, students must submit a one-page typed description of the proposed project to the director of undergraduate studies and the proposed faculty sponsor.415 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYThe minor in science and society requires four 4-point courses (16 points). All minors take the core course, Introduction to Science and Society (HIST-UA 300), and then choose three other courses from an approved list. Many courses in the minor fall into one of the following four clusters: technology, physics, biology/prehealth, and environmental sciences. Students are strongly encouraged, however, to be creative and challenge themselves to think in ways other than those that are strictly categorical. For example, a student interested in understanding the difference between the natural and the artificial might take the following three elective courses in addition to the required Introduction to Science and Society course: Philosophy of Biology; Humans, Machines, and Aesthetics; and Nature and Technology in Modern America. Students are also strongly encouraged to take courses in the various schools throughout NYU contributing to the minor. This will expose them to a plethora of diverse pedagogical experiences and greatly enhance co-learn-ing. CAS students may apply 16 points taken in the other schools of NYU toward their degree. Students seeking to raise this limit so as to accommodate the course work of the minor in science and society must file a petition in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. core c ourse Introduction to Science and Society HIST-UA 300 Jackson. 4 points. Introduces techniques and approaches used by the humanities and social sciences in studying science, technology, and medicine. Investigates how historians, philosophers, sociologists, and anthropologists apply their methodological toolkit in investigating scientific, technological, and medical knowledge. Invites students to think synthetically, organically, and creatively across several disciplines.ProgramScience and society is a rich, inherently cross-disciplinary minor, drawing on the course offerings and faculty expertise of the College of Arts and Science, the Gallatin School of Individualized Study, the Polytechnic Institute of NYU, and the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. The minor analyzes how the techniques and methodologies of the humanities and social sciences can be used to illuminate both the context and content of science, technology, and medicine. Drawing upon history, philosophy, anthropology, and sociology, students investigate how culture and society frame\u2014and, indeed, are themselves framed by\u2014science, technology, and medicine. The current influence of scientific, technological, and medical issues on our lives is unprecedented, altering our notions of race, health, responsibility, ownership, ethics, esthetics, and indeed self. We are therefore obliged to understand these critical interactions with a view to understand, and intervene in, the world. The types of questions this minor poses include: How has gene patenting affected both the content and conduct of molecular biology, as well as intellectual property law? What is the relationship between the mathemati-cal descriptions that physicists employ and the nature of physical phenomena? What are the ethical and political issues involved in human embryonic stem cell research? How do machines shape esthetics? What, if anything, is the difference between a machine and a human? How does nature have a history? This minor serves as an enlightening complement to pre-health studies, pre-law studies relevant to intellec- tual property, biotechnology, and environmental and healthcare studies. It also provides a potent training to those interested in pursuing advanced degrees in the history, philosophy, sociology, or anthropology of science, technology, or medicine.director Professor Jackson (Gallatin/ Polytechnic) Steering c ommittee Associate Professor Appuhn (College of Arts and Science), Professor Jackson (Gallatin/ Polytechnic), Assistant Professor Mills (Steinhardt)MINOR IN Science and Society coUrSeS416 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYMINOR IN SCIENCE AND SOCIETY elective c ourses college of arTS aNd ScIeNce Medical Anthropology ANTH-UA 35 4 points.

This new major enables a small number of very capable and highly motivated students to pursue a plan of study that brings together courses from more than one CAS department or program. During their sophomore year, students compose their aca-demic plan for the major in consultation with their two faculty advisers for their self-designed program of study as well as with the associate director of interschool programs and the director of college honors, who serves as the director of undergraduate studies. By spring of the sophomore year, the plan of study must be submitted to and approved by the Honors Committee. The self-designed honors major differs from the individualized major that the Gallatin School offers in several ways: (1) these two NYU schools have distinct admissions criteria, general education curricula, and other requirements; (2) this CAS major serves students who can realize their interdisciplinary goals within CAS (except for the 16 credits of non-CAS courses that CAS already permits), whereas Gallatin students draw heavily on courses from several NYU schools; and (3) this CAS major is an honors major, which has prerequisites for entry (e.g., 3.75 GPA; students must maintain a 3.65 GPA to remain in the major) and entails a heavy commitment to honors-level work, including independent research under faculty supervision.419 SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ANALYSIS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYmajor The major in social and cultural analysis consists of introductory, elective, and research components, which together make up a total of eleven 4-point courses (44 points), as described below. Students choose two of the six program areas within SCA and concentrate their introductory and elective courses in these areas: Africana Studies, American Studies, Asian/Pacific/American Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Latino Studies, or Metropolitan Studies. Three introductory courses (can be taken in any order):Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA-UA 1), an introduction to key terms and analytical categories for interdisciplinary work in social and cultural analysis and related fields, is a required introductory course. This course fulfills the Societies and the Social Sciences Morse Academic Plan (MAP) requirement. In addition, two courses are required from among the following introductory offerings:ProgramfacUl TYerich maria r emarque Professor of literature Harper Silver Professor; Professor of Spanish and Portuguese Pratt lucie Stern Professor in the Social Sciences and Professor of anthropology RosaldoProfessors Dash, D\u00e1vila, Dinshaw, Duggan, Flores, Molotch, Morgan, Ross, Stacey, fellow Herediawww.sca.as.nyu.edu 4th Floor, New York, NY 10003-7112 Phone: 212-992-9650 chair of the department Professor Prattdirector of Undergraduate Studies Assistant Professor RademacherDEPARTMENT OF Social and Cultural Analysis The Department of Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA) is transdisciplinary, combining topics and meth- odologies from the humanities and social sciences. Its faculty and students work in a broad range of fields, analyzing the social and cultural relationships among individuals, groups, institutions, and governments. In the department, a commitment to historical inquiry coexists with applied knowledge about such modern developments as intensified urbanization, transnational trade and exchange, and migration of peoples. SCA houses and integrates the activities of six interdisciplinary programs\u2014Africana Studies, American Studies, Asian/Pacific/American Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Latino Studies, and Metropolitan Studies\u2014along with the range of degrees and concentrations offered in these programs. In their teaching and research, SCA students and faculty are encouraged to make intersectional links between the areas of interest on which the programs focus. New York City is a crucible for the department's work, both in its community orientation and its connections to global networks. Study in SCA thus provides excellent background for careers in such fields as community organizing, legal advocacy, nonprofit administration, public policy, and urban and regional planning, among many others. SCA students can elect to major in social and cultural analysis or to major or minor in one of the following interdisciplinary programs within the department: Africana Studies, Asian/Pacific/American Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Latino Studies, or Metropolitan Studies. The department also offers a minor in American Studies. For detailed information, see the entries for these individual programs in this Bulletin.420 SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ANALYSIS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ANALYSIS Approaches to Africana Studies (SCA-UA 101) or Cultures and Contexts: Africa (MAP-UA 505) or Cultures and Contexts: The African Diaspora (MAP-UA 532) or Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic (MAP-UA 534) Approaches to American Studies (SCA-UA 201) Approaches to the Asian/Pacific/American Experience (SCA-UA 301) or the MAP course Cultures and Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures (MAP-UA 539) Approaches to Gender and Sexuality Studies (SCA-UA 401) Approaches to Latino Studies (SCA-UA 501) or the MAP course Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures (MAP-UA 529) Approaches to Metropolitan Studies (SCA-UA 601) or Cities in a Global Context (SCA-UA 602) Beyond the three introductory courses, six elective courses are required, to be distributed across two of the six different programs within the department (Africana Studies, American Studies, Asian/Pacific/American Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Latino Studies, and Metropolitan Studies). Finally, two research courses are required: Internship Fieldwork (SCA-UA 40) and Internship Seminar (SCA-UA 42), pertinent to social and cultural analysis Senior Research Seminar (SCA-UA 90), pertinent to social and cultural analysis A note about language/linguistic competency: The type of rigorous intercultural study promoted within the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis requires students to recognize the complex modes of communica- tion at work both within and across different social groups. The department therefore strongly encourages its students to develop advanced skills in language and linguistics by any of the following means: taking elective courses in sociolinguistics, studying a language other than English beyond the minimum level required by the College of Arts and Science, studying languages especially germane to the department's fields of study, pursuing community-based internship fieldwork necessitating the development and use of specific language skills, undertaking study or research abroad in contexts entailing the exercise of key language or linguistic capabilities. minor The minor in Social and Cultural Analysis requires five courses: the introductory course Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA-UA 1), plus four additional courses selected from SCA department offerings. honors Majors who have completed 48 points of graded work in CAS and have a 3.65 GPA or higher (both overall and in the major) are encouraged to register for Senior Honors Seminar (SCA-UA 92) in the fall semester of their senior year. Upon successful completion of the seminar requirements, students will be eligible to register for Senior Honors Thesis (SCA-UA 93) in the spring. Information about honors can be found at http://sca.as.nyu.edu/object/sca.related.honors. Introductory course Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis SCA-UA 1 Offered every semester. 4 points.

The internship complements and enhances the formal course work of the SCA major. Students intern at agencies dealing with a range of issues pertaining to their major and take a corequisite seminar that enables them to focus the work experi- ence in meaningful academic terms. The goals of the internship are threefold: (1) to allow students to apply the theory they have gained through course work, (2) to provide students with analytic tools, and (3) to assist students in exploring professional career paths. elective c ourses within S ca Programs Please see descriptions of (and prerequisites for) elective courses under the following headings in this Bulletin: Africana Studies American Studies Asian/Pacific/American Studies Gender and Sexuality Studies Latino Studies Metropolitan Studies422 SOCIOLOGY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYwww. sociology.fas.nyu.edu 295 Lafayette Street, Professors; Professors of Sociology Duster, Jassocollegiate Professor; Professor of Sociology Gerson Professors Corradi, Garland, Goodwin, Greenberg, Haney, Heyns, Horowitz, Jackson, Lee, Sharkeychair of the department Professor Manza director of Undergraduate Studies Associate Professor Ertman major The sociology major consists of nine 4-point courses (36 points).

Three electives in sociology Students must earn grades of C or better in their major courses. Of the nine courses required for the major, transfer students must take at least five (20 points) here in the College of Arts and Science.C. Wright Mills once defined sociology as the intersection of history and biography. That is, sociology studies the ways that social structures and interactions shape human experience. Sociologists seek to under- stand the full range of social institutions and practices, from the dynamics of couples and small groups to the shape of institutions such as the church, occupations, and the family to the functioning of communi- ties, cities, and whole societies. Sociological methods of research are diverse, ranging from the quantitative analysis of large surveys to qualitative approaches, such as in-depth interviewing, participant observation, and historical investigation. The Department of Sociology at NYU reflects the diversity of the discipline. The faculty includes experts in deviance, law, and crime; organizations, occupations, and work; politics, social protest, and social policy; education, inequality, and social mobility; culture, art, and mass media; urban community and the global city; and sex, gender, and the family. The department encourages students to study issues from a variety of perspectives and to develop a \"sociological imagination\" that enables them to analyze social arrange- ments and problems. Whether the goal is to become an informed citizen or an expert in a special field, the department offers the tools and knowledge to help students make sense of the world around them.DEPARTMENT OF Sociology423 SOCIOLOGY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYDEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY minor The sociology minor consists of four 4-point courses (16 points): one introductory course (as above), plus three other courses in sociology.

In the fall of their senior year, all honors students register for the first term of the Senior Honors Research Seminar (SOC-UA 950), in which they develop and structure their research projects. The faculty member teaching the course assists the students in finding substantive and methodological advisers among the faculty. Students complete their thesis in the spring semester of senior year. They register for the second term of the Senior Honors Research Seminar (SOC-UA 951) and work under the supervision of their selected adviser. One semester of the honors research seminar sequence may substitute for one of the two advanced seminars required for the major. Honors students are also encouraged to take graduate courses when appropriate. These courses should stimulate and deepen understanding of sociology and enhance the quality of the final thesis. This should be done in consultation with their advisers. Social Theory Honors Program Students in this specialized honors program take a graduate social theory course in place of one elective course. Advanced Social Research Methods Honors Program Students in this specialized honors program take a graduate methods or statistics course in place of one elective course.

These minors, which are open to all students at the College of Arts and Science, are either partly or wholly composed of courses from par- ticipating schools, such as the Silver School of Social Work; the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development; the Stern School of Business; the Tisch School of the Arts; and the Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. Students interested in pursuing a cross-school minor are encouraged to visit the department or program sponsoring the minor. Additional advising support is available in the Academic Resource Center (18 Washington Place). Students can declare the minor through Albert. With the exception of the cinema studies minor, all courses taken outside the College to complete cross- school minor requirements count toward the 16-point limit on course work in other divisions. Since many of these minors require 16 points of course work outside the College, students are encouraged to develop their course of study in consultation with a College adviser (and are limited to pursuing one cross-school minor). Courses taken within the College (with a \"UA\" suffix) to complete cross-school minor require- ments will not count toward the 16-point limit. Students seeking additional non-CAS credits above the 16-point limit must file a petition in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. The minors offered by other NYU schools and available to CAS students are listed on the NYU Undergraduate Advisement website: www.nyu.edu/advisement/majors.minors/crossminors.html. For further information about the business studies, child and adolescent mental health studies, cinema studies, and law and society minors, please consult the relevant sections of this Bulletin.www.nyu.edu/advisement/majors.minors/crossminors.html Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 905, New York, NY 10003-6688 Phone: 212-998-8130441 PREPROFESSIONAL, A CCELERATED , AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYPreprofessional, Accelerated, and Specialized Programs INTerNShIPS Preheal Th ProgramOne defining characteristic of the New York University educational experience is the opportunity students have to apply their classroom learning to real-life experiences in a variety of professional and community-service settings. New York City provides such opportunities in abundance, and the College of Arts and Science and the University take full advantage of our location in the financial, cultural, scientific, and media capital of the world. Our alumni base, for example, encompasses every conceivable profession, and alumni give generously of their time to undergraduate students seeking experiential learning. A recent survey by the University's Wasserman Center for Career Development showed that 83 percent of graduating seniors in the College held a job or internship related to their field of interest during their undergraduate years. Many different types of opportunities are available to students; some are paid, some involve volunteerism on the part of a student, and some carry academic credit\u2014and all of these can be valuable. For the purpose of securing and making the most of such opportunities, students should consider the following criteria as a guide. For further information, contact the Wasserman Center for Career Development (133 East 13th Street, 2nd Floor; 212-998-4730). Career counselors are available by appointment at the Wasserman Center; appointments may also be made through the Wasserman Center to meet with a Career Assistance Program counselor in the College offices (100 Washington Square East, 9th Floor). Paid Internships These are the most common form of intern- ship. Jobs related to a student's professional interests provide pay for the work that students are doing for the organization. Many companies and organizations provide part-time jobs that allow students to gain experience and to network in the field, while at the same time helping to alleviate the financial burden of being a college student. (Please note: Some for-profit companies ask students to volunteer, but allow it only if the student can earn academic credit. Many of these so-called internships do not relate directly to a student's academic work and are not worthy of academic credit in a discipline. In these cases, the company should consider provid- ing compensation for the work done by a student, thus making it a paid internship.) voluntary or c ommunity Service Certain organizations encourage students to work on a volunteer basis to gain experi- ence and to provide needed assistance to the organization. This type of arrangement is common, for example, in government and not-for-profit organizations. Such intern-ships are valued, sometimes even required, for admission to some professional schools, but the College awards no credit for them.credit-Bearing Internships A few departments offer academic intern-ships that directly advance a student's knowledge in the academic discipline and thus earn course credit. Such academic internships must be sponsored by an appropriate faculty member through an academic department and normally require close faculty supervision, significant research in addition to the practical work experience, a reporting of findings, and a formal assessment of the student's work. All such internships require permission of the department or program, and registration for them must be within the regular deadlines. Departments offering credit-bearing internships may restrict them to declared majors, since those students have the requisite background. Internship courses can be counted toward some majors but not toward others. Students should check relevant websites to learn more about the specific policies and procedures pertaining to credit-bearing internships in different CAS departments and programs. Independent Study In some departments, independent study that draws on the activity or environment of the internship may be a possibility. Like a credit-bearing internship, independent study requires a proposal by the student, careful guidance from a faculty member, and a body of work that can be evaluated for course credit. The prehealth program in the College of Arts and Science is designed for any student who wishes to undertake preprofessional preparation for application to medical, dental, veterinary, osteopathic medical, optometry, podiatry, or other health professional schools. The program of study for a student interested in any of these areas minimally requires completion of the following courses: Principles of Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 11, 12); General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 125); General Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 126); Organic Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 225); Organic Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 226); General Physics I and II (PHYS-UA 11, 12); Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 100) and one elective from the English depart- ment; and Calculus I (MATH-UA 121).

They will be notified of the School of Medicine's decision by mid-July. This program is open only to highly qualified, full-time CAS students whose first choice is the New York University School of Medicine. To be eligible, students must have completed approximately 90 points, as well as both the sophomore and junior years in the College, and, at the time of application, they must be making progress toward the satisfactory completion of their degree requirements. Those who apply under the early decision plan must commit themselves to attend the New York University School of Medicine if they are accepted. All applications will be handled through the Committee on Recommendations to Schools of the Health Professions in the College's Preprofessional Center.B.a./d.d.S. Program The B.A./D.D.S. program is a seven-year joint program between the College of Arts and Science and the College of Dentistry at New York University. It is designed for stu- dents who are certain that they would like to pursue a career in dentistry. Admission requirements include a minimum high school GPA of 3.5 and combined SAT scores of at least 1370. Students with a wide variety of intellectual pursuits and interests are encouraged to apply. Students are admitted to the program as incoming freshmen and engage in academic studies and cocurricular activities that will prepare them for the dental school curriculum. They spend the first three years of the program at the College of Arts and Science, where they complete the Morse Academic Plan, the prehealth requirements, and an abbreviated biology major, for a total of 104 points. Students must maintain a minimum overall GPA of 3.2, as well as a major GPA of at least 3.4; in addition, grades of B or higher must be earned in all courses required for the abbreviated biology major. Students are also expected to participate in the program's cocurricular activities, which are designed to enhance their understanding of the dental profes- sion; these activities include special lectures, field trips, and cultural functions. During the fall of the third year, students in the B.A./D.D.S. program take the Dental Admission Test and make formal applica-tion to the College of Dentistry. Students enter the College of Dentistry in fall of the fourth year and must maintain matricula- tion in the College of Arts and Science during their first year of dental school. For the B.A. degree to be awarded, an official copy of the first-year dental school transcript and a statement from the College of Dentistry indicating promotion to the second year of dental studies is forwarded to the associate dean for advising and student services in the College of Arts and Science's Office of the Dean.or require additional courses, such as Biochemistry I (CHEM-UA 881). While striving to earn the best grades pos- sible, prehealth students must also keep in mind that schools of the health professions look at every aspect of a candidate's back-ground when making admission decisions. Therefore, students are encouraged to pursue a major of heartfelt interest, to participate in extracurricular activities of their choos- ing, and to develop intellectual pursuits and hobbies outside their schoolwork. Additionally, all prehealth students are very strongly encouraged to get either paid or volunteer work experience in the area they would like to follow. The reason for this experience is twofold: students will be able to make an intelligent decision about whether or not they should pursue this profession, and admissions committees can see that an applicant is dedicated enough to find out about a particular profession and that he or she has made an attempt to become aware of both its positive and its negative aspects. The College's Preprofessional Center (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 901; 212-998-8160) has an extensive evaluation process that enables the chair of the Committee on Recommendations to Schools of the Health Professions to write a letter of recommendation using information from as many sources as possible. Students preparing for the admissions tests and sub-sequent application undergo a committee interview process during the spring semester before application. Students are encouraged to keep in touch with the Preprofessional Center so that they are informed about deadlines for the interview process. Students considering a career in one of the health professions are strongly urged to dis - cuss this with their academic adviser as early as possible. Being \"premed\" is not a major, does not affect earning one's degree, and is not an irrevocable commitment should the student change his or her mind. The Preprofessional Center will also advise stu - dents from other NYU divisions who wish to follow a prehealth curriculum. Much more detailed information about the undergradu- ate experience as a prehealth student, about health schools, and about the application process is available in the Preprofessional Center. Advisers there can help students at every stage of their prehealth careers. accelera Ted aNd JoINT ProgramS IN Preheal Th443 PREPROFESSIONAL, A CCELERATED , AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYaccelera Ted ProgramS leadINg T o gradU aTe aNd ProfeSSIoNal degreeSBarBara aNd evaN cheSler Prela W Program accelerated B. a./m.P.a. and B.a./m.U.P. Programs ( caS and Wagner) The College of Arts and Science and the Robert F . Wagner Graduate School of Public Service offer selected students the opportunity to earn the B.A. along with either a master's in public administration (M.P .A.) or a master's in urban planning (M.U.P .) in a shortened period of study. These programs combine the benefits of a broad liberal arts education at the under- graduate level with professional training at the graduate level. CAS undergraduates in any major are eligible for the B.A./M.P .A. program. Students choose either Wagner's public and nonprofit policy and management program or its health policy and manage-ment program and then further specialize within each program. CAS undergraduates in one of five relevant majors are eligible for the B.A./M.U.P . dual degree; the majors are economics, international relations, metropolitan studies, sociology, and urban design and architecture. Admission to these programs is open to CAS students who have completed 75 points toward the B.A. with a GPA of 3.0 or higher and who have finished at least 32 of those points at the College. Formal application to the program is made in part through its College coordinator in the College Advising Center (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130). Interested students should visit http://cas.nyu.edu/object/ ug.academicprogram.bampa. To gain the greatest benefit from the combined degree program, the student should complete, while still an under- graduate, 28 of the 60 points required for the M.P .A. or the M.U.P . This advanced standing can be earned by enrolling in approved courses at Wagner or by tak-ing equivalent courses in CAS, a list of which may be obtained from the program coordinator or at the website above. The courses are selected in consultation with the College coordinator or with the Wagner coordinator. Metropolitan studies majors follow a course of study that allows them to take full advantage of the joint degree program. Interested students should speak with the director of undergraduate studies in metropolitan studies. Admission to the BA/MPA or BA/MUP track does not guarantee admission to Wagner. CAS seniors must submit the Wagner graduate application prior to graduating from CAS, preferably in the fall of their senior year. accelerated Bachelor's/ master's Program ( caS and g SaS) The College of Arts and Science and the Graduate School of Arts and Science offer students in many departments or programs the opportunity to earn both the bachelor's degree and the master's degree in a shorter period of time and at less cost than is normally the case.Prospective law students are free to choose from the wide variety of courses offered at the College of Arts and Science. The College endorses the position of the Association of American Law Schools that a single \"best\" preparation for law school cannot be recommended. As a result, there is no prescribed prelaw curriculum. Purpose of Prelaw Study While the College considers the prescrip- tion of particular courses unwise, it does advise taking courses that require extensive reading, research, and writing. The College's Morse Academic Plan is an excellent beginning for prelaw students, as it offers a rigorous and multidisciplinary foundation for advanced study in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. The honors programs offered by several departments provide opportunities to do extensive written work during the junior and senior years. No matter what one majors in, law schools value a well-rounded liberal arts education, so students should choose their electives wisely. For example, the precision of methodology and thought required of students in mathematics, computer science, logic, and the natural sciences will aid in the development of analytic skills, while a background in the behavioral sciences and the humanities (such as politics, economics, history, literature, philosophy, anthropol- ogy, and sociology) will offer a deeper understanding of human institutions and values, as well as opportunities for critical thinking and writing. advising The services of the Preprofessional Center (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 901; 212-998-8160) are avail-able to students seeking consultation on general course selection, law school applica- tions, and related issues. The office serves as a clearinghouse for the dean's certification, required by a number of law schools as part of their admissions process. The Lawyer Alumni Mentoring Program (LAMP) offers CAS students an opportunity to apply for one-on-one mentoring with experienced attorneys who are alumni of the College. other activities The New York University School of Law, conveniently located across the square from the College, sponsors many events open to the University community. The school's proximity allows prelaw students to sit in on first-year law school classes and to meet and talk informally with students actively pursuing legal studies. The College and the Prelaw Society also sponsor talks by guest speakers on law-related topics and field trips to courts and schools of law; arrange for representatives from various law schools to visit the College and describe their pro- grams; and administer sample Law School Admission Tests (LSATs) in the fall and spring of each year. For further informa- tion, please contact the prelaw adviser.444 PREPROFESSIONAL, A CCELERATED , AND SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYCAS students may apply to the program once they have completed a minimum of 48 credits toward the bachelor's degree but not more than 96 credits or six semesters; they may not apply during the senior year.

New York University actively seeks students who are varied in interests, talents, and goals, as well as in economic and social backgrounds. Particular attention is paid to the degree to which candidates have made the effective use of opportunities available to them, however great or limited those opportunities may have been. Evidence of character and maturity are regarded as essential in potential students who hope to benefit fully from the unique offerings of the University and its urban environment. Participation in meaningful school and community activities is an important factor. Applicants who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents should refer to this section's heading \"Applicants with International Credentials.\"Admission recommeNded hIgh School PreP araTIoN The admISSIoNS ProceSSThe quality of an applicant's secondary school record is more important than a pre- scribed pattern of courses. The minimum requirements for consideration include four years of English, with heavy emphasis on writing; three to four years of academic mathematics; three to four years of labora- tory science; three to four years of social studies; and two to three years of foreign language.

If you have a question as to whether or not an examination offered in your country would meet our testing requirements, please send an email to admissions.ops@nyu.edu and we will confirm. You should not assume that any examinations will meet our testing requirements unless they are listed above. Submitting Scores/ examination results Test scores or examination results should be submitted by the appropriate applica-tion deadline. If final examination results are unavailable at the time of application, predicted results may be sent (except in the case of SAT, SAT Subject, ACT, or AP scores, which must be final when submit- ted). Predicted results, which may be subject to additional verification, may only be submitted by a school official, via one of the following methods: Naviance/Common Application website; Mailed on official school letterhead, in a sealed and signed envelope; or E-mailed from a clearly identifiable school e-mail address If predicted results are submitted in place of final results, NYU reserves the right to withdraw an offer of admission if final results are not within close range of the predicted results. Students are welcome to submit evidence of national or international academic accomplishments that they feel may further support their application. International students applying to our campus in New York should also review NYU's English language testing require- ments at the Admissions website. Official test scores should be sent directly to NYU from the testing agencies.

All students applying for financial aid must file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA is the only application students must complete to be considered for most student aid programs. We recommend that students apply elec- tronically; see our NYU website at www.nyu. edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/financial-aid. There is no fee charged to file the FAFSA. Students must include the NYU federal school code number 002785 in the school section of the FAFSA to ensure that their submitted information is transmit-ted by the processor to New York University.New York State residents should also complete the separate application for the T uition Assistance Program (TAP); for information, visit www.nyu.edu/admissions/ undergraduate-admissions/financial-aid. Students from other states may be required to complete separate applications for their state programs if their state grants can be used at New York University. NYU offers two Early Decision applica-tion options for freshman applicants who are certain that NYU is their first-choice university. Students applying as Early Decision candidates will receive their admission decision after December 15th (Early Decision I) or after February 15th (Early Decision II).an outline of NYU's e arly decision Philosophy and Process NYU's Early Decision programs are, in fact, binding agreements, whereas if an applicant 455 ADMISSION C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYis offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the stu- dent to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer\u2014roughly within two to three weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications, as well. Providing that a student has completed the Early Decision Financial Aid application online, the student will be provided with a financial aid estimate soon after the student is offered admission. Again, admitted stu-dents will have roughly two to three weeks to review their financial aid package before confirming their enrollment at NYU. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is to provide an early \"decision,\" and as a result, we typi- cally either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. early d ecision and f inancial a id NYU uses the same methodology in provid- ing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission. For Early Decision I candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE online to pro-vide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package after December 15th. For Early Decision II candidates, we use this information to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package after February 15th. Students are then provided with their official financial aid award in late April, assuming students have completed their Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by February 15th. Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if they believe their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid pack-ages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern. early d ecision a pplication Process 1. Complete the Common Application and NYU Supplement online, and check either the Early Decision I or II option. 2. Download and sign the Early Decision Agreement from the Common Application website. Secure the signature of your par- ent or guardian and your college adviser/ guidance counselor. If you apply online, the Early Decision Agreement may be submitted along with your high school transcript. If you apply using the paper version of the Common Application, the Early Decision Agreement should be submitted with your application. 3.

When a transfer applicant is admitted to the College, the applicant's records are examined carefully to determine how much, if any, advanced standing will be granted. Each individual course completed elsewhere is evaluated. In granting advanced standing, the following are considered: the content, complexity, and grading standards of courses taken elsewhere; individual grades and grade averages attained by the applicant; the suitability of courses taken elsewhere for the program of study chosen here; and the degree of preparation that completed courses provide for more advanced study here. Point credit toward the degree is given only for a grade of C or better and provided that the credit fits into the selected program of study and courses were completed within the past 10 years. Quarter hours will be converted to semester hours to determine the number of credits transferable to NYU. Credits based on semester hours will be transferred at face value to NYU. As with all other students, transfer students are required to fulfill the residency require-ment. All degree candidates are subject to the following residency requirement: They must complete at least 64 consecutive points of course work in residence at the College immediately preceding the date of graduation and are permitted to transfer a maximum of 64 credits to NYU. A tentative statement of advanced standing is provided to each student upon notifica-tion of admission to the College. A final statement of advanced standing is provided during the student's first semester of matriculation. Requests for reevaluation of transfer credit must be made within the semester during which the final statement of advanced standing is received. Thereafter, a student's advanced standing credits may be changed only with the written permis-sion of the Office of the Dean. The Advanced Placement (AP) Program (College Entrance Examination Board), the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program, and the results of some foreign maturity certificate examinations enable undergraduate students to receive credit toward the bachelor's degree on the basis of performance in college-level examinations or proficiency examinations related to the College's degree requirements, subject to the approval of the College. The maximum number of credits allowed toward the degree requirements of the College that are a result of any possible combination of nonresident special examination programs shall not exceed a total of 32. International Baccalaureate (IB) The College recognizes, for advanced standing credit, higher-level examinations passed with grades of 6 or 7. No credit is granted for standard-level examinations. Official reports must be submitted to the Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center for review.

This section provides information on both of these distinct but related topics. Tuition, Fees, and Financial Aid TUITIoN aNd feeS: 2011-2012 Following is the schedule of fees established by the Board of T rustees of New York University for the year 2011-2012. The Board of T rustees reserves the right to alter this schedule without notice. T uition, fees, and expenses may be expected to increase in subsequent years and will be listed in online updates to this Bulletin at www.nyu.edu/cas. Students should also consult www.nyu.edu/ bursar for this updated information. Note that the registration and services fee covers membership, dues, etc., to the student's class organization and entitles the student to membership in such University activities as are supported by this allocation and to receive regularly those University and College publications that are supported in whole or in part by the student activities fund. It also includes the University's health services, emergency and accident coverage, and technology fees. Note: Deposits may be required for labora- tory courses. Students should consult the respective departments for information. All fees are payable at the time of registra- tion. The Office of the Bursar is located at 25 West Fourth Street. Checks and drafts are to be drawn to the order of New York University for the exact amount of the tuition and fees required. In the case of overpayment, the balance is refunded on request by filing a refund application in the Office of the Bursar. A fee will be charged if payment is not made by the due date indicated on the student's statement. The unpaid balance of a student's account is also subject to an interest charge of 12 percent per annum from the first day of class until payment is received. Holders of New York State T uition Assistance Program (TAP) Awards will be allowed credit toward their tuition fees in the amount of their entitlement, provided they are New York State residents, are enrolled on a full-time basis, and present the Award Certificate with their schedule/ bill for the applicable term. Students who receive awards after registra- tion will receive a check from the University after the New York State payment has been received by the Office of the Bursar and the Office of the Registrar has confirmed eligibility. full-Time Students T uition, 12 to 18 points flat rate, per term, academic year 2011-2012: $19,672 Fall term 2011 and spring term 2012: Nonreturnable registration and services fee for flat rate, per term: $1,131 Nonreturnable CAS academic support fee, per term: $25 For each point taken in excess of 18, per point, per term (includes a nonreturnable registration and services fee of $61 per point): $1,220 other Students T uition, per point, academic year 2011-2012: $1,159 Fall term 2011: Nonreturnable registration and services fee, first point: $418 Nonreturnable registration and services fee, per point, for registration after first point: $61Spring term 2012: Nonreturnable registration and services fee, first point: $432 Nonreturnable registration and services fee, per point, for registration after first point: $61 Basic h ealth Insurance Benefit Plan: 2011-2012 For additional and updated information beyond 2011-2012, please see www.nyu.edu/shc/about/insurance.html.

This plan is avail- able to students who meet the following eligibility requirements: Matriculated and registered for 6 or more points Without a previously unsatisfactory University credit record Not in arrears (past due) for any University charge or loan The plan includes a nonrefundable applica- tion fee of $50, which is to be included with the initial payment on the payment due date. Interest at a rate of 1 percent per month on the unpaid balance will be assessed if payment is not made in full by the final installment due date. A late payment fee will be assessed on any late payments. A separate deferred payment plan applica- tion and agreement is required for each semester this plan is used. The Deferred Payment Plan will be available at www.nyu. edu/bursar/forms in July for the fall semester and in December for the spring semester. For additional information, please visit the website of the Office of the Bursar at www.nyu.edu/bursar/paymentplans or call 212-998-2806.TuitionPay Plan T uitionPay is a payment plan administered by Sallie Mae. The plan is open to all NYU students with the exception of the SCPS noncredit division. This interest-free plan allows for all or a portion of a student's edu-cational expenses (including tuition, fees, room, and board) to be paid in monthly installments. The traditional University billing cycle consists of one large lump-sum payment due at the beginning of each semester. T uitionPay is a budget plan that enables a family to spread payments over the course of the academic year. By enrolling in this plan, you spread your fall semester tuition payments over a four-month period (June through September) and your spring semester tuition payment over another four-month period (November through February). With this plan, you budget the cost of your tuition and/or housing, after deducting any financial aid you will be receiving and/ or any payments you have made directly to NYU. A nonrefundable enrollment fee of $50 is required when applying for the fall/spring T uitionPay plan. You must enroll in both the fall and spring plans. Monthly state- ments will be mailed by T uitionPay, and all payments should be made directly to them. For additional information, contact T uitionPay at 800-635-0120 or visit www. nyu.edu/bursar. arrears Policy The University reserves the right to deny registration and withhold all information regarding the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of tuition, fees, loans, or other charges (including charges for housing, dining, or other activities or services) for as long as any arrears remain. diploma a rrears Policy Diplomas of students in arrears will be held until their financial obligations to the University are fulfilled and they have been cleared by the Bursar. Graduates with a diploma hold may contact the Office of the Bursar at 212-998-2806 to clear arrears or to discuss their financial status at the University.463 TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYA student who, for any reason, finds it impossible to complete one or more courses for which he or she has registered should consult with an academic adviser. An official withdrawal must be filed either on Albert (through the first three weeks of the term only) or in writing on a completed Change of Program (drop/add) form with the Office of the University Registrar. (Note: An official withdrawal must be filed if a course has been canceled, and, in this case, the student is entitled to a refund of tuition and registration fees paid.) Withdrawal does not necessarily entitle the student to a refund of tuition paid or a cancellation of tuition still due. A refund of tuition will be made provided such withdrawal is filed within the scheduled refund period for the term. (See the follow-ing schedules.) Merely ceasing to attend a class does not constitute official withdrawal, nor does notification to the instructor. A stop payment of a check presented for tuition does not constitute withdrawal, nor does it reduce the indebtedness to the University. The nonreturnable registration fee and a penalty fee of $20 for a stopped payment must be charged in addition to any tuition not canceled. The date on which the Change of Program form is filed, not the last date of attendance in class, is considered the official date of the student's withdrawal. It is this date that serves as the basis for computing any refund granted the student. The processing of refunds takes approximately two weeks. There are two distinct refund schedules (see below): 1. For students withdrawing from some courses, but not all; 2. For students withdrawing from all courses. Undergraduate r efund Schedule, Withdrawing from Some courses ( fall and Spring o nly) Courses dropped during the first two weeks of the term: 100% (100% of tuition and fees)* Courses dropped after the first two weeks of the term: NONE* Note: All fees (including school-related fees) are nonreturnable after the second calendar week of the semester. Undergraduate r efund Schedule, Withdrawing f rom a ll courses (fall and Spring o nly) This schedule is based on the total applicable charge for tuition, excluding nonreturnable fees and deposits. Withdrawal on or before the official opening date of the term: 100% (100% of tuition and fees) Withdrawal on the second day after the official opening date of the term through the end of the first calendar week: 100% (100% of tuition only) Note: The first calendar week consists of the first seven (7) calendar days beginning with the official opening date of the term (not the first day of the class meeting). Withdrawal within the second calendar week of the term: 70% (tuition only) Withdrawal within the third calendar week of the term: 55% (tuition only) Withdrawal within the fourth calendar week of the term: 25% (tuition only) Withdrawal after completion of the fourth calendar week of the term: None Note: All fees (including school-related fees) are nonreturnable after the official first day of the semester. The above refund schedule is not applicable to students whose registration remains within the flat-fee range. Note: A student may not withdraw from a class after the ninth week of the fall or spring semester or in the last two weeks of each six-week summer session. Exceptions to the published refund schedule may be appealed in writing to the refund committee in the College Advising Center (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130) and should be supported by appropriate documentation regarding the circumstances that warrant consideration of an exception. Exceptions are rarely granted. Students who withdraw should review the \"Refunds\" page on the Office of the Bursar's website, www.nyu.edu/bursar. Federal regulations require adjustments reducing financial aid if a student with- draws even after the NYU refund period. Financial aid amounts will be adjusted for students who withdraw through the ninth week of the semester and have received any federal grants or loans. This adjustment may result in the student's bill not being fully paid. NYU will bill the student for this difference. The student will be responsible for payment of this bill before returning to NYU and will remain responsible for payment even if he or she does not return to NYU. For any semester a student receives any aid, that semester will be counted in the satisfac- tory academic progress standard. This may require the student to make up credits before receiving any further aid. Please review the \"satisfactory academic progress\" standard for your school so you do not jeopardize future semesters of aid. Tuition Insurance The College strongly advises students to purchase tuition insurance to protect their investment in the event of withdrawal from courses beyond the published refund schedule. This insurance can be very helpful when unexpected situations cause a student to withdraw. Exceptions to the University's refund policy are rarely granted for withdrawals after the fourth week of the semester. Please contact A. W. G. Dewar, Inc. (Four Batterymarch Park, Quincy, MA 02169-7468; 617-774-1555) or visit www.tuitionrefundplan.com for more information.WIThdra Wal aNd refUNd of TUITIoN464 TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYNew York University awards financial aid in an effort to help students meet the difference between their own resources and the cost of education.

The advis-ers serve as a basic source of information about the degree requirements, policies, and procedures of the College. Students are able to explore career opportunities, as well as secure tutorial support. Academic and career development workshops are sponsored to assist students in planning academic programs, choosing a major, and negotiating registration. In addition, vari- ous cocurricular educational opportunities, from informal faculty talks to seminars and lectures, are arranged through the center. Support programs are available for African American and Latino students; interna- tional students; undecided students; and freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. A freshman advising program provides individual advising for new students enter- ing in September. Each student is assigned an adviser with whom the student meets throughout his or her first year to discuss academic as well as career and other issues. New students also work with peer advisers who can provide information and support during the transition to college. There is also an academic orientation program for entering transfer students before the start of each semester. T ransfer students not ready to declare the major are assigned to an adviser in the College Advising Center. Students needing additional assistance may, throughout the year, make an individual appointment with any adviser in the center.

The Department of Veterans Affairs may not authorize allowance payments for points that are in excess of scholastic requirements, that are taken for audit purposes only, or for which nonpunitive grades are received. Applications and further information may be obtained from the student's regional office of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Additional guidance may be obtained from the Office of the University Registrar, 25 West Fourth Street, 1st Floor. Since interpretation of regulations govern- ing veterans' benefits is subject to change, veterans should keep in touch with the Department of Veterans Affairs or NYU's Office of the University Registrar. Yellow r ibbon g I education enhancement Program NYU is pleased to be participating in the Yellow Ribbon GI Education Enhancement Program (Yellow Ribbon Program), a provi-sion of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008. The program is designed to help students finance, through scholarship assistance, up to 100 percent of their out-of-pocket tuition and fees associated with education programs that may exceed the Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition benefit, which will only pay up to the high- est public in-state undergraduate tuition. Beginning in the 2009-2010 academic year, NYU has provided funds toward the tuition of each qualifying veteran who was admit-ted as a full-time undergraduate, with the VA matching NYU's tuition contribution for each student. To be eligible for the Yellow Ribbon benefits, an individual must be entitled to the maximum post-9/11 benefit. An individual may be eligible for the Yellow Ribbon Enhancement if: He/She served an aggregate period of active duty after September 10, 2001, of at least 36 months. He/She was honorably discharged from active duty for a service- connected disability and had served 30 continuous days after September 10, 2001. He/She is a dependent eligible for T ransfer of Entitlement under the Post-9/11 GI Bill based on a veteran's service under the eligibility criteria, as described on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs website.The Department of Veterans Affairs is currently accepting applications for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. To qualify for the Yellow Ribbon Enhancement, you must apply to the VA. The VA will then determine your eligibility for the Post-9/11 GI Bill and issue you a Certificate of Eligibility. Note: You can apply using the VA Form 22-1990 (PDF). The form includes the instructions needed to begin the process. After you are issued your Certificate of Eligibility from the Department of Veterans Affairs, indicating that you qualify for the Yellow Ribbon Program, please contact Clara Fonteboa at clf1@nyu.edu or 212-998-4823. The Office of the University Registrar must certify to the Department of Veterans Affairs that the eligible person is enrolled as a full-time undergraduate student for the funds to be paid under the Yellow Ribbon Program.

B.A. programs are offered by all departments of the College except that of Neural Science. Bachelor of Science (B.S.) B.S. programs are offered by the following departments of the College: Chemistry, Neural Science, and Physics. For details, see the sections on these individual depart- ments in this Bulletin. The College also offers jointly with the Polytechnic Institute of NYU a Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Science (B.S./B.S.) program; see under Dual Degree Program in Engineering (with the Polytechnic Institute of NYU) in the Departments and Programs section of this Bulletin. Further information on engineering is available in the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130. The general degree requirements are the same for the B.A. and the B.S., with the exception of the engineering B.S./B.S. To be eligible for the bachelor's degree, students must complete 128 points with a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0. Within these points, students must fulfill the requirements of both a major and the Morse Academic Plan (MAP). The degree requirements to be fulfilled are those in effect during the term of the student's first registration in the College. Registration in another division of New York University does not constitute a regis- tration in the College of Arts and Science. Readmitted students must fulfill the requirements as listed in the College of Arts and Science Bulletin published during the year of their readmission, unless their readmission letter states otherwise. In very exceptional cases, a student may petition the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards for approval of a change in the requirements as stated in the Bulletin. The petition form may be obtained from the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. Degrees are conferred in September, January, and May. The formal conferring of degrees by the president of the University takes place annually at Commencement in May. Major requirements, varying from depart- ment to department, are specified in the sections devoted to the course listings of individual departments and programs. Generally, a little more than one-third of the total points are earned in the major concentration.Every student must complete a major with a cumulative grade point average in the major of at least 2.0. At least one-half of the courses (and in some departments, at least one-half of the points) used to complete the major must be taken in the College of Arts and Science. A student may not register for courses in the major outside of NYU. The student must be accepted as a major in the department and must review his or her program with a department adviser each term. Students go to the office of the department or program to declare a major and have it posted in the Student Information System (Albert). Students who have earned 64 or more points must declare a major. Those with fewer than 64 points are strongly encouraged to declare a major as early in their academic career as possible.470 DEGREE REqUIREMENTS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYThe mINor regUla TIoNS PerT aININg T o Bo Th maJor aNd mINor TIme lImIT reSIdeNce reQUIremeNT TraNSfer STUdeNTSStudents may take a double (second) major. The same requirements, including the maintenance of a minimum grade point average of 2.0, apply to the second major as to the first. In some cases, courses may be applicable to both majors. Students must then obtain the written approval for the shared course(s) from the directors of undergraduate studies of both departments. The second major is declared in the same way as the first (see above). The minor requirements are found in the departmental sections of the Bulletin. The minor must be completed with a minimum grade point average of 2.0. The minor is declared at the office of the sponsoring department or program. No more than one minor can be completed outside of the College in other divisions of NYU in order for the credits to count toward the bac- calaureate degree, as the limit on non-CAS credits is set at 16 points. The major and minor requirements to be followed are those stated in the departmen-tal sections of the Bulletin in effect during the semester of the student's first registra- tion in the College. No credit toward the major or minor is granted for grades of C- or lower, although such grades will be computed into the grade point average of the major or the minor, as well as into the overall grade point average. No course to be counted toward the major or minor may be taken on a pass/fail basis. (See \"Pass/Fail Option\" under Academic Policies in this Bulletin.)T ransfer students from other colleges and universities must have the written approval of the director of undergraduate studies to count transfer courses toward the major or the minor. Once a student transfers to the College, all course work must be completed at NYU. (See also \"T ransfer Students,\" below.) All requirements for a degree in the College must be met within a period of eight years from the date of matriculation. For transfer students and for students who are readmit- ted to the College, the length of time is proportionately reduced. T ransfer credit is not granted for courses taken more than 10 years before the student's matriculation in the College. Once a student enrolls in the College of Arts and Science (first year and/or transfer), all course work used to satisfy the 128-credit degree requirement must be completed at NYU. All students must complete their last 32 points while registered in the College of Arts and Science. In addition, students must be registered in the College during the semester immediately prior to graduation, unless officially approved for a leave of absence in that semester. One-half of the courses used to complete the major or the minor must be taken in the College. Any transfer courses to be applied toward major or minor requirements must be approved by the department.doUBle maJor T ransfer students must complete 64 points in the College of Arts and Science with a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 overall, in the required major, and in the optional minor. At least one-half of the courses used to complete the major and any minor must be courses offered by the College. Any transfer courses to be applied toward major or minor requirements must be approved by the department and may not exceed one-half of the required course- work for the major or minor. Courses in which a grade of C- or lower was obtained are not transferable. Grades earned from external transfer courses are not calculated in the NYU grade point average.471 ACADEMIC POLICIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYAcademic Policies academIc Program The programs and courses offered at the College of Arts and Science are designed for students who attend classes offered during the day on a full-time basis. A full-time schedule normally consists of 16 points per term, or 32 points per year, which enables a student to complete the entire program of 128 points in four years. Minimal full-time status entails completing at least 12 points per term, or 24 points per year. Students who wish to attend part time should obtain permission from the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. Such status will be granted only when there is good and suf- ficient reason for part-time study. Failure to complete a minimum of 24 points per year jeopardizes a student's full-time status and his or her eligibility to receive financial aid. Students in good academic standing may register for more than 18 points per term with the approval and clearance of their academic adviser. Students on academic probation, however, who wish to register for more than 18 points per term must obtain the prior approval of the Committee on Academic Standards, as must any other student wish- ing to register for more than 20 points. change of Program T o make any changes in their program, including dropping or adding courses given in other divisions of the University, students must access Albert via NYUHome at home.nyu.edu or file a Change of Program form in the Student Services Center, 25 West Fourth Street. adding c ourses The deadline for the adding of a course or a section is the end of the second week of the semester. The deadline applies to any course added by a College of Arts and Science stu-dent and to any College of Arts and Science course added by students from other divisions. The adding of any course or section after the end of the second week is generally allowed only when the student is changing levels within a discipline\u2014for example, from a French or mathematics course to a higher- or lower-level course in the same discipline. The addition is permitted only with the written approval of both the instructor and an adviser in the College Advising Center. Withdrawing from c ourses Students are expected to maintain a full-time program as described above. Occasionally, they may withdraw from a course if, because of reasons beyond their control, they cannot continue. Courses dropped during the first three weeks of the term will not appear on the transcript. Those dropped from the beginning of the fourth week through the ninth week of the term will be recorded with a grade of W. After the ninth week, no one may withdraw from a course. Students who are ill or have a serious personal problem should see, call, or write to an adviser in the College Advising Center, College of Arts and Science, New York University, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905, New York, NY 10003-6688; 212-998-8130. complete Withdrawals Students who wish to withdraw from all their courses must make an appointment for an interview with an adviser in the College Advising Center. A student who withdraws officially from all courses in a term may register for the following term. If the student is unable to attend the College during the term following the withdrawal, he or she should request a leave of absence from an adviser in the College Advising Center. For more information, see \"Attendance,\" below. auditing Matriculated students in the College may audit (i.e., attend lectures without intending to receive credit) any course in the College with the consent of, and under the conditions established by, the instruc- tor and the department. Auditors may not preempt space required for registered students. Courses cannot be audited as a means of satisfying requirements for an incomplete grade or as a means of changing a previous grade. A student cannot register as an auditor, and audited courses will not appear on the student's official transcript. Special (nonde- gree) students may not audit courses. aTTeNdaNce Although the administration of the College does not supervise attendance of classes, it supports the standards imposed by instructors. Students who, in the judgment of the instructor, have not substantially met the requirements of the course or who have been excessively absent may be considered to have withdrawn unofficially and may be given the final grade of F . See \"Withdrawing From Courses,\" above.religious h olidays and attendance New York University, as a nonsectarian institution, adheres to the general policy of including in its official calendar only 472 ACADEMIC POLICIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYcertain legal holidays. However, it has also long been University policy that members of any religious group may, without penalty, absent themselves from classes when compliance with their religious obligations requires it. In 1988, the University Senate affirmed this policy and passed a resolution that elaborated on it as follows:1. Students who anticipate being absent because of any religious observance should, whenever possible, notify faculty in advance of such anticipated absence. 2. Whenever feasible, examinations and assignment deadlines should not be scheduled on religious holidays. Any student absent from class because of religious beliefs shall not be penalized for any class, examination, or assignment deadline missed on that day or days. 3. If examinations or assignment deadlines are scheduled, any student who is unable to attend class because of religious beliefs shall be given the opportunity to make up that day or days. 4. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student who avails himself or herself of the above provisions. credIT credit for a dvanced Placement examinations The College participates in the Advanced Placement Program of the College Entrance Examination Board. Students who have taken Advanced Placement exams while in high school should have the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J., forward their official scores to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339. No credit is given for AP tests taken after the completion of high school. In most subjects, if the score received is 4 or 5, credit will be granted. The AP credit will be lost, however, if a student takes the equivalent course for credit in the College. For more information, see the \"Advanced Placement Equivalencies\" chart in the Admission section of this Bulletin. credit for c ourses at the c ollege To receive credit for a course, the student must register before attending, meet the requirements for attendance, and creditably complete all examinations and assignments prescribed by the instructor. For exceptional students, most departments also offer independent study. The College does not permit students to register as auditors. restrictions on r eceiving c redit (Including c ourse r epeat Policy) For students who enter the College of Arts and Science in Fall 2012 and thereafter: A student who has taken a course for credit or who has obtained a W in a course is permitted to repeat that course once. Students may not repeat more than two courses dur- ing their undergraduate careers. Students may not repeat courses in a designated sequence after taking more advanced courses. The departments determine the sequencing of courses. Students with ques- tions regarding the repetition of courses or course sequences must consult with the particular department offering the course. When a student repeats a course, no addi-tional credit will be awarded. Both grades will be recorded and computed in the grade point average. (Students who entered CAS before Fall 2012 should consult this section of the CAS Bulletin for the year they matriculated in the College to find the course repeat policy applicable to them.) A limited number of credits may be earned by those in the military services who take correspondence courses in colleges approved by the United States Armed Forces Institute. Students may not be registered at another university at the same time that they are registered in the College of Arts and Science. credit for c ourses at o ther Schools and d ivisions of New York University Courses may be taken in the New York University Graduate School of Arts and Science. 1000-level graduate courses may be taken as described in the departmental sections of this bulletin, and 2000-level graduate courses may be taken with written approval of the instructor. If graduate courses are applied toward the completion of requirements for the baccalaureate degree, no advanced credit is allowed for them in the Graduate School of Arts and Science. It is also possible for students to take courses in other undergraduate divisions of New York University and to have credits for these courses applied to the degree in the College.Students may take a total of 16 points in other divisions, including any courses for particular minors approved by the College. T ransfer students should note that credits for non-liberal-arts courses (e.g., business, applied art, speech) taken at another institution count as part of the 16 points. Students seeking additional non-liberal-arts credits beyond the 16-point limit must file a petition with the Academic Standards Committee in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. Please note that restrictions apply. Courses in other divisions that duplicate the contents of a College of Arts and Science course do not count toward the College degree. For details, students must check with an adviser in the College Advising Center before regis- tering for any courses in other divisions. If a course is not approved, students will not receive credit for it. Independent study or internship courses taken in other divisions of the University do not count toward the College degree. If such courses are taken at schools outside the University, the credit will not transfer to the College. Also excluded from credit toward the degree are any courses taken in the School of Continuing and Professional Studies once a student is registered in the College. Credit for Internet and online courses will not be counted toward the baccalaureate degree. Summer Session Once admitted to the College, students must take all courses here, including those they need or wish to take during the sum-mer. Exceptions are granted only rarely and only for good academic reasons. Requests 473 ACADEMIC POLICIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYfor a waiver should be made by submit- ting a petition to the Academic Standards Committee in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. Information about NYU summer course offerings is available during the preceding fall and spring terms, as is information about dormitory facilities available to students who usually commute. credit for Transfer Students Students are allowed to transfer up to 64 credits to the College. Credits based on semester hours are accepted from other institutions at face value and are not altered when they are transferred into the College. Quarter hours will be converted to semester hours to determine the number of credits transferable to the College of Arts and Science. Non-liberal-arts credits are not always transferable, and transfer credit is never awarded for independent study or internship courses. Only credits for course work taken with a grade of C or better will be transferred. Courses taken for a pass/fail grade will not transfer to the College. credit for Non-NYU Study a broad Credits based on semester hours (similar to schools in the United States) are accepted from institutions abroad at face value and are not altered when the credits transfer into the College. Often credits from institu- tions abroad must be adjusted or converted to correspond to the College's requirements for awarding credits. Approval to partici- pate in a non-NYU study abroad is only obtained by completing an academic pro-posal. The packet of information required to complete the proposal is available at the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. When students receive approval to partici- pate in a non-NYU program abroad, the specific courses they will take are approved and the number of transfer credits they will receive are specified. eXamINa TIoNS aNd gradeS final examinations When final examinations are missed because of illness, a doctor's note must be presented to the instructor, who may give a grade of Incomplete. See below for an outline of procedures for taking makeup examinations. makeup examinations As noted under \"Grades,\" below, a student who cannot take the final examination in a course at the regularly scheduled time may be given the grade of Incomplete. The student must discuss the reasons for missing the examination with the instructor and, in the case of illness, must submit a doctor's note to the instructor. The student must ask the instructor to give a grade of Incomplete. Incompletes are not awarded automati- cally. The time and place of any makeup examinations are set by the instructor or the department. Incomplete grades received because of a missed final examination must be removed within the semester following the one in which the Incomplete was received. In the case of students who are out of attendance, such grades must be removed within one year after the end of the course concerned. A grade of Incomplete that is not removed within this time limit becomes an F and is computed in the grade point average. (Regarding the removal of Incompletes received for missed work other than final examinations, see under \"Grades\" and \"Incompletes,\" below.) grades Students may obtain their final grades for each semester on Albert via NYUHome at home.nyu.edu. The parents or guardian of a student who is a minor (under 18 years of age) may, on a written request to the Office of the University Registrar, obtain the student's grades at any time. The following symbols indicating grades are used: A, B, C, D, P , F , and W. The fol- lowing symbol indicates incomplete work: I. Only grades of A, B, C, D, or F earned in any New York University course while matriculated in the College, or earned in any of the College's courses (courses suffixed by \"-UA\") while matriculated in another division of the University, are computed in the average. The following grades may be awarded: A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, F . In general, A indicates excellent work, B indicates good work, C indicates satisfac- tory work, and D indicates passable work and is the lowest passing grade. F indicates failure. The weights assigned in computing the grade point average are as follows: A = 4.0 A- = 3.7 B+ = 3.3 B = 3.0 B- = 2.7 C+ = 2.3C = 2.0 C- = 1.7 D+ = 1.3 D = 1.0 F = 0.0 Computing the Grade Point Average The grade point average can be obtained by determining the total of all grade points earned (quality points) and dividing that figure by the total number of credit hours completed (quality hours). For example: A student who has completed 8 points of A (4.0), 4 points of B (3.0), and 4 points of C (2.0) has a grade point average of 3.25. This is obtained by adding 8 (points of A) x 4.0 (point value of A), 4 (points of B) x 3.0 (point value of B), and 4 (points of C) x 2.0 (point value of C), which totals 52 (the total of all grade points earned), and then by dividing 52 by 16 (the total number of credit hours completed). This gives the grade point average of 3.25. Policies on Assigned Grades Once a final grade has been submitted by the instructor and recorded on the tran-script, the final grade cannot be changed by turning in additional course work. To appeal an assigned grade, the student should first consult with the instructor who assigned the grade to discuss the grading requirements for the course and how the grade was determined. If the student is not satisfied with the outcome of the discussion and wishes to appeal the grade further, a 474 ACADEMIC POLICIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYformal written appeal should be submitted to the chair and/or director of undergradu- ate studies in the particular department. An independent review of the grade will be undertaken by the department. All of the student's work will be reviewed to clarify how the grade was determined and to ensure the grade is consistent with the academic guidelines and policies of the department. The decision of the department in matters related to a course grade is final. In the case of a course that has been repeated, only the second grade, whether higher or lower, is computed into the average. The initial grade, however, remains on the transcript. The grades for courses taken abroad in one of New York University's programs or at one of the exchange sites are recorded on the transcript and are also included in the grade point average. The grades for graduate and professional courses taken at other divisions in the University are included in the grade point average, provided that permission to enroll is obtained prior to registration for the courses. Not included in the undergraduate grade point average are grades for the first year of professional courses taken by those students in the three-year accelerated dental program and grades for work done at institutions other than New York University (except for exchange sites abroad). Grade of P The grade of P (Pass) indicates a passing grade (A, B, C, or D) in a course taken under the pass/fail option. It is also used to indicate nongraded courses. The grade of P is not computed in the average. The grade of F under the pass/fail option is computed in the average. For more information and procedures to obtain the pass/fail option, see the section \"Pass/Fail Option,\" below. Grade of W The grade of W indicates an official with- drawal of the student from a course in good academic standing. Please see \"Change of Program\" and \"Withdrawing from Courses,\" above, for information on the regulations and procedures for withdrawing officially from courses. Grade of I The grade of I (Incomplete) is a temporary grade that indicates that the student has, for good reason, not completed all of the course work but that there is the possibil- ity that the student will eventually pass the course when all of the requirements have been completed. A student must ask the instructor for a grade of I, present documented evidence of illness or the equivalent, and clarify the remaining course requirements with the instructor. The incomplete grade is not awarded automatically. It is not used when there is no possibility that the student will eventu-ally pass the course. If the course work is not completed after the statutory time for making up incompletes has elapsed, the temporary grade of I shall become an F and will be computed in the student's grade point average. Incompletes All work missed in the fall term must be made up by the end of the following spring term. All work missed in the spring term or in a summer session must be made up by the end of the following fall term. Students who are out of attendance in the semester following the one in which the course was taken have one year to complete the work. Students should contact the College Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130) for an Extension of Incomplete Form, which must be approved by the instructor. Extensions of these time limits are rarely granted. Independent Study Most departments offer independent study courses for students with exceptional qualifications. In these courses, the work is planned specifically for each student. Independent study courses allow the student to work independently with faculty supervision and counsel. The courses typically carry variable credit of 2 or 4 points each term. They are normally limited to upper-class majors but may be open to other well-qualified students. To register for independent study, a student must have written approval of the director of undergraduate studies of the department in which the course is offered. The result of the independent study course should be a paper or objective, tangible evidence of completion of the work. The individual departments may grant credit for not more than 8 points of independent study for work approved in advance. In general, students are not permitted to take more than 12 points of independent study and/or internship, and no more than 8 points may be taken in any one department. Internships and/or independent study courses taken in other divisions of the University or at other universities do not count toward the College degree. More specific information can be found under the individual departmental descriptions. leave of a bsence General Leave If a student and an adviser agree that a leave of absence is the best way to proceed given the student's situation, the adviser will assist in the withdrawal from the semester and extended time for a leave of absence. A student needs to make an appointment with an adviser to discuss his or her par- ticular situation and review the terms of the leave of absence; please contact the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130. A student granted a leave does not have to make a formal application for readmission as long as he or she returns to the College within the agreed-upon time (a maximum of two semesters during a student's aca-demic career). Students who attend another college during the leave must petition to have the credits transferred after they have been approved to return to the College. Petitions may be obtained at the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. Students are advised to inquire how the leave of absence may affect their scholarship and financial aid award and should contact the Financial Aid Office at 25 West Fourth Street. If students are on probation when the leave is granted, they will return on probation. Students out of attendance who did not apply for a leave and who wish to return to the College must apply for readmission. (See the Admission section of this Bulletin.) Psychological and Medical Leave If a student and a counselor or a physician agree that a psychological or medical leave of absence is the best way to proceed given 475 ACADEMIC POLICIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYthe situation, the counselor or physician should make a recommendation to the associate dean for students at the College for the withdrawal from the semester and extended time for a leave of absence. A student needs to complete the Leave of Absence Petition form, which can be obtained at the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. Leave of absence peti-tions are accepted and reviewed on a rolling basis throughout the academic year. A Certification of Readiness to Return to School from a Leave of Absence form should be completed by the counselor/therapist or physician, who needs to state clearly that the student is ready to return and that NYU is a suitable environment in which to continue his or her academic work. The student must also schedule an appointment with a counselor/therapist or physician at the NYU Student Health Center prior to receiving approval from the College to return. A student granted a leave does not have to make a formal application for readmission as long as he or she returns to the College within the agreed-upon time (a maximum of two semesters during a student's academic career). Students who attend another college during the leave must petition to have the credits transferred after they have been approved to return to the College. Petitions may be obtained at the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. Students are advised to inquire how the leave of absence may affect their scholarship and financial aid award and should contact the Office of Financial Aid at 25 West Fourth Street. If students are on probation when the leave is granted, they will return on probation. Students out of attendance who did not apply for a leave and who wish to return to the College must apply for readmission. (See the Admission section of this Bulletin.) Pass/ fail o ption Students may elect one pass/fail option each term, including the summer sessions, for a total of not more than 32 points during their college career. The pass/fail option is not acceptable for courses completed at other institutions. The choice must be made before the com- pletion of the fifth week of the term (second week of a six-week summer session); after that time, the decision cannot be initiated or changed. No grade other than P or F will be recorded for those students choosing this option. P includes the grades of A, B, C, and D and is not counted in the average. F is counted in the average.The pass/fail option is not acceptable in the major, the minor, or any of the courses taken in fulfillment of the Morse Academic Plan requirements. Students considering the pass/fail option in their area of study or in required preprofessional courses should consult with their advisers about the effect of such grades on admission to graduate and professional schools. Students who change their majors may not be able to use courses taken under the pass/fail option to satisfy the requirements of their new majors. The form for declaring the pass/fail option may be obtained in the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130. Petitions The Faculty Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards will consider peti-tions of students to waive requirements or modify policies and regulations of the College. Students should be aware that only very exceptional cases, supported by valid and documented reasons, will be consid-ered. After deliberation, the Committee's decisions on such matters are final. Petition forms may be obtained in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. PlacemeNT eX amINa TIoNS, degree ProgreSS, aNd TraNScrIPTS Placement examinations Foreign Languages T esting and Placement Most entering students take a proficiency/placement test prior to their first registra- tion in the College. SAT-style reading tests are used as proficiency (exemption) and placement instruments in French, German, Italian, and Spanish. Students who took a foreign-language SAT Subject test while in high school are encouraged to present the score instead of or in addition to taking the College's test. Written examinations are also given in Korean, modern Greek, modern Hebrew, Latin, Portuguese, Russian, Tagalog, Japanese, and Mandarin Chinese. Testing in Cantonese can be arranged through the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis. Testing in Gaelic (Irish) can be arranged through Ireland House. Testing in Arabic, T urkish, Persian, and Hindi/Urdu can be arranged through the Department of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies. Because these are reading examina- tions, students should choose to be tested in the language in which they have good reading skills. Tests can result either in an exemption from the foreign-language requirement (see \"Foreign Language\" under Morse Academic Plan) or in placement into the appropriate-level course. Placement into a lower-level course means that the student must continue his or her studies of that language (or begin a new language) until completion of the intermediate two level of that language. In some cases, adjustments in placement may be made during the first weeks of class. Information on placement testing can be obtained from the Office of Academic Affairs, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 908; 212-998-8110. Students who place at a level below that which they have completed at another college will lose transfer credit if they repeat foreign-language course work at the College of Arts and Science. T esting Exemptions The proficiency/placement test is required of all entering students with the follow- ing exceptions: students who will begin a language they have not previously studied; students whose entire secondary schooling 476 ACADEMIC POLICIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYwas in a language other than English and other than those languages taught in the College; and foreign students who complete the sequence of required Expository Writing courses for international students. Students in these categories should contact the College Advising Center to verify that they have satisfied the foreign language requirement. Quantitative Reasoning All students who are planning to register for Quantitative Reasoning (MAP-UA 1XX) or to satisfy this Morse Academic Plan require- ment by sufficiently high score on a test must take the Quantitative Reasoning screening/ exemption test, offered by the MAP office. Biology A biology assessment examination is avail- able to entering students with Advanced Placement credit in this subject to determine whether they have the qualifica- tions for immediate placement into Honors Principles of Biology I (BIOL-UA 13) or (very rarely) into Molecular and Cell Biology I (BIOL-UA 21). degree Progress All students have access to their Degree Progress Report, as generated by the Office of the University Registrar, on Albert via NYUHome at home.nyu.edu. The Degree Progress Report is a Student Information System (SIS) accounting of completed and remaining degree requirements. Transcripts of r ecord Unofficial transcripts are available on Albert, NYU's Web-based registration and information system. Albert can be accessed via NYUHome at home.nyu.edu. Students requiring a stamped and sealed copy of their New York University records should request an official copy of their University transcript from the Office of the University Registrar. Requests for official transcripts require the signature of the student/alumnus requesting the transcript, unless the student/alumnus has a valid NetId. Current students and graduates with a valid NYU NetId (able to access NYUHome/ Albert) who attended NYU in or after 1990 can request an official transcript from the Albert Student Center. The Official T ranscript form can be found under the My Academics section of the Student Center.Alumni who attended NYU prior to 1990 and have a valid NetId can go to the Secure Online T ranscript Request Form at www. nyu.edu/registrar/transcript-form-login.html and log in with their NetId and password. A signed consent form is not required. Before completing their transcript request, current students should check to ensure that all their grades have been posted. Recent graduates should check to ensure that their degree has been recorded. Any transcript request that requires any spe- cial handling must go through the Secure Online T ranscript Request Form (see above) and cannot be requested on Albert. Special handling includes: (1) sending transcripts by express mail; (2) transcripts sent to the student or alumnus in separate sealed envelopes addressed to admissions offices of other universities; (3) including additional documents to be sent along with the NYU transcript. Former students who no longer have a valid NetId (unable to access NYUHome/Albert) or who attended New York University prior to 1990 must complete the Secure Online T ranscript Request Form (see above) and mail/fax the signature page to the Office of the University Registrar. Alternatively, they may write a letter to request transcripts and send this to the Registrar. A signed consent form is required. The request letter must include all of the following information: University ID number Current name and any other name under which the graduate attended NYU Current address Date of birth School of the University attended Dates of attendance Date of graduation The full name and address of the person or institution to which the transcript is to be sent The request may be faxed to 212-995-4154 or mailed to New York University, Office of the University Registrar, Academic Records, P .O. Box 910, New York, NY 10276-0910. There is never any charge for academic tran- scripts. T ranscripts cannot be produced for anyone whose record has been put on hold for an outstanding University obligation.requesting enrollment verification Students can view/print their own enrollment certification directly from Albert using the integrated National Student Clearinghouse student portal. This feature can be accessed from the \"request enrollment verification\" link in the My Academics section of the Student Center. Eligible students are also able to view/print a Good Student Discount Certificate, which can be mailed to an auto insurer or any other company that requests proof of status as a good student (based on the cumulative GPA). Verification of enrollment or graduation may also be requested by submitting a signed letter with the following information: University ID number Current name and any name under which the student or graduate attended NYU Current address Date of birth School of the University attended Dates attended Date of graduation The full name and address of the person or institution to which the verification is to be sent The request may be mailed to New York University, Office of the University Registrar, Enrollment Verification and Graduation, P .O. Box 910, New York, NY 10276-0910. Alternatively, signed requests may be faxed to 212-995-4154. The Registrar does not accept requests for certification by e-mail. arrears Policy The University reserves the right to deny registration and withhold all information regarding the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of tuition, fees, loans, or other charges (including charges for housing, dining, or other activities or services) for as long as any arrears remain. diploma a rrears Policy Diplomas of students in arrears will be held until their financial obligations to the University are fulfilled and they have been cleared by the Bursar. Graduates with a diploma hold may contact the Office of the Bursar at 212-998-2806 to clear arrears 477 ACADEMIC POLICIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYor to discuss their financial status at the University. diploma application Students may officially graduate in September, January, or May. The all-Uni- versity Commencement ceremony is held in May. The College holds two baccalaureate ceremonies, one in December and one in May. Students must apply for graduation on Albert, and they must be enrolled for either course work, leave of absence, or maintenance of matriculation during their final semester. To graduate in a specific semester, students must apply for graduation within the application deadline period indicated on the calendar available at the Office of the University Registrar's Web page at www.nyu.edu/registrar. It is recommended that students apply for graduation no later than the beginning of the semester in which they plan to complete all program requirements. Students who do not successfully complete all academic requirements by the end of that semester must reapply for graduation for the following cycle. academIc ST aNdard S aNd dIScIPlINe academic Standards The Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards reviews student records through- out the academic year. All of its actions are based on the grades to date at the end of the term. Academic Alert Students with cumulative grade point aver-ages of 2.0 to 2.25 will receive an academic alert letter reflecting the committee's specific recommendations for achieving an appro- priate standard for academic performance. Academic Probation Any student whose record is deemed unsatis-factory will be placed on academic probation and will be so informed by letter. A record will be deemed unsatisfactory if, in any semester, the cumulative or semester grade point average falls below 2.0 or if it fails to show steady and substantial progress toward the degree. Steady and substantial progress toward the degree entails the completion, with satisfactory grades, of more than half of the courses (and points) for which a student registers in any semester. In addi- tion, it entails satisfactory progress in the student's major. Failure to satisfy the conditions of probation will result in further academic sanctions and possibly dismissal from the College. The conditions usually require that the student (a) achieve a grade point aver-age of at least 2.0 during the term he or she is on probation, (b) not receive any grade below a C or any grade of I, and (c) not withdraw from any course without securing the permission of the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards prior to the withdrawal. Students on academic probation are also required to have a special probation interview with an adviser in the College Advising Center to receive registra-tion clearance for the next semester. More specific requirements may be imposed. The Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards may summon students with unsatisfactory records to discuss their problems and to determine whether and under what conditions they may continue in the College. In special circumstances, the committee may recommend to the dean that students may be granted or placed on leave for a period not to exceed two semesters. Students on academic probation may not engage in any extracurricular activities (except for departmental clubs) and may not hold office in these clubs without the approval of the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards. Students on academic probation should be aware that they are usually ineligible for financial aid. Academic Dismissal Students who are dismissed from the College for poor academic performance will be informed via e-mail two to three weeks after their most recent grades are posted for the enrolled semester. Students who have paid tuition for the next term at the time of dismissal will receive a full refund of tuition and fees. academic Integrity Community of the Mind The College is a \"community of the mind.\" Its students, faculty, and staff all share the goal of pursuing truth through free and open inquiry, and we support one another's endeavors in this regard. As in any commu- nity, membership comes with certain rights and responsibilities. Foremost among these is academic integrity. Cheating on an exam, falsifying data, or having someone else write a paper undermines others who are \"doing it on their own\"; it makes it difficult or impossible to assess fairly a student's interest, aptitude, and achievement; and it diminishes the cheater, depriving him or her of an education. Most important, academic dishonesty is a violation of the very principles upon which the academy is founded. Thus, when students enter the College, one of the first things that they are asked to do is to sign a community compact, recognizing these principles of academic integrity. For this reason also, violations of these principles are treated with the utmost seriousness. Procedures and Sanctions The penalty for academic dishonesty is severe. The following are the procedures as approved by the Faculty of Arts and Science. 1. If a student cheats on an examination or in laboratory work or engages in plagiarism, appropriate disciplinary action should be taken. The department can take the following actions: a. The faculty member, with the approval of the director of under-graduate studies (director), may reduce the student's grade or give the student an F in the course. b. If after lowering the grade or assign- ing an F the department believes a more severe penalty (i.e., probation, suspension, expulsion) is warranted, it can refer the case to the dean or his or her representative (associate dean for students) for further action. 2. In all cases of either (a) or (b), the direc-tor shall inform the department chair of any action in writing and send copies of this letter to the dean and to the student. 478 ACADEMIC POLICIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYThe letter shall include the nature of the offense, the penalty, and the right of the student to appeal such penalty. A copy of the letter shall be kept in a confidential chairman's file and not in the student's departmental file. The dean's office copy shall also be kept in a confidential file. (The professor and/or the director is encouraged to meet with the student and discuss the nature of the offense and the action taken.) 3. For cases involving a first offense at New York University, the dean shall send the student by e-mail and first-class mail a notice that a second offense will result in a one-semester suspension or a more severe penalty. (The student is also called in to discuss the offense and review the consequences of the disciplinary action.) 4. For cases involving a second offense, the dean shall proceed as follows: a. Upon receiving a second direc- tor's letter concerning a given student, the dean shall convene a three-member ad hoc committee, with no member being from the department involved, to examine the evidence. This ad hoc committee shall consider if there are reasonable grounds to believe that cheating/ plagiarism has occurred and if so, shall affirm the suspension penalty. It shall report its conclusion to the dean within three business days. b. If the committee affirms the suspen- sion, the dean shall send the student by registered mail the suspension letter within two business days of receiving the report. The letter shall advise the student of his or her right to appeal. The student shall have two business days from the letter's delivery to request an appeal of the suspension as provided in Section 5 (below). The suspension shall ordinarily be stayed during the pendency of appeal. c. If the committee does not affirm the suspension, the report shall be kept on file for a one-year period. 5. The student in all cases has the right to appeal to the dean. In the event of an appeal, the dean shall elicit a written complaint from the faculty member and proceed as described above. discipline Students are expected to familiarize themselves and to comply with the rules of conduct, academic regulations, and established practices of the University and the College of Arts and Science, as stated in the Student Disciplinary Procedures and as outlined in the chapter \"University Policies and Procedures\" in the NYU Student's Guide. If, pursuant to such rules, regulations, or practices, the withdrawal of a student is required before the end of the term for which tuition has been paid, a refund will be made according to the standard schedule for refunds. Below is a summary of the offenses for which students may be subject to disciplinary charges by the Committee on Student Discipline: 1. False representation or forgery of academic documents 2. Deliberate destruction, theft, or unauthorized use of laboratory data, research materials, computer resources, or university property 3. Disruption of an academic event 4. Actual or threatened violence or harassment Depending on the seriousness of the offense, the following penalties may be imposed after a hearing by the Committee on Student Discipline:Censure Written reprimand for violation of a speci- fied regulation, including the possibility of more severe disciplinary sanction in the event of a subsequent violation of any University regulation within a period of time stated in the letter of reprimand. Disciplinary Probation Suspension of privileges or exclusion from participating in extra-curricular University activities as set forth by the Committee on Student Discipline for a specified period of time. Suspension Exclusion from classes, as well as suspen- sion of privileges and exclusion from other activities, as set forth in the notice of suspension for a definite period of time. A student who has been suspended and who is found \"not guilty\" shall be allowed full opportunity to make up whatever work was missed because of the suspension. Dismissal Termination of student status for an indefi-nite period. The conditions for readmission, if any are permitted, shall be stated by the committee in the order of dismissal. If, as a result of disciplinary action, the withdrawal of a student is required before the end of the term for which tuition has been paid, a refund will be made according to the standard schedule for refunds. Student g rievance Students in the College of Arts and Science are referred to the \"Student Grievance Procedure\" applicable to all the schools of New York University as found in the NYU Student's Guide. The College adheres to all articles of the \"Student Grievance Procedure\" as set forth in the \"University Policies and Procedures\" section of the NYU Student's Guide. UNIverSITY PolIcIeS aNd camPUS S afeTY University Policy on Patents Students offered research opportunities are reminded that inventions arising from participation in such research are governed by the University's \"Statement of Policy on Patents,\" a copy of which may be found in the Faculty Handbook or obtained from the dean's office. Immunization requirements New York State Public Health Law (NYS PHL) 2165 requires all students registering for 6 or more credits in a degree- granting program to provide immunization documentation for measles (rubeola), mumps, and rubella (German measles) prior to registration. Students born before January 1, 1957, are exempt. New students 479 ACADEMIC POLICIES C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYshould complete the MMR section of the Student Health History form. Continuing students should complete and submit a Student Immunization Record Form (PDF), available at www.nyu.edu/shc/pdfs/ student_immunization_record.pdf. New York State Public Health Law (NYS PHL) 2167 requires that all students registered for 6 or more credits submit a Meningitis Response Form as formal confirmation of their decision as to whether or not to be immunized with the meningo-coccal (meningitis) vaccine. New students should complete the Meningitis Response section of the Student Health History form. Continuing students should complete and submit a Meningitis Response Form (PDF), available at www.nyu.edu/shc/pdfs/meningi-tis_response.pdf. Failure to comply with state immunization laws will prevent NYU students from registering for classes. In addition to these requirements, the NYU Student Health Center recommends that students also consider hepatitis B and varicella immuniza-tions. Students should discuss immunization options with their primary care provider. campus Safety The Department of Public Safety is located at 14 Washington Place; telephone: 212- 998-2222; 212-998-2220 (TTY). New York University's annual Campus Security Report includes statistics for the previous three years concerning reported crimes that occurred on campus, in certain off-campus buildings or property owned or controlled by NYU, and on public property within or immediately adjacent to the cam- pus. The report also includes institutional policies concerning campus security, such as policies concerning sexual assault, drugs, and alcohol. Students may obtain a copy of the current report by contacting Thomas Grace, Director of Judicial Affairs and Compliance, Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs (601 Kimmel Center: 212-998-4403), or Jay Zwicker, Crime Prevention Manager, Department of Public Safety (7 Washington Place: 212-998- 1451), or by visiting the following website: www.nyu.edu/public.safety/policies. New York University Weapons Policy New York University strictly prohibits the possession of all weapons, as described in local, state, and federal statutes, including, but not limited to, firearms, knives, and explosives, in and/or around any and all University facilities\u2014academic, residential, or others. This prohibition extends to all buildings\u2014whether owned, leased, or controlled by the University, regardless of whether the bearer or possessor is licensed to carry that weapon. The possession of any weapon has the potential of creating a dangerous situation for the bearer and others. The only exceptions to this policy are duly authorized law enforcement personnel who are performing official federal, state, or local business and instances in which the bearer of the weapon is licensed by an appropri-ate licensing authority and has received written permission from the executive vice president of the University. New York University Simulated firearm Policy New York University strictly prohibits simulated firearms in and/or around any and all University facilities\u2014academic, resi- dential, or other. This prohibition extends to all buildings\u2014whether owned, leased, or controlled by the University. The possession of a simulated firearm has the potential of creating a dangerous situation for the bearer and others. The only exceptions to this policy are instances in which (1) the bearer is in possession of written permission from a dean, associate dean, assistant dean, or department head and (2) such possession or use of simulated firearms is directly connected to a University- or school- related event (e.g., play, film production). Whenever an approved simulated firearm is transported from one location to another, it must be placed in a secure container in such a manner that it cannot be observed. Storage of approved simulated firearms shall be the responsibility of the Department of Public Safety in a location designated by the vice president for public safety. Under no circumstances, other than at a Public Safety storage area, may approved simulated firearms be stored in any University-owned, -leased, or -controlled facilities.480 HONORS AND A WARDS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYHonors and Awards dean's h onors l ist A Dean's Honors List is compiled at the end of each academic year, in June. This is an honors roll of matriculated students who have achieved an average of 3.65 or higher for that academic year (September to May) in at least 28 graded points. To be listed, a student must not have any grades of Incomplete or N at the time when the list is compiled. Note that grade point averages are carried to two decimal places (but are not rounded off). honorary Societies in a rts and Science Any student seeking to join a departmental scholastic honorary society is required to maintain, as a minimum scholastic require-ment for election to membership, a general average of 3.50, as well as an average in the major subject of 3.50. Students should consult with departmental advisers in regard to the specific requirements for the various departmental honor societies. Phi Beta Kappa Phi Beta Kappa celebrates and advocates excellence in the liberal arts and sciences. The Phi Beta Kappa Society invites for induc- tion the most outstanding arts and science students in America's leading colleges and universities. NYU's College of Arts and Science chapter, the Beta of New York, was established in 1858. In terms of seniority, it ranks as the 15th oldest chapter of the Society. Each April, the faculty members of the Beta chapter automatically review the academic performance of all students in the College for eligibility for election to Phi Beta Kappa.eligibility for g raduation with latin honors To be graduated with honors, a student must have at least 64 points earned in courses from CAS, GSAS and selected Tisch departments. All graded courses taken while enrolled either in the College or in another school of NYU will be used in computing the grade point average on which Latin honors are based, as long as the 64 point residency requirement is met. Pass grades are not counted; grades received in courses taken at other institu- tions are also not counted. The student must also have a clean record of conduct. Effective with the September 2008 graduat- ing class, the GPA cutoffs for each category are determined by the combined GPA distri- bution from the preceding academic year, all graduation moments included. The cutoff for summa cum laude is the GPA included within the top 5 percent of the previous year's graduating class. The cutoff for magna cum laude is the GPA included within the next 10 percent of the previous year's class. The cutoff for cum laude is the GPA included within the next 15 percent of the previous year's class. For example, the necessary GPA level for summa cum laude for students graduating in September 2008 will be based on the GPA cutoff for the top 5 percent of the combined graduates from September 2007, January 2008, and May 2008. departmental honors Students who have completed at least 64 points of graded work in the College may be awarded degrees with departmental honors if they complete the designated honors sequence in a department and maintain the requisite grade point average. There are three levels: honors, high honors, and highest honors. Students seeking admission to and gradua- tion with departmental honors are expected to have a minimum grade point average of 3.65, both overall and in the major. Departments may exercise some flexibility in admissions, as follows. In rare cases where a candidate for admission to a departmental honors program falls short of the expected minimum GPA, the director of undergrad-uate studies or the director of departmental honors may petition the director of college honors for an exception. In all cases, once admitted, students are expected to maintain the GPA at the stipulated level in order to graduate with departmental honors. Should there be an exceptional circumstance in which the stipulated GPA is not main- tained, the director of college honors may be petitioned for an exception. If the case is compelling, the latter will inform the registrar's office of the waiver. Honors programs must, minimally, be a two-term (8-point) experience that includes a capstone research project. The capstone project, which typically culminates in a thesis, should reflect sustained original research over two semesters. The scope and length of a thesis will vary by discipline, but the thesis is typically 40 to 60 pages in length. All students completing departmental hon- ors must make public presentations of their work, preferably at the CAS Undergraduate Research Conference (URC) held at the end of the academic year, or in a departmental forum (e.g., oral defenses or presentations) held in conjunction with the URC.hoNorSMatriculated students with superior academic records are honored in various ways, such as by placement on the Dean's Honors List, election to honor societies, and admission to departmental honors programs.Additional information may be obtained from departmental advisers and from the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130.481 HONORS AND A WARDS C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYStudents with double majors in discrete, unrelated disciplines must complete honors programs in each major for which they seek honors. Students with double majors in inter- disciplinary or related fields may, if the two departments concur, convene a joint honors committee to establish an interdisciplinary research program of course work that cul- minates in a single thesis. Similarly, in the case of joint majors, the relevant departments must work out an agreement on the require- ments for honors and on the supervision and evaluation of students' theses or projects. Presidential h onors Scholars Membership in the Presidential Honors Scholars at the College of Arts and Science offers outstanding students the opportunity to receive special advising from College faculty and staff, to challenge themselves in honors courses and through independent research, to study away, to take advantage of New York City's cultural resources, and to develop leadership skills through community service. Scholars comprise a distinguished group of undergraduates; only the top 10 percent of the entering class are chosen, and students who apply for entry after they have matriculated must demonstrate not only superlative academic achievements but also a consistent record of leadership and service to the community. Freshmen appointed on the basis of their high school records participate in a Scholars Seminar. They meet regularly for lectures and discussions and participate in a wide variety of cocurricular activities. These include the Scholars Lecture Series, cultural events in the city, social events, and community service projects. Scholars also register for a Freshman Honors Seminar. During the January intersession, freshman scholars travel with faculty mentors to Villa La Pietra in Florence, Italy. Sophomore scholars also participate in a study away spring break, choosing a destination that most closely relates to their academic or personal interests. During their junior or senior year, scholars spend an entire semester (or year) studying at one of NYU's programs or exchanges away. In their junior and senior years, they also enroll in the honors track of their chosen major. In addition, Presidential Honors Scholars are committed to volun- teering and serving in the community.Membership in the Scholars Program is renewable annually, depending on the quality of the scholar's academic records and his or her level of participation in the program. All scholars are expected to be full-time students and maintain a grade point average of at least 3.65. Students who are not designated as Presidential Honors Scholars for the freshman year are invited to apply for membership at the end of the spring semester. Further information is available from the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909 (212-998-8140) or from the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor (212-998-4540). martin l uther King, Jr., Scholars Program Since its inception in 1987, the Martin Luther King, Jr., Scholars Program has awarded over 400 need-based and merit scholarships to incoming freshmen at NYU. These students present records of outstand-ing academic achievement, leadership, and commitment to the principles of commu- nity service, humanitarianism, and social progress. MLK Scholars help to plan and participate in academic and cultural events that draw on the vast resources of New York University and New York City. They explore cultural diversity through domestic and international travel and take the lead in helping others through community service. Women in Science Program The Women in Science (WINS) Program selects and supports a core group of talented, motivated women from each entering class who are interested in a career path focused on science and math research. These women, WINS Scholars, will have the opportunity to participate in a program of study, research, and mentoring specifically tailored to their chosen academic path. WINS Scholars are offered certain specialized courses and invitations to events with notable women in the science and math professions, as well as both a financial scholarship and a research stipend. Information is available from the College's Preprofessional Center (Silver Center, Room 901; 212-998-8160).lewis r udin c ity Scholars Rudin Scholars are outstanding entering freshmen selected from public and parochial high schools in all five boroughs of New York City. In addition to their scholarship, the scholars participate in academic and cultural activities in New York City. The program is named in honor of the late real estate developer Lewis Rudin, former presi-dent of the Association for a Better New York and an NYU alumnus and trustee. departmental a wards and Prizes Africana Studies Prize Presented for excellence in this field.

Through NYU's Office of Civic Engagement, students volunteer with dozens of not-for-profit organizations throughout New York City.488 STUDENT A CTIvITIES, UNIvERSITY SER vICES, AND C OMMUNITY SER vICE C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYCommunity service provides an opportu- nity to address major social, health, hunger, and environmental issues. Through service, students enhance their leadership skills, find fulfillment in giving back something to the community, and build new relationships while learning more about themselves. Service Activities There are many ways to become involved in activities on and off campus. Students in the College collect canned goods, conduct toy drives, and distribute bag lunches to the homeless. They work in dropout- prevention programs that encourage high school students to stay in school. They renovate houses and make them livable again. Students in the Presidential Scholars Program participate in ongoing service projects such as the Dean's Service Honor Corps, the University Settlement House, the Door, and the Beacon House. Whether their involvement is with the sick, the poor, or those who simply need a helping hand, student volunteers give of themselves freely. And they all agree that they get back much more than they give. To strengthen and further support commu- nity-service initiatives, the University sponsors a central Office of Civic Engagement (www.nyu.edu/civic.engagement). In addition, the President's Office sponsors a special C-Team for service, involving over 250 students working as tutors and mentors for young people at sites in Greenwich Village and the Lower East Side. Regular meetings and social events are sponsored by the Office of the President. Members are invited to submit proposals for special projects where they can call on their own skills and talents. For more information, contact 212-998-2329. Students selected for the Scholars Program in the College of Arts and Science have the opportunity to apply for the Dean's Service Honor Corps. The Honor Corps makes a special commitment to community service and assumes a leadership role in promot-ing service in the College. This group of qualified scholars works with the dean on a weekly community-service project. Service-learning courses link structured academic course work with community service for academic credit. The College offers service-learning courses related to the numerous majors and academic areas of concentration available to students. For more information about these courses, contact particular departments or the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. Many student clubs and organizations, such as Asian Initiative and Fraternity and Sorority Life, sponsor special service proj- ects and philanthropic events throughout the year. To find out more about becom- ing involved, contact the Office of Civic Engagement (212-998-2329) or Fraternity and Sorority Life (212-998-4710). In addition to clubs and organizations, the Center for Student Activities, Leadership, and Service sponsors Alternative Breaks, nontraditional winter or spring vacations in which students participate in a weeklong community service project. Another option available to students is OutReach, a volunteer corps that introduces freshmen to service in New York City (212-998-4954). The NYU Office of Civic Engagement (212-998-2329) provides students with information about service opportunities. Hundreds of volunteer positions are on file in this office. Personnel are available to provide advice and support, Monday to Friday, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The office also sponsors special events and welcomes organizations to post volunteer positions.489 FACULTY C OLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCE NEW Y ORk UNIvERSITYFaculty of Arts and Science Gabriel Abend, Assistant Professor of Sociology; Licenciado 2000, Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica (Uruguay); M.A. 2004, 2008, Northwestern Abercrombie, Associate Professor of Anthropology; B.G.S. 1973, Michigan; Ph.D. 1986, Chicago Gerard Aching, Professor of Spanish and Portuguese; B.A. 1982, California (Berkeley); Ph.D. 1991, Cornell Phillip AckermanLieberman, Assistant Professor and Faculty Fellow of Hebrew and Judaic Studies; B.A. 1990, Washington (Seattle); M.S. 1991, London School of Economics; M.A. 2002, Jewish Theological Seminary; Ph.D. 2007, Princeton Maeve E.

For more informa- tion, see the Cross-School Minors section of this Bulletin. This Bulletin contains descriptions of the College's departments, programs, and courses. The first part of every course number iden- tifies the department or program offering or cross-listing the course (for example, ARTH for art history). This is always followed by a two-letter suffix. The suffix \"UA\" indicates undergraduate courses offered in the College; \"GA\" indicates a graduate course offered by the Graduate School of Arts and Science. The numeric identifier comes last (for example, a complete course rubric would be ARTH-UA 677). Graduate courses open to qualified under - graduates are designated by the departments. The departmental policy in this matter may be indicated either in this Bulletin or in the Graduate School of Arts and Science Bulletin; interested students are also advised to check directly with the relevant departments. *HEGIS: Higher Education General Information Survey Degree and Certificate Programs as registered by the New York State Education Department.
