Animal studies of candidate vaccines against SARS -CoV-1 have raised concerns about potential VMED in recipients of COVID -19 vaccines . Challenge studies in nonhuman primates after COVID -19 vaccination did not demonstrate VMED, and human clinical trials of mRNA vaccines have found no evidence of VMED. Despite these reassuring findings, long -term monitoring is needed since declining antibody titers could alter VMED risk over time . An observ ational study of VMED can simultaneously estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) for hospitalized COVID -19, an important endpoint to assess the impact of vaccination on disease burden. This study in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) will estimate VE against COVID-19 hospitalization and provide data to assess the risk of VMED in vaccine recipients. Study Aims 1. Estimate class - and product -specific VE against COVID -19 hospitalization and seve re respiratory illness in a cohort of VSD enrollees . This aim w ill genera te a signal for VMED if VE <0 with a 95% confidence interval that excludes 0. 2. Compare severity and outcomes in fully vaccinated and unvaccinated patients hospitalized for acute COVID -19 illness. To identify VMED, we will test the hypothesis that COVID -19 vaccination is associated with COVID -19- related ICU admission or increasing severity based on the WHO Clinical Progression Scale. Study Design Aim 1. Prospective cohort study of VSD enrollees who are age-eligible for COVID - 19 vaccination based on Emergency Use Authorization . Aim 2. Cross-sectional analysis of severity in fully vaccinated and unvaccinated patients hospitalized with COVID -19. Study Duration For per sons 16 years of age, follow -up time beginning on February 1, 2021 will be recorded in our database, approximately when states began prioritizing COVID -19 vaccines for individuals aged 65 years old. Follow -up time starting on May 10, 2021 will be capture d for persons 12 -15 years of age, when the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine received EUA for this age group. Similarly, follow -up time starting on October 29, 2021 will be captured for persons 5 -11 Page iii VSD Study #1341 | Version 1.4 | 11 JANUARY 2022 Title: COVID -19 VMED an d name: COVID -19 years of age, when the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine received EUA for this age group . Follow -up will continue for approximately 24 months , until Q1 of 2023 . Eligibility Criteria Aim 1 . For the cohort analysis, VSD dynamic data files (DDF) will identify eligible individuals 12 years of age at eac h VSD site . Eligible individuals must have at least 12 months of continuous VSD enrollment at the start of follow -up to ensure ascertainment of relevant medical conditions and prior COVID -19 hospitalization . Individuals with a prior inpatient diagnosis of COV ID-19 will be excluded. Aim 2 . For the cross -sectional severity analysis, COVID -19 hospitalized individuals will be sampled each month . Fully vaccinated patients who are hospitalized for COVID -19 will be frequency matched to unvaccinated COVID -19 patients based on VSD site and age group . Individuals who are partially vaccinated at the time of hospitalization will be excluded. Classification of Vaccination Status Aim 1 . For two dose vaccines, p erson -time will be categorized into 4 groups: Unvaccinated (all unvaccinated and vaccinated person -time until <14 days after dose 1); Partia lly vacc inated (14 days after dose 1 until <14 days after dose 2 ); Fully vaccinated ( 14 days after dose 2 until <14 days after dose 3 ); Boosted ( based on CDC reco mmendation ) For one dose vaccines, person -time will be categorized into 3 group s: Unvaccinated (all unvaccinated and vaccinated person -time until <14 days after dose 1); Fully vaccinated ( 14 days after dose 1 until <14 days after dose 2 ); Boosted (based o n CDC recommendation ) Individuals will accrue vaccinated person -time on the first day of follow -up if doses were received at least 14 days prior to the calendar date when study follow -up period begins. A 14-day window for development of immunity will be used for Pfizer/BioNTech , Moderna , and Janssen vaccines. Vaccine manufacturer, dates of administration, and dose number will be extracted from VSD data files. The completeness of VSD COVID -19 vaccine records will be validated by medical record abstraction in Aim 2. Aim 2 . Vaccination status will be assessed as fully vaccinated or unvaccinated at the time of COVID -19 hospitalization. Individuals will be classified as fully vaccinated if they co mpleted the 2 dose series (Pfizer and Moderna) at least 14 days before hospital admission, or if they received a single dose vaccine (Janssen) at least 14 days before hospital admission . The unvaccinated group will be restricted to individuals who received 0 doses of COVID -19 vaccine before hospital admission. Partially vaccinated individuals will be excluded from the Aim 2 analysis. Endpoint s Aim 1 . The primary endpoint is hospitalization with an ICD-10 diagnosis code for COVID -19. These include U07.1 ( COVID -19 infection or disease) J12.82 (pneumonia due to COVID -19), or M35.81 (multisystem inflammatory syndrome Page iv VSD Study #1341 | Version 1.4 | 11 JANUARY 2022 Title: COVID -19 VMED an d to COVID -19 [MIS -C]). We will not require laboratory confirmation of SARS - CoV-2 infection since diagnostic tests may be performed pr ior to hospital admission and not available in VSD data files. The secondary Aim 1 endpoint is respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID -19, identified by the combination of U07.1 , J12.82, or M35.81 and a diagnosis code for ARDS ( J80) or acute respiratory failure ( J96.0*) during the same hospitalization . Aim 2 . The co-primary severity endpoints are 1) admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and 2) WHO Clinical Progression Scale. The latter is an ordin al scale based on setting and need for respiratory or cardiovascular support. For hospitalized patients, scores range from 4 (no oxygen therapy) to 9 (mechanical ventilation with vasopressors, dialysis, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO )). The s core is 10 for COVID -19 death. Endpoints for Aim 2 will be manually abstracted from medical records . The abstraction will also be used to validate the ICD -10 codes (J80 and J96.0*) that define severe COVID -19 respiratory illness in Aim 1. Medical records will be reviewed (when available) from up to 50 patients per month across all participating VSD sites . Vaccinated hospitalized patients will be frequency matched to unvaccinated hospitalized patients in strata defined by age group , VSD site, and month of admission . Sampling of COVID -19 hospitalizations for abstraction will occur throughout the 24 -month study period. Analysis For both Aims, data will be extracted from VSD files with a 12 week lag to ensure nearly complete capture of COVID -19 vaccinations and hospital admissions. Aim 1 . The specific analytic approach will be described in a separate statistical analysis plan. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis will generate hazard ratios for COVID -19 hospitalization and severe COVID -19 (ARDS or respiratory failure). VE will be defined as 100* (1-HR). We will construct s eparate models for each endpoint and class/ product. The primary analysis will include separate VE estimates by age group (5-11 years, 12-17 years, 18 -64 years, 65 years) and sex. We will assess changes in VE with increasing time after vaccination. We will separately estimate VE for fully vaccinated and pa rtially vaccinated person -time relative to unvaccinated person -time . Model covariates and analytic approach will be described in the statistical analysis plan. The final analysis will include a sensitivity analysis using a 7 -day window and 21 -day window after each vaccine dose as the threshold for development of immunity. If feasible, the final analysis will include VE estimates for the following subgroups : 1) mixed -product recipients (e.g., 1 dose each of Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna) ; and 2) booster dose recipients . Page v VSD Study #1341 | Version 1.4 | 11 JANUARY 2022 Title: COVID -19 VMED an d name: COVID -19 VMED /VE We will conduct at least one interim analysis during the study period . The specific timing and scope of the interim analyses will be determined in consultation with CDC. The final analysis will occur after approximately 24 months of follo w-up. Aim 2 . The specific analytic approach will be described in a separate statistical analysis plan. For each severity endpoint, doubly robust estimation of potential outcomes will be used to examine the association with COVID -19 vaccination status. The primary model will include hospitalized patients who are either unvaccinated or fully vaccinated with any FDA -authorized COVID -19 vaccine. If feasible, s eparate models will assess specific products. Covariates may include any of those described in Aim 1 an d any sourced from medical record abstraction. One interim analysis is planned after approximately 600 chart abstractions (50% of planned total) have been completed. A significant association between COVID - 19 vaccination and severity will be interpreted as evidence supporting (but not proving) VMED.

More than 60 million COVID -19 cases have been diagnosed in the US, and over 835,000 people have died from this disease ( covid.cdc.gov/covid -data -tracker ). Vaccine development has occurred at a record pace, and three highly efficacious vaccines have received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . Two vaccines use an mRNA platform with a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery s ystem. The modified mRNA codes for the stabilized prefusion form of SARS -CoV-2 spike protein. The Moderna vaccine (mRNA -1273) is authorized for use in persons aged 18 years ; it is administered as a 100 \u00b5g intramuscular ( IM) dose at 0 and 28 days. The Pfiz er/BioNTech vaccine (BNT162b2) is authorized for use in persons aged 5 years. It is administered as a 30 \u00b5g IM dose at 0 and 21 days for persons aged 12 years and as a 10 \u00b5g IM dose at 0 and 21 days for children aged 5-11 years . On August 23, 2021 it rec eived FDA approval for use in persons aged 16 years; individuals 5-15 years continue to receive the Pfizer /BioNTech vaccine under EUA. The Janssen vaccine uses a replication incompetent human adenovirus (Ad26) vector to deliver a transgene for stabilized spike protein. It is administered as a single IM dose of 5 x 1010 viral particles. Additional vaccines are in late phase clinical development, including a two dose chimp adenovirus vector vaccine ( AstraZeneca ) and a two dose recombinant spike protein nanoparticle vaccine (Novavax). One or more of these vaccines may receive EUA in the coming months. One particular safety concern for all COVID -19 vaccines is vaccine -mediated enhanced disease (VM ED), also known as vaccine -associ ated enhanced disease . VMED was first reported in the 1960s in children who received an investigational formalin -inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine [1]. The vaccine generated an antibody response, but a paradox ical effect was observed with more severe RSV illness in vaccine recipients. Eighty percent of RSV -infected vaccine recipients were hospitalized compared to only 8% of RSV -infected children in the control group. Similar evidence of enhanced disease was obs erved in children who received an inactivated measles vaccine [2]. Decades later, experimental vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS -CoV-1) were associated with more severe disease after challenge in animal models [3]. Two components of the adaptive immu ne res ponse appear to mediate VM ED in animals. First, immune complex formation with complement deposition led to activation of inflammatory cytokines in the lungs. Second, the vaccine triggered a T helper type 2 (Th2) biased immune response of CD4+ T cells. The Th2-type cytokines include interleukin 4 (IL4), IL5, and IL13, which are associated with immunoglobulin E (IgE) and allergic eosinophilic responses. Our current understanding is that two immune mark ers may indicate high er risk of VM ED: elevated ratio of bi nding antibodies to neutralizing antibodies, and Th2 biased CD4+ response. The pathogenesis of VM ED appears to be distinct from antibody -dependent enhancement (ADE), a phenomenon that has been associated with a dengue vaccine [4]. The risk of VM ED after COVID -19 vaccination is theoretical. Limited challenge studies in n onhuman primates after SARS -CoV-2 vaccination have not demonstrated evidence of VM ED, but follow -up time was short [5]. A trial of the Moderna mRNA vaccine in humans did not observe a Th2 biased response or a high level of binding (nonneutralizing) antibodies [6, 7] . The Pfizer/BioNTech p hase 2/3 trial did not identify any clinical or immunologic findings that suggest VMED [8]. Similarly, the Janssen Ad26 vaccine generated neutralizing antibodies t hat increased up to 57 days after vaccination, and the T -cell response was Th1 -biased [9]. All three vaccines generate high levels of neutralizing antibodies and there has been a Th1 biased response rather than Th2. In FDA EUA subm issions, all three vaccines were reported to have 85% to 100% efficacy against severe COVID -19. All COVID -19 hospitalizations and deaths occurred in placebo recipients, providing further evidence that VMED does not occur soon after vaccination . Page 2 VSD Study #1341 | Version 1.4 | 11 JANUARY 2022 Despite these reassuring findings, long -term monitoring is needed since declining antibody titers coul d alter VMED risk over time. Studies to assess VMED risk can also be used to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against serious COVID -19 illness, since VMED and VE are measuring risk in opposite directions. This protocol describes an observational study in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) that will estimate VE against COVID -19 hospitalization and monitor for evidence of VMED during the st udy period. 2 Study Aims 1. Estimate class - and product -specific VE against COVID -19 hospitalization and severe respiratory illness in a cohort of VSD enrollees . This aim will generate a signal for VMED if VE <0 with a 95% confi dence interval that excludes 0. 2. Compare COVID -19 severity and outcomes in fully vaccinated and unvaccinated patients hospitalized for acute COVID -19 illness. To identify VMED, we will test the hypothesis that COVID -19 vaccination is associated with 1) COVID -19-related ICU admission ; and 2 ) increasing severity based on WHO Clinical Progression Scale after adjustment for potential confounders in the potential outcomes framework . 3 Study Design and Population The VSD is a collaboration between the Immunization Safety Office at the CDC and nine integrated healthcare systems in the US (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vsd/index.html ). Healthcare systems contribute data on their members and patients, creating a large populat ion of individuals for whom near complete immunization records and healthcare claims data are available. The annual VSD population is approximately 12 million people, or 3% of the US population. The VSD population includes individuals across the age spectr um; about 20% are children and 16% are 65 years or older. All VSD sites will participate in this study including Denver Health (Denver, CO), Harvard Pilgrim (Boston, MA), HealthPartners (Minneapolis, MN), Kaiser Permanente Colorado (Denver, CO), Kaiser Per manente Northern California (Oakland, CA), Kaiser Permanente Northwest (Portland, OR), Kaiser Permanente Southern California (Los Angeles, CA), Kaiser Permanente Washington (Seattle, WA), and Marshfield Clinic (Marshfield, WI). All sites will contribute da ta except Harvard Pilgrim. Additionally, Kaiser Permanente Northern California and Kaiser Permanente Southern California will only contribute data for Aim 2 . We will address Aim 1 with a prospective cohort study of VSD enrollees who are age-eligible for COVID-19 vaccination based on FDA EUA criteria and ACIP recommendation . We will address Aim 2 with a cross -section al analysis of severity in fully vaccinated and unvaccinated patients who are hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID - 19. For persons 16 years o f age, follow -up time beginning on February 1, 2021 will be recorded in our database, approximately when states began prioritizing COVID -19 vaccines for individuals aged 65 years old. Follow -up time starting on May 10, 2021 will be captured for persons 12 -15 years of age, when the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID - 19 vaccine received EUA for this age group. Follow -up time starting on October 29, 2021 will be captured for persons 5 -11 years of age, when the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine received EUA for this age gro up. Vaccinated and unvaccinated person -time will accrue for approximately 24 months , until Q 1 of 2023. 3.1. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Aim 1 . For the cohort analysis, VSD dynamic data files (DDF) will identify individuals 5 years of age at participating VSD sites . The age criteria may change over time if COVID -19 vaccines are authorized and recommended for use in children <5 years . Eligible individuals must have at least 12 months of continuous VSD enrollment at the start of follow -up; enrol lment gaps <32 days will be ignored . Individuals with a prior inpatient Page 3 VSD Study #1341 | Version 1.4 | 11 JANUARY 2022 diagnosis of COVID -19 will be excluded. Prior COVID -19 hospitalizations will be identified by ICD Person -time follow -up for persons 16 years of age will begin on February 1, 2021 or when an individual meets the study eligibility criteria ; follow -up for persons 12 -15 years of age will begin on May 10, 2021 or when an individual meets the study eligibility criteria ; and follow -up for persons 5 -11 years of age will begin on October 29, 2021 or when an individual meets the study eligibility criteria . Person -time will be terminated at the time of COVID -19 hospital admis sion, death, disenrollment from VSD, or end of the study perio d. Aim 2 . For the cross -sectional severity analysis, VSD members aged 16 years that were hospitalized for COVID - 19 after February 1, 2021 , VSD members aged 12 -15 years that were hospitalized for COVID -19 after May 10, 2021 , and VSD members aged 5 -11 years that were hospitalized for COVID -19 after October 29, 2021 will be identified from DDF at participating sites. Individuals will be excluded if they have <12 months of continuous enrollment prior to hospitalization (enrollment gaps <32 days will be ignored ) or had a prior inpatient diagnosis of COVID -19. Individuals will be sampled in strata defined by vaccination status at the time of hospitalization (fully vaccinated, unvaccinated), VSD site, month of admission, and age group. Individuals who are partially vaccinated at the time of hospital admission will be excluded from Aim 2 . 3.2. COVID -19 Vaccination Status Exposure to COVID -19 vaccines will be identified by CVX codes in VSD data files ( Table 1). This list will be updated as more vaccine products become available in the US. We will ascertain vaccination date, product, manufacturer, and dose number for each exposure. Most VSD sites maintain linkage with state immunization information systems (I IS). We therefore expect to capture ne arly all COVID -19 vaccines delivered outside the VSD sites. We will validate this as part of the medical recor d abstractions in Aim 2. Table 1. CVX Codes for COVID -19 Vaccines Vaccine Product CVX Code CVX Code Description Vaccination Schedule Moderna COVI LNP, preservative free, 100 mcg or 50 mcg dose 2 doses separated by at least 28 days Pfizer/BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine (COMIRNATY) 208 protein, LNP, preservative free, 30 mcg/0.3mL dose 2 doses separated by at least 21 days Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine 212 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) vaccine, vector non-replicating, recombinant spike protein -Ad26, preservative free, 0.5 mL 1 dose N/A 213 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) vaccine, unspecified N/A Pfizer/BioNTech COVID -19 mRNA, 30 mcg/0.3 mL dose, tris -sucrose formulation 2 doses separated by at least 21 days Pfizer/BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine 218 SARS -COV -2 (COVID mRNA, 10 mcg/0.2 mL dose, tris -sucrose formulation 2 doses separated by at least 21 days Aim 1 . For the cohort analysis, person -time will be classif ied as unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, or fully vaccinated based on an individual's exposure to COVID -19 vaccine (s). For two dose vaccines, partially vaccinated person -time will begin 14 days after receipt of dose 1 . Fully vaccinated person time will b egin 14 days after dose Page 4 VSD Study #1341 | Version 1.4 | 11 JANUARY 2022 2. For one dose vaccines, fully vaccinated person -time will begin 14 days after receipt of dose 1. The 14 -day window for development of immunity will be used for Pfizer/BioNTech , Moderna , and Janssen vaccines. Person - time will be cl assified separately for individuals who receive a third or booster dose based on CDC recommendations. Second doses will be invalid and excluded from analyses if administered more than four days prior to the recommended date (i.e., before day 17 for a 21 d ay dosing interval) . Second and third doses administered after the recommended date will be valid regardless of timing. Aim 2. For the cross -sectional analysis, vaccination status will be assessed at the time of COVID -19 hospitalization and classified as unvaccinated or fully vaccinated. Persons will be classified as fully vaccinated if they have received both doses of a two dose vaccine and it has been 14 days since receipt of dose two, or if they have received a one dose vaccine and it has been 14 days since vaccination. Persons will be classified as unvaccinated if they have received 0 doses of vaccine before hospital admission. Partially vaccinated individuals will be excluded for the Aim 2 analysis . 3.3. Outcome Measures Aim 1 . The primary o utcome is hospitalization with an ICD -10 diagnosis code for COVID -19. The following ICD -10 codes will be used to identify COVID -19 cases: U07.1 ( COVID -19 to COVID -19); M35.81 (multisystem inflammatory syndrome due to COVID -19). CDC coding guidelines indicate that U07.1 should be used only for persons with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID - 19. CDC guidelines indicate that both U07.1 and J12.82 should be assigned for cases pneumonia (www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/icd/Announcement -New -ICD-code -for-coronavirus -19-508.pdf ). Since adherence to coding guidelines is unknown, we will accept any of these three codes assigned in the inpatient setting as evidence of COVID -19 hospitalization . We will not require laboratory confirmation of SARS -CoV-2 infection because diagnostic tests may be performed prior to hospital admission and might not be available in VSD data files. The secondary endpoint is acute respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) due to COVID - 19. This outcome will be defined as: 1. Inpatient d iagnosis code for ARDS ( J80) or acute respiratory failure (J96.0*) during the same hospitalization . Aim 2 . The co -primary severity endpoints are 1) admission to intensive care unit (ICU); and 2) increasing score on WHO Clinical Progression Scale (Table 2 ). The latter is an ordinal scale based on setting and need for respiratory or cardiovascular support [10]. For hospitalized patients, scores range from 4 (no oxygen therapy) to 9 (mechanical ventilation with vasopressors, dialysis, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO )). The score is 10 for COVID -19 death. Table 2. WHO Clinical Progression Scale for COVID -19 Patient State Descriptor Score Uninfected Uninfected; no viral RNA detected 0 Ambulatory; mild disease Asymptomatic; viral RNA detected 1 Symptomatic; independent 2 Page 5 VSD Study #1341 | Version 1.4 | 11 JANUARY 2022 Symptomatic; assistance needed 3 Hospitalized; moderate disease Hospitalized; no oxygen therapy 4 Hospitalized; oxygen by mask or nasal prongs 5 Hospitalized; severe disease Hospitalized; oxygen by non -invasive ventilation or high flow 6 Intubation and mechanical ventilation; SpO2/FiO2 200 7 Mechanical ventilation; <150 and inspired oxygen; SpO2=oxygen saturation. 3.3.1. Medical Record Abstraction for Aim 2 Outcome measures for Aim 2 will be ascertained by manual abstraction of medical records. Medical records will be reviewed (when available) from up to 1 200 hospi talized patients over 24 months . Patients will be selected for medical record abstraction based on COVID -19 vaccination status at the time of hospital admission. We anticipate fewer vaccinated vs unvaccinated patients based on high vaccine efficacy against severe COVID -19 in phase 3 trials. The sampling strategy and volume may vary over time based on the number of eligible hospitalizations. We will initially sample all fully vaccinated patients who are hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID -19 in a given mo nth. For the same month, we will sample unvaccinated patients with frequency matching on age group ( 5-11 years, 12-17 years, 18 -49 years, 50 -64 years, 65 years) and VSD site. The ratio of vaccinated to unvaccinated patients may vary over time due to the l imited capacity for medical record abstraction (approximately 50 records per month across all sites). We will abstract all COVID -19 hospitalizations in a given month if the total is 50. Sampling of COVID -19 hospitalizations and abstractions will occur throughout the 24 month study period. One interim analysis is planned after approximately half ( n=600) of the abstractions are completed. Medical record abstraction will include but is not limited to demographic characteristics , smoking status, residential setting , symptom onset date, hospital admission and discharge date (s), reason (s) for admission, discharge disposition, discharge diagnoses, symptoms, vital signs and oxygen saturation, pre-existing chronic conditions , pregnanc y status, immunocompromising conditions and medications , ICU admission, noninvasive and invasive respiratory support, and pulmonary and non-pulmonary complications . Specific COVID -19 therapies will be abstracted. Dates and results of diagnostic tests for S ARS-CoV-2 (PCR or antigen test ) will be recorded until discharge or death . COVID -19 vaccination status and dates will be independently abstracted from medical records for validation of electronic VSD data files. Abstracted medical record data on respirator y disease severity will be used to validate the ICD -10 codes that define severe COVID -19 respiratory illness in Aim 1 (J80 and J96.0*). For this validation, any patient with a score of 7 -10 on the WHO Clinical Progression Scale will be defined as having severe respiratory disease. We will assess the sensitivity, specificity and predictive val ue of the ICD -10 codes among the hospitalized patients with abstracted data. MCRI will develop and pilot a standardized chart review instrument. A detailed instruction manual will be developed and distributed to ensure consistent data collection across sit es; training sessions for abstractors may also be conducted. Each site will receive a line list of cases to review that will contain at a minimum the VSD ID number and date of COVID -19 hospitalization . Chart review data will be directly entered into an onl ine REDCap database hosted by MCRI . Completed abstractions will be reviewed and adjudicated by investigators at MCRI . Page 6 VSD Study #1341 | Version 1.4 | 11 JANUARY 2022 4 Analytic Approach 4.1. Aim 1 A separate statistical analysis plan will be developed to describe analytic methods in detail. Revisions to the analysis will be maintained in the statistical analysis plan and not otherwise updated in the protocol. Briefly, we will estimate hazard ratios (HR) for COVID -19 hospitalization and severe COVID -19 (ARDS or respiratory failure) using Cox proportional hazard s models . VE will be defined as 100*(1 -HR). We will construct separate models for each endpoint and class/ product and the primary analysis will include separate VE estimates by age group ( 5-11 years, 12-17 years, 18 -64 years, 65 years) and sex . We antici pate conduct ing at least one interim analys is during the first year . This specific timing and scope of the interim analyses will be determined in consultation with CDC. The final analysis will occur after approximately 24 months of follow -up. Data will be extracted from VSD files with a 12 week lag to ensure nearly complete capture of COVID -19 vaccinations and hospital admissions. The time scale for the regression models will be calendar time in days , with the study period beginning on Februar y 1, 2021. Individual person -time at risk will begin when the vaccine became available by age group and participating site or upon cohort entry, whichever is later. Analyses will utilize the counting process formulation of the Cox model which readily accom modates key elements of this study such as left truncation and time - dependent covariates [11]. Model covariates will be specified in the statistical analysis plan, but the primary analysis will include age, sex, VSD site, and specific comorbid conditions (including immunocompromised status). Frailty is a likely risk factor for severe COVID -19, but f railty cannot be directly identified in electronic health record s. Inclusion of demographic and chronic disease variables in the model will reduce the potential for residual confounding due to frailty. CDC has identified several pre-existing chronic diseas e categories associated with increased risk for severe COVID -19 illness or death (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/need -extra -conditions.html ). We ascertain specif ic chronic disease categories based on ICD -10 codes . We will not ascertain HIV status as a separate variable, rather it will be included in the immunocompromised state category. An individual will be classified as having a particular condition if a corresp onding ICD -10 code is present in the inpatient, outpatient, or emergency department records during the preceding 12 months ; these will be fixed covariates assigned at the time of entry into the cohort. Body mass index (BMI) may be used to enhance the class ification of overweight, obesity and severe obesity . Smoking will not be included as covariate since smoking status is not collected consistently across VSD sites. We will extract information on past receipt of influenza, pneumococcal and herpes zoster vac cines to assess preventive healthcare utilization. We will look back 24 months for receipt of 1 influenza vaccine, back to age 50 for receipt of 1 herpes zoster vaccine (zoster vaccine live or recombinant zoster vaccine), and back to age 65 for receipt o f 1 pneumococcal vaccine (pneumococcal conjugate or pneumococcal polysaccharide). We will assess changes in VE with increasing time after vaccination by creating a composite exposure variable. This variable will permit comparison of vaccinated person -time with time -since -vaccination=b to 1) unvaccinated person -time and 2) vaccinated person -time with time -since -vaccination=a. In addition, pre-existing natural immunity to COVID -19 may modify the a ssociation between vaccination and the Aim 1 endpoints . We will evaluate this potential phenomenon by including an interaction term between vaccination status and pre- existing natural immunity to COVID -19. Person -time will be classified as 'prior immunity present ' if there was a n outpatient diagnosis of COVID -19, identified by ICD -10 code U07.1 . , or a positive COVID -19 RT-PCR or rapid antigen test at least 28 days before the calendar date when follow -up time begins at each site. After this date, we will classify person -time as 'prior immunity present ' beginning 28 days after a n outpatient COVID -19 diagnosis or positive lab test . Page 7 VSD Study #1341 | Version 1.4 | 11 JANUARY 2022 A recent topic of interest in the VE literature is the effect of depleting susceptible s on estimates of VE and the waning of VE over time . We will review th is literature and address this issue in the statistical analysis plan if feasible [12-15]. If feasible, secondary analyses will estimate VE for the following subgroups: 1) mixed -product recipients (e.g., 1 dose each of Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna) ; and 2 ) booster dose recipients . For the final analysis, w e will perform sensitivity analys es using a 7 -day wind ow and a 21 -day window after each vaccine dose (rather than 14 days) as the threshold for development of immunity. The figure below shows the number of hospitalizations needed to detect hazard ratios (HR) from 0.05 to 6.0 for =0.05 (type I error rate) and power=0.80 (type II error rate 0.20) for a two -sided test between vaccinated and unvaccinated at various levels of vaccination (proportion exposed) in the cohort. HR below 1.0 indicates vaccine effectiveness for preventing COV ID-19 hospitalization. VE can be estimated as 100*(1 -HR). HR above 1.0 is consistent with VMED. Note that for Cox regression models, the sample size is the number of non -censored events (hospitalizations). With anticipated COVID -19 hospitalization on the o rder of hundreds per week in the VSD data, very large and very small HRs could be detected relatively soon. Calculations were performed in SAS/STAT 15.1 \"Proc Power CoxReg\" with 0.20 correlation of vaccination status with other covariates and proportion vaccinated ranging from 0. 05 to 0.5 0 exposed in the population (note that results are symmetric for proportions vaccinated >0.50). Under these scenarios, fewer than 100 hospitalizations are required to detect a strong VMED signal with HR >4.0 (Figure 1A ) or high vaccine effectiveness with HR < 0.25 (Figure 1 B). Figure 1A. Aim 1 Sample Size Estimates for Detecting an Increased Hazard Ratio for Hospitalization (VMED signal; VE <0) among Vaccinated Individuals (80% power, -sided test, R2=0.20) Page 8 VSD Study #1341 | Version 1.4 | 11 JANUARY 2022 Figure 1B. Aim 1 Sample Size Estimates for Detecting a Reduced Hazard Ratio for Hospitalization (VE >0) among Vaccinated Individuals (80% power, =0.05, 2 -sided test, R2=0.20) 4.2. Aim 2 Up to 600 fully vaccinated hospitalized patients will be frequency matched to unvaccinated patients with stratification by month of admission, age group (5-11 years, 12-17 years, 18 -49 years, 50 -64 years, 65 years) , and VSD site . The ratio of vaccinated to unvaccinated may vary over time due to the limited capacity for m edical record abstractions each month (50 abstractions per month across all sites). The total number of medical record abstractions is estimated to be approximately 1200. If VMED occurs, evidence is likely to emerge during the latter half of the study peri od. One interim analysis is planned after approximately 600 chart abstractions (50% of planned total) have been completed. The specific timing for the interim analysis will be determined in consultation with CDC. Data will be extracted from VSD files with a 12 week lag to ensure nearly complete capture of COVID -19 vaccinations and hospital admissions. A separate statistical analysis plan will be developed to describe the modelling approach for Aim 2 . Revisions to the analysis will be maintained in the stati stical analysis plan and not otherwise updated in the protocol. In general, causal inference using the potential outcomes framework will guide the analysis [16]. Doubly robust estimation will be used for either endpoint outcome [17]. The WHO Clinical Progression Scale may be collapsed to two categories. The collapsed categ ories would include moderate disease and severe disease/death , with the former serving as the referent group in the regression analyses. The feasibility of using score 5, 6 and 7 as the cut-point will be determined after preliminary medical record review o f sampled hospitalized cases. Analysis will be in two stages. In the first stage, inverse probability weights will be constructed from a vaccination status propensity score model. In the second stage, the inverse probability weight s will be combined with a regression adjusted outcome model to produce double robust estimation. Covariates for the models may include any covariates described in Aim 1 such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, VSD site, receipt of other vaccines, specific comorbid conditions , and any cov ariates sourced from the medical record abstractions . The power table below shows the minimum detectible odds ratios using Fisher's exact conditional test with a 2- sided alpha of 0.05 and a percent of severe outcomes among the unvaccinated of 5, 10, and 20% (Table 3 ). Page 9 VSD Study #1341 | Version 1.4 | 11 JANUARY 2022 Table 3 . Aim 2 Power Estimates for Risk of ICU Admission 5 Human Subjects and Confidentiality Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval may be required at some participating VSD sites, although we anticipate the protocol will fall und er the category of public health surveillance rather than human subjects research at CDC. MCRI will work with participating sites at the beginning of the project to determine which, if any, sites need to submit project -specific documents, including the pro tocol and chart review forms, for local IRB review . The privacy and confidentiality of all subjects under surveillance will be strictly protected according to standard VSD procedures. The VSD project is covered by an Assurance of Confidentiality. CDC has o btained an Assurance of Confidentiality under Section 308(d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 242 m(d)), which provides that this data can only be used for the purpose for which it is obtained, unless such institution or individual has consented to that disclosure. Pursuant to this, all CDC and VSD site project personnel have signed a nondisclosure statement. Whenever possible, only aggregate data will be transferred to MCRI for analysi s. When individual -level data are needed, variables will be r estricted to those needed for the analysis and will not contain an y direct identifiers. The data will include indirect identifiers such as date of birth, date of vaccination, and date of diagnosis, which are considered protected health information (PHI) un der HIPAA. Transfer of data will occur via the secure VSD Hub; pre -existing agreements between VSD sites permit the transfer of limited datasets using this method. Individu al medical records will only be reviewed for abstraction of data as specified in the study protocol. Chart reviews will be conducted at individual sites by designated personnel . Direct identifiers required to link the automated data with a medical record will not be transferred to MCRI. Chart review data will be directly entered into an o nline REDCap database hosted by MCRI. Each individual user will receive a unique username and password. Data access groups will be configured to ensure that users only have access to data on individuals from their site, with the exception of MCRI, which wi ll have access to all data captured in the database. If portions of the medical record are requested, non -essential patient identifiers will be redacted prior to upload into REDCap. REDCap databases are secure and HIPAA compliant and REDCap has previously been used for chart abstraction studies in the VSD. If needed, technical information will be provided to participating sites so that a security review or ris k assessment can be conducted. This p roject does not involve intervention or interaction with human subjects and is an analysis of existing data collected for non -research purposes. Risks are minimal and are limited to the inadvertent disclosure of PHI. Risk among Unva ccinated Odds Ratio No. of Abstracted Hospital Admissions Power 5% 1.5 1200 0.343 10% 1.5 400 0.832 Page 10 VSD Study #1341 | Version 1.4 | 11 JANUARY 2022 6 Data Management and Quality Automated data will be extracted from existing, standardized VSD dynamic data files (DDF). Specific data files will VACCINE . Sites have agreed to update the DEATH file on a monthly basis for another ongoing study; all other files are updated on a weekly basis. Additionally, an ancillary height/weight (HTWT) file may be requested from all participating sites at the time of each a nalysis. The unique VSD identification number will be used to link information between data files. Variables of interest are broken down by data file below: CONSTANT: VSD ID, site, date of birth, sex, race/ethnicity VSD ID, COVID -19 test result COVLTEST : VSD ID, specimen collection date, COVID -19 test type DEATH: VSD ID, date of death ENROLL: VSD ID, enrollment date s HTWT: VSD ID, height and weight measurements, measurement dates INPT: VSD ID, date of admiss ion, length of stay, ICD -10 diagnosis code, discharge disposition OUTPT: VSD ID, date of visit, department, ICD -10 diagnosis code, discharge disposition VACCINE: VSD ID, date of vaccine administration, vaccine product, vaccine manufacturer For analytic data extractions, we will impose a 12 -week data lag to allow for near -complete accrual of exposures and outcomes. Monthly monitoring programs may be run without a data lag. SAS programs will be developed, tested, and distributed to all participating sites tha t will extract necessary information from each site's data files. Programs will be run separately at each site and study -specific datasets will be uploaded to the VSD Hub for secure transfer to MCRI . Datasets from each site will be downloaded and combined for analysis at MCRI . 7 Challenges and Limitations This is an observational study utilizing electronic and clinical health records, and multiple factors may influence the accuracy and precision of risk estimates. In early 2021, COVID -19 activity was declinin g across most of the United States. The number of hospitalizations in VSD will be influenced by overall COVID -19 activity in the coming months, and the recent identification of highly transmissible variants ( e.g., delta variant ) may affect future disease a ctivity. Increasing circulation of virus escape variants could decrease vaccine protection against serious outcomes. If VE declines over time, it may be difficult to distinguish waning immune response from antigenic es cape. Immunocompromised status is a well-known risk factor for severe COVID -19. The analysis will use ICD -10 diagnosis codes to identify individuals with immune compromised status, but misclassification may occur since use of immune modulating medications cannot be ascertained. This study rel ies primarily on COVID -19 diagnosis codes to identify cases rather than RT -PCR laboratory results. This limitation is due to incomplete access to SARS -CoV-2 test results for VSD enrollees who may have been tested through a commercial or public health labor atory. Due to limited supply, vaccine distribution is being prioritized for specific groups, but recommendations vary in different states. Prioritization of risk groups based on occupation or exposure risk may be a source of residual confounding since VSD files do not include this information. Phase 3 clinical trials have provided strong evidence that VMED is not occurring during the first few months after vaccination. VMED is a theoretical risk beyond the first few months if neutralizing antibody titers decline, but the study is not powered to detect an elevated risk of VMED during the latter half of the observation period.
