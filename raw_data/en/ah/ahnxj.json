A planned interim analysis of data from the Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV (REPRIEVE(link is external)) study found that participants who took pitavastatin calcium, a daily statin, lowered their risk of major adverse cardiovascular events by 35% compared with those receiving a placebo. Adverse drug events observed in the study were like those in the general population taking statin therapy. The interim analysis was sufficiently compelling that the study's independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended it be stopped early given adequate evidence of efficacy. The NIH accepted the DSMB recommendations. REPRIEVE began in 2015 and enrolled 7,769 volunteers who were 40 to 75 years of age, of whom more than 30% were women. REPRIEVE volunteers were all taking antiretroviral therapy, with CD4+ cell counts greater than 100 cells/mm3 of blood at enrollment, and had low-to-moderate traditional cardiovascular disease risk that would not typically be considered for statin treatment. The trial was conducted in 12 countries in Asia, Europe, North America, South America and Africa. Both the Baltimore and Pune, India, sites from the Johns Hopkins Baltimore-India Clinical Trials Unit participated in this important effort to reduce heart disease among people with HIV.

For 32 years, this day has provided an opportunity for the world to reflect on the ongoing HIV/AIDS pandemic. In 2019, 38 million people were living with HIV/AIDS, and 1.7 million people were newly infected. Though 2020 drew HIV researchers to expand their work to address the COVID-19 pandemic, our HIV efforts have not ceased. To the contrary, the ACTG has continued to advance HIV research and clinical trials amidst the challenges of initial research study closures, social distancing, acquiring proper PPE, and quarantining. We are pleased to announce that the ACTG was re-funded for a new grant cycle for seven years starting today, World AIDS Day 2020. In this new grant cycle, our goals are to continue our efforts to cure HIV and Hepatitis B, shorten treatment for TB and find new therapies for drug-resistant TB, and test novel antiretroviral therapies and test strategies to improve long-term outcomes for people with HIV. In December's newsletter, we reflect on the progress we have made over the past year in HIV research, despite the challenges posed by COVID-19. We highlight some of ACTG's major publications over the past year (although we sadly could not highlight all of the important publications from the ACTG in 2020 in this short newsletter, please click here to read more). Our network has found balance among the chaos and continues to instill hope in our community, despite overwhelming loss. We are grateful to everyone (investigators, site staff, community advisory board members) who has stepped up to the challenge and gone above and beyond for study participants. The strides we have made as a network keep us hopeful for the future of HIV/AIDS research.

This important study showed that the four-month regimen of rifapentine, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and moxifloxacin (RPT-MOX) regimen of rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide for the treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary TB. RPT-MOX was also safe and well-tolerated by patients. A second four-month regimen of rifapentine, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol failed to meet the non-inferiority margin. To put this study in historical context, the last time pulmonary TB treatment was successfully shortened for drug-susceptible TB was 48 years ago, when the British Medical Research Council (MRC) published results showing a six-month regimen was as effective as the standard 18-month regimen at that time. Despite many trial attempts to shorten TB therapy since, the standard treatment regimen for drug-susceptible pulmonary TB has remained at six months. Thirteen countries contributed to Study 31/A5349, a phase 3, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial, at 34 clinical sites. Approximately 2,500 people aged 12 years and older participated in the study, including 214 people with HIV infection. The study was led by the CDC Tuberculosis Trials Consortium (TBTC) in collaboration with the ACTG. ACTG sites enrolled two-thirds of participants and TBTC sites enrolled one-third. Participants with HIV infection were enrolled in a staged fashion to allow for drug-drug interaction studies between rifapentine and efavirenz, which is why the number was relatively small. Reassuringly though, the participants did just as well as those without HIV, and the RPT-MOX regimen was also non-inferior and safe in these participants. \"Shortening treatment for TB has been front and center in the TB TSG scientific agenda for decades, and this new regimen that reduces treatment by two months will facilitate significant progress in global tuberculosis control,\" said Dr. Susan Swindells of the University of Nebraska Medical Center and a co-chair of the study. \"This trial demonstrates the value of collaborative efforts between the ACTG and other networks,\" added Dr. Richard Chaisson of Johns Hopkins University, another co-chair of the trial. Shortening TB treatment to four months instead of six represents a major advancement in the management of this age-old infectious disease. Congratulations to the study team and participating sites for this astounding achievement!

Led by Drs. Charles Flexner and Amita Gupta, the BWI-CTU supports high quality HIV-related treatment and prevention research at the two domestic sites and at the Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Government Medical College in Pune, India. The supplement is leveraging existing HIV research infrastructure and personnel resources for DAIDS-sponsored COVID vaccine and monoclonal antibody prevention trials that will include both HIV seropositive and seronegative participants. Activities supported involve preparing the two domestic sites to conduct COVID, and include community outreach and staff safety training. Partnering in the effort is the Johns Hopkins Center for Immunization Research. which will conduct vaccine trials beginning in July 2020. The Johns Hopkins University Clinical Research Site (JHU CRS) and the Whitman Walker Health (WWH) have highly experienced and innovative leaders in anti-infective research and have a long and successful record of HIV and viral hepatitis clinical research implementation. Co-PI Dr. Charles Flexner noted the impressive reach the domestic CTU sites offer for such research: \"The health systems that are supported by JHU and partner institutions currently provide medical coverage for more than half of all adult residents in the state. This includes having a physical presence in every major population center in the state, including the metropolitan Washington, DC, counties -- where nearly half of the state's COVID cases have occurred. This is a great opportunity to swiftly leverage our existing resources in the search for COVID treatment and prevention strategies for both HIV positive and HIV negative patients.\" [ACTG Site Medical College-Johns Hopkins University (BJGMC-JHU) research partnership was established in 2000 to conduct the multi-country Six Weeks Extended Nevirapine (SWEN) trial to reduce HIV transmission through breastfeeding. The results of that trial led to changes in the World Health Organization's clinical care guidelines. Capitalizing on the team's success and the infrastructure established, the research partnership continued and has grown exponentially. With clinical operations based at BJGMC in Pune, India, the BJGMC-JHU CRS is now a member of the Baltimore-Washington-India Clinical Trials Unit (BWI-CTU), which includes a CRS at Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore) and at Whitman-Walker Health (Washington, DC). ACTG trials represent a significant portion of our research portfolio. We're proud that our work is improving disease outcomes for patients in our own community and around the world.

The experience with tuberculosis studies underway at the Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Government Medical College-Johns Hopkins University Clinical Research Site (BJGMC-JHU CRS) in Pune, India, required swift action, agility, and innovation in ensuring that study participants continue to receive lifesaving care in the midst of a national lockdown. The WHO has prioritized TB preventive therapy, including for household contacts of people with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), as a key strategy for controlling the epidemic. One study to prevent MDR TB among household contacts of confirmed cases currently underway at the BJGMC-JHU CRS is a multinational, phase 3, randomized clinical trial to compare 26 weeks of Delamanid (DLM) versus 26 weeks of Isoniazid (INH) for preventing confirmed or probable active TB in high-risk household contacts. For this trial, titled Protecting Households on Exposure to Newly Diagnosed Index Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Patients (or PHOENIx), 19 index MDR-TB cases and 12 household contacts are enrolled. Participants on study routinely receive enough medication to last until their next scheduled clinical visit. With visits cancelled due to the lockdown, and with recovery from COVID-19 likely to be prolonged, the PHOENIx Team needed to find alternate ways to distribute medication. Mail delivery was not an option, and asking research participants to pick up medication from the CRS or at designated locations within the community was deemed too risky.
