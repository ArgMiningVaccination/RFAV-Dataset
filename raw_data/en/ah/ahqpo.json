Trends in Pediatric Emergency Department Visits for Mental Health Conditions and Disposition by Presence of a Psychiatric Unit Gretchen J. Cutler, PhD, MPH , Jonathan Rodean, MPP, MPH , Bonnie T. Zima, MD, , Stephanie K. Doupnik, MD, MSHP, Alicia L. Zagel, PhD, MPH, Kelly R. Bergmann, DO, Jennifer A. Hoffmann, MD, Mark I. Neuman, MD, MPH Resear ch Objective: To examine trends in mental health (MH) visits to pediatric emergency departments (EDs) and identify whether ED disposition varies by presence of a hospital inpatient psychiatric unit (IPU). Study Design: Cross -sectional analysis of the Ped iatric Health Information System (PHIS). Multivariable generalized estimating equations and bivariate Rao -Scott chi -square tests were used to examine trends in ED visits and ED disposition by IPU status, adjusted for clustering by hospital. Population St udied: All ED visits for patients aged 3 to 21 years from 2012 to 2016 with a primary MH or non -MH diagnosis from 35 hospitals with discharge and billing data for the entire study period (n=8,479,311). Principal Findings: From 2012 to 2016, hospitals exp erienced a greater increase in ED visits with a primary MH vs. non-MH diagnosis (50.7% vs. 12.7% cumulative increase, P<.001, Table ). MH visits were associated with patients who were older, female, white non -Hispanic, and privately insured compared with pa tients of non -MH visits (all P<.001). The rate of increase in MH visits differed by diagnosis. 44% of MH visits in 2016 had a primary diagnosis of depressive disorders or suicide or self -injury, and the increase in visits was highest for these diagnosis gr oups (depression: 109.8%; suicide or self -injury: 110.2%). Among MH visits, presence of a hospital IPU was associated with increased hospitalizations (34.6% vs. 22.5%, P<.001) and less transfers (9.3% vs. 16.2%, P<.001). Conclusion: The increase in ED MH visits from 2012 to 2016 was four times greater than non -MH visits at US children's hospitals, and was primarily driven by patients diagnosed with depressive disorders and suicide or self -injury. Patients visiting hospitals with an IPU for MH concerns wer e less likely to require transfer and more likely to be admitted compared to patients visiting non -IPU hospitals. 6 | P a g e Implications for Policy or Practice: Our findings have implications for strategic planning in children's hospitals dealing with a rising dem and for acute MH care. The dramatic increase in ED MH visits was primarily driven by youth requiring acute care for depressive disorders and suicide or self -injury, underscoring the need for hospitals to identify strategies to address these priority popula tions. Significant differences in hospitalization and transfer rates in IPU hospitals may indicate improved access to inpatient psychiatric care and greater opportunity to coordinate disposition planning with an on -site multidisciplinary MH team.

Simulation -Based M astery Learning for C entral Line Cap C hanges mastery learning (SBML) is a rigorous form of competency -based education where skills are measured against a mastery level or minimum passing score (MPS). Outcomes are uniform and training time varies [1]. SBML in central venous line (CVL) insertion and maintenance bundles has led to increased compliance rates and decreased infections [1, 2, 3]. SBML has also been widely applied in medical curriculum; however it has been underutilized in nursing curriculum. Central line -associated bloodstream infections, are associated with increased morbidity and mortality as well as increased cost [3]. This study investigated the use of SBML for central line cap change procedure with pediatric hematology oncolog y nurses. Research Question: What is the effect of SBML on the current compliance for central line cap changes for nurses on the hematology/oncology unit? Methodology : A pretest -posttest, quasi experimental design (n= 80). Pretest assessment conducted to determine ability to perform a central line cap change procedure. Nurses participated in deliberate practice until they were able to reach mastery in the posttest. The posttest was conducted on a separate day from deliberate practice. After meeting mast ery, participants completed a post -questionnaire. Descriptive and comparative analysis was conducted. ANOVA was utilized to compare participant performances from different demographic backgrounds (e.g. years of experience, frequency of procedure). Result s: 77 participants (n=3 lost to follow up due to job change) completed the study with ultimate mastery attainment. 31% (n=24) of participants achieved mastery in the pretest. 72% (n=38) of the remaining nurses achieved mastery in the second attempt. 100% ( n=15) of the remaining nurses achieved mastery in the third attempt. Higher years of experience as a registered nurse did not correlate with pretest scores. More years as a hematology oncology nurse, a role that requires extensive central line maintenance cares, was also not correlated with scores. The most commonly missed step was maintaining sterile protocol, 60% of nurses missed this step on the pretest. Discussion/Conclusions : SBML was utilized to achieve mastery in of the hematology oncology inp atient nurses. Only 31% of participants were able to meet mastery in the pretest, indicating exposure to the procedure in clinical setting is not sufficient to maintain mastery of this high risk skill. No correlation was found with the amount of cap change s the 7 | P a g e participant conducted in practice and their ability to perform the skill. No correlation was found with years of experience as a RN or hematology oncology experience and ability to perform the skill. This illustrates the challenge in nursing continui ng education and encourages further understanding about skill drift. This data may indicate the need for refresher education for all nurses and not just focus on specific groups. This study demonstrates that current practice of central line cap changes is often not compliant with institutional policy and SBML is an appropriate method to improve compliance. 3. A Dynamic Discrimination Model for Predicting Respiratory Distress at Birth Based on the Mass Volume Ratio in Fetuses with Congenital Lung Malformations Stephanie Eyerly -Webb, PhD, Clara T. Nicolas, MD , Dave Watson, PhD , Eric Dion, BA , Ruchi Amin, MD , Amy J. Wagner, MD, Andrea Lampland, MD, Ellen Bendel MD, Feltis, MD PhD Background: The congenital pulmonary airway malformation volume ratio (CVR) is a prenatal ultrasound measurement that parametrizes congenital lung malformation (CLM) size. Previous studies have reported prenatal CVRs greater than 1.0 to be prognostically significant. However, CVR changes through pregnancy and simple cutoffs cannot account for upward or downward growth trajectories throughout gestation. This multicenter study used serial CVR measurements to create estimated growth curves for fetuses with symptomatic vs. asymptomatic invasive respiratory outcomes. We hypothesized that a discriminant prognostic model could accurately predict which fetuses would likely require postnatal invasive respiratory support and therefore should deliver at an advanced care center. Methods: Prenatally diagnosed CLMs at three tertiary care children's hospitals were retrospectively reviewed (2009 - 2016). Fetuses with two or more prenatal sonographic measured CVRs were correlated with administration of invasive respiratory support at bir th. Results : Of 147 newborns meeting inclusion criteria, 16 (10.9%) required postnatal invasive respiratory support within 24 hours of birth. The estimate growth curve models (fig. 1 -A) showed different growth trajectories for asymptomatic and symptomati c neonates, with significantly larger CVRs in symptomatic newborns and CVR measurements peaking late in the second trimester (25 weeks) in asymptomatic newborns. The discriminant model had better performance (fig 1 -B, AUC = 0.88) than single value cutoff m ethods, and the best accuracy in the preterm population (AUC = 0.85). Conclusions: The estimated CVR growth curves and discriminant model showed different growth patterns for asymptomatic and symptomatic neonates with CLMs. The dynamic discriminant analy sis performed well overall, especially in infants that were carried to term. Discussions with expectant parents with a fetal diagnosis of a CLM often focus on the likelihood of respiratory symptoms at birth, and the development of a clinical tool based on this analysis could be useful in determining site of delivery for these patients.

Physical Activity, the Childhood Cancer Symptom Cluster - Leukemia, and Cognitive Function: A Longitudinal Mediation Analysis Casey Hoo ke, PhD, APRN, PCNS, CPON, F AAN, Pauline Mitby, MPH Background: Children undergoing treatment for leukemia report co -occurring symptoms of fatigue, sleep disturbances, pain, nausea, and depression as a symptom cluster. Physical activity (PA) is essential for development and may influence symptom seve rity. Children with leukemia are at risk for cognitive impairments from CNS directed therapies. Longitudinal parallel -process (LPP) modeling is a type of analysis that examines relationships between two or more longitudinal processes. Using an LPP model, w e were able to explore relationships among the functions of PA and cognition with symptom clusters over the trajectory of leukemia treatment. This study examined the longitudinal mediation effects of PA on cognition via a symptom cluster during leukemia tr eatment. Methods: Symptoms, PA, and cognitive function of 327 children ages 3 to 18 were measured over 4 intervals during the first year of leukemia treatment. Children age 7 years and older self -reported and parents reported for younger children. Parents completed child co gnitive function measurements regardless of age. Using the LLP model, the influence of the first time -point and the subsequent change between all 4 time -points of PA on the symptom cluster was explored. Analysis was also performed to determine whether the symptom cluster mediates the effect of cognition over the treatment period. Results : Patients with a higher PA at Time 1 reduced their symptom cluster severity over the 4 measurements. However, when PA increased over the measurements, symptom cluster severity also increased. When the symptom cluster was more severe at Time 1, cognitive fu nction was lower at Time 1 and cognitive function decreased over time. When symptoms became more severe over time, cognitive function declined. The symptom cluster acted as a mediator between physical activity and cognition. 5. Craniospinal Abnormalities De tected via Imaging in Patients with Chromosome 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome Amy Linabery, PhD, MS Victoria Nguyen, BA, Albert Tu, MD, Katherine Ingram, PhD, Shuo Zhang, BA, Richard Patterson, MD, Joseph Petronio, MD, Rebecca Olson, APRN CNP, Robert Tibesar, MD, Meysam Kebriaei, MD Introduction : Children and adolescents with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome display a variable phenotype that includes craniospinal abnormalities. Given the lack of expert consensus regarding screening imaging, we aimed to characterize imaging studies and craniospinal abnormalities in this understudied patient population. Methods : We identified a retrospective cohort of patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (ICD nesota since the inception of the Velocardiofacial Clinic in 2008. Trained abstracters recorded demographic, imaging (MRI/MRA, CT, dynamic x -ray, static x -ray), neuraxis abnormality, and related intervention data from electronic medical records. Descriptiv e statistics were tabulated. Results : From January 2008 -February 2018, we saw 340 patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Of those, 211 (62%) underwent at least one craniospinal imaging study and 111 underwent imaging by 2 modalities. Median age at first imaging was 3.2 years (intra -quartile range: 0.3 -6.2). In 112 imaging studies, the primary indication for imaging was screening due to 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Half of patients who received imaging had at least one bony abnormality detected (n=107) and 36 had 2 abnormalities. The most frequently observed included fixation ( n=4) and bracing (n=1) for scoliosis, and spinal cord detethering (n=1), Additionally, 10 patients were referred to external spine specialists, with no further intervention information available. Conclusion : Consistent with prior observations, over half o f patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome had bony abnormalities, although only a small fraction were clinically significant to warrant intervention. Our results suggest that imaging may not be needed as a screening tool and should be employed only as clin ically indicated. We conclude that evidence -based imaging guidelines are needed for managing this population. This investigation serves as a first step in the development of such guidelines. 9 | P a g e 6. Early M ortality and Associated Risk F actors in Infants with Critical Congenital Heart Disease Shengxu Li, MD, PhD, MPH, Alissa Jorgenson, CCRP, Alicen Burns PhD, MPH, Robroy MacIver, MD, MPH, Ellen Bendel -Stenzel, MD Background : Infants with critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) experience increased mortality. Identifying contributing factors is important for improving patient outcomes, such as survival to discharge, in these patients. The current study aimed to examine mortali ty and associated factors in infants with CCHD. Methods : This retrospective cohort study included 632 infants (gestational age at birth: 23 -42 weeks) with CCHD treated at Children's Minnesota from 2005 to 2015. Data was obtained from two electronic patie nt databases. Multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the associations of clinical characteristics with survival to cardiac surgery and survival at or after surgery. Results : Among 632 patients, 45 (7.1%) died before surgery and 61 (9.7% ) died at or after surgery. Significant differences in gestational age at birth, birth weight, and respiratory distress syndrome were found between those who died before surgery and those who survived at least to the first surgery; however, only gestationa l age at birth remained significant in multiple logistic regression analysis. In univariate analyses among those who survived to first surgery, significant differences were found in race/ethnicity, sex, gestational age at birth, birth weight, total cardiop ulmonary bypass time, total STAT score, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, number of surgeries, and presence of the following clinical interventions: broviac line, peripherally inserted central catheter line, oxygenation (ECMO), tracheostomy ventilation, high -frequency oscillatory ventilation, and high flow rate ( 1L/min); in multiple logistic regression analysis, presence of necrotizing enterocolitis and use of ECMO were significantly associated with a lower odds, and use of flow rate 1 L/min a higher odds, of survival up to 30 days after hospital discharge. Conclusion : Gestational age at birth is an important factor for survival in infants with CCHD. Causality between survival and other associ ated factors requires further investigation. 7. Peer Influence on the Culture of Safety Natalie Lu, MSN, RN and Terry Schepers, BSN, RN Research Question: Does the inclusion of an invitation to \"speak up\" for patient safety affect \"speaking up\" behaviors among nurses? Main Outcome Measure: To explore influence of invitation to speak up in the maintenance of a psychologically safe environment within the pat ient care setting. Setting: A simulated clinical setting was crafted in 2018 on two units at Children's MN, including a manikin with a \"capped\" central line due to be changed. Participants: 50 Registered Nurses were recruited and randomized into control or invitation groups . Design: Randomized control trial. Upon entering the simulated setting, participants were instructed to play the role of \"helper\" for a sterile cap change performed by one principal investigator, and observed by another principal investigator. A break in sterile te chnique was staged at the same juncture of all 50 records in the study. Participants were asked to fill out pre - and post -task surveys via REDCap to obscure what investigators were studying. Intervention: Participants in the invitation group were also as ked to speak up if they saw a break in sterile technique. Results: Four participants (8%) spoke up about the staged break in sterile technique. One participant was in the control group, and three participants were in the invitation group . Our analysis reveals that there is no statistical difference in speak up behavior between the control and the invitation groups. 10 | P a g e Anecdotal findings: Despite insignificant findings around behaviors, attitudinal changes were noted in answers to the pre- and post -task surveys. Participants placed significantly more value on utilizing a second person in this sterile task, and in speaking up \"if you see something say something\" if something that might risk harm is detected. 8. The Association B etween Pre-Existing Anxiety and Prolonged Recovery After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in Children and A dolescents Alexia Martin, BS, Heather Sesma, PhD, LP, Katherine Ingram, PhD, Katie Slifko, APRN, CNP, Victoria Nguyen, BA, Kevin Coleman, PsyD, LP, ABPP -CN, Amy Linabery, PhD, MS Background: While mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) symptoms resolve in many pediatric patients within 2 -4 weeks after injury, 25 -40% have prolonged sequelae lasting months or years. Here, we examine pre -existing anxiet y disorder (AD) as a predictor of prolonged recovery from mTBI. Methods: We established a retrospective cohort of patients seen at our 3 specialty concussion clinics to examine potential risk factors for prolonged recovery. Medical record data for childr en aged 5 -17 yrs who presented to a clinic with mTBI and were discharged between 4/2018 -11/2018 were included. Outcome measures included time to symptom recovery, provider clearance for full return to physical activity, return to school full time without a ccommodations, and concussion symptom load, as measured by a validated symptom inventory. Differences across AD exposure groups were estimated via log -rank tests, and linear and Cox regression. Results : Among 248 eligible mTBI patients (mean age 13.1 yea rs), 30% reported pre -existing AD. Concussion symptom load was similar between the AD and no AD groups, after adjustment for age (p=0.12). Patients with AD had longer duration of concussion symptoms than those without (median 210 v 70 days, p=0.0003). Afte r controlling for age category (5-11 v 12 -17 yrs), presence of AD was significantly associated with prolonged symptom recovery (adjusted Hazard Ratio=4.48; 95% CI: 2.00 -10.0), delayed return to delayed return to physical activ ity (1.90; 1.34 -2.70). No substantial differences were observed upon stratification by age category. Conclusions: Pre-existing AD is a risk factor for prolonged recovery in pediatric/adolescent mTBI patients. Anxiety is closely related to executive funct ioning skills, which are particularly vulnerable after mTBI. Providers should advise mTBI patients with AD of the importance of brief rest followed by early return to light physical and cognitive activity, and address anxiety and stress management. 11 | P a g e Poster Abstracts Poster Number Presenting Author Abstract Title Page 9 Kari Allen Ectopic H epatocyte Transplantation Cures the Pig Model of Tyrosinemia 13 10 Andrea Balzer, DNP, RNc, LSSBB Multidisciplinary Engagement from Providers to Administrators in Surgery Verification Quality Improvement 13 11 Laura Chen, MD Standardizing Emergency Department to Hospitalist Verbal Handoff at Ch ildren's Minnesota 13 12 Gretchen Cutler, PhD, MPH Pediatric Emergency Department Visits for Mental Health Concerns: Barriers to Connecting with Outpatient Care and Usefulness of a Text M essage Appointment Reminder S ystem 14 13 Zeji Du, PhD Genome -Wide I ntegration Profile of a Lentiviral Vector C arrying the Human FAH Gene in H uman Hepatocytes 15 14 Sarah Eckhardt, PhD A Combined Treatment Approach for Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder in a Patient with Celiac Disease 16 15 Paul Escher, BA Combining Preoperative Erythropoietin and Intraoperative Tranexamic Acid Reduces Transfusions and Length of Stay in Sagittal Craniosynostosis Surgery 16 16 Elizabeth Franck Thompson, MPH, CCRP Impact of Early Screening for Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD): An Analysis of Port CF Patient Registry Data of Screening Practices by Clinic 17 17 Stephanie Fritch Lilla, MD Short -Term H igh-Dose I ntravenous Deferoxamine as Combination Therapy for R eduction of Iron in Patients with P ersistent Iron Overload 18 18 Anne Harris , MPH International Pleuropulmonary Blastoma Registry/DICER1 Registry -- China: An Emerging Global Partnership 18 19 Gabrielle Hester, MD, MS Measles at US Children's Hospitals 19 20 Gabrielle Hester, MD, MS Management and Rate of Airway Intervention for Croup at a Tertiary Children's Hospital 2015 -2016 20 21 Raymond Hickey, PhD Autologous G ene and Cell T herapy Provides Safe and Long -Term Curative Therapy in a Large Pig M odel of Hereditary Tyrosinemia Type1 21 22 Lori Hillin, RALAT Development and Characterization of a Humanized Porcine Model of Phenylketonuria 22 23 Shilvi Joshi, MS Detection of Intraoperative Hypothermia May Assist in Prediction of Infectious Complications in Neonates with Gastroschisis 22 24 Robert Kaiser, PhD, DABT In V ivo Liver-Directed Lentiviral Ggene T herapy is Curative in a Large Animal M odel of Hereditary Tyrosinemia Type 1 23 25 Robert Kaiser, PhD, DABT Effects of Lentiviral Vector Administration on a DEN/CCl4 -

Ectopic H epatocyte Transplantation C ures the Pig Model of Tyrosinemia Kari L . Allen, Clara T Nicolas, Raymond D . Hickey, Zeji Du, Rebekah Kocher, Timothy . DeGrado, Scott L . Nyberg, . Kaiser, Eric Lagasse, Joseph B . Lillegard The effectiveness of cell -based therapies to treat liver failure is limited by the diseased liver environment. Herein we provide preclinical proof -of-concept for the treatment of liver failure through hepatocyte transplantation into lymph nodes in a large -animal model of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1), a metabolic liver disease caused by deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) enzyme. FAH -deficient pigs received autologous into mesenteric lymph nodes after ex vivo transduction with a lentiviral vector carrying the pig Fah gene. Hepatocytes showed early (6 hour) and durable (8 month) engraftment in lymph nodes, with reproduction of vascular and hepatic microarchitecture. Subsequently, hepatocytes migrated to and repopulated the native diseased liver. The corrected cells generated enough liver mass to clinically ameliorate disease as early as 97 days post -transplantat ion, with complete normalization of tyrosine levels and liver function tests. Integration site analysis defined the corrected hepatocytes in the liver as a subpopulation of hepatocytes in the lymph nodes, indicating that the lymph nodes served as a source for healthy hepatocytes to repopulate a diseased liver. Ectopic transplantation of hepatocytes cures the pig model of HT1 and is a promising approach to the treatment of liver disease in patients with pre -existing liver damage and fibrosis. 10. Multidisciplinary E ngagement from Providers to Administrators in Surgery Verification Quality I mprovement Andrea S. Balzer, DNP, PMP Introduction : Multidisciplinary engagement is a cornerstone of quality improvement. Per Vincent, Batalden, and Davidoff, \"effective improvement and research rely on sustained multidisciplinary collaboration\" (BMJ, 2011). As part of the journey to achieve Level 1 Pediatric Surgery Verification, our organization has built a robust multidisciplinary Performance Improvement an d Patient Safety (PIPS) infrastructure focused on quality care and optimal outcomes of surgical patients across the continuum of care. A pivotal key driver to our success has been the way in which we've engendered engagement and trust of surgeons, admini strators, and key stakeholders who are the enables of quality care. Methods : As a first step to establishing the committee, clear expectations and guidelines were set by the Chief of Surgery and Surgical Director of Quality which were reinforced by hospi tal administrators. In order to engender trust of our multidisciplinary team in the PIPS committee and process, the committee chairs committed to supporting in their patient review process by providing them with standard forms to present cases for review , populating the forms with the patient event information, and supporting each specialty's Morbidity and Mortality conference. Results : Attendance of the PIPS committee required specialties range from 71% to 100%; well above the ACS requirement of 50%. An average of 10 multidisciplinary cases are reviewed on a monthly basis with applicable performance improvement opportunities identified by individual specialties and as a committee. Conclusion : Engaged leaders, providing tools to team members, and sharing a vision for providing quality care to children are success factors to establishing an effective PIPS committee. 11. Standardizing E mergency Department to Hospitalist Verbal Handoff at Children's Minnesota Laura MD, MD, Gabrielle Hester, MD, MS Introduction: Standardized handoffs can improve patient safety. Objective: To implement a standardized handoff checklist between pediatric Emergency Department (ED) and hospitalist clinicians. 14 | P a g e Methods: Four hospitalists and two ED physicians created a handoff checklist. Four -do-study -act (PDSA) cycles were conducted: 1.) 20-item checklist (see figure 1) implemented by placing a placard next to each ED computer and educating staff at meetings and via e -mail, 2.) Revision of checklist placard (addition of primary clinic), 3.) Electronic surveys to clinicians, 4.) Summary pag e with run chart posted in hospitalist workrooms. Primary outcome was checklist adherence, assessed by hospitalists during clinical shifts May -December 2018. ED clinicians were unaware of audit. Results were displayed on Statistical Process Control charts using Microsoft Excel with QI macros. The date of checklist implementation was indicated as a process change to recalculate control limits. Secondary outcomes were provider satisfaction and awareness of checklist, reported with descriptive statistics. This study was deemed exempt by our IRB. Results: 382 handoffs were assessed. Mean checklist adherence increased from 8.6 to 11.3 with checklist implementation. See Figure 1 for control chart with PDSA cycles. Survey response rate was 43.7% for both hospitali sts (28/64) and (14/25) of hospitalists and 63.3% (19/30) of ED providers were aware of the checklist. There was discrepancy in provider satisfaction of handoffs: 96% (29/30) of ED providers assessed the quality of handoffs as \"very go od\" or \"good\" compared to (16/25) of hospitalists. Discussion/Conclusion : Following four PDSA cycles, small improvements in checklist adherence were seen. Provider awareness of the checklist was low. ED provider satisfaction with handoff was much higher than hospitalist satisfaction, highlighting a need for improved inter -depar tmental communication. Future PDSA cycles will include educating ED residents on the checklist. Figure 1. Mean Adherence to ED -Hospitalist Handoff Checklist. UCL= Upper control limit. CL= Lower control limit. *Twenty checklist items included: introduction of provider, patient name, reason for admission, code status, interpreter needs, chief complaint, brief history, past medical history, home medications, initial vital signs, physical exam, interventions in ED, medications given in E D, respiratory support, changes in vital signs, labs/imaging, consults, IV access, pending labs, and to -do items. 12. Pediatric E mergency Department Visits for Mental Health C oncerns: Barriers to Connecting with Outpatient Care and U sefulness of a Text Message Appointment Reminder S ystem Gretchen Cutler, PhD, MPH, Jing Jin, MS, Ayesha Bhatia, BS, Kristin Frenn, MPH, Michael Troy, PhD, LP, Anupam Kharbanda, MD, MSc Objective: To examine barriers to mental health (MH) care in youth visiting the emergency department (ED) with MH concerns, and develop and test a text message reminder system. Methods: Prospective study and randomized controlled trial of patients less than 18 year s of age visiting the ED for MH concerns from April 2016 to December 2017. Parents of patients discharged with a referral for outpatient MH care were randomized to receive text message appointment reminders or usual care. Data was collected from patient's electronic medical records and parent baseline and follow -up surveys. Association between text message intervention and appointment follow -up was examined using chi -square tests. Results: We enrolled 293 patients and parents in the prospective study, and 106 in the text message intervention. The majority of patients were female (57.3%), white (64.3%), and 12 years of age or older (61.8%). Most common diagnoses included behavior disorders (34.1%), suicide or self -injury (32.1%) and depressive disorders (28 .0%). Top barriers to care 15 | P a g e included having to wait too long for an appointment (44.4%), not knowing where to go (37.5%) and lack of convenient appointment times (35.7%). One fifth of patients had never received MH care (20.1%). Parents identifying as food insecure (17.9%) were significantly more likely to report that their child was not able to get MH care when needed (p=0.05, Figure ). We found no significant relationship between receiving text messages and follow -up with outpatient treatment, but 62.1% of parents felt that the reminders were very or somewhat helpful. Conclusion: Parents reported multiple barriers to accessing MH care for their children, and our results suggest disparities in ability to access to care. We successfully piloted a text messag e appointment reminder process in a large, urban pediatric ED. While we found no significant relationship with follow -up appointment rates, parents were receptive to receiving text message reminders. 13. Genome -Wide Integration Profile of a Lentiviral Vector C arrying the Human FAH Gene in Human H epatocytes Zeji Du, Raymond Hickey, Clara Nicolas, Kari Allen, Caitlin VanLith, Robert Kaiser, Joseph Lillegard Introduction: Lentiviral (LV) vectors can deliver large amounts of genetic information into dividing and non -dividing host cells with high efficiency, generating stable expression of the transgene. These characteristics make LV vectors an excellent option for gene deliv ery and gene editing; however, potential for insertional mutagenesis remains a concern. This study investigates the whole genome profile of LV integration to better characterize and evaluate its genotoxicity. Methods: The LV vector used in this study was constructed carrying human FAH gene expressed under the hepatic control region enhancer/human alpha -1 antitrypsin promoter complex (HCR -hAAT). Human hepatocytes were transduced with LV vector at 2000 MOI, 4\u00b0C for 90 minutes and 37\u00b0C for 30 min. Genomic DN A was extracted at 72 h from the transduced hepatocytes. Standard PCR using LV -specific primers was used to confirm genome integration. The diverse libraries of lentiviral integration sites were generated through ligation -mediated amplificatio through next generation sequencing (NGS). The genomic location of each virus -host junction was mapped using BWA MEM. Results: A total of 77.6 million integration sites were detected with 1.2 million being unique. Mapp ing of all integration sites to human chromosomes shows most hotspot integration sites correspond to less condensed, more structurally accessible regions of the genome. Additionally, virus integration frequency was correlated to gene density in each chromo some and relative expression level of each gene. Lentivirus preferentially integrated in transcription unit, especially introns, and much less frequently in exons and other non -coding regions. Dividing LV integration into quartiles of the coding region we found no preference to a particular quartile. Lentivirus also demonstrated a preference for integration beyond 20kb to transcript start sites (TSS) but not in the promoter region. After normalization for all CpG islands in the human genome, CpG islands wer e not preferred for lentivirus integration suggesting a low frequency of promoter disruption. When integration frequency within tumorigenesis -related genes was normalized for all genes in the human genome, we observed no preference for integration into tum or-associated genes, with integrations typically occurred in the intronic region with no preference to the promoter region. Finally, we show for the first time that sequence 16 | P a g e homology may play role for integration preference as overwhelming integration even ts occurred at the FAH locus and SERPINA1 gene, which has homology with HCR -hAAT. Conclusions: Evaluation of 77.6M LV integration sites provided a meaningful data set for genotoxic evaluation of lentivirus integration. Whole genome integration mapping sh ows most hot spots occurred in less condensed regions in the genome. LV integration sites were highly related with gene density in the human genome, and typically within transcribed regions with a preference for introns. CpG islands were not favored by len tivirus for integration and integration was positively correlated to gene expression level. We also showed there was no significant integration preference towards tumorigenesis -related genes when compared to the whole genome. LV -huFAH integrated frequentl y into the FAH gene in human hepatocytes, indicating the possibility that sequence homology may affect integration site selection. 14. A Combined T reatment Approach for Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder in a Patient with Celiac D isease Sarah Eckhardt, PhD,Kristina Duncombe Lowe, PhD, Daniel Le Grange, PhD, Jill Ehrenreich -May, PhD This case report illustrates the presentation and treatment of an 11 -year -old female with a recent diagnosis of celiac disease, resulting in rapid weight loss in the context of severe anxiety about physical sensations and choking while eating. The patient was diagnosed with Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) and subsequently treated with a modified version of Family -Based Treatment (FBT), in conjunct ion with the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children (UP -C). At the end of treatment, improvements in weight gain, ability to eat apart from caregivers/in a variety of settings, as well as a decrease in anxiety aro und trying new foods and choking were observed. These findings highlight promising results for the combined treatment approach, named FBT+UP for ARFID. Further research utilizing a randomized controlled trial is needed to establish the efficacy of this tre atment for a variety of presentations of ARFID. 15. Combining Preoperative Erythropoietin and Intraoperative Tranexamic Acid Reduces Transfusions and Length of Stay in Sagittal Craniosynostosis Surgery Paul Escher, BA, Albert Tu, MD, Susan Kearney, MD, Matthew Wheelwright, PhD, Robert Tibesar, MD Introductio n: Calvarial vault remodeling for correction of sagittal craniosynostosis in infants often results in considerable blood loss requiring transfusion of blood products. Prior series have suggested that preoperative erythropoietin (EPO) and intraoperative tranexamic acid (TXA) reduce the need for transfusions in these patients. The purpose of this investigation is to assess the effect of a protocol of co mbined EPO and TXA on the incidence of transfusion in patients with sagittal craniosynostosis. Methods: A retrospective chart review of all sagittal craniosynostosis patients undergoing repair at our institution since 2010 was conducted. Patients had received either preoperative EPO with iron and intraoperative TXA, TXA alone, or neither. Perioperative hemoglobin levels, length of stay, and transfusion rate and volumes were collected and compared between these three groups. Syndromic, multisutural, and nonsagittal craniosynostosis patients were excluded from study. Results: A total of 45 patients were identified for study. 33 patients were male and 12 were female. 22 patients received neither TXA nor EPO, 7 received TXA alone, and 16 received both EPO and TXA. There were significant differences in the percentage of patients transfused with red blood cells between the groups who received neither drug (100% transfused), TXA alone (57.1%) and those and intraoperative TXA (25%, p<0.0001). The combined TXA/EPO group had the shortest mean length of stay (3.25 days) compared to those receiving TXA alone (4.43 days) and neither (4 days, p=0.006). Estimated blood loss correlated with longer operative time (R2=0.418, p<0.0001), but operative time did not differ between groups, nor did the percentage of the patients' estimated blood volume that was transfused. Conclusion: Preoperative EPO combined with intraoperative TXA effectively reduces the need for blood transfusion as well a s length of hospital stay in sagittal craniosynostosis patients. 17 | P a g e 16. Impact of Early S creening for Cystic Fibrosis Related D iabetes (CFRD): An Analysis of Port CF Patient Registry Data of Screening Practices by C linic Elizabeth Franck Thompson, MPH, CCRP; Dave Watson, , MD Objective: Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is the most common comorbidity of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), affecting about 20% of adolescents and 40 -50% of adults (Moran A, et al. Diabetes Care. 2009:1626 -1631). CFRD is associated with pulmonary function decline and increased mortality (Miller RJ et al. Can Respir J. 2008; 15:291 -294). In 2010, the CFRD Clinical Care Guideline were updated, recommending all patient with CF begin CFR D screening at 10 years old. This study uses PortCF registry data of patients with CF to examine the impact of earlier screening practices at centers from 2009 -2015. Methods: The cohort was defined as patients with CF and without CFRD that turned 10 from 2009 to 2015. The cohort was identified to examine the impact of the 2010 guideline recommending a 2 hr OGTT screen for CFRD of patients entering the screening age. CF clinics with less than 50 patient years of data were excluded. Screening rates for each clinic were calculated from patients at risk of CFRD; specifically number of patient years with a CFRD screen divided by the total number of patient years. Kaplan -Meier curves were used to show the distribution of age at CFRD diagnosis and the differences in curves were tested using the log rank test, with significance level set at 0.05 Results: Of 189 centers that met inclusion criteria, the average rate of annual screening was 35%. Of 4 ,010 patients screened, 512 (13%) were diagnosed. The screening rat e of the patients' clinic was significantly associated with time to diagnosis (p -value=0.0001). Clinics with higher screening rates tended to diagnose CFRD more frequently and earlier (Figure 1). Centers with the lowest (0% -20%), middle (40% -60%), and -18%), and 25% (15 -34%) of patients by the age of 15, respectively. Conclusions: Centers that screen for CFRD more tend to diagnose CFRD at a younger age. An average annual screening rate among this cohort of 35% suggests there are significant opportunities for improvement in early diagnosis of CFRD. Figure 1. Kaplan -Meier curves of the time undtil CFRD diagnosis by screening rates of clinic. 18 | P a g e 17. Short -term High -dose Intravenous Deferoxamine as Combination Therapy for Reduction of Iron in Patients with Persistent Iron Overload Stephanie A. Fritch Lilla, Nicole A. Hart, & Kristen M. Appert Background: Transfusional iron overload is common in patients receiving chronic red cell transfusions. As a result, iron chelation is required to minimize toxicity from iron overload. Chelation with a single agent can be inadequate at controlling or reducing iron burden. When combination therapy is required deferoxamine may be added to oral chelation. Deferoxamine is generally given subcutaneous over 8 -12 hours for 5 -6 days a week at 25 -60mg/kg/day. Many patients struggle to remain compliant with this schedule which has prompted trials of intravenous high -dose(HD) deferoxamine. Prior reports of short -term HD deferoxamine have shown minimal side effects however, prolonged use of HD deferoxamine has known toxicity. When compliance is a concern, our center has used HD deferoxamine infusions at 15mg/kg/hr x 48hour s every 2 to 4 weeks. Objectives: Evaluate the safety and efficacy of HD deferoxamine at our institution to help guide future therapy . Methods: Retrospective review was completed of patients previously treated with HD deferoxamine between April 2011 and September 2017 at Children's Minnesota. Final sample included 8 patients ages 3 to 14 years with underlying diagnosis of thalassemia (7) and diamond -blackfan anemia (1). Deferoxamine infusions were given for 48 hours every 24 - 35 days with a mean length of treatment of 279 days . Results : All patients were on combination therapy with deferasirox, however deferasirox was held during deferoxamine infusion. Mean pre -deferoxamine liver iron concentration (LIC) was 31.75mg/g and mean post LIC was 12.11mg/g (p= 0.0008). Ferritin mean pre -deferoxamine was 2677ng/mL compared with mean post 1594ng/mL (p=0.0107). Tw o patients had possible allergy, leading to deferoxamine discontinuation. One patient developed hives, eye swelling and cough while the other had emesis and cough. Another patient experienced facial nerve palsy of unclear etiology, which did not recur with resumption of deferoxamine. No respiratory complications were seen . Conclusions : Results showed significant decrease in iron burden following combination therapy with high dose deferoxamine and deferasirox. No significant pulmonary, liver, renal, vision, or hearing toxicities were observed. Three patients reported reactions to deferoxamine infusions. However, one of these was able to successfully continue deferoxamine without further incident. Short -term, HD deferoxamine was effective at reducing LIC in c ombination with oral chelation but requires further evaluation to assess for potential increased risk of toxicity. Short -term HD deferoxamine may be considered in the setting of poor compliance of subcutaneous administration or inadequate chelation with si ngle agent therapy. Further studies are needed to clarify ideal dosing, timing and risk of toxicity . 18. International Pleuropulmonary Blastoma Registry/ DICER1 Registry -- China: An Emerging Global Partnership Anne K. Harris, MPH, Xiaoli, Ma, MD, MM, PhD, Alice Chen, MTI, Gao Chao, MD, PhD, Fu Libing, MD, MSc, Matthew Brown, PhD, MPS , Amanda Field, MPH , D. Ashley Hill, MD, Kris Ann P. Schultz, MD, MS Background: Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is related to germline or tissue specific mutations in the DICER1 gene. Since 1988, the International PPB/ DICER1 Registry has enrolled individuals with PPB from 49 countries including China, however, collection of data and clinical samples from China has historically been limited by language and customs barriers. More information is needed regarding optimal treatment and more samples are needed for development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics. Beijing Children's Hospital (BCH) currently follows Registry guidelines for the treatment of PPB and sees more than 35 0 children with newly diagnosed solid tumors per year creating opportunities for collaboration. Methods/Status: Collaboration agreements have been executed between the Registry and BCH and the Registry protocol has been approved by the BCH Institutional Review Board. BCH will directly enroll children with PPB or other DICER1 -related cancers and abstract medical records, pathology and operative reports into standardized data collection forms. Digital central pathology review will occur via HIPAA -secure clo ud based servers. Tumor DICER1 sequencing and digital droplet PCR for measurement of circulating tumor DNA will be performed at BCH. This partnership continues to receive infrastructural support from the National Cancer Institute Global Health Office. 19 | P a g e Results: Thus far, this collaboration has included successful initiation of central pathology review resulting in a change in clinical management for a young child with suspected PPB and submission of a collaborative grant to fund enrollment and specimen col lections. Future directions: This emerging partnership will help us collate additional clinical data and will accelerate the development of novel diagnostics for DICER1 -related tumors. We also hope that this global partnership will serve as a springboard to additional collaborative efforts to accelerate pediatric and/or rare tumor research and may advance \"science diplomacy.\" 19. Measles at US Children's Hospitals Gabrielle Z. Hester, MD , Amanda J. Nickel, MPH , Patricia A. Stinchfield, MS , Alicen B. Spaulding, PhD , MPH Introduction : While not endemic in the United States (US), measles outbreaks continue to occur. Objective: To describe demographics, complications, and resource utilization for children hospitalized for measles at a sample of US children's hospitals. Methods : This was a retrospective, descriptive study of patients 0 -18 years old hospitalized at children's ho spitals contributing data to Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) 1/1/2004 - 06/30/2018 with an International Classification of Disease version 9 or 10 discharge diagnosis code for measles (055.X or B05.X). Complications were identified by categoriz ation of secondary diagnosis codes into relevant clinical groups. Patients with complex chronic conditions (CCC) were excluded from resource utilization analysis. Descriptive statistics were performed using STATA version 14.0 (College Station, TX). This st udy was deemed exempt from review by the local IRB. Results : Fifty -two hospitals reported on average 12 years of data to PHIS, 35 hospitals had measles admissions. We identified 134 unique patients with 135 measles -related admissions. Median age was 23 months, 48% were male, 32% were Caucasian and 25% were black/Af rican -American, 55% had public insurance, and 48% were from Midwestern hospitals. Twenty -two patients (16%) had CCCs. Two patients with CCC (2/22; 9%) died or were discharged to hospice. Among non -complex patients, 52% were given at least one dose of antib iotics and 35% received Vitamin A. Most common complications were dehydration (52%) and eye problems (25%) (Table 1). Among non -complex patients median length of stay was 3 days (range 1 -50 days) and median adjusted estimated costs were $5,932 (range $1,08 9 - $134,491). Discussion : Similar to previous reports dehydration and pneumonia were common complications; however keratitis/eye problems were higher than previously described. The higher mortality rate found in our study may reflect the increased acuit y in a hospitalized population or higher risks in patients with underlying CCC. Low rate of vitamin A use may reflect clinician confusion regarding recommendations for supplementation in developed vs. developing countries, and lack of comparative effective ness studies in US patients. Conclusions : While uncommon in US children's hospitals, patients hospitalized for measles have significant morbidity, mortality, and resource utilization. Efforts to improve measles vaccination rates should continue. Future s tudies are needed to examine risks and benefits of Vitamin A use in patients with measles in the US. 20 | P a g e Table 1.

Management and Rate of Airway Intervention for Croup at a Tertiary Children's Hospital 2015 -2016 Gabrielle Hester, MD, MS MD , Amanda Nickel, MPH Background: Decision making after initial stabilization for croup is challenging as the rate of further intervention is unclear. Objective: To describe rates of interventions, including racemic epinephrine (RE) and additional inpatient airway interventions (IAI), am ong pediatric patients presenting to a tertiary children's hospital with croup. Design: Retrospective study. Setting/Patients: Patients (3 months to 8 years old) with an emergency department (ED)/inpatient encounter for croup from 1/1/15 -12/31/16 at a tertiary children's hospital. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) direct admits and patients with bronchiolitis/asthma/pneu monia were excluded. Measurements: IAI was defined as RE, oxygen or heliox therapy, intubation, and/or transfer to ICU after admission. Univariate analysis was used to assess associations with IAI. Comparisons were made between groups (a weighted random 5% sample of patients evaluated in ED only, and those admitted with or without IAI) using Kruskal -Wallis, Pearson Chi - Square, or Fischer's Exact test, where appropriate. Results: 588 patients (194 discharged from ED, 394 admitted) were included. Median a ge was 18 months, 65% were male. In admitted patients, 20.8% (82/394) had IAI. Overall, patients with 2 outside hospital/ED doses of RE had a 12.1% rate of IAI (23.5% in patients with 3 RE doses), see table 1. Potential factors such as age, race/ethnicit y, prematurity and RE doses were not associated with IAI in univariate analyses (table 2). Conclusion : Our study found a low rate of IAI after ED management in patients with croup and no significant associated risk factors. These findings should be considered in admission decisions. 21 | P a g e 21. Autologous Gene and Cell Therapy P rovid es Safe and Long -Term Curative T herapy in a Large Pig Model of Hereditary T yrosinemia T ype 1 Raymond D. Hickey, Clara T. Nicolas, Kari Allen, Shennen Mao, Faysal Elgilani, Jaime Glorioso, Bruce Amiot, Caitlin VanLith, Rebekah Guthman, Harvey Chen, Cary O. Harding, Robert A. Kaiser, Scott L. Nyberg, Joseph B. Lillegard Background : Orthotopic liver transplantation remains the only curative therapy for inborn errors of metabolism. Given the tremendous success for primary immunodeficiencies using ex vivo gene therapy with lentiviral vectors, there is great interest in developing simila r curative therapies for metabolic liver diseases. We have previously generated a pig model of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1), an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH). Methods: Using this model, we have demonstrated curative ex vivo gene and cell therapy using a lentiviral vector to express FAH in autologous hepatocytes. To further evaluate the long -term clinical outcomes of this therapeutic approach, we continued to monitor one of these pigs over t he course of three years. Results: The animal continued to thrive off the protective drug NTBC, gaining weight appropriately, and maintaining sexual fecundity for the course of his life. The animal was euthanized 31 months after transplantation to perform a thorough biochemical and histological analysis. Biochemically, liver enzymes and alpha -fetoprotein levels remained normal and abhorrent metabolites specific to HT1 remained corrected. Liver histology showed no evidence of tumorigenicity and Masson's Tri chrome staining revealed minimal fibrosis and no evidence of cirrhosis. FAH - immunohistochemistry revealed complete repopulation of the liver by transplanted FAH -positive cells. A complete histopathological report on other organs, including kidney, revealed no abnormalities. Conclusion: This study is the first to demonstrate long -term safety and efficacy of hepatocyte -directed gene therapy in a large animal model. We conclude that hepatocyte -directed ex vivo gene therapy is a rational choice for further exploration as an alternative therapeutic approach to whole organ transplantation for metabolic liver disease, including HT1. 22 | P a g e 22. Development and Characterization of a Humanized Porcine Model of Phenylketonuria Lori Hillin, Kari L . Allen, Daniel F Carlson, PhD, Dennis A Webster, Caitlin J . VanLith, Clara T . Nicolas, MD, Yue Yu, PhD, Raymond D . Hickey, PhD, Shelley R . Winn, PhD, Robert A . Kaiser, PhD, DABT, Cary O . Harding, MD, Joseph B . Lillegard, MD, PhD Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder whereby phenylalanine metabolism is deficient due to allelic variations in the gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). There is no cure for PKU other than orthotopic liver transplantation, and the standard of care for patients is lim ited to dietary restrictions and key amino acid supplementation. Therefore, Pah was targeted in pig fibroblasts using TALENs, and pigs were subsequently cloned to facilitate research and therapeutic development where the genetic variation is identical to a common and severe human allele, R408W. Additionally, the proximal region to the mutation was further humanized by introducing 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to allow for development of gene editing machinery that could be translated from the pig directly to human PKU patients that harbor at least one classic R408W allele. R esulting piglets were hypopigmented (a single Ossabaw piglet) and had low birthweight (all piglets). The piglets had similar levels of PAH expression, but no detectable enzymatic activity, consistent with the human phenotype. The piglets were fragile and r equired extensive neonatal care to prevent failure to thrive and early demise. Phenylalanine levels rose sharply when dietary Phe was unrestricted but could be rapidly reduced with a low-Phe diet. Fibroblasts and hepatocytes isolated from R408W piglets sho w susceptibility to correction using CRISPR or TALEN, with subsequent homology -directed recombination to correct Pah. This pig model of PKU provides a powerful new tool for the development of all classes of therapeutic candidates to treat or cure PKU, with a unique advantage that prospective advanced therapeutic approaches such as gene editing can be directly translated to human patients without the cost and delays incurred in the development of surrogate reagents for preclinical testing. Conclusions : SGA i nfants born less than 30 weeks gestation are at increased risk for significant respiratory complications and morbidity, in addition to increased mortality, when compared to matched AGA infants. They also are at higher risk for severe neurodevelopmental dis ability and development of cerebral palsy. 23. Detection of Intraoperative Hypothermia May Assist in Prediction of Infectious Complications in Neonates with Gastroschisis Shilvi Joshi, MS, Stephanie Eyerly -Webb, PhD, Eric Dion, BA, Andrea Lampland, MD , Brad Feltis MD, PhD Purpose: To evaluate the relationship between intraoperative hypothermic events and infectious complication in neonates with gastroschisis undergoing closure. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed (2013 - 2017) all neonates with gast roschisis, analyzing infant with at least three intraoperative temperature measurements. Spontaneous intraoperative hypothermia was defined as any intraoperative body temperature measurement below 36\u00baC. Primary outcomes were surgical site infections (SSIs) or other infectious complications (ICs) within 30 -days of closure. Secondary variables included operative characteristics, such as silo use and operation duration. Fisher's exact test assessed the association between intraoperative hypothermia and infecti on outcomes and secondary variables. This site data was contributed to a larger multicenter study with the same aim coordinated by the Medical College of Wisconsin. Results: Of the 55 identified cases of gastroschisis, 50 met inclusion criteria. 16(32%) incidents of infectious complications occurred, of which 12(24%) were identified as surgical site infections. 10(20%) newborns had experienced intraoperative hypothermia. Mean nadir intraoperative hypothermic and normothermic were 35.21\u00b10.61\u00baC and 36.63\u00b10.18\u00baC, respectfully. Infants that were hypothermic during surgery had higher rates of SSIs (50% vs 17.5%) and ICs (70% vs 22.5%) than normothermic infants, and intraoperative hypothermia was found to be significantly associated with SSIs ( p=0.046) and ICs ( p=0.009). Silo associated with remaining normothermic during surgery ( p=0.02), while other operative conditions were similar between normothermic and hypothermic groups. Conclusion: Site data demonstrated an association between intraoperative hypothermia and ICs in newborns with gastroschisis. Additionally, infants with silo placement were associated with remaining normothermic. Follow -up with multi -institutional data sets will provid e more statistical power on the relationship between perioperative hypothermia and surgical infectious complications. 23 | P a g e 24. In Vivo Liver -Directed Lentiviral Gene Therapy is Curative in a Large Animal Model of Hereditary Tyrosinemia T ype 1 Robert A Kaiser, Clara T Nicolas, Caitlin J VanLith, Kari L Allen, Raymond D Hickey, Zeji Du, Lori G Hillin, Rebekah M Guthman, type 1 (HT1) is an autosomal recessive i nborn error of metabolism that is characterized by the inability to breakdown tyrosine, causing an accumulation of toxic metabolites in the liver and resulting in severe oxidative damage. These patients develop fibrosis, cirrhosis, high rates of hepatocell ular carcinoma and ultimately liver failure at a very young age if left untreated. Our group has previously demonstrated that ex vivo lentiviral (LV) gene transfers followed by autologous transplantation of corrected hepatocytes is curative in both mouse a nd pig models of HT1. The ex vivo approach, although effective, requires a partial hepatectomy in liver -based diseases. In vivo liver -directed gene therapy is an attractive non -surgical option for the treatment of genetic hepatic disease. In this study, we evaluated both effectiveness and safety profile of in vivo liver -directed LV gene therapy for the treatment of HT1 in pigs. Pigs dosed with LV-FAH (n=4) showed only a transient immune response to the lentiviral vector and transgene. They were able to become weight stable after only four cycles on the maintenance m edication, NTBC. Blood data from 150 days post treatment showed normalized tyrosine and liver function enzyme levels. No increase in alpha -fetoprotein was seen, indicating a lack of hepatocellular carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry of livers from dosed pigs s howed nearly complete repopulation of the liver with FAH+ hepatocytes at 6 month post treatment, with a reversal of fibrosis by 12 months. An analysis of the lentivirus integration profile showed integration in the livers of all animals, in addition to a n umber of other tissues, such as lung, colon, and heart. Intronic integration seemed to be favored, with a lack of preference for highly expressed genes, CpG islands, or tumor coding genes. 25. Effects of Lentiviral Vector Administration on a DEN/CCl4 -Induced Liver Injury Mouse Model Kaiser , Nicolas, Allen2, Chilton, Du, Hickey, Lillegard We expressing fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (LV -FAH) intended gene therapy for hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HT1). To develop this vector for consideration for potential human clinical use we have evaluated general - and specific hepato -toxicity of a single intravenous dose in wild -type mice and mice subsequently exp osed to N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) to induce liver injury. Briefly, groups of 20 male mice were dosed with vehicle, DEN/CCl4, LV -FAH (109 TU/mouse), or the combination of LV -FAH and subsequent DEN/CCl4 over a 109 -day study period. All groups were evaluated for general toxicology endpoints, including body weights, cage side observations, serum chemistry, hematology, and gross pathology. Hepatotoxicity was specifically interrogated with routine histopathology and expression of alpha fetoprotein, a biomarker associated hepatocellular carcinoma. Although there were no changes in observational data associated with any treatment group, both the DEN/CCl4 induction and LVV -FAH caused slight, non -additive, statistically significant de creases in body weight gain over the course of the study (4.2x gain for controls compared to 3.2 -3.7x for treated groups). DEN/CCl4 resulted in expected liver toxicity and, alone or in the presence of LV -FAH, was associated with heart weight decreases (0.8 5-0.81x control, respectively) and spleen weight increases (1.06 -1.12x, respectively). LV -FAH alone or with DEN/CCl4 was associated with reduced kidney weights (0.93 -0.91x, respectively) with some animals exhibiting mild increases in BUN and/or creatinine. In the liver, exposure to DEN/CCl4 alone or with LV -FAH was associated with elevations in AST (2.3 - 2.7x, respectively) and ALT (3.2 -4.2x, respectively), but only the combination group demonstrated increases in liver to body weight ratio (4.5x compared to 4.1x). combination of DEN/CCl4 and LV -FAH was associated with an increased severity of t hese findings, with higher incidence of bridging fibrosis and advancing to hepatocyte degeneration and necrosis. There were no hepatocellular tumors observed in any group tested; however, DEN/CCL4 caused increases in alpha fetoprotein levels that were exac erbated in the context of pretreatment with LV -FAH. These results indicate that systemic LV -FAH administration was unequivocally safe, with no adverse effects at this therapeutic dose in any parameters tested. However, in the context of a chemically injure d liver model, pretreatment with LV -FAH was associated with increased frequency and/or severity of toxicity. These results support therapeutic development of in vivo lentivirus administration, and further, clearly show that both healthy and disease models must be evaluated. 24 | P a g e 26. Caring for a Child with a Complex Chronic Condition: Parent -Reported Burden and Quality of Life Andrea Postier, Kolste, Stefan Friedrichsdorf Objectives: Parents caring for children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) face higher care -giving responsibilities, which may negatively impact caregiver burden and quality of life (QOL). The primary goal of this analysis was to measure burden of illness/QOL for p arents caring for a child with CCC, and to examine their association with sociodemographic characteristics. Methods: A survey was delivered to parents of 1,523 children (with and without CCCs) identified through a Midwestern US Medicaid insurance (low in come health assistance program) claims database if they received 1 clinic/hospital visit in 2015. The survey included the CarerQOL scale, questions about disease status, functional limitations, indirect cost indicators (e.g., reduced work) and parent/hous ehold characteristics. Results : Parents of 280 children (18%) participated. Factors associated with higher caregiver burden scores were: having a child with a progressive or variable disease, functional limitations (e.g., having difficulty eating or drin king), special education needs, and being considered disabled by the state government. Being on work leave, white race, and experiencing major household changes were also associated with higher burden while black race (child/parent) was associated with low er burden. Factors associated with lower QOL were in line with higher burden scores, as was having more education. Higher QOL was associated with black race (child/parent) and Hispanic or Somali ethnicity (child/parent). Compared to parents in the healthy child group, parents of children with CCCs reported more financial difficulty and problems managing care -giving tasks. QOL scores were lower in parents of children with CCCs, but they felt supported. Conclusion: Caring for a child with a CCC was associat ed with higher caregiver burden, lower QOL, and higher indirect costs. Future research is needed to help understand how interdisciplinary health providers can help identify and reduce burden, and improve QOL for patients and their families. 27. Secular Trends in Emergency Department Encounters for Concussion at US Children's Hospitals by Age G roup (2008 -2017) Amy M. Linabery, PhD, MS, Kara K. Seaton, MD, Alicia L. Zagel, PhD, MPH, Alicen B. Spaulding, PhD, MPH, Gretchen J. Cutler, PhD, MPH, Robert C. Do ss, PsyD, LP, ABPP CN, Anupam B. Kharbanda, MD, MSc Background: Increased concussion rates in US youth have been documented since 2000. Concomitant rises in healthcare utilization for concussion are likely attributable to public health, media, and legislative initiatives aimed at increasing public awareness of the importance of seeking medical attention after injury. Utilization trends in young children have not been well documented, however. Objective: To characterize recent secular trends in pediatric emergency department (ED) encounters for concussion by 4year age group. Methods : Using Children's Hospital Association's Pediatric Health Information System data, we examined a retrospective cohort of pati ents aged 2 17 years with an ED encounter for concussion at 22 US pediatric hospitals with continuous data between 2008 -2017. Average annual change in rates of ED visits for concussion and sports/recreation related concussion, imaging, and admissions were estimated via leastsquares regression. Results: ED encounters with a primary indication of concussion comprised 0.8% (n=86,393) of all ED encounters in 2008 -2017. Over time, ED concussion visits in 6 17yearolds increased by 0.5 1.1 per 1,000 ED encounters per year (all Ptrend<0.0001), while rates among 2 5yearolds remained stable (Ptrend=0.72). Rates for sports /recreation related concussions increased significantly across all age groups (<0.0001Ptrend0.01). Absolute number undergoing any imaging increased in all age groups; however, due to increased ED concussion encounters, the rate of imaging decreased 25 | P a g e overall (29.7/1,000 ED concussion encounters/year; Ptrend<0.0001) and across all age groups; the imaging rate decreased less for 25yearolds (19.6/1,000 encounters/year; Ptrend<0.0001). Likewise, admission rates declined significantly over time overall ( 10.1/1,000 encounters/year; Ptrend=0.0006) and for all age groups. Conclusions : ED concussion encounter rates in US youth aged 6 17 yea rs continue to increase at pediatric hospitals, suggesting awareness efforts have been effective. Conversely, imaging and admission rates have decreased, indicating efforts to curtail unnecessary irradiation and intervention have also been successful. Tren ds in 25yearolds were somewhat different from older youth and should be explored further. 28. Facto rs Affecting Admission and Length of S tay in Patients with Influenza - Associated (IAM) often seen in children who present with Influenza -like illness and leg pain. As no clear management guidelines exist, early recognition and better understanding of its expected course would allow for more efficient and standardized treatment. Objective: The aim of this study is to describe the clinical and laboratory profiles of patients presenting with IAM and to identify features affecting admission and length of stay (LOS). Design/Methods: A retrospect ive chart review was conducted on all patients presenting to a pediatric ED between 10/1/2014 -4/30/2018 with Influenza -like illness and myositis. Data was retrieved from the EMR and chart review. Chi -sq, t-test and logistic regression were implemented to c ompare clinical and laboratory features between admission and non - admission groups (Table 1), and in the admission group between patients with short ( 2 days) and long (>2 days) LOS (Table 2). Statistically significant results are defined as p0.05. Resu lts: The average annual ED volume at Children's Minnesota is 95,000. 123 cases met our inclusion criteria. The median age of patients was 6.6 years (SD=2.6 years) and 86 patients were male (70 %). 119 cases (97%) reported difficulty/refusal to ambulate and presence of muscle pain with 106 (86%) experiencing calf pain. On average, leg pain preceded the ED visit by 1.2 days and flu -like symptoms by 4.6 days. 119 (98%) patients had elevated Creatinine Phosphokinase (CPK) at presentation. The primary treatments were IV fluids (90%) and pain control (65%). Patients with longer duration of leg pain (1.6 vs. 0.5 days, p=0.0007) and higher CPK value (5133 vs. 1199, p<0.0001) were more likely to be admitted. The median LOS for admitted patients was 2.1 days. The majo rity (88%) of admitted patients had elevated but down -trending CPK at discharge (Table 3). Patients with higher maximum temperatures (38.1\u00b0C vs. 37.5\u00b0C, p=0.0035) were more likely to be hospitalized for >2 days. No patients developed any renal complication s. Conclusion(s): Though the treatment for IAM is straightforward, there are no reliable guidelines to help decide between inpatient versus outpatient treatment. Our results indicate that providers are more likely to admit patients with more severe illnes s and higher CPK levels. Due to a small cohort of admitted patients, we were unable to determine which variables most affected LOS and discharge readiness and protective effect of Influenza vaccine and oseltamivir. A multicenter study with a larger populat ion is required. 26 | P a g e 1.

Quality Of Life In Individuals With DICER1 -Related Conditions: An Interim Report From the International PPB Registry Ann Mason, Alicia Kunin -Batson, Stephanie DeAntoni, Kris Ann P. Schultz Purpose : To determine the feasibility of collecting quality of life (QOL) data for participants enrolled in the International PPB/ DICER1 Registry. The ultimate goal of this project will be to characteri ze the impact of carrier status and/or diagnosis and treatment of DICER1 -related cancers on quality of life, fatigue and physical function. Methods : Data was collected using PedsQL Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale at 6 months from enrollment. Adult self -report and parent -report (for children ages 2 to 17) surveys were mailed to 99 English -speaking and 1 Spanish -speaking participants. Survey distribution was tracked in a SQL Database and survey responses were scored through standardized procedures. 27 | P a g e Results : Of 100 participants who enrolled in the QOL portion of the registry, 50% (50/100) returned completed PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale surveys and 46% (46/100) returned completed PedsQL Pediatric Qu ality of Life Inventory Scale surveys. Four of the 50 respondents did not complete the PedsQL Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. One patient withdrew from the QOL portion of the study. Conclusions : Preliminary results demonstrate that ongoing QOL data collection is feasible. Longitudinal data collection is planned, with repeated surveys to be completed every other year. Electronically based surveys will be used in future assessments to improve response rate. Additional data analyses are underway. 30. Clinical Validation of Staging Criteria for Ovarian Sex Cord -Stromal Tumors: An Interim Report from the International OTST and PPB/ DICER1 Registries Alexander T. Nelson, BS, Anne K. Harris, MPH, Miranda Langford, BS , Farheen Turk, MBBS, MBA, , Louis P. Dehner, MD, Deborah F. Billmire, MD, Kris Ann P. Schultz, MD, MS Background: Ovarian sex cord -stromal tumors (OSCST) generally present in young girls and women with clinical signs of hormone production. Stage Ia OSCSTs carry a favorable prognosis ; however, later stage and recurrent disease are associated with a poor prognosis. Establishment management guidelines has been challenging due to the rarity of these tumors. Ovarian germ cell tumors in children are staged using Children's Oncology Group ( COG) criteria. Epithelial ovarian tumors in adults are staged using the FIGO (International Federation of Gynecological Oncology) surgical staging system. By convention, OSCSTs are frequently staged using the FIGO system but the clinical utility of this ap proach has not been validated. Patients and Methods: Individuals with OSCST were enrolled in the International Ovarian and Testicular Stromal Pathology was reviewed centrally. Medical records including pathology and surgical reports were abstracted into standardized fields. For each individual, a FIGO stage was obtained from the medical record. Follow -up data was requested annually. Centra l review of surgical staging is in progress. Results: Since inception, records from 101 individuals have been abstracted. Of these 49 have Sertoli -Leydig cell tumor, 24 have juvenile granulosa cell tumor (JGCT) and 28 have OSCST of other pathologic subty pes. Using FIGO staging, most tumors were found as stage Ia, did not require chemotherapy and did not recur. Tumors stage Ic and higher generally received chemotherapy. Recurrence rate was highest for individuals with JGCT with rupture (FIGO Ic). Of those with recurrence of JGCT, 75% (3/4) died of disease. Sampling of peritoneal fluid, a key component of FIGO staging, was frequently omitted. Conclusion: This represents the largest cohort available for validation of a staging system for OSCST. Preliminary analysis suggests incomplete staging is common. Correlation of clinical outcomes with staging by central review is underway. 31. Hepatocyte S pheroids as an Alternative to Single Cells for Transplantation After Ex Vivo Gene Therapy in Mice and Pig M odels Clara T. Nicolas MD, Raymond D. Hickey PhD, Kari L. Allen, Zeji Du PhD, Rebekah M. Guthman, Robert A. Kaiser PhD, PhD, R . DeGrado PhD, Scott L. Nyberg MD, PhD, Joseph B. Lillegard MD, PhD Background : Autologous hepatocyte transplantation after ex vivo gene therapy is an alternative to liver transplantation for metabolic liver disease. Here we evaluate ex vivo gene therapy followed by transplantation of single -cell or spheroid hepatocytes. Methods: Pig and mouse hepatocytes were isolated, labeled with zirconium -89 and returned to the liver as single cells or spheroids. Biodistribution was transduced with a lentiviral vector containing the Fah gene. Animals received portal vein infusion of single -cell or spheroid autologous hepatocytes after ex vivo gene 28 | P a g e delivery. Portal pressures were measured and ultrasound was u sed to evaluate for thrombus. Differences in engraftment and expansion of ex vivo corrected single -cell or spheroid hepatocytes were followed through histologic analysis and ability to thrive off 2 hepatocytes with increased heterogeneity in biodistribution as compared with single cells, which spread more uniformly throughout the liver. Animals receiving spher oids experienced higher mean changes in portal pressure than animals receiving single cells (P < .01). Additionally, two animals from the spheroid group developed portal vein thrombi that required systemic anticoagulation. Immunohistochemical analysis of s pheroid - and single -cell-transplanted animals showed similar engraftment and expansion rates of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase -positive hepatocytes in the liver, correlating with similar weight stabilization curves. Conclusio n: Ex correction of autologous hepatocytes -deficient spheroids or single -cell hepatocytes, with spheroids showing a more heterogeneous distribution within the liver and higher risks for portal vein thromb osis and increased portal pressures. 32. Concussion Recovery in Children Injured During the School Year vs Summer Months Alexander Petronio, BS, Robert Doss, PsyD, John Bedingham, BS, Mary Koolmo, CNP, Joseph Petronio, MD Introduction: Children who have suffered a concussion tend to have a longer period of recovery compared to adults. This course of recovery can vary dramatically from patient to patient, and is dependent upon a multitude of biopsychosocial factors. In order to tease apar t some of these factors, we aimed to characterize the recovery differences in pediatric concussion patients injured during the summer months (SUM) versus the school year (SCH), and whether the increased academic demands endemic to high school contribute to longer recovery intervals. Methods: Patients (age 6 -18) were grouped on the basis of injuries occurring during the summer (n = 119) or school year (n = 397). Demographic, medical/psychiatric history, injury characteristics, and clinical recovery data we re abstracted from medical records. The groups were further categorized by school -level: elementary (EL), middle school (MS), and high school (HS). Recovery time was defined as the number of days between injury and final clinic visit. Parametric and non - parametric statistical procedures were utilized. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with respect to demographics, medical/psychiatric histories, acute injury signs/symptoms, and most other clinical variables . The SCH group demonstrated a significantly longer recovery time (p < 0.05) and higher clinical utilization (p < 0.01) than the SUM group. This difference was greatest for high school -aged patients (p < 0.01). Conclusion : Children who sustained a concus sion during the school year took significantly longer to recover than those injured during the summer when the academic demands and school environment are relatively minimal to non -existent. This effect was found to be greatest in high school -aged patients and occurred in the context of comparable demographics, acute injury characteristics, and medical/psychiatric histories. This finding highlights the need for parents, clinicians, an d school officials to recognize and address factors that may influence rec overy. 33. Lung Transplantation for End -Stage Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Roy Maynard, MD, Brooke Moore, MD, Stephen Kurachek, MD, George B. Mallory, Jr, MD, Casey Rieck, William Wheeler, MD Purpose : Infants born less than 30 wee ks premature and surviving beyond 36 weeks corrected gestational age (GA) with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have a 5% chance of death before discharge.1 The purpose of this study was to review the role and outcome of lung transplantation for inf ants with severe BPD which is largely unknown. Methods : Data was obtained from retrospective review of the medical records database from Children's Minnesota over a 20-year period (1997 -2016). Inclusion criteria included prematurity < 32 weeks, BPD, chronic respiratory failure with 29 | P a g e invasive mechanical ventilation, and survival beyond 36 weeks corrected GA. Collected data included perinatal demographics, in -hospital medications and interventions, level of respiratory support, and outcome s. This study was approved by Children's Minnesota IRB. Results : Over the study period we identified 2374 infants that survived beyond 36 weeks or were discharged from our institution with a diagnosis of <32 weeks premature and BPD. Of these 148/2374 (6. 2%) received a tracheostomy for invasive mechanical ventilation for chronic respiratory failure and survived beyond 36 weeks corrected gestational age. Death or lung transplant occurred in 16/148 (10.8%) of these ventilator - dependent BPD patients before h ospital discharge. Lung transplantation for concerning pulmonary status was discussed with 10/148 (6.6%) families and subsequently 2 survived to discharge with eventual decannulation, 4 were referred for lung transplantation, and 4 expired before hospital discharge. The 4 patients referred for lung transplantation had deteriorating clinical status including severe pulmonary hypertension treated with nitic oxide and multiple pulmonary vasodilators, oxygen requirements > 0.70 FiO 2, high ventilatory requiremen ts, and need for extensive sedation . Data for patients referred for lung transplantation is shown in Table 1. Table 1.

Like other infants receiving solid organ transplant, long -term issues with comorbidities and special needs persist into childhood. 34. Interventions to Decrease Air Bubbles within Central Lines in a Cardiac Intensive Care Unit Setting Casey Rieck, Melissa Buescher, MPH, Mark Lo Galbo, MPH, Dave Watson, PhD, Alexandra Hopkins, Erik Edens, MD, PhD Purpose : Placement of central venous lines (CVL) is common in managing critically ill pediatric patients. Inadvertent air bubbles in a line can lead to an air embolus within pulmonary circulation. Venous air emboli in children with right to left shunting lesions can lead to myocardial infarction, stroke and death. Children with congenital heart disease have strokes at a higher rate than normal children. While many strokes are related to clots/procedures, some may be due to inadvertent air embolus and thus a preventable harm. Methods : We analyzed the proport ion of CVLs with air bubbles before and after implementation of anti -siphon valves in March 2016 and neutron caps in March 2017 within a pediatric Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit (CVICU). 30 | P a g e Quality/Safety Analysts collected data during patient encounters and manually examined lines for the presence of air bubbles. Results : A total of 104 patients were included in the study. P -charts were used to determine whether the proportion of CVLs with bubbles remained in control using Western Electric rules. After the intervention, the proportion of lines with bubbles was compared between those deemed compliant with the new protocol and those not compliant. Prior to the intervention the proportion of lines with bubbles showed a lack of control but the process remain ed in control following the first intervention. Figure 1 shows the proportion decreased from 18.0% before any intervention to 8.0% after the intervention. Of the 104 patients, 19% had a neurological event. Additional results will be available at the time o f poster presentation. Conclusion : The implementation of these devices, paired with nurse training on use, significantly reduced the frequency of air bubbles occurring with the placement of CVLs. Integrating these practices into standard care has the potential to improve the safe care of pediatric CVICU patients. 35. Blood -Based Biomarkers for Children with Pleuropulmonary Blastoma (PPB): A Report from the International PPB/ DICER1 Registry Kris Ann P. Schultz, MD, MS, Anne K. Harris, MPH, Amanda Field, MPH, Mercedes Wilhelm, Jessica Havens, Dave Watson, PhD, Yoav H. Messinger, MD, D. Ashley Hill, MD, Mark Brenneman, PhD Background: Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is the most common pediatric lung cancer. Survival rates decrease as PPB progresses. Overall survival is only 53% for children with Type III PPB. Toxicities of treatment intensification are substantial; thus, there is a need for novel ways to monitor treatment efficacy. Computed tomography scans are the current standard for assessment of treatment response and monitoring for recurrent disease but lack sensitivity and specificity and require radiation exposure and frequent seda tion in young children. PPB is related to germline and tumor -specific mutations in DICER1 , a critical gene in embryogenesis. Nearly all DICER1 - related tumors have one of a limited number of mutations in the RNase IIIb (\"hotspot\") domain. The Registry and collaborators at ResourcePath have jointly developed a blood -based biomarker for detection of DICER1 hotspot circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Methods: Children with PPB are enrolled in the International PPB/ DICER1 Registry (IRB#1611 -130). Blood samples are collected at times of clinical venipuncture including imaging time points. Tumor testing is performed to determine the tumor specific DICER1 hotspot. Levels of ctDNA are measured using digital droplet PCR. Results: More than 250 plasma samples have been collected from 94 individuals from the US, Canada, Norway and Israel, facilitating analytical validation for 11/22 \"hotspots\" covering 85% and representing ~90%of DICER1 -related tumors. Preliminary results demonstrate low limits of detection. Rising levels of DICER1 hotspot ctDNA were detected in a young child correlating with tumor progression. Future Directions: Enrollment and sample collection is underway to facilitate clinical validation. Blood -based biomarkers may allow measurement of minimal residual disease allowing risk stratification for children with PPB or other DICER1 -related cancers in future clinical t rials and may also allow us to detect relapse as early as possible, increasing survival while minimizing therapy -related toxicities. These biomarkers may also have utility in preclinical assessment of novel therapeutics. 36. Systematic Review of Spinal Deformities Following Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy Matthew Wheelwright, Ph D, Paige Selvey , BS, Paul Steinbok MB BS, Ash Singhal MD, George Ibrahim MD PhD, Aria Fallah MD MSc , Alexander G Weil MD, Kyle Halvorson MD, Albert Tu MD Introduction: Cerebral palsy is a common neurological disorder that involves spasticity of the extremities and that can lead to lifelong disability. Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) can improve spasticity and quality of life in these patients, b ut may be associated wit h development of spinal deformity. Risk factors for spinal deformity after SDR have not yet been systematically examined. 31 | P a g e Methods : Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases were queried for clinical studies reporting incidence of new or worsening spinal deformity, including scoliosis, after SDR. Variables that represent possible risk factors for deformity were correlated with repo rted incidence of deformity. Results: 22 articles for a total of 1485 patients met inclusion criteria for this study. Deformity occurs among all patients with a weighted mean incidence of 28.0%. Scoliosis appears to be the most common deformity occurring with a weighted mean incidence of 31.6%. There is substantial heterogeneity between studies, limiting our analysis. Significant positive correlation was found between percent of patients that developed any type of deformity and the ratio of female to male patients, p = 0.02. Significant positive correlation was also found between percent of patients that develop scoliosis and the ratio of female to male patients, p < 0.01, and between scoliosis and the number of years to follow up, p < 0.01. Conclusion: Spinal deformity is an important potential complication of SDR, and scoliosis is the most common type of deformity. The major risk factor for postoperative deformity is female sex. Deformity was also found to significantly increase with extended follow -up, indicating a slow process that should be carefully monitored. 37. Perceptions, Experiences, and Utilization of Music Therapy by NICU Staff: A Mixed Methods Approach Kayla Shafer, MA, MT -BC , Chantise Hunt, MT -BC Background: Infants admitted to the NICU face many developmental challenges due to their premature birth. Music therapy has been offered and studied to a limited extent in some NICUs (NICU -MT) for over two decades (Standley, 2014) to enhance developmental care and pr omote maturation of preterm infants. There is evidence for the benefits of music therapy, but research on staff perceptions about NICU -MT is limited. Objectives: The researchers conducted a study to understand the perceptions of and experiences with music therapy by NICU staff and whether these factors impact utilization of services. Methods: The study employed the Explanatory Sequential Mixed Methods design. Wi thin this design structure, Phase II data is collected to help explain Phase I. In Phase I, a survey was distributed to 459 NICU staff on two campuses of a large, urban pediatric hospital. The survey included demographic information, Likert -type scale ques tions regarding perceptions of music therapy, and two open ended prompts. In Phase II, 12 participants were interviewed. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed from a social constructivist lens. Results: Appropriate descriptive statistics were used to summarize participant characteristics and survey responses (n=80) from Phase I. To analyze whether acceptance of music therapy was correlated to utilization, researchers compared the aggregate scores of acceptance of those who requested music therapy with those who did not. Acceptance of music therapy was associated with higher utilization, and was statistically significant ( p = .01) in the domains of \"Infant \u2014 Positive Outcomes\" and \"Parent \u2014Positive Responses.\" Results of the qualitative data analysis reveal ed three themes: Perceptions largely based on what music therapy \"looks like\"; Experience makes the difference; Sensory input gate - keeping. Conclusions: Results of both phases highlighted areas of opportunity for music therapists to provide education and support for NICU staff. Questions and concerns can and should be addressed by music therapists to allow for increased understanding by those who can request this service for premature infants. 32 | P a g e 38. Isolated P ituit ary Stalk Thickening (IPST) in Children: Natural H Neoplastic isease Mary M. CNP Charles R. Bend elsmith, BS Sachin R. Patel, MD, Richard J. Patterson, MD, M. Jennifer Abuzzahab, MD , Katherine M. Ingram, PhD , Amy M. Linabery, PhD , MS, Anne E. Bendel, MD Background: Isolated pituitary stalk thickening (IPST) is rare, but is occasionally discovered while evaluatin g the etiology of diabetes insipidus (DI). IPST has a broad differential diagnosis including malignancy. We performed a retrospective review to characterize the outcomes of IPST. Methods: We reviewed medical records of 365 patients < 21 years seen at Children's Minnesota in 11/2003 -1/2018 with a diagnosis of DI. Patients were eligible if brain MRI showed IPST, with \"pituitary stalk thickening\" defined as a pituitary stalk diameter measuring >3 mm and \"isolated\" defined as a negative in itial workup for other causes of pituitary thickening. Results: Ten children were identified with IPST, with a male:female ratio of 6:4 and median age at diagnosis of 9.4 years (range: 3d -19.1 years). Median follow -up was 5.0 years (range 0.5 -9.6 years). Maximum pituitary stalk diameter (MPSD) occurred at diagnosis in 4 patients and between 3 -20 mo (mean=7 mo) from diagnosis in the other 6 patients. During follow -up, 7 patients had resolution of IPST between 3 -56 months from diagnosis (MPSD: 3.4 -7.8 mm), 1 had persistent but improved IPST at 12 months (MPSD: 7.4 mm), and 2 showed asymptomatic progression of IPST within 6.5 months from diagnosis. The 2 patients with progressive IPST underwent biopsy of the pituitary stalk and were diagnosed a germinoma and craniopharyngioma, respectively. Conclusion: IPST typically resolves over time, but 20% of IPST may harbor a malignancy. For the remainder, follow -up brain MRI is indicated, and progressive growth of pituitary stalk or new symptoms warrants further workup and potential biopsy to rule out malignancy. 39. Bloodstream Infections in Hospitalized Children in the United States: Incidence, Pathogens, and Regional Differences Alicen B. Spaulding, PhD, MPH ,Dave Watson, PhD , Jill Dreyfus, PhD, MPH , Phillip Bloodstream infections (BSI) cause significant morbidity and mortality in children, leading to longer hospital stays and increased healthca re costs. Recent epidemiology on national trends and pathogens in children is lacking, which could improve prevention strategies and empiric therapy selection. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study utilizing demographic and microbiology data from the Premier Healthcare Database, including all inpatient encounters from 2009 -2016 among patients <19 years. BSI were identified via a documented positive blood culture; known contaminants were excluded. Incidence rate was the number of BSI - positive patient encounters per 10,000 admissions. Demographics were analyzed comparing BSI -positive to patients without a documented positive BSI (non -BSI). Hospital -acquired infections were defined as those occurring at least 2 days after admission and analyzed o nly for non -neonates. Differences were assessed using chi -square tests and t -tests; time trends were analyzed using Cochran -Armitage tests. Results: Among 162 US hospitals reporting 4 years of blood cultures, 1,809,722 patient encounters met inclusion criteria; 6,152 (0.34%) had a positive BSI. BSI patients were significantly more often 1 -5 years old (16% vs. 6%), and had a complex chronic condition (26% vs. 5%), central line (34% vs. 2%), or catheter (12% vs. 3%) compared to non -BSI patients. Overall BS I incidence rate declined over time (37.0 in 2009 vs. 31.9 in 2016 per 10,000 admissions, p<0.001). Among non -neonates, pathogens with the highest incidence rates (per 10,000 admissions) were methicillin -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (10.5), E. coli (10.4), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (6.4); among neonates incidence was highest for E. coli (4.3), Group B Streptococcus (4.0) and MSSA (2.6). Incidence increased significantly over time in two US regions while decreasing in three (Figure 2). 33 | P a g e Conclusion: Hospitalized children remain at risk of community and hospital -acquired BSI. Due to substantial efforts, pediatric BSI incidence has declined nationally in recent years. However, more effective methods to prevent and assess patients at risk for BSI are warranted. 40. Oral Antibiotic Treatment Failure Among Children 2 Months to 2 Years with Acute Urinary Tract Infections Presenting to a P ediatric Emergency D epartment, 2010 - 2017 Alicen B. Spaulding, PhD, MPH, Alicia Zagel, PhD, MPH, Steve Grapentine, PharmD, BCPS, Ernest Krause, BA, Kelly Bergmann, DO, MS Background : Acute urinary tract infections (UTIs) commonly occur among young infants and toddlers, and may result in signific ant morbidity. However, current guidelines do not recommend a particular class or antibiotic for outpatient oral therapy for this age. Objective: This study aimed to determine current oral antibiotic prescribing practices for UTIs in children aged 2 months to 2 years and to analyze treatment failure by antibiotic type. Methods :We conducted a retrospective cohort study including patients ages 2 mon ths to 2 years presenting to our tertiary care pediatric emergency department (ED) between 2010 -2017. We included children with a laboratory -confirmed UTI (defined as urinanalysis positive and >50,000 colony forming units of a single pathogen) who were pre scribed an antibiotic at discharge. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as an antibiotic change or a UTI -related return ED visit within 30 days of the index ED visit. Sensitivity analyses excluded patients with a history of urological compli cations and limited to patients receiving intravenous (IV) antibiotics during their initial encounter. Differences in treatment failure by antibiotic type were assessed using chi -square tests and t -tests; time trends were analyzed using Cochran -Armitage te sts. Results: A total of 754 patients met inclusion criteria; 88% of UTIs were due to Escherichia coli and 38 (5%) had a history of urological Antibiotics to 2017, the proportion of patients prescribed cefdinir significantly increased from 39% to 90% (p<0.001). The 165 (22%) patients with treatment failure di d not significantly differ demographically from patients without treatment failure. Treatment failure was highest for patients prescribed trimethoprim/sufamethoxaxole (43%) and lowest among patients prescribed cefdinir (18%) or cefprozil (16%) (p=0.0003, F ig. 1); results were similar excluding patients with urological complications. Among 257 patients given IV antibiotics, 61 (37%) experienced treatment failure with no difference found by antibiotic type prescribed. Conclusions: Among children aged 2 months to 2 years, acute UTI treatment failure was lowest among children given cefprozil and cefdinir. We did not fi nd evidence that IV antibiotics during the initial ED encounter prevented treatment failure. Figure 1.

Homozygous Deletion within Exon 5 of DNAL1 in a Patient with Primary Ciliary Temme, R. by otosinopulmonary symptoms, laterality defects and infertility. PCD is known to be caused by loss -of-function mutations in more than 30 genes that play a critical role in the structure and/or function of motile cilia. Establishing a diagnosis can be difficult, often requiring multiple tests including molecular studies, ciliary ult rastructure analysis and/or nasal nitric oxide (nNO) testing, and as a result we continue to learn more about the phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity of this condition. Case Report: We present the case of a 9 year -old female who initially presented with respiratory distress and pneumonia at ~1 month of age, with hospital admission requiring prolonged intubation with several failed extubations. The patient was hospitalized at 2, 3 and 4 months of age for respiratory concerns. Ciliary biopsy was obtained via bronchoscopy at 1 month of age and ciliary ultrastructure showed a normal 9 + 2 structure. However, the dynein arms varied in size, with outer arms occasionally appearing small or ab sent, suggesting a possible outer dynein arm defect. Clinical history includes chronic otorrhea requiring multiple sets of PE tubes, chronic rhinitis, daily wet cough and bronchiectasis. Her clinical symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for PCD. Nasal nit ric oxide testing performed at age 8 years was 19.2 nl/min (right) and 19.0 nl/min (left), also consistent with a diagnosis of PCD. DNA testing, which, at the time, included a 30 -gene next generation sequencing panel revealed a homozygous deletion of DNAL1 exon 5. While this deletion is expected to result in the loss of DNAL1 function, it was interpreted as a Variant of Uncertain Significance due to limited evidence in the literature supporting a causal relationship between loss of DNAL1 and PCD. Discussi on: This patient's symptoms and diagnostic testing support the diagnosis of PCD. Interestingly, a homozygous deletion of exon 5 within the DNAL1 gene was detected. This deletion creates a premature translational stop signal and is expected to result in a c omplete loss of DNAL1 protein function. The DNAL1 protein has been shown to bind to DNAH5, and DNAH5 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in patients with PCD. To date, a single rare homozygous missense variant (p.Asn150Ser) in DNAL1 has been shown to segregate with PCD in 3 affected individuals from two families. Our case adds to the published literature of potentially pathogenic mutations within DNAL1 , and further supports the assertion that biallelic loss -of-function mutations in DNAL1 cause PCD. In addition, this study highlights the importance of correlating clinical information with molecular results, especially in the context of a variant of uncertain clinical significance. 42. In U tero AAV -Based G enome -Editing to Cure a Mouse Model of Human Hereditary Tyrosinemia T ype 1 VanLith, C.J., Nicolas, C.T, Allen, Lillegard, J.B. In utero gene therapy is an advanced approach that offers significant advantages over postnatal therapy. In utero gene therapy for liver disease can be curative while also addressing liver disease before any clinical consequences occur. In addition, the liver is an ideal organ for gene therapy in utero due to its easy access and rapid growth. We show here for the first time that in utero gene editing can cure a mouse model of liver disease \u2014in this case, hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HT1). Two AAV vectors expressing S. aureus Cas9 with gRNAs and a 1.2kb homology repair template were developed to correct the point mutation in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) -deficient mice. We performed fetal intrahepatic injections of both vectors in Fah-/- mice at E15\u00b11. Pups wer e withdrawn from 2 -(2-nitro -4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl) -1,3- cyclohexanedione (NTBC) at the time of weaning (21 days) and were weighed daily for NTBC -independent growth. Dosed mice demonstrated the presence of FAH positive cells in the liver at birth (3.99%) and showed healthy NTBC -independent growth after weaning, with many animals requiring no NTBC therapy. By 70 days of life all animals were phenotypically cured, with complete liver repopulation by FAH -positive hepatocytes and normal plasma tyrosine levels. The cure was durable when followed to 186 days of life. This report is the first ever to use in utero AAV -based genome editing to cure a mouse model of a human disease and acts as a proof -of-concept approach that would prevent liver damage, neurological crises, and noncompliance issues in HT1 patients. 35 | P a g e 43. Ex V ivo Hepatocyte Reprograming Promotes Homology Directed DNA Repair to Correct Metabolic Disease in Mice After T ransplantation Caitlin J. VanLith, Rebekah M. Guthman, Clara T. Nicolas, Kari L. Allen, Yuanhang Liu, Jennifer A. Chilton, Zachariah P. Tritz, Scott L. Nyberg, Robert A Kaiser, Raymond D. Hickey, Joseph B. Lillegard Ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9 -mediated gene editing in hepatocytes using homology directed repair (HDR) is a potential alternativ e curative therapy to organ transplantation for metabolic liver disease. However, a major limitation of this approach in quiescent adult primary hepatocytes is that non -homologous end joining is the predominant DNA repair pathway for double strand breaks ( DSB). This study explored the hypothesis that ex vivo hepatocyte culture could reprogram hepatocytes RNA sequencing - and flow cytometry demonstrated that within 24h, primary mous e hepatocytes in ex vivo monolayer culture decreased metabolic functions and increased expression of genes related to mitosis progression and HDR. Despite the downregulation of hepatocyte function genes, hepatocytes cultured for up to 72h could robustly en graft in vivo . To assess functionality long -term, primary hepatocytes from a mouse model of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) bearing a single point mutation were transduced ex vivo with two adeno -associated viral (AAV) vectors to deliver the Cas9 nuclea se, target guide RNAs, and a 1.2kb homology template. AAV -Cas9 induced robust cutting at the target locus, and, upon delivery of the repair template, precise correction of the point mutation occurred by HDR. Edited hepatocytes were transplanted into recipi ent fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase knockout ( Fah-/-) mice, resulting in engraftment, robust proliferation, and prevention of liver failure. Weight gain and biochemical assessment revealed normalization of metabolic function. Conclusion : The results of thi s study demonstrate the potential therapeutic effect of ex vivo hepatocyte -directed gene editing after reprogramming to cure metabolic disease in a preclinical model of HT1. 44. In U tero Lentiviral Gene Delivery to Cure a Mouse M odel of Human H ereditary Tyrosinemia Type 1 VanLith, C.J., Nicolas, C.T., Kaiser, R.A., Hickey, R.D., Lillegard, J.B. In utero gene therapy is an advanced approach that offers significant advantages over postnatal therapy. In utero gene therapy for liver di sease can be curative while also addressing liver disease before any clinical consequences occur. In addition, the liver is an ideal organ for gene therapy in utero due to its easy access, rapid growth, and immune privilege. Transduction and biodistributio n experiments using a lentiviral or luciferase showed 6.9% hepatocyte transduction at birth with biodistribution limited to the fetal liver and maternal uterus, indicating this would be a viable approach to curing some metabolic diseases. We show here for the first time that in utero lentiviral gene delivery can cure a mouse model of liver disease \u2014in this case, hereditary tyrosinemia type I. A lentiviral vector expressing the human Fah gene under the alpha -1 antitrypsin promoter was developed compensate for the mutant fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase ( Fah) in the mouse model. We performed fetal intrahepatic injections of the vector at a dose of 1x107 -1x108 TU/fetus in Fah-/- mice trifluoromethylbenzoyl) -1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC) at the time of weaning (21 days) and were weighed daily for NTBC - independent growth. Treated mice showed healthy NTBC -independent growth after weaning as compared to control Fah- /- animals, w ith many treated animals requiring no NTBC therapy. By 50 days of life, animals were phenotypically cured, with complete liver repopulation by FAH -positive hepatocytes and normal plasma tyrosine and liver enzyme levels. In conclusion, lentivirus -based gene delivery is a viable treatment for hereditary tyrosinemia type I in mice, leading to phenotypic, histological, and biochemical correction of the condition. 45. In Utero Liver -Directed Lentiviral Gene Therapy Cures a P ig Model of Hereditary Tyrosinemia Type 1 VanLith, C.J., Nicolas, C.T., J.B. In utero gene therapy is an advanced approach that offers significant advantages over postnatal therapy. In liver disease, it can be curative while also addressing disease before any clinical consequences occur. We show here for the first time that 36 | P a g e in utero gene therapy can cure a large animal model of liver disease, in this case hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HT1). We perfor med ultrasound -guided intrahepatic injections of a lentiviral vector carrying the human fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase ( Fah) gene under the alpha -1 antitrypsin promoter in 16 Fah-/- pig fetuses at E70\u00b15. Doses ranged from 2.4x10E8 to 1.6x10E9 transducing un its/fetus. Sows were maintained protective drug, 2 -(2-nitro -4- trifluoromethylbenzoyl) -1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC), throughout gestation, and piglets were maintained on NTBC until weaning. Sixteen treated and seventeen control Fah-/- piglets were bor n from four pregnancies. Six treated piglets were euthanized for early data collection, and five died from complications due to surrogate sows. Positive FAH immunohistochemistry was seen at birth. Remaining treated piglets and control littermates are being followed long -term, and all treated piglets have demonstrated NTBC -independent growth. Liver biopsies at 50 days of life show expansion of FAH+ hepatocytes with no evidence of fibrosis, cirrhosis, or HCC. Liver biopsies at 6 months show near complete repo pulation of the liver with FAH+ hepatocytes. Plasma tyrosine levels in dosed animals have normalized. Lentiviral integration was seen in only one of 4 sows and in the liver, as well as several other tissues, in treated piglets and shows a benign integratio n profile. This report is the first ever to use in utero gene therapy to cure a large animal model of a human liver disease. 46. The Use of Simulation and Deliberate Practice for Administration of Epinephrine, Effective Chest Compressions, and Other Essen tial Lifesaving Skills In a Cardiac Arrest Simulation Scenario Christine Willett, MSN, Kendra Gram, MD, Mike Finch, PhD, & Karen Mathias, MSN, CNS Introduction: Literature describes the correlation between timely and effective code role interventions and improved patient outcomes (Anderson et al., 2015; American Heart Association, 2015). Mastery of code role skills, the critical thinking to promptly recognize and respond to patient deterioration, and implementation of these skills in various patient care and team settings are fundamental elements of code role performance. This pilot study was conducted to investigate the effect of role and task -specific education v ia simulation and deliberate practice on nurses' expertise and automaticity with performing essential code role skills. Methods: 20 pediatric advanced life support (PALS) trained nurse volunteers were recruited and randomly assigned to the role of medica tions or compressions during a bradycardic arrest scenario. Baseline measures of time to preparation and administration of epi, and time to initiation of chest compressions were recorded during the first simulation. After deliberate practice of the specifi c code role skills of medication preparation, compressions and bag/mask ventilations study participants were then assigned the same code role during their participation in a second bradycardic arrest simulation scenario. Results: Paired t -test analysis r evealed statistically significant reductions in time to availability and administration of epinephrine and initiation of chest compressions with a p value of < .05. The data revealed a decrease in time to compressions with a heart rate of 60 decreased by 5 4%. The time interval between assignment to the medication role and the availability of a dose of epinephrine was decreased by 27%. The time a dose of epinephrine was ordered by the provider to the time the dose was ready decreased by 84%. The time the epi nephrine dose was ordered until it was administered to the patient decreased by 49%. Conclusion: The results of this pilot indicate that simulation and deliberate practice is an effective strategy for code role training. 47. Does Acetic Acid Solution D ecrease Trach Stoma Site Infections Compared to Sterile Water When U sed as a Daily C leaning Task for P atients with Tracheostomy Tube Under One Year of A ge? Teresa Zustiak AE-C, NPS Background: Procedures for cleaning pediatric tracheostomy stoma sites vary. The solution used often varies based on surgeon preference, and may include sterile water or 25% acetic acid. Surgeons were asked why they preferred a particular solution and indicated it was often based on the guidance of a mentor during their training. Complications of stoma site 37 | P a g e infections cause increased discomfort, possible longer length of stay, increased medication use, additional consults, and possible respiratory tract infections. To determine best practice and standardize care around cleaning solutions, Google Scholar, CINAHL, and Cochran were searched and no relevant publications were found. Practice guidelines based on consensus statements and expert opinions were available, but no research studies within the last five years were found. Method: A research study utilizing a retrospective chart review was completed. Inclusion criteria were children under one year of age who had a tracheostomy tube placed in the last five years at our institution. The age limit narrows the study to the most common patient population who receive a trach tube. Data were collected from the first 30 days after a tracheostomy procedure to limit extraneous variables. This included 102 patients. Children's Minnesota IRB approval was obtained. Initial orders for trach site cleaning were reviewed. Nursing narrative notes, Progress notes from providers, along with nursing descriptions of the stoma site during cleaning were reviewed for signs of infection. The symptoms searched for included redness, rash, odor, increased secretions, and any other unusual tissue observations. Results: There was a statistically significant increase of infections to the patient if 25% acetic acid was not used as the daily stoma cl eaning agent. Barriers to data collection were inconsistent nursing narrative notes. Other factors that could have contributed to infection include improper hand washing, and frequency of tube changes. Conclusion: 25% Acetic acid significantly reduces infection at trach stoma sites when compared to using sterile water or saline. The research showed about a 30% higher chance of infections if not using acetic acid as daily cleaning agent. The cost of using acetic acid is the same as using sterile water or saline. No negative side effects were seen by using 25% acetic acid daily in this study. "}
