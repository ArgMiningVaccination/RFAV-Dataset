Commonly cultivated for its culinary uses, the plant can now be found worldwide. In Ancient Greece, tarragon leaf was chewed to relieve oral pain caused by many different ailments such as gum inflammation. Tarragon has been used to stimulate menstruation and alleviate the pain that can come with a period. This plant can also aid in lowering blood sugar levels, as it increases insulin sensitivity. Terragon is associated with the goddess Artemis, which is what its botanical name Artemisia is derived from. Traditionally, tarragon was cooked into dishes and fed to guests to make them feel comfortable and welcome in your home, and this is likely due to the plant's soporific effects - leaving a feeling of calm in those who consume it. One common use of tarragon in magical practices is for banishing. Typically, the ritual entails writing the desired banishment on parchment, sprinkling tarragon on said parchment, folding the paper three times away from oneself, and finally burning the folded parchment to complete the ritual. **Always consult a physician before using herbal products, especially if you are pregnant, nursing, or on any medication(s).
