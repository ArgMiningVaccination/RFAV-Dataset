This is grand self-admiring body that is reluctant to make itself accountable to the public and press. Answers were sought to the question, 'Did the WHO cry wolf and frighten the world unnecessarily?' The Council of Europe represents 800 million people in 47 countries. While we MPs can question the conduct of our own domestic governments. only an international body like the COE can tackle the WHO. This morning, a Council of Europe Committee held its [ first session on the swine flu pandemic](mms://coenews.coe.int/vod/20100126_05_e.wm) 'that never was.' There was huge interest from the press who excelled in their sharp questioning in a subsequent press conference. I was very happy to be appointed the rapporteur for this subject. It will be my job to write the report that will eventually be presented to the full Council of Europe for approval. I told Dr Keiji Fukuda, Special Adviser on Pandemic Influenza to the Director-General, (WHO) that his contribution was disappointing. Not a word of regret or apology. After all, they had frightened the world with the threat of deaths on a massive scale. Subsequent events prove that this fear-mongering was unjustified. The other consequences were \u00a3billions spent on unneeded vaccines and a disruption of health services worldwide. Dr Luc Hessel, represented the European Vaccine Manufacturers who have made several fortunes out of selling Swine Flu Vaccines. He confirmed that the Pharmas invested $4 Billion in preparations for the [ Swine Flu Pandemic beforehand. They had a vested interest in exaggerating the seriousness of the illness. That investment would have been in vain if the world had not been galvanised with fear.](https://paulflynnmp.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8346d963f69e2012877148129970c-pi) Dr Wolfgang Wodarg, medical expert specialising in epidemiology and former Chair of the Sub-committee on Health of the COE called for this inquiry. He made a powerful case on the potential problems of vaccines that had not been sufficiently tested. He charge that the composition of the medicines was determined by the need to make money from patents rather than the well-being of patients Professor Emeritus Dr. Ulrich Keil, University Professor and Director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Epidemiology of the University of M\u00fcnster fully supported the case presented by Doctor Wodarg. The UK Government came out of the hearing with some credit. We were one of the few countries that urged the WHO to water down their terrifying warnings of a health holocaust. Health secretary of State Alan Johnstone made a plea to moderate the message to avoid public hysteria. I promised that I will act as rapporteur and report on the scientific principles in examining evidence objectively. I look forward to the work. the WHO has served the world well in the past by eliminating smallpox and reducing the effects of other major diseases. I hope they learn a little humility and express some contrition. Otherwise trust is this vital force in world health will crumble. (Thanks to David Tarlo for the pictures) Popish plot? One delicious rumour that is circulating in Strasbourg is that the Pope has intervened in the election of Committee chairpeople here. Up for grabs was the chair of the powerful Politics Committee. One of Berlesconi's acolytes was up for the job. It is claimed the Papal Nuncio conveyed the Pope's view that the Italian should get the job. He did. A few months ago the candidates campaigned for superior morals throughout Europe. He could make a start with own leader. "}
