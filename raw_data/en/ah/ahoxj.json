This spiritual meditation for mind-body healing continues to get rave reviews from grateful listeners. Counselor, therapist and spiritual coach Lynne Newman consistently garners enthusiastic word-of-mouth praise for her extraordinarily affirming and empowering guided imagery. Guided imagery is a holistic, mind-body technique that consists of healing words and hypnotic images, set to soothing music, to provide healing, growth and change. Repeated listening once or twice a day for 2-3 weeks ensures maximum impact.
