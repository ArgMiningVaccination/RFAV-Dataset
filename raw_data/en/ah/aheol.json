Her extensive experience in those research areas includes her role as a Principal Investigator of numerous projects and the publication of hundreds of journal articles, book chapters and professional reports. Dr. Reynolds is working on several projects, including one in which she joins UA engineers to apply lasers to detect human viruses in drinking water. This type of technology would not only expedite the process of discovering water-borne viruses, but it could detect viruses that were previously undetectable. Between 1971 and 2000 in the United States, water-borne pathogens resulted in nearly 600,000 cases of illness. Dr. Reynolds suspects that millions of cases were undocumented because people who were affected suffered relatively minor symptoms. She is also the Principal Investigator of two other projects, which looks for contaminants in the water supply and in the home. In the water study, Dr. Reynolds aims to assess the risk of tap water by analyzing the types of disease-causing organisms captured in the filters of water vending machines. In the home hygiene study, Dr. Reynolds is monitoring the Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the home by identifying the bacteria's survival in soft surfaces, including carpets and towels. The MRSA bacteria could cause severe skin infections and result in hospitalizations, or rarely death. Dr. Reynolds hopes that her research yields information that people will use in order to reduce their risk of illness. \"From a scientist's point of view, we can continue to develop and improve methods to identify hazards\" she said. But that information only goes so far if the public doesn't actively participate in reducing their exposure. Dr. Reynolds received her doctorate degree from the University of Arizona in agriculture and life sciences in the Department of Soil, Water and Environmental Science, and a master's degree from the University of South Florida in Department of Environmental and Occupational Health. She has previously worked as a research technician, research fellow and an assistant research scientist at the UA since 1987.

The high population densities and the infrastructure required to support these high populations generate unique environmental and human health issues. Managing urban development in a sustainable manner will be key to improving and maintaining human well-being while preserving environmental quality. This issue of sustainable urban development is one of the most critical issues of the 21st century. This chapter will present some of the major environment-related issues associated with urban areas. - Reynolds, K. A. (2019).

The chapter presents a general description of their major structural features and functions that are related to the field of environmental microbiology. Analysis of 16S rRNA has led to the modern classification of living things into a three-domain system consisting of archaea, eucarya, and bacteria. The bacteria are the least structurally complex of the microorganisms with a single large circular chromosome located in the cytoplasm and without any compartmentalization of the cell, which offers the greatest metabolic flexibility. Archaea are somewhat similar to bacteria in size and shape, but they are genetically and biochemically quite different and may be the oldest form of life on Earth. Eukaryotes possess membrane-bound organelles in addition to a cytoplasmic membrane that is composed of a phospholipid bilayer with interspersed proteins for transport and degradation. Fungi, are a physically larger group of eucaryotic microorganisms and can be divided into three groups: molds, mushrooms, and yeasts. Fungi are extremely important in the degradation and recycling of dead plant, insect, and animal biomass. Protozoa are eukaryotic microorganisms that are important environmentally because they serve as the foundation of the food chain in many aquatic ecosystems. Algae are a group of single-celled or complex multi-cellular eucaryotic oxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms that sustain the food web in many aquatic environments. Viruses\u2014prokaryotic or eukaryotic\u2014are a group of biological entities that consist of a nucleic acid encapsulated within a protein coat and are obligate parasites of a range of bacteria and other living organisms. Viroids and prions are subviral particles that cause diseases in plants and animals respectively. - Hurst, C. J., Reynolds, K. A., & Reynolds, K. A. (2007). Detection of viruses in environmental waters, sewage, and sewage sludges.. In .) Manual of Environmental Microbiology. Third Edition. American Society of Microbiology. doi:10.1128/9781555815882.CH23 [More info](#more-chapter4)This chapter describes techniques that can be used for concentrating human enteric viruses from environmental water, drinking water, raw wastewater, wastewater sludges, and wastewater effluents. The chapter presents the use of cartridge filter-based methods for concentrating viruses from environmental water, drinking water, and sewage effluent. The methods presented in this chapter for isolating viruses from raw sewage (raw wastewater) and wastewater sludges effectively utilize a process of directed adsorption and elution but differ in that they rely upon the wastewater solids to serve as an in situ adsorbent. A variety of sampling apparatuses may be needed when detecting viruses in environmental waters. The types of apparatus used for concentrating viruses from large volumes of environmental waters, drinking water, or sewage effluent by means of cartridge filtration are not standard equipment for most environmental microbiology laboratories. All of the cartridge filters described in the chapter can be presterilized within their holders by using ethylene oxide gas treatment before they are transported to the field. Objects less resistant to high heat, such as nonborosilicate glass and some polymer materials, can be surface sterilized by dousing or immersing them in commercial 95% ethanol and then igniting the alcohol with a flame. The infectivity of enteric viruses contained in environmental samples can be examined by inoculating the sample into cultures of either human or animal cells that are prepared in the laboratory as opposed to inoculating them into live animals. - Hurst, C. J., Reynolds, K. A., & Reynolds, K. A. (2007). Sampling Viruses from Soil. In Manual of Environmental Microbiology. Third Edition. American Society of Microbiology. doi:10.1128/9781555815882.CH50 [More info](#more-chapter5)This chapter focuses on the methodology used to detect animal viruses in samples of soil. This methodology generally relies on elution and subsequent concentration of viruses from the soil, after which either cytopathogenicity or plaque formation assays are used to detect the viruses. These assays are based on the use of cultured animal cells as hosts for viral replication. The chapter also describes the use of plaque formation methodology to detect bacteriophages, viruses which infect bacteria. Other types of assay procedures, such as those based on the PCR, have also been developed to detect viruses in soil samples. Many different types of apparatus can be used to collect soil samples. These range from spoons and spatulas to shovels and powered augers. The available options for suitable sample containers include wide-mouthed screw-cap plastic jars and zipper closure plastic bags. Soil samples should be kept chilled to reduce thermal inactivation of the viruses. Bacteriophages can be detected by direct assay of soil suspensions using a plaque formation technique. If the presence of soil particles in the assay causes a problem, either because the resulting turbidity obscures assessment of the results or the number of contaminating soil bacteria and fungi carried along with the soil particles complicates plaque enumeration, then the bacteriophages can be eluted from the soil particles and the eluate can be assayed. - Gerba, C.

Rapid, sensitive detection of PFOA with smartphone-based flow rate analysis utilizing competitive molecular interactions during capillary action. Journal of Hazardous Materials. doi:10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.130699 [More info](#more-journal-publication0)Perfluorinated-alkyl substances (PFAS) pose an unmet threat to the public because they are not strictly monitored and regulated. Perfluorinated-carbon alkyl chains (PFOA), a type of PFAS, at 70 fg/L is the current health and safety recommendation. Current testing methods for PFOA and PFAS chemicals include HPLC-MS/MS and molecularly imprinted polymers, which are expensive, time-consuming, and require training. In this work, PFOA and PFOS detection was performed on a paper microfluidic chip using competitive interactions between PFOA/PFOS, cellulose fibers, and various reagents (L-lysine, casein, and albumin). Such interactions altered the surface tension at the wetting front and, subsequently, the capillary flow rate. A smartphone captured the videos of this capillary action. The samples flowed through the channel in less than 2 min. Albumin worked the best in detecting PFOA, followed by casein. The detection limit was 10 ag/L in DI water and 1 fg/L in effluent (processed) wastewater. Specificity to other non-fluorocarbon surfactants was also tested, using anionic sodium dodecyl non-ionic Tween 20, and cationic cetrimonium bromide (CTAB). A combination of the reagents successfully distinguished PFOA from all three surfactants at 100% accuracy. This low-cost, handheld assay can be an accessible alternative for rapid in situ estimation of PFOA concentration. - Noakes, C. J., Reynolds, K. A., Wilcox, M., Dancer, S. J., Clifton, I., Sleigh, P.

Modeling fomite-mediated SARS-CoV-2 exposure through personal protective equipment doffing in a hospital environment.. Indoor air, 32(1), e12938. doi:10.1111/ina.12938 [More info](#more-journal-publication8)Self-contamination during doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE) is a concern for healthcare workers (HCW) following SARS-CoV-2-positive patient care. Staff may subconsciously become contaminated through improper glove removal; so, quantifying this exposure is critical for safe working procedures. HCW surface contact sequences on a respiratory ward were modeled using a discrete-time Markov chain for: IV-drip care, blood pressure monitoring, and doctors' rounds. Accretion of viral RNA on gloves during care was modeled using a stochastic recurrence relation. In the simulation, the HCW then doffed PPE and contaminated themselves in a fraction of cases based on increasing caseload. A parametric study was conducted to analyze the effect of: (1a) increasing patient numbers on the ward, (1b) the proportion of COVID-19 cases, (2) the length of a shift, and (3) the probability of touching contaminated PPE. The driving factors for the exposure were surface contamination and the number of surface contacts. The results simulate generally low viral exposures in most of the scenarios considered including on 100% COVID-19 positive wards, although this is where the highest self-inoculated dose is likely to occur with median 0.0305 viruses (95% CI =0-0.6 viruses). Dose correlates highly with surface contamination showing that this can be a determining factor for the exposure. The infection risk resulting from the exposure is challenging to estimate, as it will be influenced by the factors such as virus variant and vaccination rates. - Abrell, L. M., Reynolds, K.

Critical care explorations, 3(2), e0340. doi:10.1097/cce.0000000000000340 [More info](#more-journal-publication30)Healthcare surfaces contribute to nosocomial disease transmission. Studies show that despite standard guidelines and practices for cleaning and disinfection, secondary infection spread among healthcare workers and patients is common in ICUs. Manual terminal cleaning practices in healthcare are subject to highly variable results due to differences in training, compliance, and other inherent complexities. Standard cleaning practices combined with no-touch disinfecting technologies, however, may significantly lower nosocomial infection rates. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a whole-room, no-touch disinfection intervention to reduce the concentration and cross-contamination of surface bacteria when used in tandem with manual cleaning protocols..Bacterial tracers were seeded onto hospital room surfaces to quantitatively evaluate the efficacy of manual terminal cleaning practices alone and in tandem with a no-touch, whole-room atomization system. Cross-contamination potentials and labor efficiency were also evaluated..Environmental service personnel cleaning efficacy was evaluated pre and post application of manual terminal cleaning protocols alone and in tandem with a whole-room atomization system with an United States Environmental Protection Agency-registered hospital-grade hypochlorous acid disinfectant..The study was conducted in an unoccupied patient room at Banner University Medical Center in Tucson, AZ. The room was located in a newly constructed ICU suite..Manual terminal cleaning averaged a 2.4 log10 reduction in seeded bacterial counts compared with a 4.9 average and up to a 6 log10 reduction with tandem cleaning. Cross-contamination among surfaces following terminal cleaning alone was documented in 50% of the samples compared with 0% with tandem cleaning, with the latter achieving a 64% improvement in manual labor efficiency..The use of whole-room atomized disinfection with terminal cleaning protocols lowered manual labor times, improved disinfection outcomes, and eliminated the transfer of bacterial pathogens in healthcare environments. - Sexton, J.

Journal of applied microbiology, 130(1), 25-39. doi:10.1111/jam.14796 [More info](#more-journal-publication31)Numerous studies are published on the benefits of electric hand dryers vs paper towels (PT) for drying hands after washing. Data are conflicting and lacking key variables needed to assess infection risks. We provide a rapid scoping review on hand-drying methods relative to hygiene and health risks. Controlled vocabulary terms and keywords were used to search PubMed (1946-2018) and Embase (1947-2018). Multiple researchers independently screened abstracts for relevance using predetermined criteria and created a quality assessment scoring system for relative study comparisons. Of 293 papers, 23 were included in the final analysis. Five studies did not compare multiple methods; however, 2 generally favoured electric dryers (ED); 7 preferred PT; and 9 had mixed or statistically insignificant results (among these, 3 contained scenarios favourable to ED, 4 had results supporting PT, and the remaining studies had broadly conflicting results). Results were mixed among and within studies and many lacked consistent design or statistical analysis. The breadth of data does not favour one method as being more hygienic. However, some authors extended generalizable recommendations without sufficient scientific evidence. The use of tools in quantitative microbial risk assessment is suggested to evaluate health exposure potentials and risks relative to hand-drying methods. We found no data to support any human health claims associated with hand-drying methods. Inconclusive and conflicting results represent data gaps preventing the advancement of hand-drying policy or practice recommendations. - Suppes, L., Canales, R. A., Gerba, C. P., & Reynolds, K. A.

Our aim was to develop a model predicting pathogen exposures for patients utilizing wheelchairs and estimate exposure reduction potential of wheelchair disinfection between rides..An agent-based model was informed by wheelchair location data from a connected 215-bed acute care and 250-bed long-term care facility. Simulated scenarios varied in frequencies of patient wheelchair contamination and wheelchair disinfection in between trips. Clostridioides difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus concentrations on patient hands at the end of wheelchair trips were estimated. Exposure reductions due to disinfection, assuming low real-world efficacies (50%, 70%, and 90%), were compared..In the simulation, when few patients introduced contamination to wheelchairs, disinfection in between patients 50% of the time decreased baseline (no disinfection) estimated exposures for the 50th wheelchair rider by >99.999%. When patients had a 50% chance of being contaminated before the wheelchair ride, disinfection did not reduce exposures consistently..The efficacy of disinfection in between patient rides as an exposure mitigation strategy likely depends on the frequency of infected patient wheelchair use..During outbreak, high contamination conditions, disinfection, alone, is not enough to protect patients from wheelchair-mediated exposures. - Wilson, A.

Few studies describe children's hand-to-eye or -nose contacts or adults' hand-to-face contacts. The study objective was to characterize hand-to-head (mouth, eyes, nose, and other) contacts for children in a daycare and adults in multiple locations. Macro-activities and sequences of hand-to-face contacts were recorded for 263 people observed for 30 min each. Statistically significant differences between locations, males and females, adults and children, and during eating and non-eating macro-activities were evaluated. Discrete Markov chains were fit to observed contact sequences and compared among adults and children during eating and non-eating macro-activities. No significant differences in contact frequency were observed between males and females with the exception of hand-to-nose contacts. Children tended to touch the mouth, eyes, and nose more frequently than adults during non-eating macro-activities. Significant differences in contact frequency were observed between locations. Transitional probabilities indicated that children make repetitive mouth, eye, and nose contacts while adults frequently transition to contacts of the head other than the mouth, eyes, or nose. More data are needed to evaluate the effect of age on adults' contact frequencies and to confirm lack of statistically significant differences between adults and children during eating macro-activities. - Wilson, A.

The study objective was to estimate infection risks per transport for first responders and quantify how first responder use of N95 respirators and patient use of cloth masks can reduce these risks. A model was developed for two Scenarios: an ambulance transport with a patient actively emitting a virus in small aerosols that could lead to airborne transmission (Scenario 1) and a subsequent transport with the same respirator or mask use conditions, an uninfected patient; and remaining airborne SARS-CoV-2 and contaminated surfaces due to aerosol deposition from the previous transport (Scenario 2). A compartmental Monte Carlo simulation model was used to estimate the dispersion and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent infection risks for first responders, accounting for variability and uncertainty in input parameters (i.e., transport duration, transfer efficiencies, SARS-CoV-2 emission rates from infected patients, etc.). Infection risk distributions and changes in concentration on hands and surfaces over time were estimated across sub-Scenarios of first responder respirator use and patient cloth mask use. For Scenario 1, predicted mean infection risks were reduced by 69%, 48%, and 85% from a baseline risk (no respirators or face masks used) of 2.9 \u00d7 10-2 \u00b1 3.4 \u00d7 10-2 when simulated first responders wore respirators, the patient wore a cloth mask, and when first responders and the patient wore respirators or a cloth mask, respectively. For Scenario 2, infection risk reductions for these same Scenarios were 69%, 50%, and 85%, respectively (baseline risk of 7.2 \u00d7 10-3 \u00b1 1.0 \u00d7 10-2). While aerosol transmission routes contributed more to viral dose in Scenario 1, our simulations demonstrate the ability of face masks worn by patients to additionally reduce surface transmission by reducing viral deposition on surfaces. Based on these simulations, we recommend the patient wear a face mask and first responders wear respirators, when possible, and disinfection should prioritize high use equipment. - Wilson, A.

Understanding exposure mechanisms will inform exposure mitigation interventions. The study objective was to evaluate the influences of hospital patient room layout on differences in HCPs' predicted hand contamination from deposited norovirus particles. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations of a hospital patient room were investigated to find differences in spatial deposition patterns of bioaerosols for right-facing and left-facing bed layouts under different ventilation conditions. A microbial transfer model underpinned by observed mock care for three care types (intravenous therapy (IV) care, observational care, and doctors' rounds) was applied to estimate HCP hand contamination. Viral accruement was contrasted between room orientation, care type, and by assumptions about whether bioaerosol deposition was the same or variable by room orientation. Differences in sequences of surface contacts were observed for care type and room orientation. Simulated viral accruement differences between room types were influenced by mostly by differences in bioaerosol deposition and by behavior sequences when deposition patterns for the room orientations were similar. Differences between care types were likely driven by differences in hand-to-patient contact frequency, with doctors' rounds resulting in the greatest predicted viral accruement on hands. - Wilson, A.

Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, 41. doi:10.1017/ice.2020.1150 [More info](#more-journal-publication60)Background: Wheelchairs can contribute to healthcare-associated infection transmission due to direct contact with patients and healthcare workers and due to wide spatial movement in facilities. Objective: We utilized location data of a wheelchair to inform an agent-based model for estimating the contribution of a single contaminated patient ride in a wheelchair to subsequent environmental contamination and to estimate the potential for wheelchair disinfection between patients to disrupt this spread. Methods: The destination and origin of wheelchairs were tracked in several facility locations: specialty care services, long-term care, radiology, acute care, common spaces, domiciliary, and outpatient clinics. An agent-based model was developed in which the probability of the wheelchair traveling directly from one location to another was informed by wheelchair origin and destination data. We assumed that the first patient's hands were contaminated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For each patient trip, each simulated patient made contact with the wheelchair arm rests and a surface in the destination location. To evaluate potential exposures of uninfected patients, all patients riding in the wheelchair after the contaminated patient were assumed to be uncontaminated. In total, 50 patient rides were simulated. The concentration and number of contaminated surfaces in each hospital area were compared in addition to the average concentration of MRSA on patient hands over time. The intervention simulation involved a disinfection of wheelchair armrests with 90%, 70%, or 50% efficacy. Results: The 3 areas that had the largest estimated number of contaminated surfaces after 50 wheelchair trips following the first patient assumed to be infected were specialty care services, long-term care, and acute care. This finding was consistent with the paths that were most frequented by the wheelchair. Without cleaning between patients, the fiftieth patient to use the wheelchair had an average MRSA concentration of 41.5 CFU/cm2. With cleaning between patients, assuming a 50% cleaning efficacy, average MRSA concentration on the hands for the fiftieth patient was reduced to 7.4 \u00d710-14 CFU/cm2. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that cleaning, even with efficacies as low as 50%, may protect patients using contaminated wheelchairs from potential pathogen exposures. This study also demonstrates that tracking portable equipment can be useful not only for exposure modeling but also for predicting where the largest number of surfaces contaminated via portable equipment routes may be found. Future steps include performing a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of spatial assumptions. Funding: None Disclosures: None - Verhougstraete, M., Reynolds, K.

[More info](#more-journal-publication61)Microbial contamination of drinking water post-municipal treatment is difficult to predict as a risk factor for human health. One method to reduce morbidity or mortality from unpredictable exposures is through point-of-use (POU) treatment devices. The goal of this project was to assess the cost-benefit of POU water treatment at the tap in terms of protection from microbes in drinking water. This project estimated: (1) incidence of acute illness (AI), sequela, and mortality associated with waterborne pathogens; (2) illness reduction rates from using POU devices; and (3) healthcare cost reductions associated with POU devices. Infection rates and costs associated with 10 of the most common waterborne pathogens were identified and used to calculate national annual costs. We estimated 9M AI, 0.6M sequela, and 1,400 mortality cases that occur annually in the USA from these pathogens. The greatest cost-benefit was seen when considering the totality of disease burden reduction (AI, sequela, and mortality) including all pathogens at a national level and applying a 35% infection reduction, resulting in a total cost per averted disease case of $1,815. This study suggests that it is cost-beneficial to prevent water-related illness using POU devices. - Wilson, A. M., Abney, S. E., King, M. F., Weir, M. H., L\u00f3pez-Garc\u00eda, M., Sexton, J.

[More info](#more-journal-publication63)Current microbial exposure models assume that microbial exchange follows a concentration gradient during hand-to-surface contacts. Our objectives were to evaluate this assumption using transfer efficiency experiments and to evaluate a model's ability to explain concentration changes using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) on these experimental data. Experiments were conducted with two phages (MS2, X174) simultaneously to study bidirectional transfer. Concentrations on the fingertip and surface were quantified before and after fingertip-to-surface contacts. Prior distributions for surface and fingertip swabbing efficiencies and transfer efficiency were used to estimate concentrations on the fingertip and surface post contact. To inform posterior distributions, Euclidean distances were calculated for predicted detectable concentrations (log PFU cm) on the fingertip and surface post contact in comparison with experimental values. To demonstrate the usefulness of posterior distributions in calibrated model applications, posterior transfer efficiencies were used to estimate rotavirus infection risks for a fingertip-to-surface and subsequent fingertip-to-mouth contact. Experimental findings supported the transfer gradient assumption. Through ABC, the model explained concentration changes more consistently when concentrations on the fingertip and surface were similar. Future studies evaluating microbial transfer should consider accounting for differing fingertip-to-surface and surface-to-fingertip transfer efficiencies and extend this work for other microbial types. - Wilson, A.

Norovirus is a good example with a minimum infectious dose as low as a few tens of virions, that is, below femtogram scale. Norovirus detection from commonly implicated environmental matrices (water and food) involves complicated concentration of viruses and/or amplification of the norovirus genome, thus rendering detection approaches not feasible for field applications. In this work, norovirus detection was performed on a microfluidic paper analytic device without using any sample concentration or nucleic acid amplification steps by directly imaging and counting on-paper fluorescent submicron image-processing algorithm isolated the particles aggregated by antibody-antigen binding, leading to an extremely low limit of norovirus detection, as low as 1 genome copy/L in deionized water and 10 genome copies/L in reclaimed wastewater. - Gerba, C.

The U.S. government does not regulate contaminants in private wells. The goals of this study were to investigate the quality of drinking water from unregulated private wells within one mile (1.6 kilometers) of an effluent-dominated river in the arid Southwest, determine differences in contaminant levels between wet and dry seasons, and identify contributions from human sources by specifically measuring man-made organic contaminants (perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfate (PFOS), and sucralose). Samples were collected during two dry seasons and two wet seasons over the course of two years and analyzed for microbial (Escherichia coli), inorganic (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, synthetic (PFOA, PFOS, and sucralose) contaminants. Arsenic, nitrate, and Escherichia coli concentrations exceeded their respective regulatory levels of 0.01 mg/L, 10 mg/L, and 1 colony forming unit (CFU)/100 mL, respectively. The measured concentrations of PFOA and PFOS exceeded the respective Public Health Advisory level. Arsenic, PFOA, PFOS, and sucralose were significantly higher during the dry seasons, whereas E. coli was higher during the wet seasons. While some contaminants were correlated (e.g., As and Hg = 0.87; PFOA and PFOS = 0.45), the lack of correlation between different contaminant types indicates that they may arise from different sources.

The bacteriophage and chemical dye indicate highest environmental contamination nearest the HCWs and both tracers could be appropriate for PPE disposal training..HCWs use gloves every workday and potentially could contaminate surrounding surfaces and floors, during improper disposal practices. Therefore, proper disposal techniques are required to minimize pathogen transmission by establishing industry-wide policies, adequate training, and education to HCWs. - Verhougstraete, M., Pogreba Brown, K.

Applied and environmental microbiology, 84(18). doi:10.1128/aem.00709-18 [More info](#more-journal-publication92)Nosocomial viral infections are an important cause of health care-acquired infections where fomites have a role in transmission. Using stochastic modeling to quantify the effects of surface disinfection practices on nosocomial pathogen exposures and infection risk can inform cleaning practices. The purpose of this study was to predict the effect of surface disinfection on viral infection risks and to determine needed viral reductions to achieve risk targets. Rotavirus, rhinovirus, and influenza A virus infection risks for two cases were modeled. Case 1 utilized a single fomite contact approach, while case 2 assumed 6 h of contact activities. A 94.1% viral reduction on surfaces and hands was measured following a single cleaning round using an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered disinfectant in an urgent care facility. This value was used to model the effect of a surface disinfection intervention on infection risk. Risk reductions for other surface-cleaning efficacies were also simulated. Surface reductions required to achieve risk probability targets were estimated. Under case 1 conditions, a 94.1% reduction in virus surface concentration reduced infection risks by 94.1%. Under case 2 conditions, a 94.1% reduction on surfaces resulted in median viral infection risks being reduced by 92.96 to 94.1% and an influenza A virus infection risk below one in a million. Surface concentration in the equations was highly correlated with dose and infection risk outputs. For rotavirus and rhinovirus, a >99.99% viral surface reduction would be needed to achieve a one-in-a-million risk target. This study quantifies reductions of infection risk relative to surface disinfectant use and demonstrates that risk targets for low-infectious-dose organisms may be more challenging to achieve.IMPORTANCE It is known that the use of EPA-registered surface disinfectant sprays can reduce infection risk if used according to the manufacturer's instructions. However, there are currently no standards for health care environments related to contamination levels on surfaces. The significance of this research is in quantifying needed reductions to meet various risk targets using realistic viral concentrations on surfaces for health care environments. This research informs the design of cleaning protocols by demonstrating that multiple applications may be needed to reduce risk and by highlighting a need for more models exploring the relationship among microbial contamination of surfaces, patient and health care worker behaviors, and infection risks. - Suppes, L.

Optimal strategies for monitoring irrigation water quality. AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT, 199, 86-92. doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2017.12.018 [More info](#more-journal-publication95)The quality of irrigation water drawn from surface water sources varies greatly. This is particularly true for waters that are subject to intermittent contamination events such as runoff from rainfall or direct entry of livestock upstream of use. Such pollution in irrigation systems increases the risk of food crop contamination and require adoption of best monitoring practices. Therefore, this study aimed to define optimal strategies for monitoring irrigation water quality. Following the analysis of 1357 irrigation water samples for Escherichia coli, total coliforms, and physical and chemical parameters, the following key irrigation water collection approaches are suggested: 1) explore up to 950 m upstream to ensure no major contamination or outfalls exists; 2) collect samples before 12:00 p.m. local time; 3) collect samples at the surface of the water at any point across the canal where safe access is available; and 4) composite five samples and perform a single E. coli assay. These recommendations comprehensively consider the results as well as sampling costs, personnel effort, and current scientific knowledge of water quality characterization. These strategies will help to better characterize risks from microbial pathogen contamination in irrigation waters in the Southwest United States and aid in risk reduction practices for agricultural water use in regions with similar water quality, climate, and canal construction. - Verhougstraete, M., Reynolds, K.

Multi-Normalization and Interpolation Protocol to Improve doi:10.1177/2472630317724769 [More info](#more-journal-publication125)Norovirus (NoV) is one of the leading causes of acute gastroenteritis, affecting 685 million people per year around the world. The best preventive measure is to screen water for possible NoV contamination, not from infected humans, preferably using rapid and field-deployable diagnostic methods. While enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) can be used for such detection, the low infectious dose as well as the generally inferior sensitivity and low titer of available NoV antibodies render critical challenges in using EIAs toward NoV detection. In this work, we demonstrated smartphone-based Mie scatter detection of NoV with immunoagglutinated latex particles on paper microfluidic chips. Using only three different concentrations of anti-NoV-conjugated particles, we were able to construct a single standard curve that covered seven orders of magnitude of NoV antigen concentrations. Multiple normalization steps and interpolation procedures were developed to estimate the optimum amount of antibody-conjugated particles that matched to the target NoV concentration. A very low detection limit of 10 pg/mL was achieved without using any concentration or enrichment steps. This method can also be adapted for detection of any other virus pathogens whose antibodies possess low sensitivity and low antibody titer. - Gerba, C. P., Koenig, D. W., Sifuentes, L.

Multimodal Imaging and Lighting Bias Correction for Improved uPAD-based Water Quality Monitoring via Smartphones. Scientific Reports, 6(27529). doi:10.1038/srep27529 [More info](#more-journal-publication127)Smartphone image-based sensing of microfluidic paper analytical devices (PADs) offers low-cost and mobile evaluation of water quality. However, consistent quantification is a challenge due to variable environmental, paper, and lighting conditions, especially across large multi-target PADs. Compensations must be made for variations between images to achieve reproducible results without a separate lighting enclosure. We thus developed a simple method using triple-reference point normalization and a fast-Fourier transform (FFT)-based pre-processing scheme to quantify consistent reflected light intensity signals under variable lighting and channel conditions. This technique was evaluated using various angles/heights of light source, imaging backgrounds, and type/quality of light source. Further testing evaluated its handle of absorbance, quenching, and relative scattering intensity measurements from assays detecting four water contaminants - Cr(VI), total chlorine, caffeine, and E. coli K12 - at similar wavelengths using the green channel of RGB images. Between assays, this algorithm reduced error from PAD surface inconsistencies and cross-image lighting gradients. Although the algorithm could not completely remove the anomalies arising from point shadows within channels or some non-uniform background reflections, it still afforded order-of-magnitude quantification and stable assay specificity under these conditions, offering one route toward improving smartphone quantification of PAD assays for in-field water quality monitoring. - Reynolds, K.

The bacterial virus MS-2 was used to evaluate two scenarios, one where the hand of an individual was contaminated and another where a fomite was contaminated. MS-2 was selected as a model because its shape and size are similar to many human pathogenic viruses. Two separate experiments were conducted, one in which the entrance door push plate was inoculated and the other in which the hand of one selected employee was inoculated. In both scenarios, 54 selected surfaces in the office were tested to assess the dissemination of the virus within the office. Associated surface contamination was also measured employing an ATP meter. More than half of the tested hands and surfaces in the office were contaminated with MS-2 within 4 h. Next, an intervention was conducted, and each scenario was repeated. Half of the participating employees were provided hand sanitizer, facial tissues, and disinfecting wipes, and were instructed in their use. A significant (p - Suppes, L. M., Canales, R. A., Gerba, C.

[More info](#more-journal-publication141)Although the number of illnesses resulting from indirect viral pathogen transmission could be substantial, it is difficult to estimate the relative risks because of the wide variation and uncertainty in human behavior, variable viral concentrations on fomites, and other exposure factors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the micro-activity approach for assessment of microbial risk by adapting a mathematical model to estimate probability of viral infection from indirect transmission. To evaluate the model, measurements of phage loading on fomites and hands collected before and after implementation of a Healthy Workplace Project intervention were used. Parameter distributions were developed from these data, as well as for micro-activity rates, contact surface areas, phage transfer efficiencies, and inactivation rates. Following the Monte Carlo simulations (n = 1,000), the estimated phage loading on hands was not significantly different from the loading of phage on hands measured in the experimental trials. The model was then used to demonstrate that the Healthy Workplace Project intervention significantly reduced risk of infection by 77% for rotavirus and rhinovirus. This is the first published study to successfully evaluate a model focused on the indirect transmission of viruses via hand contact with measured data and provide an assessment of the micro-activity approach to microbial risk evaluation. - Lopez, G.

This study assessed whether implementation of the Healthy Workplace Project (HWP) (providing hand sanitizers, disinfecting wipes, facial tissues, and use instructions) would reduce viral loads in an office setting of approximately 80 employees after seeding fomites and the hands of volunteer participants with an MS-2 phage tracer. The HWP significantly reduced viable phage detected on participants' hands, communal fomites, and personal fomites (p .010) in office environments and presents a cost-effective method for reducing the health and economic burden associated with viral illnesses in the workplace. - Reynolds, K.

[More info](#more-journal-publication152)Inanimate surfaces, or fomites, can serve as routes of transmission of enteric and respiratory pathogens. No previous studies have evaluated the impact of surface disinfection on the level of pathogen transfer from fomites to fingers. Thus, the present study investigated the change in microbial transfer from contaminated fomites to fingers following disinfecting wipe use. Escherichia coli (10(8) PFU/ml) were seeded on ceramic tile, laminate, and granite in 10-l drops and allowed to dry for 30 min at a relative humidity of 15 to 32%. The seeded fomites were treated with a disinfectant wipe and allowed to dry for an additional 10 min. Fomite-to-finger transfer trials were conducted to measure concentrations of transferred microorganisms on the fingers after the disinfectant wipe intervention. The mean log10 reduction of the test microorganisms on fomites by the disinfectant wipe treatment varied from 1.9 to 5.0, depending on the microorganism and the fomite. Microbial transfer from disinfectant-wipe-treated fomites was lower (up to - Lopez, G. U., Lopez, G. U., Kitajima, M., Kitajima, M., Sexton, J. D., Sexton, J. D., Gerba, C. P., Gerba, C.

[More info](#more-journal-publication167)The goals of this study were to observe the spread of viruses in a hotel setting and to assess the effectiveness of a hygiene intervention in reducing their spread. Selected fomites in one hotel room were inoculated with bacteriophage x-174, and fomites in a conference center within the same hotel were inoculated using bacteriophage MS2. Cleaning of the contaminated room resulted in the spread of viruses to other rooms by the housekeeping staff. Furthermore, viruses were transferred by hotel guests to the conference center and a communal kitchen area. Additionally, conference attendees transferred viruses from the conference center to their hotel rooms and a communal kitchen area. This study demonstrated how viruses can be spread throughout a hotel setting by both housekeepers and guests. A hygiene intervention, which included providing hand hygiene products and facial tissues to the guests and disinfecting solutions with disposable wipes to the housekeeping staff, was successful in reducing the spread of viruses between the hotel guest rooms and conference center. The hygiene intervention resulted in significantly reduced transfer of the x-174 between the contaminated hotel room and other hotel rooms, communal areas, and the conference center (p = 0.02). - Sifuentes, L.

Cryptosporidium and Giardia zoonoses: Minimizing health risks from food animal production. Cab Reviews: Perspectives in Agriculture, Veterinary Science, Nutrition and Natural Resources, 7(008), 1-7. doi:10.1079/pavsnnr20127008 [More info](#more-journal-publication189)Abstract More than 10 years ago, food-borne pathogens were estimated to cause 76 000 illnesses and 5 000 deaths in the USA alone. Given the under-reporting of food-borne illnesses, the numbers of illnesses and deaths associated with food are actually higher. Food-borne pathogens continue to impact public health through worldwide disease outbreaks as they have many opportunities to enter the food chain - from the pre-harvest environment to the consumer. With over half of all disease-causing micro-organisms having the ability to be transmitted zoonotically, food animal production is a key source of pathogens in the farm-to-fork continuum. The protozoan parasites, Cryptosporidium and Giardia, have both been implicated in food-borne disease, and have the potential to be transmitted zoonotically in the farm environment. Farm management strategies have been developed to minimize the transmission of protozoa (from animals) that may infect farm workers, and contaminate nearby waterways and food crops. Such strategies target protecting the health of the herd, preventing (oo)cyst transmission to surface water and vegetable crops, and providing education to animal husbandry personnel and veterinarians on best management practices. To fully address the challenges associated with food safety, post-harvest control measures should also be implemented. - Lee-Montiel, F. T., Reynolds, K. A., & Riley, M. R. (2011). Detection and quantification of poliovirus infection using FTIR spectroscopy and cell culture. Journal of biological engineering, 5, 16. [More info](#more-journal-publication190)In a globalized word, prevention of infectious diseases is a major challenge. Rapid detection of viable virus particles in water and other environmental samples is essential to public health risk assessment, homeland security and environmental protection. Current virus detection methods, especially assessing viral infectivity, are complex and time-consuming, making point-of-care detection a challenge. Faster, more sensitive, highly specific methods are needed to quantify potentially hazardous viral pathogens and to determine if suspected materials contain viable viral particles. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy combined with cellular-based sensing, may offer a precise way to detect specific viruses. This approach utilizes infrared light to monitor changes in molecular components of cells by tracking changes in absorbance patterns produced following virus infection. In this work poliovirus (PV1) was used to evaluate the utility of FTIR spectroscopy with cell culture for rapid detection of infective virus particles. - Reynolds, K. A., Pepper, I.

Poliovirus type 1 was added to dechlorinated tapwater and stored at room temperature (22.5-24\u00b0C) for a total of 50 days. Samples were assayed at defined time intervals by the most probable number (MPN) method on Buffalo green monkey kidney cells (BGM) by CPE and additionally by ICC-PCR. Monolayers that were CPE negative on first passage were passed onto fresh monolayers of cells for a second and third time if still negative. By CPE assay, second passage was observed to yield a greater titer (2,300 vs. 24,000 MPN/ml) and third passage also resulted in an increased titer. ICC-PCR proved to be a more rapid and sensitive method than conventional cell culture for determining virus inactivation rates in water. Poliovirus survived in tapwater for up to 32 days, as assessed by both third passage ICC-PCR and CPE. There was no statistical difference in the inactivation rates between the two methods. To determine the total number of infectious viruses, these findings indicate the need for performing three cell culture passages or, alternatively, ICC-PCR on first passage. - Reynolds, K., Sexton, J.

[More info](#more-journal-publication192)Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections result in 19,000 deaths a year in the United States. Epidemiologic studies have shown that community-acquired infections are increasing dramatically, and strains typical of community infections are increasingly detected in hospital populations. Emergency medical responders (EMR) are exposed to both community and hospital MRSA patients, which, combined with their communal lifestyles in fire stations, results in higher risk of exposure. This study determined the occurrence and frequency of MRSA and other bacterial indicators on environmental surfaces in fire stations, training sites, and offices of EMR. - Roberts, M. C., Meschke, J.

[More info](#more-journal-publication194)Novel telluride glasses with high electrical conductivity, wide infrared transparency and good resistance to crystallization are used to design an opto-electrophoretic sensor for detection and identification of hazardous microorganisms. The sensor is based on an attenuated total reflectance element made of Ge-As-Te glass that serves as both an optical sensing zone and an electrode for driving the migration of bio-molecules within the evanescent wave of the sensor. An electric field is applied between the optical element and a counter electrode in order to induce the migration of bio-molecules carrying surface charges. The effect of concentration and applied voltage is tested and the migration effect is shown to be reversible upon switching the electric field. The collected signal is of high quality and can be used to identify different bacterial genus through statistical spectral analysis. This technique therefore provides the ability to detect hazardous microorganisms with high specificity and high sensitivity in aqueous environments. This has great potential for online monitoring of water quality. - Andrade, C., Champagne, S., Caruso, D., Foster, K., & Reynolds, K. (2009).

Environmental science & technology, 43(5). [More info](#more-journal-publication196)The objective of this study was to develop a method to monitor the microbial quality of treated drinking water at the tap utilizing point-of-use filter systems that are placed in water vending machines. Such vending machines have high-volume water throughput and allow for an evaluation of the occurrence of human enteric pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria in tap water over extended time periods. Seeded experiments, using Escherichia coli and bacteriophage MS-2, were performed on (i) new filters, (ii) artificially aged filters, and (iii) filters that had been used in the field (naturally aged filters) to evaluate the efficiency of recovery of these organisms from the three-component filter set (30 microm, 5 mirom, solid block carbon (SBC)) by evaluating each filter independently. SBC filters had the highest recovery of the organisms, averaging recovery of 27% and 5% for E. coli and MS-2, respectively. Subsequently, tapwatersupplieswere monitored in vending machinesthroughout Southern Arizona using SBC filters as a monitoring tool. A total of 48 filters from 41 unique site locations were surveyed for the presence of total coliforms, E. coli, enterococci, Cryptosporidium, enteroviruses, and noroviruses. Organisms were detected following the passage of large volumes of water ranging from 1000 to 17,000 L through the filters. Out of 48 SBC filters 54.2% were positive for at least one organism. The number of filters positive for total coliforms, E. coli, enterococci, and enterovirus was 13, 5, 19, and 3, respectively, corresponding to 27.1%, 10.4%, 39.6%, and 6.3% of the total filters. No filters were positive for noroviruses or Cryptosporidium. These results suggest that the SBC filter can be used to monitor large volumes of treated drinking water and detect the incidence of indicators and pathogens that may be present at low concentrations. These data show that post-treated water often contains water quality indicator and pathogenic organisms at the tap, and therefore, monitoring with this method would be beneficial to the community as it allows for an assessment of exposure to pathogens and associative risks. This monitoring tool will also aid in the tracking of outbreaks and the determination of the microbial pathogen load during all stages of an outbreak as a filter can be installed and retrieved at the point-of-use at anytime during an outbreak. - Vargas, C.

Applied and environmental microbiology, 75(20), 6431-40. [More info](#more-journal-publication197)The goal of this work is to develop an online monitoring scheme for detection of viruses in flowing drinking water. The approach applies an electrodeposition process that is similar to the use of charged membrane filters previously employed for collection of viruses from aqueous samples. In the present approach, charged materials are driven onto a robust optical sensing element which has high transparency to infrared light. A spectroscopic measurement is performed using the evanescent wave that penetrates no more than 1 mum from the surface of an infrared optical element in an attenuated total reflectance measurement scheme. The infrared measurement provides quantitative information on the amount and identity of material deposited from the water. Initial studies of this sensing scheme used proteins reversibly electrodeposited onto germanium chips. The results of those studies were applied to design a method for collection of viruses onto an attenuated total reflectance crystal. Spectral signatures can be discriminated between three types of protein and two viruses. There is the potential to remove deposited material by reversing the voltage polarity. This work demonstrates a novel and practical scheme for detection of viruses in water systems with potential application to near-continual, automated monitoring of municipal drinking water. - Lucas, P., Riley, M. R., Wilhelm, A. A., Riley, M. R., Reynolds, K. A., & Lucas, P. (2008). Integrated capture and spectroscopic detection of viruses in an aqueous environment. Proceedings of SPIE, 6852. doi:10.1117/12.774540 [More info](#more-journal-publication198)A new approach to virus detection in an aqueous environment has been developed using the electrophoretic deposition of protein and viruses on a charged surface for in situ infrared characterization and identification. In this study, a potential was applied across a germanium ATR crystal, which acted as the anode, and an indium tin oxide (ITO) plate, which acted as the cathode in the electrodeposition setup. Sample aqueous solutions were placed between the germanium and the ITO with different concentrations of the protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) and the virus MS2, in tap water. The pH of the tap water was above the isoelectric point of the virus and the protein, resulting in a net negative charge for both. The negatively charged protein and virus were then driven to the surface of the positively charged germanium ATR crystal, once a potential was applied to the system. FTIR/ATR was used before and throughout electrodeposition to enable the in situ observation of the deposition with time. In this study, we evaluate the capture efficiency, compared to control experiments with no applied voltage, and the feasibility of using this approach for the collection and quantification of proteins and viruses from water samples. This technique resulted in the successful deposition of BSA, and MS2 with an applied voltage of only 1.1V. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the ATR spectra, distinct spectral features were identified for the protein and virus showing the potential for identification and characterization of biological molecules in an aqueous environment. - Reynolds, K. A., Mena, K. D., & Gerba, C. P. (2008). Risk of waterborne illness via drinking water in the United States. Reviews of environmental contamination and toxicology, 192, 117-58. [More info](#more-journal-publication199)Outbreaks of disease attributable to drinking water are not common in the U.S., but they do still occur and can lead to serious acute, chronic, or sometimes fatal health consequences, particularly in sensitive and immunocompromised populations. From 1971 to 2002, there were 764 documented waterborne outbreaks associated with drinking water, resulting in 575,457 cases of illness and 79 deaths (Blackburn et al. 2004; Calderon 2004); however, the true impact of disease is estimated to be much higher. If properly applied, current protocols in municipal water treatment are effective at eliminating pathogens from water. However, inadequate, interrupted, or intermittent treatment has repeatedly been associated with waterborne disease outbreaks. Contamination is not evenly distributed but rather affected by the number of pathogens in the source water, the age of the distribution system, the quality of the delivered water, and climatic events that can tax treatment plant operations. Private water supplies are not regulated by the USEPA and are generally not treated or monitored, although very few of the municipal systems involved in documented outbreaks exceeded the USEPA's total coliform standard in the preceding 12 mon (Craun et al. 2002). We provide here estimates of waterborne infection and illness risks in the U.S. based on the total number of water systems, source water type, and total populations exposed. Furthermore, we evaluated all possible illnesses associated with the microbial infection and not just gastroenteritis. Our results indicate that 10.7 M infections/yr and 5.4 M illnesses/yr occur in populations served by community groundwater systems; 2.2 M infections/yr and 1.1 M illnesses/yr occur in noncommunity groundwater systems; and 26.0 M infections/yr and 13.0 M illnesses/yr occur in municipal surface water systems. The total estimated number of waterborne illnesses/yr in the U.S. is therefore estimated to be 19.5 M/yr. Others have recently estimated waterborne illness rates of 12M cases/yr (Colford et al. 2006) and 16 M cases/yr (Messner et al. 2006), yet our estimate considers all health outcomes associated with exposure to pathogens in drinking water rather than only gastrointestinal illness. Drinking water outbreaks exemplify known breaches in municipal water treatment and distribution processes and the failure of regulatory requirements to ensure water that is free of human pathogens. Water purification technologies applied at the point-of-use (POU) can be effective for limiting the effects of source water contamination, treatment plant inadequacies, minor intrusions in the distribution system, or deliberate posttreatment acts (i.e., bioterrorism). Epidemiological studies are conflicting on the benefits of POU water treatment. One prospective intervention study found that consumers of reverse-osmosis (POU) filtered water had 20%-35% less gastrointestinal illnesses than those consuming regular tap water, with an excess of 14% of illness due to contaminants introduced in the distribution system (Payment 1991, 1997). Two other studies using randomized, blinded, controlled trials determined that the risks were equal among groups supplied with POU-treated water compared to untreated tap water (Hellard et al. 2001; Colford et al. 2003). For immunocompromised populations, POU water treatment devices are recommended by the CDC and USEPA as one treatment option for reducing risks of Cryptosporidium and other types of infectious agents transmitted by drinking water. Other populations, including those experiencing \"normal\" life stages such as pregnancy, or those very young or very old, might also benefit from the utilization of additional water treatment options beyond the current multibarrier approach of municipal water treatment. - Reynolds, K.

Samples were analyzed for fecal and total coliform bacteria, protein, and biochemical markers. Biochemical markers, i.e., hemoglobin (blood marker), amylase (mucus, saliva, sweat, and urine marker), and urea (urine and sweat marker) were detected on 3% (26/801); 15% (120/801), and 6% (48/801) of the surfaces, respectively. Protein (general hygiene marker) levels > or = 200 microg/10 cm2 were present on 26% (200/801) of the surfaces tested. Surfaces from children's playground equipment and daycare centers were the most frequently contaminated (biochemical markers on 36%; 15/42 and 46%; 25/54, respectively). Surfaces from the shopping, miscellaneous activities, and office environments were positive for biochemical markers with a frequency of 21% (69/333), 21% (66/308), and 11% (12/105), respectively). Sixty samples were analyzed for biochemical markers and bacteria. Total and fecal coliforms were detected on 20% (12/60) and 7% (4/ 60) of the surfaces, respectively. Half and one-third of the sites positive for biochemical markers were also positive for total and fecal coliforms, respectively. Artificial contamination of public surfaces with an invisible fluorescent tracer showed that contamination from outside surfaces was transferred to 86% (30/ 35) of exposed individual's hands and 82% (29/35) tracked the tracer to their home or personal belongings hours later. Results provide information on the relative hygiene of commonly encountered public surfaces and aid in the identification of priority environments where contaminant occurrence and risk of exposure may be greatest. Children's playground equipment is identified as a priority surface for additional research on the occurrence of and potential exposure to infectious disease causing agents. - Bright, K.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 113(2), S180. doi:10.1016/j.jaci.2004.01.082 [More info](#more-journal-publication201)Abstract Rationale Many fungi colonize indoor environments and produce allergenic proteins that cause adverse health symptoms in sensitive individuals. The effect of sodium hypochlorite (2.4% NaOCl) disinfectant on fungal growth and the presence of allergenic properties was evaluated. Methods Environmental and laboratory isolates of common indoor mold sporulation, purified, dried on sterile ceramic porous and non-porous carriers, and treated with 2.4% NaOCl for up to 10 min. Volunteer's showers were monitored, for 2 weeks to determine the rate of mold regrowth following disinfectant treatment. ELISA tests measured the ability of NaOCl to reduce the allergenic properties of Aspergillus fumigatus following 30 sec, 1 min, and 5 min exposures. Results 2.4% NaOCl reduced total mold counts in home showers by >4 logs after 5 min exposures. In controlled laboratory studies, home mold isolates were reduced by >5 logs following 5 min exposures with 2.4% NaOCl. Test organisms were not culturable in 10 out of 10 trials after 5 and 10 min contact times in non-porous and porous ceramic carriers, respectively. NaOCl treatment reduced A. fumigatus allergen levels by >90% in as little as 30 seconds. Conclusions Low concentrations (2.4%) of NaOCl, common to household disinfectants, are effective at reducing mold from indoor surfaces, to undetectable levels, in both real-time and seeded laboratory studies. In addition, NaOCl effectively fragments the proteins responsible for the allergenic properties of indoor mold. - Reynolds, K. A., & Reynolds, K. A. (2004).

Integrated cell culture/PCR for detection of enteric viruses in environmental samples. Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.), 268. [More info](#more-journal-publication203)Recently, an integrated cell culture/polymerase chain reaction (ICC/PCR) technique has been developed for the detection of viruses in environmental samples providing a reliable method for practical analysis and direct monitoring of environmental samples for viral pathogens. CC/PCR allows for detection of infectious viruses in hours to days compared with the days or weeks necessary with cell culture alone. Bacterial indicator organisms are commonly used to evaluate environmental samples with respect to fecal contamination and potential public health impacts. These organisms do not correlate well with the presence of viruses, but a rapid, reliable method was not previously available for direct virus testing. Using ICC/PCR, environmental samples may be directly surveyed for pathogenic viruses, in a timely manner. Direct virus analysis will lead to better assessment of the presence and risk of human enteric viruses in the environment, so that control measures may be developed with true virus occurrence data. The ICC/PCR approach combines two previously applied virus detection methods, conventional cell culture and PCR amplification, utilizing the major advantages and overcoming the major limitations of each methodology when used alone. Cell culture assay is the standard method for the detection of viable human viruses (i.e., poliovirus, coxsackievirus, echovirus, adenovirus, hepatitis A virus, reovirus, and rotavirus) in environmental samples, serving as the method against which all newer technologies are evaluated. Although cell culture is theoretically capable of detecting a single viable virus in relatively large volumes of sample, the time required for confirmed results with conventional cell culture makes it an impractical method for routine monitoring of environmental samples. Furthermore, cell culture does not detect noncytopathogenic viruses (viruses that are viable, infecting cells, and continually spreading to neighboring cells but that do not cause a visible cytopathogenic effect [CPE] on the cell monolayer). Rotavirus and most wild-type hepatitis A viruses (HAV) are infectious to cell cultures but do not produce a clear CPE. - Reynolds, K., Gerba, C., Kuwahara, S., & Tanner, B. (2004).

[More info](#more-journal-publication205)Effective wastewater treatment is critical to public health and well-being. This is especially true in developing countries, where disinfection of wastewater is frequently inadequate. People who live in these areas may benefit from wastewater disinfection using ozone. This study evaluated the ability of a new electrochemical process of ozone generation, which produced ozone continuously at high pressure and concentration by the electrolysis of water, to disinfect tap water and secondarily treated wastewater. Inactivation of Klebsiella terrigena, Escherichia coli, MS2 bacteriophage and poliovirus 1 was evaluated first in reverse osmosis (RO) treated water. Inactivation of K. terrigena (6-log), MS2 (6-log) and poliovirus 1 (>3-log) was observed after 1 min of ozonation in a 1 L batch reactor. Experiments were then performed to assess the microbiological impact of disinfection using ozone on secondarily treated municipal wastewater. The effect of ozonation on wastewater was determined for total and faecal coliforms, bacteriophages and heterotrophic plate count (HPC) bacteria. Electrochemical ozone generators provided an effective, rapid and low-cost method of wastewater disinfection. Based on the results of this research, electrochemically generated ozone would be well suited to remote, small-scale, disinfection operations and may provide a feasible means of wastewater disinfection in developing countries. - Reynolds, K.

Canadian Journal of Microbiology, 47(2), 153-157. doi:10.1139/w00-134 [More info](#more-journal-publication207)This study applied the integrated cell culture/polymerase chain reaction methodology (ICC/PCR) for rapid and specific detection of both cytopathogenic and noncytopathogenic viruses. Results of this study showed that the use of direct RT-PCR or conventional cell culture alone may yield erroneous results with the analysis of environmental samples. The purpose of this study was to compare cultural, molecular, and combined assays for the most effective method of virus detection in variable environmental samples. Using ICC/PCR, stock enterovirus inocula of > or =10 PFU were PCR positive in at least 4/5 replicate flasks after only 5 h of incubation in cell culture, and in all flasks after > or =10 h. An inoculum of one PFU was detected by PCR after 20 h of cell culture incubation while for concentrations of virus below one PFU, 25 h of incubation was sufficient. Similarly, hepatitis A virus (HAV) inocula of 100 MPN/flask, produced indeterminate CPE in cell culture, but were clearly detected by ICC/PCR following 48 h of incubation. Lower levels of HAV, 1 and 10 MPN, were detected by ICC/PCR after 96 to 72 h of incubation, respectively. Cell culture lysates from 11 environmental sample concentrates of sewage, marine water, and surface drinking water sources, were positive for enteroviruses by ICC/PCR compared to 3 positive by direct RT-PCR alone. Results from ICC/PCR eventually agreed with cell culture but required < or =48 h of incubation, compared to as long as 3 weeks for CPE following incubation with BGM and FRhK cells. - Reynolds, K.

Thus, the contact time for chlorine disinfection of poliovirus is up to five times greater than previously thought. - Roll, K. P., Reynolds, K. A., Pepper, I. L., Gerba, C. P., & Fujioka, R. S.

Canadian Journal of Microbiology, 44(6), 598-604. doi:10.1139/w98-040 [More info](#more-journal-publication209)The consequence of point and nonpoint pollution sources, discharged into marine waters, on public recreational beaches in Mamala Bay, Hawaii was evaluated using virus cell culture and direct reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Twelve sites, nine marine, two freshwater (one stream and one canal), and one sewage, were assessed either quarterly or monthly for 1 year to detect the presence of human enteric viruses. Water samples were concentrated from initial volumes of 400 L to final volumes of 30 mL using Filterite electronegative cartridge filters and a modified beef extract elution procedure. Cell culture was applied using the Buffalo Green Monkey kidney cell line to analyze samples for enteroviruses. Positive samples were also evaluated by RT-PCR, using enterovirus-specific primers. Levels of RT-PCR inhibition varied with each concentrated sample. Resin column purification increased PCR detection sensitivity by at least one order of magnitude in a variety of sewage outfall and recreational marine water samples but not in the freshwater canal samples. Using cell culture, viable enteroviruses were found in 50 and 17% of all outfall and canal samples, respectively. Samples were positive at beaches 8% of the time. These data illustrate the potential public health hazard associated with recreational waters. Using direct PCR, viruses were detected at the outfall but were not found in any beach or canal samples, in part, owing to substances that inhibit PCR. Therefore, conventional cell culture is the most effective means of detecting low levels of infectious enteroviruses in environmental waters, whereas direct RT-PCR is rendered less effective by inhibitory compounds and low equivalent reaction volumes. - Reynolds, K.

By this method, the presence of infectious enterovirus was confirmed within 24 h, compared with > or = 3 days by cell culture alone. The combined methodology eliminated typical problems normally associated with direct reverse transcriptase PCR by increasing the equivalent volume of environmental sample examined and reducing the effects of inhibitory compounds. - Johnson, D.

This practice raises health risk concerns of possible transmission of Giardia and Cryptosporidium . Both of these protozoa have been shown to be transmitted by recreational swimming. To date no studies have determined the efficiency of their detection and concentration in marine waters. This study evaluated the efficiency of their detection in tap water and from marine waters in Hawaii with two different filter types. This study compared a polypropylene fiber cartridge filter, DPPPY (1.0 m nominal porosity) (Cuno, Meriden, CT) which is typically used for parasite detection and the Filterite negatively charged filter (0.45m) (Filtemp Sales, Inc., Phoenix, AZ). The latter would allow for both viruses and parasites to be concentrated simultaneously. The organisms were removed from the filter by passing the eluent through the filters in the opposite direction of collection and detected by indirect immunofluorescence antibody staining specific for Giardia and Cryptosporidium . Processing was simpler and faster with the Filterite filter and the overall efficiency for both Giardia and Cryptosporidium detection was greater. These methods are currently being used for the detection of the oocysts and cysts at bathing beaches in Hawaii impacted by marine sewage discharge. - Reynolds, K. A., & Reynolds, K. A. (1995).

Although members of the enterovirus group have been suggested as possible indicators of sewage pollution in marine waters, the lack of rapid, sensitive and cost effective methods have prevented routine monitoring in the United States. This study compared traditional cell culture and direct RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) amplification for detection of an enterovirus. Poliovirus could be recovered from 100 L of artificial seawater with an average efficiency of 77%, using adsorption and elution from electronegative filters. Viruses were eluted from the filters with 1.5% beef extract for viruses (BEV) adjusted to pH 9.5 and reconcentrated by organic flocculation to a volume of 30 mL. Substances which interfered with detection by RT-PCR were removed by treatment of the concentrates with sephadex and chelex resins. Direct RT-PCR could detect 2.5 and 0.025 PFU (plaque forming units) for single (25 cycles) and double PCR (2 \u00d7 25 cycles) in 10 L of pure culture poliovirus samples, respectively. These methods are currently being applied to assess the occurrence of enteroviruses at marine bathing beaches influenced by sewage discharges. - Rose, J. B., Reynolds, K. A., & Giordano, A. T.

This work was undertaken to examine methods for recovery and detection of coliphage in marine waters and sediments. Seeded studies were used to compare viradel and Ultrafiltration methods for the recovery and concentration of both indigenous and introduced viruses from seawater. Ultrafiltration recoveries of MS2 averaged 29.3% in artificial seawater. Viradel methods used to concentrate MD1 coliphage averaged 18.7% recovery when used with natural seawater. A variety of eluants were examined for recovery of phage from sediments. Recoveries ranged from 0.8-100% depending on the type of phage and eluant used. No eluant was capable of providing more efficient recoveries over another, however, indigenous phage #16 was isolated more efficiently than introduced tailed phages T2 and MD1. For phage quantitation, plaque assay counts were compared to particle counts using TEM. TEM counts were usually higher than PFUs in artificial seawater concentrates but lower with eluted marine sediments. Environmental surveys revealed that phage could sometimes be isolated from sediments when they could not be detected in the overlying water column. Preliminary data showed phage could be isolated from sea cucumbers and sponges at higher concentrations than in their surrounding habitats. Therefore, with the development of efficient elution and rapid quantitation techniques, sediments and sea organisms are the most appropriate sampling sites for detection of marine phage populations.

Rapid and Reliable Norovirus Assay at pg/mL Level Using Smartphone-Based Fluorescence Microscope and a Microfluidic Paper Analytic Device. In Annual International Meeting, 2017, 1701234. [More info](#more-proceedings-publication2)Detection of norovirus from water samples typically requires extremely low limit of detection (LOD), preferably at single virus particle level, since they can be pathogenic at extremely low concentrations. Complicated equipment and/or lengthy procedures are necessary to concentrate large volume of water sample. In addition, this low LOD requirement have traditionally been associated non-reproducible and less convincing assay results. In this work, rapid and reliable detection of norovirus contamination in water samples was demonstrated using an in-house developed smartphone-based fluorescence microscope and a paper microfluidic analytic device (PAD). Norovirus was concentrated directly on the PAD, which was fabricated with polarity filter, to further decrease the LOD. Antibody-conjugated submicron (0.5 m diameter) fluorescent particles were added to this PAD, and a smartphone based fluorescence microscope imaged these beads directly from the PAD. Since the spatial resolution of our smartphone-based fluorescence microscope is > 1 m, only the beads immunoaggltuinated by norovirus can be identified, providing reliable, reproducible, and visually convincing assay results. Using this novel this method, extremely low LOD was demonstrated, 0.01 pg/mL with a benchtop fluorescence microscope and 10 pg/mL to 100 pg/mL with a smartphone based fluorescence microscope. This novel assay can provide a fully unmanned platform for assaying various waterborne pathogens that require extremely low LOD as well as high reliability, while providing low-cost, ease-of-use, and user friendliness appropriate for field applications. - Yoon, J., Reynolds, K. A., Paz, V., Tat, T., & McCracken, K. E. (2017, Jul.). Immunoagglutinated Particle Rheology Sensing on a Microfluidic Paper-Based Analytical Device for Pathogen 2017, 1701190. [More info](#more-proceedings-publication3)Particle immunoagglutination assays have been successfully used in biological sensing for food, water, and environmental applications and medical diagnostics. In this method, interactions between antibody-conjugated particles and biological targets are typically quantified by optical-based sensing, including Mie scattering detection. While these optical methods demonstrate favorable sensitivity and specificity, those that measure light intensity changes are vulnerable to environmental perturbations, such as variations in ambient lighting or humidity. In this work, we investigated a new sensing method based on the particle rheology of immunoagglutinated samples, as seen in droplet spreading on a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (\u00b5PAD). By monitoring the overall bulk movement of a particle suspension on paper, these assays are not as critically affected by the sensing environment. Capillary flow of the particle suspension on \u00b5PAD channels was tuned by adjusting various parameters, including paper thickness, channel width, channel morphology, particle concentration, and particle size. We then tested the most favorable lateral flow channel design for E. coli K12 sensing in water samples, and applied this overall technique to Zika virus (ZIKV) sensing in biological matrices. From these assays, we achieved similar limits of detection as compared with other demonstrated methods (2 log CFU/mL E. coli; 0.53x10^4 transcription copies/mL). Based on this work, direct detection of immunoagglutinated particle rheology through droplet spreading shows promise as a unique and simple method with applications in automated biosensors for environmental and health samples. - Sexton, J.

[More info](#more-proceedings-publication4)Novel telluride glasses with high electrical conductivity, wide infrared transparency and good resistance to crystallization are used to design an opto-electrophoretic sensor for detection and identification of hazardous microorganisms. The sensor is based on an attenuated total reflectance element made of Ge-As-Te glass that serves as both an optical sensing zone and an electrode for driving the bio-molecules within the evanescent wave of the sensor. An electric field is applied between the optical element and a counter electrode in order to induce the migration of bio-molecules carrying surface charges. The effect of concentration and applied voltage is tested and the migration effect is shown to be reversible upon switching the electric field. The collected signal is of high quality and can be used to identify different bio-molecules through spectral analysis. This technique therefore provides the ability to detect hazardous microorganisms with high specificity and good sensitivity in aqueous environments. - Kuwahara, S. S., Reynolds, K. A., Kuwahara, S.
