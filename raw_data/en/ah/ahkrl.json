At the time, I was recovering from some serious injuries after I was hit by a car while riding a bicycle. I came to Kripalu to heal. In my heart I knew that therapeutic yoga could help support the efforts of Western medicine to repair my bones and tissues. I also knew that if I learned the techniques of yoga therapy, it would help me become a more skilled and compassionate yoga teacher. Under the gentle guidance of Joseph Le Page, and through the transformative power of his Integrative Y oga Therapy program, Kripalu helped bring me back to life. And I'm not the only one. In my time here, I have been amazed by the diversity of people who come to Kripalu and the miraculous effect it has on so many. Some arrive for yoga teacher trainings, while others come to explore nutrition, psychology, dance, mindfulness, bodywork, and other practices that inspire, uplift, and heal. Still others are here to simply rest and relax, often seeking nothing more than a quiet spot by the lake to watch the play of sun and clouds, wind and water. In our classrooms and on the hiking trails, in the dining areas and on the yoga mats, a community of like-minded human beings has found their playground and laboratory in Kripalu. It calls like a beacon of light, providing an opportunity to reconnect to our true selves and re-energize our life force so that we can tap into our fullest expression of health and happiness. This summer, Joseph's Integrative Y oga Therapy program will be back, along with a bounty of other life-changing teachers, programs, and experiences. I am grateful for what Kripalu has given me, so it is my privilege to offer you these wonderful programs on behalf of our incredible staff, faculty, and invited presenters. I hope to see you here this summer.

When we feel anxious or depressed, it's tempting to view our emotional difficulties as proof that we're unstable. I frequently hear people say, \"I don't have what it takes to be happy,\" \"I've been depressed all my life,\" or \"I've always been anxious, as long as I can remember\u2014I'll never learn to relax.\" This reaction to emotional pain is understandable, especially if it's been a long time since we've experienced anything different. But over time, our response solidifies. It can lock our emotional wiring\u2014 the way our brain cells are wired to communicate and respond to experience\u2014onto the anxiety and depression settings. Therapeutic yoga, mindfulness, and movement therapy can help reverse our habitual responses to difficulty. They give us a new collection of tools and experiences that reverberate deep into the mind-body network. How, exactly, do they do this? When practiced in a contemplative way, yoga draws our focus from the world outside us (the one that requires continual action) and transfers it deep into the mind, brain, and body, where the roots of anxiety, depression, and disconnection lie. Naturally, this puts us into immediate and intimate contact with our deep-rooted issues. We might want to escape from our pain. Y et, when we can hang in there a little longer, something happens. We regulate our breath and relax our muscles, which calms the agitation that can come from immersion in challenging experiences. We draw our attention inside and become exquisitely present with our issues, our pain. At the same time, we're also in our bodies and in the present moment. And suddenly, or slowly by degrees, our narrative\u2014the story that says \"I am anxiety,\" or \"Depression's a permanent part of me\"\u2014 begins to lose traction and become less compelling. This allows us, even for a moment, an experience of not anxiety or not depression, and the brain and body respond by laying down new \"tracks.\" What's key here is that this new adaptation can take as few as five minutes. And when we do this regularly over time, we develop the emotional muscles to resist the stubborn pull of our reactions. We cease to let them define us. Beyond these benefits, therapeutic yoga, mindfulness, and movement therapy offer something more. They give us a firsthand, embodied experience of our fluctuating emotional landscapes. We can feel how emotions ebb and flow\u2014how they really are short- lived, passing states of awareness. With even a brief interlude of not being anxious or depressed, we can begin to suspect that anxiety and depression are not who we are; they're just powerful emotional patterns that draw us in. We can replace these anxious or depressed emotional patterns with healthier ones. And because yoga's experiential practices involve both the mind and the body, the insight they create isn't simply mental; it's embodied insight, which has a more lasting effect on anxiety and depression. Each year in teacher training, I hold free group clinics for people with anxiety, depression, chronic pain, and other mind-body issues. For a 75-minute span of time, they are not anxious, depressed, or in pain. Faces previously tense with anxiety are, during and after the practice, smoothed with calm. The slow movements and hunched posture of those with depression become infused with energy. The light that shines in their eyes afterward never fails to move me. And this happens through simply entering the body with awareness, and having the faith to stay for a while. The beauty of mindful yoga is that it doesn't require flexibility, strength, or grace. It's an equal- opportunity tool, available to everyone.

From: ellicott, Maryland to diet: an integrative Weight-loss p rogram Reflections on the path to a healthier life.Practice, Practice, Practice I've lost weight many times, but I've never been able to keep it off. But last summer, I was at a point where I knew I had to get in better shape, so I enrolled in The Kripalu Approach to Diet: An Integrative Weight-Loss Program. I had no idea what to expect, but I felt completely welcomed and accepted. I approached the program as a class, and our homework was to practice what we were learning. Aruni suggested we consider yoga, meditation, and journaling, among other things. She encouraged us to try new and different things, so I meditated and wrote in my journal\u2014and I continue to practice both every day. They have made a huge difference for me, and I'm grateful that I was willing to try something new. I knew that when I got home after the five days at Kripalu, I'd have to deal with life's challenges differently. The six weeks of online support, and especially the weekly phone calls with faculty and students, were enormously helpful in reinforcing the need to practice. My most eye-opening discovery that came from the program was that it isn't really a weight thing for me. What I learned was that I've never let myself feel my feelings\u2014I used food to suppress them. Through the program, I learned that \"the best way out is always through,\" and that sums it up for me. Before Kripalu, I didn't know there was a way out. When I got upset, I would eat. Now, I take a deep breath and look at what's happening and acknowledge my feelings. When I choose to have food that I know I need to limit, I practice enjoying what I have and not judging myself for having it. My goal is to feel light and free\u2014today, tomorrow, and into the future. In order to make serious changes in my life, I had to invest in myself, and give myself the opportunity to get some new tools and, most importantly, to use them. I soaked it all in like a sponge. \"Practice\" is the word that encapsulates my Kripalu experience. Y ou take a deep breath, ease into it, and do that over and over, and, eventually, change occurs. 800.741.7353 or kripalu.org | 27800.741.7353 or kripalu.org | 29 Coming back home to yoga My passion for yoga began when I participated in the Kripalu Yoga in the Schools program at my high school in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. I loved knowing there was a time during the day when I would get to decompress and move my body before returning to the hectic environment that is high school. I maintained my yoga practice throughout college in Boston, including during my study abroad. It is in my nature to share my positive energy, ideas, and knowledge with others. I figured a wonderful way to do that was to become a teacher of yoga. A year after I graduated from college, I was at Kripalu for yoga teacher training. Now that I'm a certified Kripalu Yoga teacher, I've come full circle\u2014I've been assisting in Kripalu Yoga in the Schools classes back at my old high school. I find it fascinating to see the transformation in the students as they become increasingly comfortable with themselves and with each other. One of my goals as a yoga teacher is to make yoga more accessible for all kinds of people. I've been exploring offering a class through a local youth project, and I'm also teaching a donation-based community class. It's so inspiring to see people find ease in their bodies and minds. Every time I prepare for and teach a class, I learn more about the yoga tradition and about myself. \u2014Sandra H., Great Barrington, MassachusettsThe true measure of our mission is the impact we have on people's lives, at our retreat center and in the world.

(web code COC-151) BRIAN DELMONICO , former All-American, Big T en champion gymnast and Ironman triathlete, is founder of Circuit of Change, a life-changing system of movement, fitness, and personal evolution. circuitofchange.comThe Kripalu Approach has been developed over decades, in workshops off the mat and in yoga classes on the mat. Thousands of students and classes later, our approach to living skillfully emerges as unique, specific, and profoundly transformational; it informs our way of being in the world. Rooted in the idea of Self-Observation Without Judgment, our model has two primary pillars: radical compassion and the right use of will. These two elements, practiced together, can create sustainable life change in any arena. This model does more than modify behavior; it shifts, at the core, the issues that drive us. For example, in The Kripalu Approach to Diet: An Integrative Weight-Loss Program, the real question becomes not \"How can I change my eating habits?\" but rather \"What am I really hungry for?\" Our relationship with food can express deeper aspects of our process. RADICAL C OMPASSION Cultivating the capacity to notice our behavior, without judgment or expectation, both on and off the mat, opens the doorway to unlimited possibility. Compassion is the key. No change\u2014whether it's around diet, exercise, yoga practice, lifestyle, or relationship\u2014can be sustained through the force of self-discipline alone. Y es, the will is needed, yet our actions must be grounded in radical acceptance. Our human flaws, when accepted with relaxed ease, become the doorway to our true nature. Through the lens of compassion, we quiet our minds and allow our inner wisdom to emerge to support and generate change. RIGHT USE OF WILLThe right use of will is the second essential piece in this model. Obviously, if you want something to be different, you have to change your behavior. How do we best take actions that realign us with this flow of energy and aid us in continuing to access our hearts? Neuroscience tells us that consistency is the driver of brain change, that just five to seven minutes of meditation, done regularly, changes the chemistry of the brain. So often, we overcommit and focus only on the outcome of our experiment. We lose both patience for and sight of the journey itself. That inspiration returns when we instead choose to do less, get quiet, and relax the push around practice. This isn't easy\u2014we are such human do- ers! Returning to human beingness realigns us. SMALL , POWERFUL CHANGES The Kripalu Approach acknowledges small, incremental changes, practiced consistently, as the profound stepping stones of true transformation. There is no getting it \"right,\" no checking things off your to-do list. This is a relaxed yet rigorous journey that cultivates compassion, curiosity, and fascination with your process. For example, in crafting this article, it dawned on me that I could utilize the Kripalu Approach in writing it. As I practiced breathing, relaxing, and being present with my ever-changing attitude (willingness, excitement, resistance, or dread), I found that relaxation and breath were the key to moving forward. The Kripalu Approach is one of mindful experimentation. Breathe. Relax. Feel. Watch. Allow. Show up just as you are. As your actions come into unity with your intentions, all change becomes possible.

Schwartz and Sarah Stewart For everyone, including therapists, non-therapists, and seasoned iFS practitioners. CE credits. The world's religions teach that there is an untarnished essence within us, a Self from which wisdom, healing, and spiritual energy flow. We rarely experience this Self because it is obscured by self-protective psychological mechanisms, or lost in the fear, pain, and shame of past trauma. The internal Family Systems (iFS) model helps you access the Self and bring its natural compassion and confidence into daily life. People who have used iFS report profound shifts in previously constraining feelings and beliefs. iFS introduces you to a detailed map of your psyche, including all subpersonalities and their inner conflicts. The Self then forms healing relationships with each of them. Whether you want to deepen your skills or do personal work, this program\u2014open to therapists, non-therapists, and seasoned iFS practitioners\u2014offers the opportunity for transformative inner exploration and learning. tuItIon $525. add 5 midweek nights room & meals; see page 112.

Who they are: Y uri H. and her son, Michaelangelo Who she is: program development Coordinator at Kripalu From: pittsfield, Massachusetts The Heart of Kripalu In this series, we introduce you to some of the people who make up the Kripalu community\u2014 staff members, teachers, and interns\u2014who are passionate about our mission. A bilingual mom learns the language of yoga I first came to Kripalu because I had a few family members who worked here. I didn't really know what yoga was, but the people at Kripalu seemed so relaxed and connected, and I knew this was exactly where I wanted to be. I'm bilingual\u2014my family came to the United States from Colombia when I was seven years old\u2014and that's something that's valued at Kripalu. When I got a job in the Registrations Department, I was nervous but ecstatic to finally be here. A year later, I joined the Program Development team. Each different role I hold within my position inspires me. I interact on a daily basis not just with programmers and presenters, but also with other departments, and I learn something new every day from each of them. I love knowing that I'm supporting presenters so they can bring their work to Kripalu and impact so many lives. My coworkers are also a huge inspiration to me\u2014their passion for what we do as a team, their creativity, and the support I receive from them, as an employee and as a friend. Being at Kripalu has shown me what it looks like to be authentic, kind, and compassionate, and how to teach my five-year-old son, Michelangelo, what that means. I've learned how to make time for myself, an important lesson when you're from a country where family comes first, before anything\u2014including yourself. At first, I didn't think yoga was for me.

Why do you practice and teach Ayurveda? Ayurveda has dramatically strengthened my health, invigorated my yoga practice, and enhanced my spiritual studies. I feel called to share these ancient healing tools, and I hope to spend my life empowering and encouraging people to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature. What inspires and motivates you? Reading the classic texts of yoga and Ayurveda lights me up with perplexing inquiries, elaborate questions, uplifting perspectives, and grand revelations. I'm hooked. How has Kripalu resonated with you? Kripalu has been my true home and haven. Being a part of this precious community of friends, peers, and teachers ensures continual encouragement to stay on the path of mindful living\u2014which isn't always easy on my own. How do you spend your free time? In the summer, I spend as much time as possible across the street at T anglewood, the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. After a fulfilling day of practicing and teaching at Kripalu, I love picnicking on the lawn, lying under the stars, and listening to the tranquil sounds of the symphony. Connection to nature, meditation on sound, deep relaxation\u2014for me, this is yoga off the mat! with Kripalu faculty Larissa Hall CarlsonOff the mat Find out more about the Kripalu School of Ayurveda on page 18.
