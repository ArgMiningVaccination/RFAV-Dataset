Alarms in hospitals are frequently misunderstood, disregarded, and overridden. The purpose of this study was to address the alarm problem by redesigning, reorganizing, and reprioritizing to better discriminate alarm sounds and displays in a hospital. The investigators concluded that this unique collaboration allowed them to make progress on the alarm problem by making unintuitive leaps, avoiding common missteps, and refuting conventional healthcare approaches.

This study examined how having a family history of dementia and caregiving experience are associated with perceptions about and self-efficacy for dementia preventability. Participants were surveyed whether they had a family member with dementia, and if they need whether they served as a caregiver. Of 1,575 respondents, 71% had a family member with dementia, and of those 42% served as a caregiver. People with a family member with dementia were less likely to believe that dementia is preventable and had lower self-efficacy for dementia prevention. Survey participants who were also caregivers had an even lower perception about dementia preventability. AHRQ-funded; HS022982. Citation: Lee W, Gray SL, Zaslavsky O .

Using the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's disease surveillance system (MDPHnet), the authors examined obesity prevalence in 3 periods from 2018 to 2020 in a fixed cohort of children and adolescents. They found that, although childhood obesity prevalence was rising prior to COVID-19, the prevalence increased by a greater difference in Massachusetts youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. They observed greater increases in obesity prevalence in Black and Hispanic youth, particularly in boys aged 6 to 11 years. AHRQ-funded; HS000063. Citation: Wu AJ, Aris IM, Hivert MF .

This study examined whether children in counties with more pediatricians had fewer emergency department (ED) visits. The authors conducted a cross-sectional study of all ED visits among children younger than 18 years from 6 states. Each additional pediatrician per 1000 children was associated with a 13.7% decrease in ED visits in the state-adjusted model. In the full model however, there was no association. Other factors such as presence of an urgent care facility, high socioeconomic status, urban status and higher proportions of White race and nonpublic insurance were also associated with decreased ED visit rates.

This study's goal was to evaluate the impact of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act on the volume and payer mix of elective spine surgery in the United States. The authors evaluated elective spinal surgeries performed in the U.S. from 2011 to 2016 and included 10 states with expanded Medicaid access and 4 states that did not. They identified 218,648 surgical procedures performed in 10 Medicaid expansion states and 118,693 procedures performed in 4 nonexpansion states. Medicaid expansion was associated with a 17% increase in mean hospital spine surgical volume and a 23% increase in Medicaid volume. Privately insured surgical volumes did not change significantly. This increase indicated improved access to care. AHRQ-funded; HS027075. Citation: Greenberg JK, Brown DS, Olsen MA .

This systematic review/meta-analysis' goal was to assess associations between norovirus outbreak control measures and outcomes in hospitals and long-term care facilities (LTCFs), globally. The authors identified 102 papers describing 162 norovirus outbreaks. Control measures were reportedly implemented in 118 (73%) outbreaks and were associated with 0.6 times smaller patient case counts and 0.7 times shorter durations in hospitals but 1.5, 1.5 and 1.6 times larger overall, resident and staff case counts, respectively, and 1.4 times longer durations in LTCFs. The paper concluded that control measures were likely implemented in response to larger/longer outbreaks in LTCFs rather than causing them, while hospitals' preemptive control measures resulted in smaller/shorter outbreaks.

Among patients hospitalized for influenza pneumonia, the researchers reported the rate of coinfection and distribution of pathogens and also compared outcomes of patients with and without bacterial coinfection. They found that, in a large US inpatient sample hospitalized with influenza and community-acquired pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent cause of bacterial coinfection. Coinfection was associated with worse outcomes and higher costs. AHRQ-funded; HS024277.

The objective of this study was to understand bereaved parent perspectives on technology assistance among children with complex chronic conditions (CCCs). Researchers analyzed data from the cross-sectional Survey of Caring for Children with CCCs. Parents described both benefits and burdens of technology, with two emergent subthemes related to goals of care: technology was necessary to give time for life extension and/or to say goodbye, and technology greatly impacted the child's quality of life and symptoms. The second theme to emergence was complications and regret. The researchers concluded that it is important to understand parents' most goals when supporting decisions about technology assistance for children with CCCs.

J CK, Lion KC, Fisher CL Breaking through barriers: the need for effective research to promote language-concordant communication as a facilitator of equitable emergency care. The authors discuss the issue of individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP) and the high risk for adverse outcomes in the US health care system, especially in the emergency department. They point out that, although professional language interpretation improves the quality of care for these patients, it remains underused. They find few examples in the literature of rigorous interventions to improve quality of care and outcomes for patients with LEP and urge further high-quality research to improve communication with patients with LEP along the continuum of emergency care in order to achieve equity in outcomes.

Researchers used data from the Health and Retirement Study and a structural equation modeling approach to examine whether perceived neighborhood social cohesion and adulthood wealth mediate the relationship between childhood socioeconomic status (SES) and physical activity. They found that perceived neighborhood social cohesion and adulthood wealth have small but statistically significant mediational effects in the relationship between childhood SES and physical activity.

This paper discusses the results of a two-part web-based survey of palliative care clinicians from five academic groups in the United States. The objective was to describe clinicians' assessment practices and factors influencing their approach to quality palliative care in contrast to the National Consensus Project guidelines for palliative care. Nineteen out of 25 invited clinicians completed the survey, including physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. The majority (62%) reported that their usual practice was to tailor the focus of the consultation, mainly due to time limitations and workload, followed by beliefs that comprehensive assessment was unnecessary, and absence of the full interdisciplinary team. Most participants cited reason for consult as factors influencing a tailored approach. Physical symptoms were the most commonly assessed factor (81%), with spiritual and cultural factors least commonly (24% and 19%, respectively) listed. Although most clinicians reported usually tailoring their consultations, mean importance scores for almost all assessment elements were high (mean of 7.1 on a 0-9 importance scale).

This study's purpose was to assess the consistency of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) breast density reporting comparing digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) with digital mammography (DM) and to evaluate density as a breast cancer risk factor when assessed using DM versus DBT. A secondary analysis of data from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium was used from 342,149 women aged 40-79 years who underwent at least two screening mammography examinations less than 36 months apart. There were no significant differences in breast density assessment in pairs consisting of one DM and one DBT examination (57,516 of 74,729 [77%]), two DM and two DBT examinations (20,763 of 26,854). Results were similar when pair analysis was restricted to readings by the same radiologist. The breast cancer hazard ratios (HRs) for breast density were similar for DM and DBT. The HRs for density acquired using DM and DBT, respectively, were 0.55 and 0.37 for almost entirely fat, 1.47 and 1.36 for heterogeneously dense, and 1.72 and 2.05 for extremely dense breasts.

The objective of this study was to compare the impact of the introduction of two distinct sets of star ratings, quality of care, and patient experience, on home health agency (HHA) selection. The investigators concluded that the introduction of quality of care and patient experience stars were associated with changes in HHA selection; however, the strength of these relationships was weaker than observed in other health care settings where a single star rating was reported.

The authors assessed how patient, hospital, and community characteristics explain the safety-net hospital (SNH)/non-SNH disparity in postpartum readmission rates. Using HCUP data, they found that higher postpartum readmission rates at SNHs versus non-SNHs were largely due to differences in the patient mix rather than hospital factors. They recommended hospital initiatives to reduce the risk of postpartum readmissions among SNH patients. They concluded that improving factors that contribute to the disparity, including underlying health conditions and health inequities associated with race, will require enduring investments in public health.

This study evaluated the cost utility of lifelong immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IRT) versus hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) to treat agammaglobulinemia. This economic evaluation used Markov analysis to model the base-case scenario of a patient aged 12 months to receive lifelong IRT vs matched sibling donor (MSD) or matched unrelated donor (MUD) HSCT. In this evaluation, lifelong IRT cost more than HSCT ($1,512,946 compared with $563,776 and 17.18 IRT over HSCT generated higher incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), it exceeded US willing-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. However, IRT prevented at least 2488 premature deaths per 10,000 microsimulations compared with HSCT treatment. But when the annual IRT price was reduced from $60,145 to below $29,469, IRT became the cost-effective utility of lifelong immunoglobulin replacement therapy vs hematopoietic stem cell Treatments, Evidence-Based Practice Carroll AR, McCoy AB, Modes K Decreasing pre-procedural fasting times in hospitalized children. The purpose of this study was to decrease pre-procedural clear liquid fasting time from 10 hours, 13 minutes to 5 hours for pediatric hospital medicine (PHM) patients. The study included all children admitted to the PHM service at a quaternary care children's hospital with an NPO (nil per os) order associated with a procedure requiring general anesthesia or sedation from November 2, 2017 to September 19, 2021. The study found that after implementation of a SmartPhrase in the NPO order, there was special cause variation resulting in a centerline shift from a mean of 10 h 13 min to 6 h 37 min. After implementation of a hospital-wide change to the NPO order format, another centerline shift to 6 h 7 min occurred and has been sustained for 6 months. The study concluded that in hospitalized children, higher reliability interventions and quality improvement methods safely reduced the mean pre-procedural fasting time. AHRQ-funded; HS026122.

This retrospective cohort study identified term and preterm infants at lowest risk of culture-confirmed early-onset sepsis (EOS) using delivery characteristics and also determined antibiotic use among them. The study cohort included term and preterm infants born 2009 to 2014 with blood culture with or without cerebrospinal fluid culture obtained 72 hours after birth. Low EOS risk criteria included: cesarean delivery, without labor or membrane rupture before delivery, and no antepartum concern for intraamniotic infection or nonreassuring fetal status. Among 53,575 births, 7549 (14.1%) were evaluated and 41 (0.5%) of those infants had EOS. For 1121 evaluated infants there were low-risk delivery characteristics and none had EOS. Duration of antibiotics administered to infants born with and without low-risk characteristics was not different. AHRQ-funded; HS027468.

This study's aim was to develop a patient-reported outcome measure for febrile infants 60 days or younger evaluated in the emergency department. This 3-part study included: 1) individual, semistructured interviews with parents of febrile infants 60 days or younger to generate potential items for the measure; 2) expert review with pediatric emergency medicine physicians and member checking with parents, and 3) cognitive interviews with a new sample of parents who gave feedback and rated the measure's ease of use on a 4-point scale. In part 1 24 parents of 21 infants were interviewed. The interviews revealed several themes: parents' experiences with medical care, communication, and decision making; parents' emotions, particularly worry, fear, and stress; the infant's outcomes valued by parents; and the impact of the infant's illness on the family, from which 22 potential items for inclusion were identified. In part 2, 10 items were revised for clarity based on feedback from physicians and parents. In part 3, the authors further revised the measure for clarity and added an item. The final measure included 23 items. AHRQ-funded; HS026006. Citation: Aronson PL, Fleischer E, Schaeffer P .

The purpose of this study was to test whether out-of-pocket costs and negotiated hospital prices for childbirth change after enrollment in high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) and whether price effects differ in markets with more hospitals. Administrative medical claims data from three large commercial insurers with plans in all U.S. states was provided by the Health Care Cost Institute. Findings showed that prices for childbirth in markets with more hospitals decreased after HDHP switch due to lower hospital prices for HDHPs relative to prices at those same hospitals for non-HDHPs.

Keywords: Labor Delivery, Health Insurance, Healthcare Costs, Women Mitchell JM, Gresenz CR Documenting horizontal integration among urologists who treat prostate cancer. The purpose of this study was to create and employ a methodology to document changes in physician practice structure resulting from horizontal mergers among urology groups. To identify all urologists who treated men with prostate cancer, the researchers integrated cancer registry records from four large states with Medicare Part B claims. Information from SK & A surveys and extensive internet searches was added to assign a practice structure to each urologist-year from 2005-2014. The study found that horizontal merging among small urology groups resulted in a strong increase in the percentage of urologists who belong to large urology practices with ownership in anatomical pathology services and/or intensity modulated radiation therapy. By 2014, small percentages (7%-16%) of New Jersey, Florida and Texas urologists were employed by a health system, whereas more than half of New Jersey urologists and about 43% of urologists in Florida and Texas were members of large practices. This is compared to California urologists of which only 17.5% had ownership in intensity modulated radiation therapy and/or pathology services. The researchers highlighted that the study indicators of market share of urologists connected with each practice structure type were highly correlated with indicators of market share based on quantity of prostate cancer events treated by each type of practice structure.
