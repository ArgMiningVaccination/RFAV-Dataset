Sanford Health completes a community health needs assessment every three years. This process helps identify unmet health needs in the community, and allows us to then strategically plan how to best address those needs. The assessment is well aligned with Sanford's vision to improve the human condition. From December 2020 to February 2021, members of the community were invited to complete a survey to help identify unmet health needs across of range of social determinants of health. These include economic well -being, transportation, children and youth, the aging population, safety, access to services, and mental and behavioral health. Sanford Health and the NDSU Center f or Social Research partnered to analyze data from the primary survey research along with key secondary data points from County Health Rankings. Sanford also facilitated discussions with key stakeholders in each community to help prioritize the identified needs. After completing this year's assessment, Sanford Westbrook will address the following health needs in a formalized implementation strategy for the 2022 -2024 time period: - Mental Health - Access to Health Care Providers The CHNA process also highlights the many s trengths, support, and resources available to residents of our community. This report includes an overview of the community assets that are offered to address various community health needs. Additionally, we have included an impact report detailing progre ss made to date with our 2019 implementation strategies. Sanford Westbrook is grateful to the community members who participated in this year's assessment process. We appreciate your commitment to the health and wellness of our community, and to those wh o live and work here. Working together, we can continue to improve the quality of life for all.

It is a community -owned facility leased to Sanford Health Network. Originally known as Henry Schmidt Memorial Hospital, Sanford Westbrook was built in 1950 and through a comprehensive community effort was remodeled and expanded into the current single -site health care facility that includes an attached medical clinic and 21 -unit senior housing facility. The medical center offers emergency services. The Sanford Westbrook service area i ncludes the communities of Currie, Dovray, Storden and Westbrook and covers parts of Cottonwood, Redwood and Murray counties with a combined population of 3,600. It is located in an area classified as a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) and Manpower Underserved Area (MUA). Sanford Westbrook employs approximately 58 individuals. CHNA Purpose The purpose of a community health needs assessment is to develop a global view of the population's health and the prevalence of disease and health issues within our community. Findings from the assessment serve as a catalyst to align expertise and develop a Community Investment/Community Benefit plan of action. There is great intrinsic value in a community health needs assessment when it serves to validate and justify the not -for-profit status and create opportunity to identify and address public health iss ues from a broad perspective. A community health needs assessment identifies the community's strengths and areas for improvement. A community health needs assessment is critical to a vital Community Investment/Community Benefit Program that builds on commu nity assets, promotes collaboration, improves community health, and promotes innovation and research. 5 dba Sanford Westbrook Medical Center EIN #46 -0388596 Regulatory Requirements Federal regulations stipulate that non- profit medical centers conduct a community health needs assessment at least once every thr ee years and prioritize the needs for the purpose of implementation strategy development and submission in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code 501(r) (3). The Internal Revenue Code 501(r) (3) requires that each hospital must have: (1) conducted a comm unity health needs assessment in the applicable taxable year; (2) adopted an implementation strategy for meeting the community health needs identified in the assessment; and (3) created transparency by making the information widely available. The regulati ons stipulate that each medical center take into account input from persons who represent the broad interests of the community. Hospitals are required to seek at least one state, local, tribal or regional government public health department or state Office of Rural Health with knowledge, information or expertise relevant to the health needs of the community. Non -profit hospitals are required to seek input from members of medically underserved, low income, and minority populations in the community, or organ izations serving or representing the interest of such populations, and underserved populations experiencing disparities or at risk of not receiving adequate care as a result of being uninsured or due to geographic, language or financial or other barriers. The community health needs assessment includes a process to identify community resources that are available to address the assessed needs and to prioritize the needs. Hospitals are to address each and every assessed need or explain why they are not addressing the needs. Once the needs have been identified and prioritized, hospitals are required to develop an implementation strategy to address the top needs. The strategies are reported on the IRS 990 and a status report must be provided each year on IRS f orm 990 Schedule H. Finally, hospitals are to be transparent with the findings and make the written CHNA report available to anyone who asks for the report. Sanford places the CHNA reports and the implementation strategies on the Sanford website. Hospital s are required to keep three cycles of assessments on the web site. The 20 22 report will be Sanford's fourth report cycle since the requirements were enacted in 2010. Sanford extended a good faith effort to engage all of the aforementioned community repre sentatives in the survey process. We worked closely with public health experts throughout the assessment process. Public comments and responses to the community health needs assessment and the implementation strategies are welcome on the Sanford website or contact can be made at https://www.sanfordhealth.org/about/community -health -needs -assessment. No community comments or questions regarding the previous CHNA have been made via the website link or email address. 6 dba Sanford Westbrook Medical Center EIN #46 -0388596 CHNA Process Sanford Health, in coordination with public health experts, community leaders, and other health care providers, within the local community and across Sanford's care delivery footprint, developed a multi -faceted assessment program designed to establish multiple pathways for health needs assessment. Limitations The findings in this study provide an overall snapshot of behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions of residents living in the community. A good faith effort was made to secure input from a broad base of the community. H owever, gaps in individual data sources may arise when comparing certain demographic characteristics (i.e., age, gender, income, minority status) with the current population estimates. For example, these gaps may occur due to the difficulty in contacting them through the survey process. To mitigate limitations, the CHNA evaluates community health from several perspectives; a stakeholder and community survey, meetings with community leaders that have special knowledge and expertise regarding populations, s econdary data sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau and County Health Rankings, public comments from previous assessments, and institutional knowledge by Sanford employees locally and across the Sanford enterprise. Community and Stakeholder Survey Memb ers of the community were asked a series of questions through an online survey designed in partnership with health experts and public health officials across the Sanford footprint to understand the needs of the community based upon the UW Population Health model. Each respondent was asked to rate community drivers from poor to excellent. Any response other than excellent was offered a follow up opportunity to comment on the reason. Respondents were also asked a series of questions specific to their health c are access, health care quality, barriers to care, travel to care, and insurance. The survey was sent to a sample of the Cottonwood County, MN population through Qualtrics, a qualified vendor. The full set of questions is available in the appendix. To fur ther promote community involvement the survey was also sent to community stakeholders and elected officials with knowledge and connections amongst medically underserved, low income, or minority populations. Stakeholders were asked to complete the instrumen t as a resident of the community and forward the survey to their respective populations for greater involvement. The survey was highlighted in a Sanford Health News article (https://news.sanfordhealth.org/community/health- needs -assessment -survey/) and prom oted through social media via paid communications. The paid communications yielded 344,300 impressions and 1,150 completed surveys across the system. Survey data for the local community should be considered directional and best utilized in conjunction wit h additional data. A total of 48 respondents from the CHNA survey area completed the survey. 6,748 total respondents from across the Sanford footprint completed the survey. Consultation with Public Health, Community Leaders, Other Health SystemsCommunity & Stakeholder SurveySecondary DataAsset MappingLocal Community dba Sanford Westbrook Medical Center EIN #46 -0388596 Secondary Data County Health Rankings is based upon the UW Population Health model and serves as the main secondary data source utilized for the community health needs assessment. Alignment of the survey and secondary data within the UW Population Health model allows for greater connection of the data sets. Population data are sourced t o the U.S. Census Bureau. Additional data sources may be used and are sourced within the document. Health Needs Identification Methodology The Center for Social Research at North Dakota State University was retained to develop the initial community health needs list for each community and builds upon their involvement during the previous cycle. The following methodology was used to develop the significant health needs presented later in the report: Survey data was stratified into representative groups base d upon population: large urban communities, medium sized communities, and rural communities. The three groups were analyzed separately. Westbrook is included with Bagley, MN; and MN To identify community health care needs, each community's score by question was compared to the average stratified composite of the comparative group. For example, if the composite stratified system -wide average score is 4 and an individual community's average response was 2.5, that would suggest an issue of concern and a potential community health care need to be highlighted in the summary findings. Upon determination o f a potential strength or need, County Health Rankings (https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/) and responses from open- ended questions provided additional insights into the drivers of the respective needs. A similar methodology was also used to provide add itional insights into findings from County Health Rankings data with relevant health needs highlighted in the survey findings. Health needs identified through either the survey or County Health Rankings data but not both were also included in the findings . Community Asset Mapping Asset mapping was conducted to find the community resources available to address the assessed needs. Each unmet need was researched to determine what resources were available to address the needs. Once gaps were determined, the prioritization exercise followed with key stakeholder groups determining the top needs. Community Stakeholder Meetings Community stakeholders were invited to attend a presentation of the findings of the CHNA assessment . Facilitated discuss ion commenced and each participant was asked to consider the needs identified above that should be further developed into implementation strategies. Health needs identified during the previous cycle but not raised through the survey or County Health Rankings were also considered. The meeting served to inform the group of the findings but also served as a catalyst to drive collaboration. 8 dba Sanford Westbrook Medical Center EIN #46 -0388596 The facilitated discussion sought to inform on several aspects: What are the biggest challenges currently with these nee ds in the community? Does the community have gaps in services, access, outreach, etc.? Opportunities - where can we have greatest impact in addressing these needs? Which are most urgent in nature? Is there any work being done of the identified needs? What are the resources currently not utilized within the community that could address this topic? Which fall within the purview of healthcare system and which do not? Can the non- healthcare needs be shared with other entities or organizations? Is there an ything you consider an urgent need that we have not discussed? Two health needs were identified by consensus during the meeting for inclusion in the implementation plan. The needs were confirmed with participants prior to the meeting's conclusion. Consens us was based upon all factors, including primary and secondary data, input from the community stakeholder meeting, and scalability of current hospital programs and resources to address the identified needs efficiently and effectively. All identified needs not addressed in the implementation plan were shared with other community partners for action. Requests for survey data and other CHNA assets by public health organizations, governmental bodies, and community partners were and continue to be supported. Community Definition Cottonwood County, MN is included in the data analysis and represents a majority of volumes to Sanford Westbrook. No population was excluded from the process. 9 dba Sanford Westbrook Medical Center EIN #46 -0388596 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Community Health Summary CHNA respondents were asked to rate various community health issues and their personal health and wellness on the following 1 to 5 scale: 1= poor, 2= fair, 3= good, 4= very good, 5= excellent. Overall, perceptions among CHNA respondents in the Wes tbrook area regarding the following community health issues were positive. Long -term nursing care and senior housing quality (average score=3.50) Access to healthy foods (average score=3.72) Access to exercise opportunities (average score=3.78) Childcar e and preschool quality (average score=3.42) Health care quality (average score=3.47) Community safety (average score=3.76) Environmental health (average score=3.84) When asked about their personal health, CHNA respondents in the Westbrook area rated their current health and wellness as good (average score=3.41) and their current ability to access health care services as very good (average score=3.87) \u2014 and both scores were higher than the comparison group average. CHR data indicate that Cottonw ood County is in the lower, middle range of Minnesota counties in terms of overall health. The following areas of concern were identified for further discussion (in no particular order). Significant Health Needs Identified Access to Health Care Providers Access to affordable, quality health care is important to physical, social, and mental health. Health insurance helps individuals and families access needed primary care, specialists, and emergency care, but does not ensure access on its own \u2014it is also ne cessary for providers to offer affordable care, be available to treat patients, and be in relatively close proximity to patients. CHNA respondents in the Westbrook area rated their ability to access health care as very good (average score=3.87) and higher than the average of similar -sized market areas served by Sanford Health. In addition, 95 percent of respondents said they currently have a primary care physician or provider they see for general health issues, which is the highest percentage among similar markets. However, when Westbrook area respondents were asked about the most important health care issues impacting their community, access to health care services and providers was their biggest concern (more so than COVID -19 and cost issues). In additi on, 16 percent of CHNA respondents in the Westbrook area said they or a family member needed care in the past year but did not receive it and 73 percent of respondents traveled to receive health care services outside their community in the past three years - both percentages were higher than the comparison group average. When respondents were asked why they traveled for care, the main reason was that they needed a specialist or the needed service was not available locally (50%) - which was followed by needing b etter or higher quality care (22%) and a physician's referral (22%). When asked which health care services they would like to see offered or improved in their community, most respondents said general surgery (62%), followed by 39 percent who said dental ca re. Three in ten CHNA respondents in the Westbrook area said walk -in or urgent care (31%), labor and delivery (31%), and family medicine or primary care (31%) were most needed . 10 dba Sanford Westbrook Medical Center EIN #46 -0388596 According to County Health Rankings (CHR) , in the Westbrook area, there are 1,410 people for every one primary care physician and 1,599 people for every one dentist (ratios which are similar to the comparison group average). However, CHR data also indicate that when compared to similar markets, the Westbrook area has a lower than average mammography screening rate (47%) and flu vaccination rate (39%). Access to care was discussed at the local stakeholder meeting with a heavy emphasis on the need for dental health services in the community. Access is very limited in terms of afford ability. Some providers are available , but are not accepting new patients that are on medical assistance. The group discussed various options for programming with local schools, partnerships with other entities, and parent education. Access to dental hea lth services was a clear need and the group agreed it should be included as a top priority in the next 3 -year implementation plan.

It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood1. When CHNA respondents in the Westbrook area were asked which health care services they would like to see off ered or improved in their community, nearly one -third said behavioral and mental health services (31%) and 23 percent said addiction treatment. According to CHR, adults in the Westbrook market average 3.7 mentally unhealthy days each month and 12 percent o f adults average at least 14 days of mental distress per month - both rates are similar to the comparison group average. In the Westbrook area there are 800 people for every one mental health provider (which is similar to the comparison group average). The need for mental health care and services was a major topic of discussion at the local stakeholder meeting. The group discussed expanding access to virtual care as one avenue to reach more people in need of mental and behavioral health services. All seg ments of the population have a need , but in particular, the group discussed elderly and youth populations. There was broad consensus to elevate mental health for inclusion in the implementation plan. 1 U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, MentalHealth.gov.

CHNA respondents in the Westbrook area rated access to exercise opportunities as good (ave rage score=3.78) and access to healthy foods as good (average score=3.72), and both scores were higher than the comparison group average. In addition, CHR data indicate that 78 percent of people in the Westbrook market have access to exercise opportunities , which is the highest percentage when compared to similar -sized markets served by Sanford Health. However, CHR data also indicate that 13 percent of adults in the Westbrook area have diabetes, 38 percent of adults have obesity, and 14 percent of residents are low -income and do not live close to a grocery store; all three percentages are higher than the comparison group average. While important, the stakeholder group felt current efforts in this regard were sufficient and that other health needs were more urgent at this time. Sanford Westbrook will continue to emphasize physical activity and nutrition with patients and the community at large, especially as it relates to chronic disease prevention.

While CHNA respondents in the Westbrook ar ea rated community safety concerns as good (average score=3.76), the average safety score for Westbrook was lower than the comparison group average. In addition, CHR data indicate that the rates of motor vehicle crash deaths (24 per 100,000 people), alcoho l-impaired driving deaths (36%), and juvenile arrests (48 per 1,000 youth) in the Westbrook area are higher than the comparison group average. The stakeholder meeting discussion determined that community safety, while important, is not a top priority hea lth need and that other needs were currently more urgent. Sanford Westbrook provides behavioral health services locally for those suffering from addiction and will work with other community partners as needed to address community safety issues.

People interact with their physical environment through the air they breathe, water they drink, houses they live in, and the transportation they access to travel to work and school. Poor physical environment can affect our ability and that of our families and nei ghbors to live long and healthy lives. Specifically, clean air and water are prerequisites for health. Poor air and water quality can be particularly detrimental to vulnerable populations such as the very young, the elderly, and those with chronic health c onditions. 13 dba Sanford Westbrook Medical Center EIN #46 -0388596 While CHNA respondents in the Westbrook area rated the environmental health of their community as very good (average score=3.84), the average score was lower than the comparison group average. In addition, CHR data indicate that the Westbrook a rea has the highest concentration of air pollution- particulate matter (8.5 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter) among similar -sized markets served by Sanford Health. Environmental Health was discussed at the local stakeholder meeting but was not included as a top priority in the Implementation Plan. Stakeholders felt this was not the most urgent need the community faces at this time, and also indicated that Sanford does not currently have the competencies or capacity to effectively address th e environmental issues in the region. Local Asset Mapping Environmental Health Resources: CDC air quality resources, https://www.cdc.gov/air/resources.htm Environmental Protection Agency, https://www.epa.gov/ City of Westbrook, 556 1st Ave, Westbrook Cottonwood Soil and Water Conservation District, 220 10th St, Windom Affordable Housing There is a strong and growing evidence base linking stable and affordable housing to health. As housing costs have outpaced local incomes, households not only struggle to acquire and maintain adequate shelter, but also face difficult trade- offs in meeting other basic needs. When the majority of a paycheck goes toward the rent or mortgage, it can be difficult to afford doctor visits, healthy foods, utility bills, and reliable transportation to work or school. This can, in turn, lead to increased stress level s and emotional strain. CHNA respondents in the Westbrook area rated the availability of affordable housing in their community as less than good (average score=2.98). When asked to explain why they rated community access to affordable housing the way they did, respondents cited an overall lack of affordable units to meet the need based on incomes in the community. In addition, CHR data indicate that 12 percent of households in the Westbrook area have severe housing problems (i.e., overcrowded, high housin g costs, lack of kitchen facilities, or lack of plumbing facilities), a rate which is higher than the comparison group average. The stakeholder group discussed a ffordable housing , particularly the lack of inventory and the lack of affordable options. Howe ver, housing is not included in the Implementatio n Plan as the group did not consider it a high priority health need at this time . Stakeholders mentioned that other organizations in the community are better equipped to address the need.

Public transportation services play an important role for p eople who are unable to drive, people without access to personal vehicles, children, individuals with disabilities, and older adults 2. CHNA respondents in the Westbrook area rated community access to daily transportation as less than good (average score =2.90). When asked to explain why they rated community access to daily transportation the way they did, CHNA responses highlighted limited to no public transportation options available. Responses also indicated that, where options exist, routes and hours a re limited, making access to health care appointments difficult. The local stakeholder meeting did not include substantive discussion around transportation and public transportation is not included in the Implementation Plan . The group indicated that it is not a top health need at this time and that other local partners are addressing the issue. Sanford Westbrook provides care navigators and social workers to help patients obtain needed services in the community. Local Asset Map ping No public transportation options available. Employment and Economic Opportunities Economic factors, such as income and employment can significantly affect how well and how long we live. These factors affect our ability to make healthy choices, afford medical care and housing, and manage stress. CHNA survey results indicate that respon dents in the Westbrook area rated the employment and economic opportunities in their community as less than good (average score=2.81) and lower than any other community health issue. When asked to explain why they rated these opportunities as they did, res ponses focused on fewer businesses and job opportunities in smaller communities, forcing many to drive long distances to find work. This lower economic rating is also reflected in respondent concerns about health care. When CHNA respondents in the Westbroo k area were asked about their biggest health care concerns for themselves and their family (concerns they face on a regular basis), cost and the ability to afford health care was their top concern. CHR data indicate that 4 percent of adults in the Westbro ok area are unemployed, which is slightly higher than the comparison group average. CHR data also indicate that the median household income in the Westbrook area ($53,725) is lower than the comparison group average and 48 percent of children are eligible f or free - or reduced- price lunch (a percentage which is higher than the comparison group average). Employment and economic opportunities were not substantively discussed by local stakeholders. The group did not elevate employment and economic opportunitie s for inclusion in the Implementation Plan as the stakeholder group indicated that other organizations, including those listed in the asset map, are addressing the need . Sanford Westbrook will share the findings of this survey with community partners and w ork with local entities as appropriate. 2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Office of the Associate Director for Policy and Strategy, Population Health and Healthcare Office.

Stakeholders felt this was not a top health need, and also indicated that Sanford does not currently have the competencies or capacity to effectively address the environmen tal issues in the region. Affordable Housing: Affordable housing is not included in the Implementation Plan as the stakeholder group indicated while important, housing is not a top health priority at this time and that other organization s, including tho se listed in the asset map, are addressing the need.

EVALUATION OF 2019 -2021 CHNA Priority 1: Wellness Goal: Improve physical health, chronic disease and overall wellness Strategy: Utilize medical nutrition therapy services for patients with chronic disease and weight management needs. Increase referrals to the RN Health Coach. Expand Sanford fit program across the community. Dietician and health coach services - Dietician and RN Health Coach Services continued to be offered in 2020 as needed. There were 5 in -person dietician visits in 2020 and zero dietician telemed visits. Our RN Health Coach had 152 visits in 2020. Community education - staff attended local HS basketball games in February 2020 (for the 2nd year in a row) to share heart health information with the community. Staff also worked with A.C.E. to provide a Bone Builders class two times a we ek and a Matter of Balance class periodically for area seniors at Peterson Estates (senior living facility attached to Sanford Westbrook) into March. In March, all community education programs were put on pause due to COVID 19. Unfortunately, no other comm unity education events were held in 2020. Sanford fit program - 2020 saw staff continue the Sanford fit program, which focuses on healthy lifestyle choices to prevent childhood obesity, with the Westbrook Walnut Grove Elementary 4th grade class. Unfortuna tely, the 2020 session was cut short due to COVID19 and the schools going to distance learning. Resources for at home learning and exercise were provided to the teachers. The 4th graders took a pre- test, but were unable to take the post -test, so we were unable to measure their learning from the program. Priority 2: Mental Health and Substance Abuse Goal: Community members are aware of the services that are available for mental health and behavioral health Strategy: Work with community partners to create new options for mental health and behavioral health services. Promote services to create an awareness of options for community members. 20 dba Sanford Westbrook Medical Center EIN #46 -0388596 Continued awareness campaigns for telemedicine services and local behavioral health services began in 2020, but were qu ickly halted in March due to COVID19. Yet, provider referrals were a major factor in the continued use of our in- house behavioral health services. Behavioral Health providers in Westbrook saw 27 new referrals in 2020 and a grand total of 752 visits for the year.
