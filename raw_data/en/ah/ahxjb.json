Binding to SH -/ seleno - proteins involved in protection against oxidative stress has been defined as the Molecular Initiating Event (MIE). Production, binding and degradation of Reactive Oxygen Radi cals (ROS) are tightly regulated, and an imbalance between production and protection may cause oxidative stress, which is common to many toxicity pathways. Oxidative stress may lead to an imbalance in glutamate neurotransmission, which is involved in learn ing and memory. Oxidative stress may also cause cellular injury and death. During brain development and in particular during the establishment of neuronal connections and networks, such perturbations may lead to functional impairment in learning and memory . Neuroinflammation (Resident cell activation; Increased pro -inflammatory mediators) is triggered early in cell injury cascades and is considered as an exacerbating factor. The weight -of-evidence supporting the relationship between the described key events is based mainly on developmental effects observed after an exposure to the heavy metal, mercury, known for its strong affinity to many SH -/seleno -containing proteins, but in particular to those having anti -oxidant properties, such as glutathione (GSH). Th e overall assessment of this AOP is considered as strong, based on the biological plausibility, the empirical support and on the essentiality of the Key Events (KEs), which are moderate to strong, since blocking, preventing or attenuating an upstream KE is mitigating the downstream KE. The gap of knowledge is mainly due to limited quantitative evaluations, impeding thus the development of predictive models. 1 Contents Background ................................ ................................ of Quantitative Consideration ................................ ................................ for Potential Applications of the AOP (optional) ................................ ......................... 18 Appendix 1 - MIE, KEs AO ................................ ................................ ................................

Crit Rev Toxicol 45(1), 83 -91. The process of inflammation is common to many tissues and can be described by several KEs, as proposed in a dedicated workshop (Villeneuve et al., 2018). Brain inf lammation called Neuroinflammation can be described by the two common KEs: Tissue resident cell, activation and pro-inflammatory mediators, increased. However, Neuroinflammation is a concept accepted by the regulators and is found in the whole literature d escribing brain inflammation. Therefore, in accord with the external reviewers, we decided to use the KE Neuroinflammation for building the KERs of this AOP, but we introduced in the list of the KEs the two KEs common to the inflammatory process, as propos ed in Villeneuve et al., 2018.

Pre-natal and post-natal exposure may have long-term consequences, i.e. not detected immediately at the end of the exposure period. Such effects on visuospatial memory for example have been described on child development in communities with chronic low level mercury exposure (Castoldi et al., 2008a; Debes et al., 2006; Grandjean et al., 2014; Lam et al., 2013). The aim of this AOP is to capture the KEs and the KERs that occur after binding to thiol - and s elenol groups of proteins involved in protection against oxidative stress, the MIE, and impairment in learning and memory, the AO, which is a neurotoxicity marker belonging to the OECD regulatory tool box. The chemical initiators used for the empirical support are methylmercury and mercury chloride, and acrylamide. Data are most extensive for mercury as stressor during development; data for acrylamide are much more limited and restricted to some KEs. Chronic, low-dose prenatal MeHg exposure from maternal consumption of fish has been associated with endpoints of neurotoxicity in children, including poor performance on neurobehavioral tests, particularly on tests of attention, fine-motor function, language, visual -spatial abilities (e.g., drawing), and verbal memory (NRC, 2000). However, it is important to note that some uncertainties remain about the effects of low dose of mercury during brain development (Grandjean et al., 1999). Epidemiological studies in Seychelles on prenatal exposure through fish consumption did not evidenced adverse effects on memory when analyses were performed at 22 and 24 years (Van Wyngaarden et al., 2017), whereas similar experiments made in the Faroe Islands revealed dysfunctions in language, attention and memory at 7 years (Grandjean et al., 1997). And a clear association was observed between mercury cord blood level and memory deficit (Grandjean et al., 1997; Debes et al., 2006). Castoldi and coworkers (2008) proposed that modulating factors, such as diet, nutrition, gender , pattern of exposure and co -exposure could explain the discrepancies of these epidemiological studies. Nevertheless, there are experimental evidences showing that the neurocognitive domain, in particular dentate gyrus, hippocampus and cortex are susceptible to the neurotoxicity of mercury in the developing brain (Sokolowski et al., 2011, 2013; Ceccatelli et al., 2013); therefore, we focus on impairment in learning and memory as the AO. Some -SH- or -SeH-containing proteins involved in protection a gainst oxidative stress have been demonstrated to be inhibited by MeHg either in vitro or in vivo , but a causal relationship has not been established between these inhibitory effects and the final pathological events (Oliveira, 2017). However, the analysis of the essentiality of the KEs and of the weight of evidence for the KERs supports a plausible mechanistic link between the MIE and the AO. Domain of Applicability Life Stage Applicability Life Stage Evidence During brain development Taxonomic Applicability Term Scientific Term Evidence Links rat Rattus norvegicus sapiens Moderate NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id= 9606) Sex Applicability Sex Evidence Male Female This AOP is mainly focused on the developmental period, although it cannot be excluded that long -term exposure in adult may trigger a similar cascade of KEs leading also to impairment in learning and memory, as observed in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (Mutter et al., 2004). While no specific sex differences have been analyzed/described for most KEs, Cu rtis and coworkers (2010) observed a higher level of TNF -a in hippocampus of male prairie wolf than in female, both treated for 10 weeks with inorganic mercury, in the form of HgCl 2; whereas Zhang and coworkers (2013) found a higher neuroinflammatory respo nse associated with altered social behavior in female mice offspring than in male, following gestational exposure to HgCl 2. However, after developmental methylmercury exposure, long -lasting behavioral alterations were more prominent in males (Ceccatelli et al., 2013; Castoldi et al., 2008b). These discrepancies may be due to sex differences in kinetics or susceptibility (Vahter et al., 2006). Essentiality of the Key Events High (Strong) Moderate Low (Weak) Support for Essentiality of KEs Defining Question Are downstream KEs and/or the AO prevented if an upstream KE is blocked ? Direct evidence from specifically designed experimental studies illustrating essentiality for at least one of the important KEs (e.g. stop/reversibility studies, antagonism, knock out models, etc.) Indirect evidence that sufficient modification of an expected modulating factor attenuates or augments a KE leading to increase in KE down or AO No or contradictory experimental evidence on the essentiality of any of the KEs KE1 Decreased protection against oxidative stress HIGH RATIONALE: The fact that a decrease in anti-oxidant properties causes oxidative stress is well accepted. In addition, experimental evidences of knocking out proteins involved in protection against oxidative stress incresed the susceptibilty to oxidative stress. KE2 Oxidative stress HIGH RATIONALE: The deleterious consequences of oxidative stress are well accepted in various animal models. Oxygen radical scavengers, such as glutathione, catalase, selenium and cysteine can block the deleterious oxidative stress. KE3 Glutamate dyshomeostasis HIGH RATIONALE: Glutamate is the main excitatory transmitter, and is involved in memory processes, it is well accepted that perturbation of glutamate homeostasis has deleterious functional consequences. Disruption of glutamate signaling is thought to play a role, at least in part, in the etiology underlying several neurodevelopmental disorders, including memory dysfunction. KE4 Cell Injury/death, increased HIGH RATIONALE: Cell injury/death is a highly converging node in AOPs. Decrease in synaptic connectivity or cell loss will in turn induce perturbations in the establishment of neuronal connections and trigger inflammatory responses, which through a feedback loop can exacerbate this KE. Therefore, prevention of cell injury/death by anti -oxidant or by inhibitors of NMDA receptors prevents the downstream KEs. KE5 Neuroinflammatio n KE5' Tissue resident cell activation KE5'' Pro- inflammatory mediators, increased MODERATE RATIONALE: It is widely accepted in different experimental animal models that the use of minocycline, an antibiotic, which blocks microglial reactivity has protective effects, as have other interferences with any inflammatory mediators. However, we rate the essentiality of this KE as moderate given the complexity of the neuroinflammatory response, having either protective/reparative or aggravating consequences, KE6 Decreased network formation and function HIGH RATIONALE: Glutamate neurotransmission is an important mechanism underlying memory function (for review: Featherstone, 2010). During brain development, glutamate has also trophic effects, by stimulating BDNF production or through the activation of the different glutamate receptors. The trophic effect of glutamate receptor activation is developmental stage -dependent and may play an important role in determining the selective survival of neurons that made proper connections (Balazs, 2006). AO Impairment of learning and memory HIGH RATIONALE: Impairment in learning and memory is a converging KE in several AOPs related to brain development. Regarding this AOP and its chemical initiators, it was shown that the neurocognitive domain, in particular dentate gyrus, hippocampus and cortex are susceptible to the neurotoxicity of mercury in the developing brain (Sokolowski et al., 2011, 2013; Ceccatelli et al., 2013). Chronic, low-dose prenatal MeHg exposure from maternal consumption of fish has been associated with endpoints of neurotoxicity in children, including poor performance on neurobehavioral tests, particularly on tests of attention, fine-motor function, language, visual -spatial abilities (e.g., drawing), and verbal memory (NRC, 2000). Prenatal MeHg exposure is associated with childhood memory and learning deficits, particularly visual memory performance in school -aged children (Orenstein, 2014). Weight of Evidence Summary Dose -response and temporal concordance of KEs There is no study where all KEs are measured simultaneously after exposure to several doses, impeding a dose-response and concordance analysis. In one single study (in blue in the table), three downstream KEs were measured following pre-natal exposure to methylmercury. Comparisons of all animal studies show that doses used are ranging from 0.5 - 5 mg/kg; but dose -response was seldom performed. In these studies, the time (pre -natal, post -natal, lactation,...) and duration of exposure are quite diverse and no analysis of brain mercury content was made, so it is not possible to compare doses between studies. Therefore, based on the present data, it is impossible to define whether KEs up occur at lower doses and earlier time points than KEs down. For in vitro studies, KEs up are often measured after acute exposure to high concentrations. The following table summarizes concentrations/doses, time, and duration of exposure for the various test systems and KEs.

Extensive understanding of the KER based on extensive previous documentation and broad acceptance The KER is plausible based on analogy to accept biological relationship but scientific understanding is not completely established There is empirical support for a statistical association between KEs but the structural or functional relationship between them is not understood MIE to KE Decrease protection against oxidative stress MODERATE RATIONALE: Thiol - and selenol containing proteins, which mainly belong to the anti-oxidant protections, have a high affinity for binding soft metals such as mercury (Farina, 2011). Binding to these thiol/sulfhydryl/SH/SeH groups results in structural modifications affecting the catalytic capacity, and thereby reducing the capacity to neutralize ROS. However, binding to other SH/SeH groups of other proteins not involved in protection against oxidative stress can occur and trigger other neurotoxicity pathways. KE Decrease protection against oxidative stress to KE Oxidative stress HIGH RATIONALE: Oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defenses. Several studies have shown depletion of GSH, the main anti-oxidant, and an increase in oxidative stress following methylmercury or mercury chloride exposures (Meinerz, 2011; Rush, 2012; Agrawal, 2015). Protection observed by with diphenyl selenide (Meinerz, 2011) or by glutathione ester (Rush, 2012). Limited conflicting data. KE Oxidative stress to KE Glutamate (Glu) dyshomeostasis LOW RATIONALE: Glutamate transport is driven by the Na+ ion gradient, which is dependent on the Na/K ATPase, which, in turn, requires energy. Glutamate enters the cells accompanied by 2 Na+and an H+. Perturbations of energy metabolism such as mitochondrial dysfunction and increased production of ROS will lead to glutamate dyshomeostasis, due to the indirect coupling of glutamate transporters with ATP level, and to the important role of glutamate transporters in glutamate homeostasis. (Boron and Boulpaep, 2003). Methylmercury was shown to inhibit both the H+-ATPase activity and vesicular glutamate uptake (Porciuncula et al., 2003). As, on one hand, ROS production can interfere with glutamate uptake, and on the other hand, glutamate accumulation leads to excitotoxicity and ROS production, the exact sequence of the KER is difficult to assess. But the fact that both KEs are involved in mercury -induced neurotoxicity is broadly accepted (Farina et al., 2011; Antunes dos Santos et al., 2016; Morris et al., 2017; Kern et al., 2016). KE Glutamate dyshomeostasis to KE Cell injury/death HIGH RATIONALE: Glutamate particular excess of cleft, leads to overactivation of ionotropic glutamate receptors, referred to as excitotoxicity. This, in turn, will cause cell injury/death via ROS production. This KER is also inherent to the developing brain, where glutamate ionotropic receptors are expressed early in various neural cells and when NMDA receptors are expressed in neurons. There is empirical support for all three chemical initiators (mercury, acrylamide, acrolein). In addition, several experiments aiming at blocking glutamate excitotoxicity and the resulting ROS production are protective for cell injury/death. Limited conflicting data. KE Cell injury/death to KE Neuroinflammation MODERAT E RATIONALE: It is widely accepted that cell/neuronal injury and death lead to neuroinflammation (microglial and astrocyte reactivities) in adult brain, and in the developing brain, where neuroinflammation was observed after cell injury/death induced by excitotoxic lesions (Acarin et al., 1997; Dommergues et al., 2003). Empirical support is available for all three chemical initiators (mercury, acrylamide, acrolein). Few experiments, showing a protection when blocking any feature of neuroinflammation have been described. There are some contradicting data showing an absence of neuroinflammatory response despite the occurrence of mercury -induced apotosis and slight behavioral alterations. KE Neuroinflammatio n to KE Cell injury/death MODERAT E RATIONALE: In vitro co-culture experiments have demonstrated that reactive glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) can kill neurons via the release of pro- inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF -a, IL - 1b and IL-6 and/or ROS/RNS (Chao et al., 1995; Brown and Bal- Price, 2003; Kraft and Harry, 2011; Taetzsch and Block, 2013) and that interventions aiming at blocking these inflammatory biomolecules can rescue the neurons (Yadav et al., 2012; Brzozowski et al., 2015). Several reports showed that modulating mercury or acrylamide -induced neuroinflammation was protective for neurons. Because of the complexity of the neuroinflammatory response, that can have neuroprotective or neurodegenerative consequences depending on the duration, local environment or still unknown factors, the rating of this KER was kept as moderate. The vicious cycle between cell injury/death and neuroinflammation is well known and was described in other AOPs. Neuroinflammation could be considered as a modulating factor, but because of the numerous inhibiting experiments, it is considered as an essential KE. Some conflicting data due to the dual role of some inflammatory mediators have been reported. KE Cell injury/death to KE Decreased network formation and function HIGH RATIONALE: Neuronal network formation and functional crosstalk are established via synaptogenesis. It was shown that under physiological conditions components of the apoptotic machinery in the developing brain regulate synapse formation and neuronal connectivity (Dekkers et al., 2013). The brain's electrical activity dependence on synapse formation is critical for proper neuronal communication. Glial cells are also involved in the establishment and stabilization of the neuronal network. Extensive experimental support for the adverse effects of mercury on synaptogenesis exist, establishing a strong link between mercury -induced apoptosis and/or neuronal loss and perturbations in a neurotransmitter systems (Jacob, 2017; Onishchenko, 2007). Limited protective experiments and conflicting data reported. KE Decreased network formation and function to AO Impairment in learning and memory HIGH RATIONALE: A review on the Morris water maze (MWM) (Morris, 1981), as an investigative tool of spatial learning and memory in laboratory rats (Vorhees and Williams, 2006) pointed out that perturbed neuronal networks rather than neuronal death per se in certain regions is responsible for the impairment in MWM performance . Functional integrated neural networks that involve the coordination action of different brain regions are consequently important for spatial learning and memory performance (D'Hooge and De Deyn, 2001). Broad empirical support showing mercury -induced effects on learning and memory as consequence of network disruption (Sokolowski et al. 2013; Eddins et al., 2008; Glover et al., 2009). Similar observations were made in humans (Orenstein et al., 2014; Yorifuji et al., 2011). Interestingly, behavioral alterations were detected long time after exposure (delayed effects). Few conflicting data have been reported, but other behavioral deficits, such as alterations in motor activity and increased anxiety suggest that systems other than hippocampus -related learning and memory are also affected. KE oxidative stress to KE Cell injury/death HIGH RATIONALE: The central nervous system is especially vulnerable to free radical damage since it has a high oxygen consumption rate, an abundant lipid content and reduced levels of antioxidant enzymes (Coyle and Puttfarcken, 1993; Markesbery, 1997). The developing nervous system is particularly vulnerable to chemical insults (Grandjean & Landrigan, 2014). One reason for this higher vulnerability is the incapacity of immature neural cells to cope with oxidative stress by increasing glutathione (GSH) production (Sandstr\u00f6m et al., 2017a). Broad empirical support for mercury and acrylamide showing an association between increased ROS production and/or decreased protection against oxidative stress and apoptosis and/or necrosis (Lu et al., 2011; et al., Allam et et al. , 2012). Anti -oxidant treatments proved to be protective. Few conflicting data, except a mercury - induced upregulation of GSH level and GR activity as an adaptive mechanism following lactational exposure to methylmercury (10 mg/L in drinking water) associated with motor deficit, suggesting neuronal impairment (Franco et al., 2006). Quantitative Consideration Some quantitative relationships have been described between the upstream early KEs (MIE, oxidative stress, Cell injury/death), although the diversity of test systems and posology (dosing/exposure amount and duration) hampers comparison between studies. It is more difficult to evaluate quantitative relationships between later downstream KEs, such as Neuroinflammation and Decreased Network Function. Neuroinflammation is a complex adaptive mechanism which is not yet completely understood; it can have neuroprotective or neurodeg enerative consequences, depending on triggering signals, duration, microenvironment or other unknown influences, which may determine the outcome of the neuroinflammatory process. Decreased network function is currently difficult to quantify because quantitative technologies for mapping and understanding of brain networks (and their plasticity) are still under development. Optimally, we would like data from a single type of test system showing that exposure to stressor, e.g. mercury, is correlated with changes in all KEs. Such models are emerging, using cells of human origin (Pamies et al., 2016; Sandstr\u00f6m et al., 2017b; Fritsche et al., 2017) and/or models, such as zebrafish (Geier et al., 2018; Padilla et al., 2018) and will allow in the future generation of quantitative data which may be used for in silico hazard prediction.

The stable or transitory interaction (binding) of MeHg with critical thiol and selenol groups in target enzymes can disrupt the biological function of different types of enzymes, particularly of the antioxidant 2011; Branco et al. 2017) can impair the fine cellular redox balance via disruption of sensitive cysteinyl - or thiol-containing proteins (Go etal., 2013; Go et al. 2014; Jones 2015). (https://aopwiki.org/system/dragonfly/production/2018/02/07/3zeb7785qn_Diapositive1.jpg) Figure 1 - Hypothetical Binding of MeHg to different types of target proteins. The binding of MeHg to proteins can cause either a transitory inhibition of the protein fucntion (first line, the yellow protein was reactivated by interacting with LMM -SH or R -SH). The pink protein is an example of protein that after the binding of MeHg suffered a change in the structure in such a way that it cannot be reactivated by LMM -SH or R-SH. The third protein (blue) is an example of protein that was permanently denaturated after MeHg binding and even after the removal of MeHg the activity was not recovered. The same type of interactions can be applied to the selenol -containing proteins (i.e., the selenoproteins). The affinity of Mercury chloride (Hg2+) for thiol and selenol groups is higher than that of MeHg (compare Table 2 with Table 1). The constants described in Table 1 and 2 indicate that MeHg and Hg2+ behave as strong soft electrophiles, i.e., theyhave much higher affinity for the soft nucleophiles centers of thiol- and selenol -containing molecules et al. 1986; Sugiura et al., 1976).Furthermore, the rate constant for the reaction of MeHg with thiol/thiolate (R-SH/R -S-) has been estimated to be about 6 x 108 M-1.sec-1, indicating that the reactions of electrophilic forms of Hg (EpHg+ ; here MeHg and Hg2+) with thiolate and selenolate groups are diffusion controlled reactions (Rabenstein and Fairhurst, 1975). The constant indicates that the binding of EpHg+ to thiolate (-S-) or selenolate EpHg+ with -S- or -Se- groups. The studies of Rabenstein and others have also pointed out that the affinity of MeHg for -SeH groups is higher than for -SH groups (Sugira et al. 1976; Arnold et al. 1986). Consequently, -SeH-containing molecules (i.e., selenoproteins) should be the preferential targets for MeHg (Farina et al. 2011). Accordingly, several studies have demonstrate the selenoenzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) were vitro and in vivo exposure to MeHg or Hg2+ (Carvalho et al., 2008a; 2011, Farina et al., 2009; Franco et al., 2009; Wagner et 2013; Meinerz al., 2017). As corollary, the occurrence of free MeHg and Hg2+ or bound to other ligands such amines, chloride or hydroxyl anions in the physiological media of living cells is insignificant or nonexistent (George et al. 2008). The binding of MeHg to abundant low molecular mass thiols or LMM -SH (e.g., cysteine and reduced glutathione -GSH) and high molecular mass thiol-containing proteins or HMM -SH (e.g., albumin, hemoglobin, etc) is critical for the MeHg distribution from non -target to target organs and cells (Farina et al. 2017). The coordination of MeHg with one -S- group of a LMM -SH will determine MeHg distribution to its targets organs, including the brain. The coordination of Hg2+ with two -S- of LMM -SH molecules (particularly, cysteine or Cys) will determine the distribution of Hg2+ to kidney (which is its main target) and to non -classical targets organs, such as the brain (Oliveira et al. 2017). The entrance of Hg2+ into the brain is proportionally small, but recent literature data have indicated the neurotoxicity of very low and environmentally relevant doses of Hg2+ in rodents (Mello -Carpes et al. 2013 ), which confirms data obtained with toxic doses in rodents (Peixoto et al. 2007 ; Franciscato et al. 2009 ; Chehimi et al. 2012). Table 1 - Affinity constants of methylmercury for important chemical groups found in biomolecules (adapted from aRabestein, 1978a, bRabestein and Bravo, 1987, using different thiol-containing molecules with the arylmercurialpara - mercurybenzenosulfonate, and from cArnold et al. 1986 taking into consideration that the calculated formation constant of -Se-MeHg conjugates was 0.1 to 1.2 order greater than that of -S-MeHg). The values represent the Log of the constants. Functional Group Occurrence Formation constant Thiol/thiolate (- 16-18c 2. Formation constants of Hg2+ with some representative nucleophilic centers approximate () of the constants. The values were adapted from Stricks and Kolthoff 1953; Mousavi 2011 and Liem -Nguyem et al. 2017. We have to emphasize that what we call of binding to -SH or -SeH groups is, in fact, an exchange reaction of MeHg MeHg or selenol/selenolate -group from non -target or target proteins. Thus, the interaction of MeHg with its target proteins in the brain usually involves the exchange of MeHg from low - molecular mass conjugates (LMM -S-conjugates) to a thiol or 1986; et al. 2011, 2017; D\u00f3rea et al. 2013). (https://aopwiki.org/system/dragonfly/production/2018/02/07/44zji8zmr8_Diapositive1.jpg) Figure 2 - Binding of MeHg (CH3Hg+) to target thiol- (HMM -SH) or selenol -containing proteins (HMM -SeH). Note that, in fact, the binding of MeHg to their high molecular mass target proteins is mediated by exchange reactions of MeHg from low molecular mass thiol (LMM -SH) molecules to HMM -SH (represented by Prot-SH) or HMM -SeH (represented by Prot-SeH). The scheme also demonstrated that MeHg conjugated with one LMM -SH (here represented by either Cys 1-SHgCH 3 or G1SHgCH 3) can exchange with others LMM -SH (here represented by Cys 2-SH or G2SH). After exchange reaction, the conjugated Cys 1-SHgCH 3 and G1SHgCH 3 -SH molecules Cys 1-SH or G1SH.

However, the rate constant for the reaction between acrylamide with thiol/thiolate groups is much lowe r than that for MeHg. The rate of reaction of this compound with HMM -SH and LMM - SH is slow but can occur under physiological conditions (Tong et al. 2004; LoPachin, 2004). The inhibition of brain enzymes by acrylamide have been studied and the inhibition caused by acrylamide in some HMM -SH can be reversible (Howland et al. 1980). Despite of this, we can infer that some targets of MeHg and acrylamide can overlap, in particular GSH,where the rate constant for MeHg and acrylamide are 6.0 x 108 M-1.sec-1 and 0.15 M- 1989; Kopaska et al. 2015). Acrylamide can also be metabolized to an epoxide intermediate (glycidamide), which can also form adducts with cysteinyl residues in HMM -SH target proteins (Bergmark et al. 1991). Domain of Applicability Taxonomic Applicability Term Scientific Term Evidenc e Links Applicability Life Stage Evidence During brain development High Sex Applicability Sex Evidence Female High Male High Due to the ubiquitous distribution of the SH-/ and seleno -proteins involved in protection against oxidative stress and inview of the strong affinity of MeHg and Hg2+ for thiolate and selenolate groups the binding of MeHg and Hg2+ to thiol and selenol groups is expected to occur in the living cells of all taxonomic groups found in the biosphere.The conservation of these effects across different vertebrate species indicates that thiol- and selenol -containing proteins (particularly, TrxR and GPx) can also be important targets of electrophilic forms of Hg(EpHg+ or MeHg and Hg2+) toxicity in fish and birds (Heinz, 1979; Carvalho et al. 2008b; Heinz et al. 2009; Xu et al.2012, 2016). The disruption of the Trx and GSH systems by MeHg and Hg2+have Bernstssen et al. MeHg can also interfere with the Trx and GSH systems in zebrafish (Yang et al. 2007; Cambier et al. 2012). Key Event Description In the brain, thiol (SH) - and seleno -containing proteins involved in protection against oxidative stress are mainly located in mitochondria and in the cytoplasm of the different neural cell types (Comini, 2016; Hoppe et al. 2008; Barbosa et al. et al. 2017). The main SH -containing peptide involved in protection against oxidative stress is Glutathione (GSH), a tripeptide acting as a cofactor for the enzyme peroxidase and thus serving as an indirect antioxidant donating the electrons necessary for its decomposition of H2O2. The seleno -containing proteins of interest are: (i) the Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) family, involved in detoxification of hydroperoxides; (ii) the Thioredoxin Reductase (TrxR) family, involved in of reduced thioredoxin (Pillai et al., 2014; ), and the less studied SelH, K, S, R, W, and P selenoproteins (Pisoschi and Pop, 2015, Reeves and Hoffmann, 2009). Binding of chemicals to these proteins induces either their inactivation or favor their degradation (Farina et al. 2009; Zemolin et al. 2012). Of particular importance, the GSH/GPx and thioredoxin (Trx)/TrxR systems are the two main redox regulators of mammalian cells and the disruption of their activities can compromise cell viability (Ren et al. 2016). How it is Measured or Detected Binding of Hg to thiol groups was analyzed by multiple collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectometry (Wiederhold et al., 2010). The binding affinity of methylmercury by various selenium -containing lingands was investigated by proton magnetic resonance spectometry (Sugiura et al., 1978; Arnold et al., 1986). A methylene blue -mediated enzyme biosensor was developed for the detection of mercury -glutathione complex. The biosensor was the enzyme horseradish peroxidase. The binding site of HgCl 2 with the enzyme was a cysteine residue -SH (Han et al., 2001). Binding of mercuric chloride to GSH was measured by high performance liquid (HPLC) -ultraviolet ionization mass spectometry (Qiao et al., 2017). Carvalho et al. (2011) determined the binding of MeHg or Hg2+ with purified Thioredoxin Reductase using mass spectrometry. The liquid chromatography was not applied because they have used a pure chemical system, i.e, without living cells. Mass spectra analysis allowed to measure the binding of mercury chloride and methylmercury to proteins of (GR) and glutaredoxin (Grx) (Carvahlo 2008) The methodology to detect acrylamide -cysteine adducts has been performed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (Martyniuk et al. 2013). In this paper the authors dected by using a shotgun proteomic approach a total of 15,243 peptides in ACR -exposed N27 cells. And from those 15,243 peptides, 103 peptides (from 100 different proteins) contained acrylamide -cysteine adducts. References Arnold, A.P.,K. -S. Tan, D.L.

Key Event Description High levels reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be very damaging to cells and molecules within the cell. As a result, the cell has important defense mechanisms to protect itself from ROS, such as glutathione and selenoenzymes. Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant low molecular mass thiol compound synthesized in cells, reaching intracellular concentrations of 1-10 mM, and is the major antioxidant and redox buffer in human cells. In fact, GSH serves as a reducing agent for ROS and other unstable molecules generated by catalytic systems, including glutathione peroxidase (GPx)(Forman, 2009). Selenium plays a crucial role in antioxidant defense, as one Se atom is absolutely required at the active site of all selenoenzymes, such as GPx and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), in 2000). GPx is an antioxidant enzyme that, in the presence of tripeptide GSH, adds two electrons to reduce H 2O2 and lipid peroxides to water and lipid alcohols, respectively, while simultaneously oxidizing GSH to glutathione disulfide. The GPx/GSH system is thought to be a major defense in low -level oxidative stress, and decreased GPx activity or GSH levels may lead to the absence of adequate H2O2 and lipid peroxides detoxification, which may be converted to OH-radicals and lipid peroxyl radicals, respectively, by transition metals (Fe2+) (Brigelius -Flohe, reductase (TrxR) is essential for maintaining intracellular redox status. The expression of this small (12 kDa) ubiquitous thiol-active protein is induced by ROS and an elevated serum level may indicate a state of oxidative stress. In this regard, TrxR, a NADPH -dependent lipid hydroperoxide reductase, uses NADPH to maintain the levels of reduced Trx via a mechanism similar to that used by GR to maintain GSH levels, contributing to the maintenance of thiol redox homeostasis in proteins. Importantly, the inhibition of the cyclical regeneration of Trx activity, as Trx remains in the oxidized state (Bjornstedt, 1995, Zhong, 2002). Other, less studied selenoproteins, such as SelP, H, K, S, R, and W selenoproteins, play a role in antioxidant defense (Pisoschi, 2015, Reeves, 2009) . How it is Measured or Detected - Glutathione (GSH) depletion. GSH can be measured by assaying the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH:GSSG) using a commercially available kit (e.g., http://www.abcam.com/gshgssg - kit-fluorometric -green -ab138881.html) activity. The activit y of GPx can be measured by a colorimetric assay, using a commercially available kit (e.g., Abcam ab102530) - Reduction of TrxR activity. The activity of TrxR can be measured by a colorimetric assay, using a commercially available kit (e.g., Abcam ab83463) - Reduction of Selenoprotein R activity. The methionine sulfoxide reductase activity of SelR can be measured by HPLC (Chen, 2013) - Selenoprotein P depletion. The depletion in SelP can be measured using an ELISA (e.g., MyBiosource #MBS9301054) - Selenoprotein W depletion. The depletion in SelW can be measured using an ELISA (e.g., MyBiosource #MBS9312544) - Selenoprotein S depletion. The depletion in SelS can be measured using an ELISA (e.g., MyBiosource #MBS9306607) - Selenoprotein H and K depletion. The depletion in SelH and K can be measured by western blotting (Lee, 2015, Novoselov, 2007) References Bjornstedt, M., Hamberg, M., Kumar, S., Xue, J., Holmgre, A.

Key Event Description Oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defenses. High levels of oxidizing free radicals can be very damaging to cells and molecules within the cell. As a result, the cell has important defense mechanisms to protect itself from ROS. For example, Nrf2 is a transcription factor and master regulator of the oxidative stress response. During periods of oxidative stress, Nrf2-dependent changes in gene expression are important in regaining cellular homeostasis (Nguyen, et al. 2009) and can be used as indicators of the presence of oxidative stress in the cell. In addition to the directly damaging actions of ROS, cellular oxidative stress also changes cellular activities on a molecular level. Redox sensitive proteins have altered physiology in the presence and absence of ROS, which is caused by the oxidation of sulfhydryls to disulfides (2SH \u00e0SS) on neighboring amino acids (Antelmann and Helmann 2011). Importantly Keap1, the negative regulator of Nrf2, is regulated in this manner (Itoh, et al. 2010). The brain possesses several key physiological features, such as high O2 utilization, high polyunsaturated fatty acids content, presence of autooxidable neurotransmitters, and low antioxidant defenses as compared to other organs, that make it highly susceptible to oxidative stress (Halliwell, 2006; Emerit and al., 2004; Frauenberger et al., 2016). How it is Measured or Detected Oxidative Stress. Direct measurement of ROS is difficult because ROS are unstable. The presence of ROS can be assayed indirectly by measurement of cellular antioxidants, or by ROS -dependent cellular damage: - Detection of by chemiluminescence (https:// www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165993606001683) - Glutathione (GSH) depletion. GSH can be measured by assaying the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathi one (GSH:GSSG) using a commercially available kit assaying for lipid peroxidation using TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) using a commercially available kit. - 8-oxo-dG. Oxidative damage to nucleic acids can be assayed by measuring 8-oxo-dG adducts (for which there are a number of ELISA based commercially available kits),or HPLC, described in Chepelev et al. (Chepelev, et al. Molecular Biology: Nrf2. Nrf2 activity include: Immunohistochemistry for increases in Nrf2 protein levels and translocation into the nucleus; - Western blot for increased Nrf2 protein levels; - Western blot of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions to observe translocation of Nrf2 protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus; Srxn), available pathway -based qPCR array (e.g., oxidative stress array from SABiosciences) - Whole transcriptome profiling by microarray or RNA -seq followed by pathway analysis (in IPA, DAVID, metacore, etc.) for enrichment of the Nrf2 oxidative stress response pathway (e.g., Jackson et al. 2014).

Drosophila) to vertebrates (Fagnou and Tuchek, 1995). Key Event Description Glutamate (Glu) is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), where it plays major roles in multiple aspects, such as development, learning, memory and response to injury (Featherstone, 2010). How ever, it is well recognized that Glu at high concentrations at the synaptic cleft acts as a toxin, inducing neuronal injury and death (Meldrum, 2000; Ozawa et al., 1998) secondary to activation of glumatergic N-methyl D- aspartate (NMDA) receptors and Ca2+ influx. Glu dyshomeostasis is a consequence of perturbation of astrocyte/neuron interactions and the transport of this amino acid, as will be discussed below. Astrocytes are critically involved in neuronal function and survival, as they produce neurotrophic factors, such as brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glia -derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), as well as express two main glutamate transporters responsible for the removal of excessive Glu from the synaptic clefts (Chai et al., 2013; Sheldon et al., 2007). Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, playing a major role in memory and cognitive function (Platt, 1997), and Glu transporters as such prevent the overstimulation of post- synaptic glutamate receptors that injury et al., 2001; Dobble, 1999). Among the five subtypes of Glu transporters identified, glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) and Glu transporter -1 (GLT - 1) [excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) 1 and 2 in humans, respectively], are predominantly expressed in astrocytes. They are responsible for the uptake of excess glutamate from the extracellular space (Furuta et al., 1997; Lehre et al., 1995; Tanaka, 2000), supported by the fact that knockdown of either GLT -1 or GLAST in mice increases extracellular glutamate levels, leading to excitotoxicity related neurodegeneration and progressive paralysis (Bristol and Rothstein, 1996). In the adult brain, EAAT2 accounts for >90% of extracellular glutamate clearance (Danbolt, 2001; Kim et al., 2011; Rothstein et al., 1995), and genetic deletion of both alleles of GLT -1 in mice leads to the development of lethal seizures (Rothstein et al., 1996). On the other hand, EAAT1 -3 play a major role during human brain development, in particular in corticogenesis, where they are expressed in proliferative zones and in radial glia, and alterations of Glu transporters contributes to disorganized cortex seen in migration disorders (Furuta et al., 2005; Regan et al., 2007). Indeed, disruption of glutamate (http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/glutamic -acid) signaling is thought to be part of the etiology underlying some neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia (Chiocchetti et al., 2014; Schwartz et al., 2012 (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159116300587?via%3Dihub#b0075)). Genes involved in glutamatergic pathways, affecting receptor signalling, metabolism and transport, were enriched in genetic variants associated with autism spectrum disorders (Chiocchetti et al, 2014). Extracellular Glu released by neurons is taken up by astrocytes, which is converted into Binding SH -/seleno containing proteins). Inter cellular compartmentation of Gln and Glu, the so -called Gln/Glu (GGC), is critical for optimal CNS function.13C NMR studies have demonstrated that the ratio of Gln/Glu is extremely high and increases with brain activity (Shen et al., 1999). Thus the GGC gives rise to the amino acid neurotransmitters Glu and GABA via dynamic astrocyte neuron interactions. Glu released at synaptic terminals is taken up by surrounding astrocytes via GLT -1 and GLAST (Rothstein et al., 1994; 1996). A small proportion of the astrocytic formed Gln via a reaction mediated by GS is transported into the extracellular space by Gln carriers, with a predominant role for System N/A transporter (SNAT3), which belongs to the bidirectional transporter System N (Chaudhry et al., 2002). In addition to System N, release of Gln from astrocytes is mediated by other transport systems, including Systems L (LAT2) and ASC (ASCT2). Extracellular Gln is taken up into GABAergic and neurons by the unidirectional System A transporters SNAT1 (Melone et al., 2004) and SNAT2 (Grewal et al., 2009). Once in neurons, Gln is converted to Glu by the mitochondrial enzyme phosphate -activated glutaminase (Kvamme et al., 2001). Additionally, Glu is packaged into synaptic vesicles by the vesicular VGLUT transporter (Bellocchio et al., 1998), released into the extracellular space and taken up by astrocytes where it is converted back to Gln by GS, thus completing the GGC (Fig. 1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3633698/figure/F1/) ). Figure 1: Schematic representation of Glu and Gln transport systems related to the GGC. From Sidorik -Wegrzynowicz and Aschner, 2013 How it is Measured or Detected L-Glu transporter activities can be quantified by direct or indirect methods: For direct quantification, L -Glu transporter activities are determined by the amount of 3H-labeled ligand (L-Glu or D-aspartate) taken up by the cells (Primary mixed astrocyte and neuron cultures [Perez -Dominguez et al., 2014]; primary astrocyte cultures [Matos et al., 2008; Li transfected or tissues (ex. Hippocampal tissue [Selkirk et al., 2005]) For indirect quantification, L-Glu transporter activities are determined by the L-Glu residue in the medium or buffer after incubation with cells expressing the different L-Glu transporters (Brison et al., 2014; Xin et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2015; Gu et al., 2014; Abe et alt.2000], .). The transport activity of the different L-Glu transporter subtypes should be determined in the presence of the appropriate inhibitors as shown in the table 1. Ex: The glutamate uptake activity via EAAT1 can be determined in the presence of dihydrokainic acid (DHK), a specific inhibitor for GLT -1, as described in Mutkus et al. (2005). Expression level of L-Glu transporter subtypes should be confirmed using Western blotting or immunocytochemistry. It is interesting to note that pure astrocyte culture express only GLAST (EAAT1) (Danbolt et al., 2016); whereas In cultures, GLAST (EAAT1) and GLT -1(EAAT2) are expressed (Danbolt et al., 2016). The expression of GLT1 (EAAT2) is suggested to be induced by soluble factors (Gegelashvili et al., 1997, 2000; Plachez et al., 2000; Martinez -Lozada et al., 2016). For measuring glutamate release, load 3H glutamate for several hours and then look at release over time, as descibed in (Arizza et al., 1994) . The L-Glu concentrations in medium or in incubation buffer can be quantified by commercially -available kits quantifying the final products of the redox reaction in which L-Glu is a substrate. The kits using colorimetric final Glutamate -Glo Assay from Promega (J7021) Table 1 is a summary based on the reviews of Murphy -Royal et al., 2017 and Pajarillo et al., 2019, with some modification.

Key Event Description Two types of cell death can be distinguished by morphological features, although it is likely that these are two ends of a spectrum with possible intermediate forms. Apoptosis involves shrinkage, nuclear disassembly, and fragmentation of the cell into discrete bodies with intact plasma membranes. These are rapidly phagocytosed by neighbouring cells. An important feature of apoptosis is the requirement for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to initiate the execution phase. In contrast, necrotic cell death is characterized by cell swelling and lysis. This is usually a consequence of profound loss of mitochondrial function and resultant ATP depletion, leading to loss of ion homeostasis, including volume regulation, and increased intracellular Ca2+. The latter activates a number of nonspecific hydrolases (i.e., proteases, nucleases, and phospholipases) as well as calcium dependent kinases. Activation of calpain I, the Ca2+ - dependent cysteine protease cleaves the death -promoting Bcl and Bax which translocate mitochondrial membranes, resulting in release apoptosis -inducing factor (tAIF), cytochrome c and endonuclease in the case of Bid and cytocrome c in the case of Bax. tAIF translocates to cell nuclei, and together with cyclophilin A and phosphorylated histone H2AX (H2AX) is responsible for DNA cleavage, a feature of programmed necrosis. Activated calpain I has also been shown to cleave the plasma membrane Na+ -Ca2+ exchanger, which leads to build -up of intracellular Ca2+, which is the source of additional increased intracellular Ca2+. Cytochrome c in cellular apoptosis is a component of the apoptosome. DNA damage activates nuclear poly(ADP poly(ADP -ribose) polymers, to repair DNA, but when DNA damage is extensive, PAR accumulates, exits cell nuclei and travels to mitochondrial membranes, where it, like calpain I, is involved in AIF release from mitochondria. A fundamental distinction between necrosis and apoptosis is the loss of plasma membrane integrity; this is integral to the former but not the latter. As a consequence, lytic release of cellular constituents promotes a local inflammatory reaction, whereas the rapid removal of apoptotic bodies minimizes such a reaction. The distinction between the two modes of death is easily accomplished in vitro but not in vivo. Thus, although claims that certain drugs induce apoptosis have been made, these are relatively unconvincing. DNA fragmentation can occur in necrosis, leading to positive TUNEL staining. Conversely, when apoptosis is massive, it can exceed the capacity for rapid phagocytosis, resulting in the eventual appearance of secondary necrosis. Two alternative pathways - either extrinsic (receptor -mediated) or intrinsic (mitochondria -mediated) - lead to apoptotic cell death. The initiation of cell death begins either at the plasma membra ne with the binding of TNF or FasL to their cognate receptors or within the cell. The latter is due to the occurrence of intracellular stress in the form of biochemical events such as oxidative stress, redox changes, covalent binding, lipid peroxidation, on endoplasmic reticulum, microtubules, cytoskeleton, involves the initiator, caspase -9, which, when activated, forms an \"apoptosome\" in the cytosol, together with cytochrome c, effector caspase, which in turn activates downstream factors that are responsible for the apoptotic death of a cell (Fujikawa, 2015). Intracellular stress either directly affects mitochondria or can lead to effects on other organelles, which then send signals to the mitochondria to recruit participation in the death process (Fujikawa, 2015; Malhi et al., 2010). oxide (NO) from L -arginine, and NO reacts with the free radical such as superoxide (O2) to form the very toxic free radical peroxynitrite (ONOO). Free radicals such as ONOO, O2 and hydroxyl radical (OH) damage cellular membranes and intracellular proteins, enzymes al., 2010; Kaplowitz, 2002; Kroemer et 2009). How it is Measured or Detected Necrosis: LDH is a soluble cytoplasmic enzyme that is present in almost all cells and is released into extracellular space when the plasma membrane is damaged. To detect the leakage of LDH into cell culture medium, a tetrazolium salt is used in this assay. In the first step, LDH produces reduced nicotinamide oxidation to pyruvate. In the second step, a tetrazolium salt is converted to a colored formazan product using newly synthesized NADH in the presence of an electron acceptor. The amount of formazan product can be colorimetrically quantified by standard spectroscopy. Because of the linearity of the assay, it can be used to enumerate the percentage of necrotic cells in a sample (Chan et al., 2013). The MTT assay is a colorimetric assay for assessing cell viability. NAD(P)H -dependent cellular oxidoreductase enzymes may reflect the number of viable cells present. These enzymes are capable of reducing the tetrazolium dye MTT 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol -2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetraz olium bromide to its insoluble color. Other closely related tetrazolium dyes including XTT, MTS and the WSTs. Tetrazolium dye assays can also be used to measure cytotoxicity (loss of viable cells) or cytostatic activity (shift from proliferation to quiescence) of potential medicinal agents and toxic materials. MTT assays are usually done in the dark since the MTT reagent is sensitive to light (Berridgeet al.,2005). is an intercalating agent and a fluorescent molecule used to stain necrotic cells. It is cell membrane impermeant so it stains only those cells where the cell membrane is destroyed. When PI is bound to nucleic acids, the fluorescence excitation maximum is 535 nm and the emission maximum is 617 nm (Moore et al.,1998) Alamar Blue (resazurin) fluorescent dye. The oxidized blue non fluorescent Alamar blue is reduced to a pink fluorescent dye in the medium by cell activity (O'Brien et al., 2000) (12). Neutral red uptake, which is based on the ability of viable cells to incorporate and bind the supravital dye neutral red in lysosomes (Repetto et al., 2008)(13). ATP assay: Quantification of ATP, signaling the presence of metabolically active cells (CellTiter -Glo; Promega). Apoptosis: TUNEL is a common method for detecting DNA fragmentation that results from apoptotic signalling cascades. The assay relies on the presence of nicks in the DNA which can be identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase or TdT, an enzyme that will catalyze the addition of dUTPs that are secondarily labeled with a marker. It may also label cells that have suffered severe DNA damage. Caspase activity assays measured by fluorescence. During apoptosis, mainly caspase -3 and -7 cleave PARP to yield an 85 kDa and a 25 kDa fragment. PARP cleavage is considered to be one of the classical characteristics of apoptosis. Antibodies to the 85 kDa fragment of cleaved PARP or to caspase -3 both serve as markers for apoptotic cells that can be monitored using immunofluorescence (Li, Peng et al., 2004). Hoechst 33342 staining: Hoechst dyes are cell -permeable and bind to DNA in live or fixed cells. Therefore, these stains are often called supravital, which means that cells survive a treatment with these compounds. The stained, condensed or fragmented DNA is a marker of apoptosis (Loo, 2002; Kubbies and Rabinovitch, 1983). Acridine Orange/Ethidium is used to visualize nuclear changes and apoptotic body formation that are characteristic of apoptosis. Cells are viewed under a fluorescence microscope and counted to quantify apoptosis. References Fujikawa, D.G.

Key Event Description Neuroinflammation or brain inflammation differs from peripheral inflammation in that the vascular response and the role of peripheral bone marrow -derived cells are less conspicuous. The most easily detectable feature of neuroinflammation is activation of microglial cells and astrocytes. It is evidenced by changes in shape, increased expression of certain antigens, and accumulation and proliferation of the glial cells in regions (Aschner, Kraft and Harry, 2011; Claycomb et al., 2013). Upon stimulation by cytokines or inflammogens (e.g. from pathogens or from damaged neurons), both glial cell types activate inflammatory signalling pathways, which result in increased expression and/or release of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, eicosanoids, and metalloproteinases (Dong & Benveniste, 2001), as well as in the production of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) (Brown & Bal -Price, 2003). Different types of activation states are possible for microglia and astrocytes, resulting in pro -inflammatory or anti -inflammator y signalling and other cellular functions (such as phagocytosis) (Streit et al., 1999; Nakajima and Kohsaka, 2004). Therefore, neuroinflammation can have both neuroprotective/neuroreparative and neurodegenerative consequences (Carson et al., 2006 ; Monnet -Tschudi et al, 2007; Aguzzi et al., 2013 ; Glass et al., 2010). Under normal physiological conditions, microglial cells scan the nervous system for neuronal integrity (Nimmerjahn et al, 2005) are the first type of cell activated (first line of defence), and can subsequently induce astrocyte activation (Falsig, 2008). Two distinct states of microglial activation have been described (Gordon, 2003; Kigerl et al, Maresz Moehle and West, 2015): The M1 state is classically triggered by interferon -gamma and/or other pro -inflammatory cytokines, and this state is characterized by increased expression of integrin alpha M (Itgam) and CD86, as well as the release of pro -inflammatory cytokines (TNF - alpha, IL -1beta, IL -6), and it is mostly associated with neurodegeneration. The M2 state is triggered by IL-4 and IL-13 (Maresz et al, 2008; Perego et al, 2011; Ponomarev et al, 2007) and induces the expression of mannose receptor 1 (MRC1), arginase1 (Arg 1) and Ym1/2; it is involved in repair processes. The activation of astrocytes by microglia -derived cytokines or TLR agonists resembles the M1 state (Falsig 2006). Although classification of the M1/M2 polarization of microglial cells may be considered as a simplification of authentic microglial reaction states (Ransohoff, 2016), a similar polarization of reactive astrocytes has been descibed recently Liddlelow et al., 2017): -1 alpha (IL -1alpha), TNF and subcomponent q released by activated microglial cells induce A1 -reactive astrocytes, which lose the ability to promote neuronal survival, outgrowth, synaptogenesis and phagocytosis and induce the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes. Neuroinflammation and Brain development During brain development, microglia are known to play a critical role as shapers of neural circuits, by providing trophic factors and by remodeling and pruning synapses (Rajendran and Paolicelli, 2018). In addition to playing a role in synaptic management, microglia are important for the pruning of dying neurons and in the clearance of debris (Harry, 2013). Microglia seem to affect also processes associated with neuronal proliferation and differentiation (Harry and Kraft, 2012). Similarly to microglia, astrocytes have instructive roles in synaptogenesis, and The development -dependent reactivity of microglial cells and astrocytes is not well known. Ischemic insult appears to elicit similar microglial reactivity both during brain development and in adulthood (Baburamani et al, 2014; Leonardo & Pennypacker, 2009). In contrast, treatment with lead acetate was previously shown to result in a more pronounced microglial and astrocyte reactivity in immature 3D rat brain cell cultures as compared to mature ones (Zurich et al, 2002). Astrocyte reactivity was also more pronounced in immature 3D rat brain cell cultures following paraquat exposure, whereas development -dependent differences in the phenotype of reactive microglia were observed (Sandstr\u00f6m et al., 2017). This suggests that neuroinflamm ation is occurring during brain development and may express a different phenotype than in adulthood, and that dysfunction of microglia and astrocyte during brain development could contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders and potentially to late-onset neuropathology (Reemst et al., 2016). How it is Measured or Detected Neuroinflammation, i.e. the activation of glial cells can be measured by quantification of cellular markers (most commonly), or of released mediators (less common). As multiple activation states exist for the two main cell types involved, it is necessary to measure several markers of neuroinflammation: 1. Microglial activation can be detected based on the increased numbers of labeled microglia per volume element of brain tissue (due to increase of binding sites, proliferation, and immigration of cells) or on morphological changes. A specific microglial marker, used across different species, is CD11b. Alternatively various specific carbohydrate structures can be stained by lectins (e.g. IB4). Beyond that, various well-established antibodies are available to detect microglia in mouse tissue (F4/80), phagocytic microglia in rat tissue (ED1) or more generally microglia across species (Iba1). Transgenic mice are available with fluorescent proteins under the control of the CD11b promoter to easily quantify microglia without the need for specific stains. 2. The most frequently used astrocyte marker is GFAP (99% of all studies) (Eng et al., 2000). This protein is highly specific for astrocytes in the brain, and antibodies are available for immunocytochemical detection. In neuroinflammatory brain regions, the stain becomes more prominent, due to an upregulation of the protein, a shape change/proliferation of the cells, and/or better accessibility of the antibody. Various histological quantification approaches can be used. Occasionally, alternative astrocytic markers, such as vimentin of the S100beta protein, have been used for staining of astrocytes (Struzynska et al., 2007). Antibodi es for complement component 3 (C3), the most characteristic and highly upregulated marker of A1 neurotoxic reactive astrocytes are commercially available. 3. All immunocytochemical methods can also be applied to cell culture models. 4. In patients, microglial accumulation can be monitored by PET imaging, using [11C] -PK 11195 as a microglial marker (Banati et al., 2002). 5. Activation of glial cells can be assessed in tissue or cell culture models also by quantification of sets of activation markers. This can for instance be done by PCR quantification of inflammatory factors, by measurement of the respective mediators, e.g. by ELISA -related immuno -quantification.

LIVER: Human [Su et al., 2002; Kegel et al., 2014] and Peterson, 2001] Mouse [Dalton t al., 2009] Key Event Description Tissue resident cell activation is considered as a hallmark of inflammation irrespective of the tissue type. Strategically placed cells within tissues respond to noxious stimuli, thus regulating the recruitment of neutrophil and the initiation and resolution of inflammation (Kim and Luster, 2015). Examples for these cells are resident immune cells, parenchymal cells, vascular cells, stromal cells, or smooth muscle cells. These cells may be specific for a certain tissue, but they have a common tissue -independent role. Under healthy conditions there is a homeostatic state, characterized as a generally quiescent cellular milieu. Various danger signals or alarmins that are involved in induction of inflammation like pathogen -associated molecular pattern molecules (PAMPs) and damage -associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) activate these resident cells in affected tissues. Examples of well-characterized DAMPs (danger signals or alarmins) (Sa\u00efd -Sadier TLR2, CD40 DC Chemotaxis, cytokine induction, immune cells Uric acid crystals CD14, TLR2, stress Intracellular Laminin adjuvant activity Activation refers to a phenotypic modification of the resident cells that includes alterations in their secretions, activation of biosynthetic pathways, production of pro-inflammatory proteins and lipids, and morphological changes. While these represent a pleiotropic range of responses that can vary with the tissue, there are a number of common markers or signs of activation that are measurable. Examples of Common markers are NF-kB AP-1 Jnk P38/mapk These described commonalities allow the use of this KE as a hub KE in the AOP network. However, despite the similarities in the inflammatory process, the type of reactive cells and the molecules triggering their reactivity may be tissue -specific. Therefore, for practical reasons, a tissue specific description of the reactive cells and of the triggering factors is necessary in order to specify in a tissue -specific manner, which cell should be considered and what should be measured. BRAIN The most easily detectable feature of brain inflammation or neuroinflammation is activation of microglial cells and astrocytes. It is evidenced by changes in shape, increased expression of certain antigens, and accumulation and proliferation of the glial cells in regions (Aschner, Kraft and Harry, 2011; Claycomb et al., 2013). Upon stimulation by cytokines, chemokines or inflammogens (e.g. from pathogens or from damaged neurons), both glial cell types activate inflammatory signaling pathways, which result in increased expression and/or release of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, eicosanoids, and metalloproteinases (Dong & Benveniste, 2001) (cf KE: pro- inflammatory mediators, increased), as well as in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) (Brown & Bal -Price, 2003). Different types of activation states are possible for microglia and astrocytes, resulting in pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory signaling, and other cellular functions (such as phagocytosis) (Streit et al., 1999; Nakajima and Kohsaka, 2004). Therefore, neuroinflammation can have both and neurodegenerative consequences (Carson et al., 2006; Monnet -Tschudi et al, 2007; Aguzzi et al., 2013 ; Glass et al., 2010). Under normal physiological conditions, microglial cells survey the nervous system for neuronal integrity (Nimmerjahn et al, 2005) 1995; Kreutzberg, 1996; Rivest, 2009). They are the first type of cell activated (first line of defense), and can subsequently induce astrocyte activation (Falsig, 2008). Two distinct states of microglial activation have been described (Gordon, 2003; Kigerl et al, Maresz Ponomarev et al, 2005): The M1 state is classically triggered by interferon - gamma and/or other pro-inflammatory cytokines, and this state is characterized by increased expression of integrin alpha M (Itgam) and CD86, as well as the release of pro - inflammatory cytokines (TNF -alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6), and it is mostly associated with neurodegeneration. The M2 state is triggered by IL-4 and IL-13 (Maresz et al, 2008; Perego et al, 2011; Ponomarev et al, 2007) and induces the expression of mannose receptor 1 (MRC1), arginase1 (Arg 1) and Ym1/2; it is involved in repair processes. The activation of astrocytes by microglia -derived cytokines or TLR agonists resembles the M1 state (Falsig 2006). Although classification of the M1/M2 polarization of microglial cells may be considered as a simplification of authentic microglial reaction states (Ransohoff, 2016), a similar polarization of reactive astrocytes has been described recently Liddlelow et al., 2017): -1 alpha (IL- 1a), TNF and subcomponent q released by activated microglial cells induce A1 -reactive astrocytes, which lose the ability to promote neuronal survival, outgrowth, synaptogenesis and phagocytosis and induce the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes. Regulatory examples using the KE Measurement of GFAP in brain tissue, whose increase is a marker of astrocyte reactivity, is required by the US EPA in rodent toxicity studies for fuel additives (40 CFR 79.67). It has been used on rare occasions for other toxicant evaluations. LIVER: Kupffer cells (KCs) are a specialized population of macrophages that reside in the liver; they were first described by Carl Wilhelm -1902) in the reticuloendothelial system and account for approximately 15% of the total liver cell population [Bouwens et al., 1986]. They play an important role in normal physiology and homeostasis as well as participating in the acute and chronic responses of the liver to toxic compounds. Activation of KCs results in the release of an array of inflammatory mediators, growth factors, and reactive oxygen species. This activation appears to modulate acute hepatocyte injury as well as chronic liver responses including hepatic cancer. Understanding the role KCs play in these diverse responses is key to understanding mechanisms of liver injury [Roberts et al.,2007]. Besides the release of inflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines, lysosomal and proteolytic enzymes KCs are a main source of TGF-1 (transforming growth factor -beta 1, the most potent profibrogenic cytokine). In addition latent TGF -1 can be activated by KC -secreted matrix -9)[Winwood and Arthur, Peeterson, 2001] through the release of biologically active substances that promote the pathogenic process. Activated KCs also release ROS like superoxide generated by NOX (NADPH oxidase), thus contributing to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress also activates a variety of transcription factors like NF -B, PPAR - leading to an increased gene expression for the production of growth factors, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. KCs express TNF - (Tumor stellate cells (HSCs) and induce the expression of PDGF receptors on HSCs which enhances cell proliferation. Expressed apoptosis -inducing Ligand) are not only pro -inflammatory active but also capable of inducing death receptor -mediated apoptosis in hepatocytes [Guo and Friedman, 2007; Friedman 2002; Roberts et al., 2007]. Under conditions of oxi dative stress macrophages are further activated which leads to a more enhanced inflammatory response that again further activates KCs though cytokines (Interferon bone marrow -derived macrophages, originating from circulating monocytes are recruited to the injured liver via chemokine signals. KCs appear essential for sensing tissue injury and initiating inflammatory responses, while infiltrating Ly-6C+ monocyte - derived macrophages are linked to chronic inflammation and fibrogenesis. The profibrotic functions of KCs (HSC activation via paracrine mechanisms) during chronic hepatic injury remain functionally relevant, even if the infiltration of additional inflammatory monocytes is blocked via pharmacological inhibition of Zimmermann, 2014]. KC activation and macrophage recruitment are two separate events and both are necessary for fibrogenesis, but as they occur in parallel, they can be summarised as one KE. Probably there is a threshold of KC activation and release above which liver damage is induced. Pre-treatment with gadolinium chloride (GdCl), which inhibits KC function, reduced both hepatocyte and sinusoidal epithelial cell injury, as well as decreased the numbers of macrophages appearing in hepatic lesions and inhibited TGF -1 mRNA expression in macrophages. Experimental inhibition of KC function or depletion of KCs appeared to protect against chemical - induced liver injury [Ide et al., 2005]. How it is Measured or Detected In General: Measurement targets are cell surface and intracellular markers; the specific markers may be cell and species -specific. Available methods include cytometry, immunohistochemistry, gene expression sequencing; western blotting, ELISA, and functional assays. BRAIN Neuroinflammation, i.e. the activation of glial cells can be measured by quantification of cellular markers (most commonly), or of released mediators (less common). As multiple activation states exist for the two main cell types involved, it is necessary to measure several markers of neuroinflammation: 1. Microglial activation can be detected based on the increased numbers of labeled microglia per volume element of brain tissue (due to increase of binding sites, proliferation, and immigration of cells) or on morphological changes. A specific microglial marker, used across different species, is CD11b. Alternatively various specific carbohydrate structures can be stained by lectins (e.g. IB4). Beyond that, various well-established antibodies are available to detect microglia in mouse tissue (F4/80), phagocytic microglia in rat tissue (ED1) or more generally microglia across species (Iba1). Transgenic mice are available with fluorescent proteins under the control of the CD11b promoter to easily quantify microglia without the need for specific stains. 2. The most frequently used astrocyte marker is glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP (99% of all studies) (Eng et al., 2000). This protein is highly specific for astrocytes in the brain, and antibodies are available for immunocytochemical detection. In neuroinflamatory brain regions, the stain becomes more prominent, due to an upregulation of the protein, a shape change/proliferation of the cells, and/or better accessibility of the antibody. Various histological quantification approaches can be used. Occasionally, alternative astrocytic markers, such as vimentin of the S100beta protein, have been used for astrocyte staining (Struzynska et al., 2007). Antibodies for complement component 3 (C3), the most characteristic and highly upregulated marker of A1 neurotoxic reactive astrocytes are commercially available. 3. All immunocytochemical methods can also be applied to cell culture models. 4. In patients, microglial accumulation can be monitored by PET imaging, using [11C] -PK 11195 as a microglial marker (Banati et al., 2002). 5. Activation of glial cells can be assessed in tissue or cell culture models also by quantification of sets of M1/M2 phenotype markers.

They can be divided into exogenous and endogenous mediators. Exogenous mediators of inflammation are or toxins like endotoxin or LPS. Endogenous mediators of inflammation are produced from within the (innate and adaptive) immune system itself, as well as other systems. They can be derived from molecules that are normally present in the plasma in an inactive form, such as peptide fragments of some components of complement, coagulation, and kinin systems. Or they can be released at the site of injury by a number of cell types that either contain them as preformed molecules within storage granules, e.g. histamine, or which can rapidly switch on the machinery required to synthesize the mediators. Table1: a non-exhaustive list (RNS) NO, iNOS The increased production of pro-inflammatory mediators can have negative consequences on the parenchymal cells leading even to cell death, as described for TNF -a or peroxynitrite on neurons (Chao et al., 1995; Brown and Bal- Price, 2003). In addition, via a feedback loop, they can act on the reactive resident cells thus maintaining or exacerbating their reactive state; and by modifying elements of their signalling pathways, they can favour the M1 phenotypic polarization and the chronicity of the inflammatory process (Taetzsch et al., 2015). Basically, this event occurs equally in various tissues and does not require tissue -specific descriptions. Nevertheless, there are some specificities such as the release of glutamate by brain reactive glial cells (Brown and Bal-Price, 2003; Vesce et al., 2007).The differences may rather reside in the type of insult favouring the increased expression and/or release of a specific class of inflammatory mediators, as well the time after the insult reflecting different stages of the inflammatory process. For these reasons, the analyses of the changes of a battery of inflammatory mediators rather than of a single one is a more adequate measurement of this KE. LIVER: When activated, resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) release inflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines, lysosomal, and proteolytic enzymes and are a main source of TGF -1 - the most potent pro-fibrogenic cytokine. Following the role of TGF - is described in more detail. Transforming growth factor (TGF -) is a pleiotropic cytokine with potent regulatory and inflammatory activity [Sanjabi et al., 2009; Li and Flavell, 2008a;2008b]. The multi -faceted effects of TGF - on numerous immune functions are cellular and environmental context dependent [Li et al., 2006]. TGF - binds to TGF - receptor II (TGF -RII) triggering the kinase activity of the cytoplasmic domain that in turn activates TGF -RI. The activated receptor complex leads to nuclear translocation of Smad molecules, and transcription of target genes [Li et al., 2006a]. The role of TGF - as an immune modulator of T cell activity is best exemplified by the similarities between TGF -1 knockout and T cell specific TGF - receptor II knockout mice [Li et al., 2006b; Marie et al., 2006;Shull et al., 1992]. The animals in both of these models develop severe multi -organ autoimmunity and succumb to death within a few weeks after birth [Li et al., 2006b; Marie et al., 2006; Shull et al., 1992]. In addition, in mice where TGF - signaling is blocked specifically in T cells, the development of natural killer T (NKT) cells, natural regulatory T (nTreg) cells, and CD8+ T cells was shown to be dependent on TGF - signaling in the thymus [Li et al., 2006b; Marie et al., 2006]. TGF - plays a major role under inflammatory conditions. TGF - in the presence of IL -6 drives the differentiation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which can promote further inflammation and augment autoimmune conditions [Korn et al., 2009]. TGF- orchestrates the differentiation of both Treg and Th17 cells in a concentration -dependent manner [Korn et al., 2008]. In addition, TGF - in combination with IL -4, promotes the differentiation of IL -9- and IL -10- producing T cells, which lack suppressive function and also promote tissue inflammation [Dardalhon et al., 2008; Veldhoen et al., 2008]. The biological effects of TGF - under inflammatory conditions on effector and memory CD8+ T cells are much less understood. In a recent study, it was shown that TGF - has a drastically opposing role on na\u00efve compared to antige n-experienced/memory CD8+ T cells [Filippi et al., 2008]. in vitro , TGF - suppressed na\u00efve CD8+ T cell activation and IFN- production, whereas TGF - enhanced survival of memory CD8+ T cells and increased the production of IL-17 and IFN- [Filippi et al., 2008]. TGF - also plays an important role in suppressing the cells of the innate immune system. The transforming growth factor beta (TGF -) family of cytokines are ubiquitous, multifunctional, and essential to survival. They play important roles in growth and development, inflammation and repair, and host immunity. The mammalian TGF - isoforms (TGF -1, 2 and 3) are secreted as latent precursors and have multiple cell surface receptors of which at least two mediate signal transduction. Aut ocrine and paracrine effects of TGF -s can be modified by extracellular matrix, neighbouring cells and other cytokines. The vital role of the TGF - family is illustrated by the fact that approximately 50% of TGF -1 gene knockout mice die in utero and the re mainder succumb to uncontrolled inflammation after birth. The role of TGF- in homeostatic and pathogenic processes suggests numerous applications in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases characterised by inflammation and fibrosis. [Clark and al., 2009] Abnormal TGF - regulation and function are implicated in a growing number of fibrotic and inflammatory pathologies, including pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy, congestive heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis, Marfan syndrome, hypertrophic scars, systemic and TGF TGF - superfamily of cytokines. TGF - is synthesized as a non -active pro -form, forms a complex with two latent associated proteins latency -associated protein (LAP) and latent TGF- binding protein (LTBP) and undergoes protolithic cleavage by the endopeptidase furin to the mature - dimer. Among the TGF -s, six distinct isoforms have been discovered although only the TGF -1, TGF -2 and TGF -3 isoforms are expressed in mammals, and their human genes are located on chromosomes 19q13, 1q41 and 14q24, respectively. Out of the three TGF - isoforms (1, 2 and 3) only TGF -1 was linked to fibrogenesis and is the most fibrogenic factor tissue and blood levels of active TGF - are elevated and overexpression of TGF -1 in transgenic mice can induce fibrosis. Additionally, experimental fibrosis can be inhibited by anti -TGF - treatments with neutralizing antibodies or soluble TGF - [Qi 2009]. TGF -1 induces its own mRNA to sustain high levels in local sites of injury. The effects of TGF -1 are classically mediated by intracellular signalling via Smad proteins. Smads 2 and 3 are stimulatory whereas Smad is inhibitory. [Parsons and PI3 kinase are further signalling pathways in different cell types for TGF - 1 effects. TGF - is found in all tissues, but is particularly abundant in bone, lung, kidney and placental tissue. TGF - is produced by many, but not all parenchymal cell types, and is also produced or released by infiltrating cells such as lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, and platelets. Following wounding or inflammation, all these cells are potential sources of TGF-. In general, the release and activation of TGF- stimulates the production of various extracellular matrix proteins and inhibits the degradation of these matrix proteins. [Branton and Kopp, 1999] . TGF- 1 is produced by every leukocyte lineage, including lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, and its expression serves in both autocrine and paracrine modes to control the differentiation, proliferation, and state of activation of these immune cells. [Letterio and Roberts; 1998] In the liver TGF -1 is released by activated Kupffer cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and platelets; in the further course of events also activated hepatic stellate cells express TGF -1. Hepatocytes do not produce TGF -1 but in intracellular activation of 2006] TGF-1 is the most established mediator and regulator of epithelial -mesenchymal -transition (EMT) which further contributes to the production of extracellular matrix. It has been shown that TGF-1 mediates EMT by inducing snail -1 transcription factor and tyrosine phosphorylation of Smad2/3 with subsequent al., 2006] TGF-1 induces apoptosis and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo through the activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) High levels of VEGF and TGF-1 are present in many tumors. Crosstalk between the signalling pathways activated by these growth factors controls endothelial cell apoptosis and angiogenesis. [Clark and Coker; 1998] How it is Measured or Detected The specific type of measurement(s) might vary with tissue, environment and context and will need to be described for different tissue contexts as used within different AOP descriptions. In general, quantification of inflammatory markers can be done by: PCR (mRNA expression) ELISA Immunocytochemistry Immunoblotting For descriptions 2004; Kuegler Tobel et al., 2014 LIVER: There are several assays for TGB -1 measurement available. e.g. Human TGF -1 ELISA Kit. Human TGF - 1 ELISA (Enzyme -Linked Immunosorbent in vitro enzyme assay for the quantitative measurement of human TGF -1 in serum, plasma, cell culture supernatants, and urine. This assay employs an antibody specific for human TGF -1 coated on a 96 - well plate. Standards and samples are pipetted into the wells and TGF -1 present in a sample is bound to the wells by the immobilized antibody. The wells are washed and biotinyl ated anti-human TGF-1 antibody is added. antibody, HRP - conjugated streptavidin is pipetted to the wells. The wells are again washed, a TMB substrate solution is added to the wells and colour develops in proportion to the amount of TGF-1 bound. The StopSolution changes the colour from blue to yellow, and the intensity of the colour is measured at 450 nm [Mazzieri et al., 2000] References Brown GC, Bal-Price A 36: 180-190.

Key Event Description Biological state: There are striking differences in neuronal network formation and function among the developing and mature brain. The developing brain shows a slow maturation and a transient passage from spontaneous, long-duration action potentials to synaptically -triggered, short -duration action potentials. Furthermore, at this precise developmental stage the neuronal network is characterised by \"hyperexcitability\", which is related to the increased number of local circuit recurrent excitatory synapses and the lack of -amino -butyric acid A (GABAA) -mediated inhibitory function that appears much later. This \"hyperexcitability\" disappears with maturation when pairing of the pre - and postsynaptic partners occurs and synapses are formed generating population of postsynaptic potentials and population of spikes followed by developmental GABA switch. Glutamatergic neurotransmission is dominant at early stages of development and NMDA receptor -mediated synaptic currents are far more times longer than those in maturation, allowing more calcium to enter the neurons. The processes that are involved in increased calcium influx and the subsequent intracellular events seem to play a critical role in establishment of wiring of neural circuits and strengthening of synaptic connections during development (reviewed in Erecinska et al., 2004). Neurons that do not receive glutaminergic stimulation are undergoing developmental apoptosis. During the neonatal period, the brain is subject to profound alterations in neuronal circuitry due to high levels of synaptogenesis and gliogenesis. For example, in neuroendocrine regions such as site of (GnRH) system is developmentally regulated by glutamatergic neurons. The changes in the expression of the N -methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B system begin early in postnatal development, before the onset of puberty, thereby playing a role in establishing the appropriate environment for the subsequent maturation of GnRH neurons (Adams et al., 1999). Biological compartments : Neural network formation and function happen in all brain regions but it appears to onset at different time points of development (reviewed in Erecinska et al., 2004). Glutamatergic neurotransmission in hippocampus is poorly developed at birth. Initially, NMDA receptors play important role but the vast majority of these premature glutamatergic synapses are \"silent\" possibly due to delayed development of hippocampal AMPA receptors. In contrast, in the cerebral cortex the maturation of excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission happens much earlier. The \"silent\" synapses disappear by PND 7-8 in both brain regions mentioned above. There is strong evidence suggesting that NMDA receptor subunit composition controls synaptogenesis and synapse stabilization (Gambrill and Barria, 2011). It is established fact that during early postnatal development in the rat hippocampus, synaptogenesis occurs in parallel with a developmental switch in the subunit composition of NMDA receptors from NR2B to NR2A. It is suggested that early expression of NR2A in organotypic hippocampal slices reduces the number of synapses and the volume and dynamics of spines. In contrast, overexpression of NR2B does not affect the normal number and growth of synapses. However, it does increase spine motility, adding and retracting spines at a higher rate. The C terminus of NR2B, and specifically its ability to bind CaMKII, is sufficient to allow proper synapse formation and maturation. Conversely, the C terminus of NR2A was sufficient to stop the development of synapse number and spine growth. These results indicate that the ratio of synaptic NR2B over NR2A controls spine motility and synaptogenesis, and suggest a structural role for the intracellular C terminus of NR2 in recruiting the signalling and scaffolding molecules necessary for proper synaptogenesis. Interestingly, it was found that genetic deletion of NR3A accelerates glutamatergic synaptic transmission, as measured by AMPAR -mediated postsynaptic currents recorded in hippocampal CA1. Consistent, the deletion of NR3A accelerates the expression the glutamate and GluR1 sugesting that dependent upon activation of NMDA -type glutamate receptors (Henson et al., 2012). General role in biology: The development of neuronal networks can be distinguished into two phases: an early 'establishment' phase of neuronal connections, where activity -dependent and independent mechanisms could operate, and a later 'maintenance' phase, which appears to be controlled by neuronal activity (Yuste and Sur, 1999). These neuronal networks facilitate information flow that is necessary to produce complex behaviors, including learning and memory (Mayford et al., 2012). How it is Measured or Detected In vivo: The recording of brain activity by using electroencephalography (EEG), electrocorticography (ECoG) and local field potentials (LFP) assists towards the collection of signals generated by multiple neuronal cell networks. Advances in computer technology have allowed quantification of the EEG and expansion of quantitative EEG (qEEG) analysis providing a sensitive tool for time -course studies of different compounds acting on neuronal networks' function (Binienda et al., 2011). The number of excit atory or inhibitory synapses can be functionally studied at an electrophysiological level by examining the contribution of glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic inputs. The number of them can be determined by variably clamping the membrane potential and recording excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs or IPSCs) (Liu, 2004). In vitro : Microelectrode array (MEA) recordings are also used to measure electrical activity in cultured neurons (Keefer et al., 2001, Gramowski et al., 2000; Gopal, 2003; Johnstone et al., 2010). MEAs can be applied in high throughput platforms to facilitate screening of numerous chemical compounds (McConnell et al., 2012). Using selective agonists and antagonists of different classes of receptors their response can be evaluated in a quantitative manner (Novellino et al., 2011; Hogberg et al., 2011). Patch clamping technique can also be used to measure neuronal network activity.In some cases, if required, planar patch clamping technique can also be used to measure neuronal networks activity (e.g., Bosca et al., 2014).

More complex cognitive processes such as executive function likely reside only in higher mammalian species such as non-human primates and humans. Recently, larval zebrafish has also been suggested as a model for the study of learning and memory (Roberts et al., 2013). Key Event Description Learning can be defined as the process by which new information is acquired to establish knowledge by systematic study or by trial and error (Ono, 2009). Two types of learning are considered in neurobehavioral studies: a) associative learning and b) non-associative learning. Associative learning is based on making associations between different events. In associative learning, a subject learns the relationship among two different stimuli or between the stimulus and the subject's behaviour. On the other hand, non-associative learning can be defined as an alteration in the behavioural response that occurs over time in response to a single type of stimulus. Habituation and sensitization are some examples of non-associative learning. The memory formation requires acquisition, retention and retrieval of information in the brain, which is characterised by the non-conscious recall of information (Ono, 2009). There are three main categories of memory, including sensory memory, short -term or working memory (up to a few hours) and long- term memory (up to several days or even much longer). Learning and memory depend upon the coordinated action of different brain regions and neurotransmitter systems constituting functionally integrated neural networks (D'Hooge and DeDeyn, 2001). Among the many brain areas engaged in the acquisition of, or retrieval of, a learned event, the hippocampal -based memory systems have received the most study. For example, the hippocampus has been shown to be critical for spatial -temporal memory, visio -spatial memory, verbal and narrative memory, and episodic and autobiographical memory (Burgess et al., 2000; Vorhees and Williams, 2014). However, there is substantial evidence that fundamental learning and memory functions are not mediated by the hippocampus alone but require a network that includes, in addition to the hippocampus, anterior thalamic nuclei, mammillary 2002, Toscano and Guilarte, 2005; Gilbert et al., 2006, 2016). Thus, damage to variety of brain structures can potentially lead to impairment of learning and memory. The main learning areas and pathways are similar in rodents and primates, including man (Eichenbaum, 2000; Stanton and Spear, 1990).While the prefrontal cortex and frontostriatal neuronal circuits have been identified as the primary sites of higher -order cognition in vertebrates, invertebrates utilize paired mushroom bodies, shown to contain ~300,000 neurons in honey bees (Menzel, 2012; Puig et al., 2014). For the purposes of this KE (AO), impaired learning and memory is defined as an organism's inability to establish new associative or non-associative relationships, or sensory, short -term or long-term memories which can be measured using different behavioural tests described below. How it is Measured or Detected In laboratory animals : in rodents, a variety of tests of learning and memory have been used to probe the integrity of hippocampal function. These include tests of spatial learning like the radial arm maze (RAM), the Barnes maze, passive avoidance and Spontaneous alternation and most commonly, the Morris water maze (MWM). Test of novelty such as novel object recognition, and fear based context learning are also sensitive to hippocampal disruption. Finally, trace fear conditioning which incorporates a temporal component upon traditional amygdala -based fear learning engages the hippocampus. A brief description of these tasks follows. 1) RAM, Barnes, MWM are examples of spatial tasks, animals are required to learn the location of a food reward (RAM); an escape hole to enter a preferred dark tunnel from a brightly lit open field area (Barnes maze), or a hidden platform submerged below the surface of the water in a large tank of water (MWM) (Vorhees and Williams, 2014). 2) Novel Object recognition. This is a simpler task that can be used to probe recognition memory. Two objects are presented to animal in an open field on trial 1, and these are explored. On trial 2, one object is replaced with a novel object and time spent interacting with the novel object is taken evidence of memory retention - I have seen one of these objects before, but not this one (Cohen and Stackman, 2015). 3) Contextual Fear conditioning is a hippocampal based learning task in which animals are placed in a novel environment and allowed to explore for several minutes before delivery of an aversive stimulus, typically a mild foot shock. Upon reintroduction to this same environment in the future (typically 24-48 hours after original training), animals will limit their exploration, the context of this chamber being associated with an aversive event. The degree of suppression of activity after training is taken as evidence of retention, i.e., memory (Curzon et al., 2009). 4) Trace fear conditioning. Standard fear conditioning paradigms require animals to make an association between a neutral conditioning stimulus (CS, a light or a tone) and an aversive stimulus (US, a footshock). The unconditioned response (CR) that is elicited upon delivery of the footshock US is freezing behavior. With repetition of CS/US delivery, the previously neutral stimulus comes to elicit the freezing response. This type of learning is dependent on the amygdala, a brain region associated with, but distinct from the hippocampus. Introducing a brief delay between presentation of the neutral CS and the aversive US, a trace period, requires the engagement of the amygdala and the hippocampus (Shors et al., 2001). In humans : A variety of standardized learning and memory tests have been developed for human neuropsychological testing, including children (Rohlman et al., 2008). These include episodic autobiographical memory, perceptual motor tests, short and long term memory tests, working memory tasks, word pair recognition memory; object location recognition memory. Some have been incorporated in general tests of intelligence (IQ) such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and the Wechsler. Modifications have been made and norms developed for incorporating of tests of learning and memory in children. Examples of some of these tests include: 1) Rey Osterieth Complex Figure test (RCFT) which probes a variety of functions including as visuospatial abilities, memory, attention, planning, and working memory (Shin et al., 2006). 2) Children's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (CAVLT) is a free recall of presented word lists that yields measures of Immediate Memory Span, Level of Learning, Immediate Recall, Delayed Recall, Recognition Accuracy, and Total Intrusions. (Lezak 1994; Talley, 1986). 3) Continuous Visual Memory Test (CVMT) measures visual learning and memory. It is a free recall of presented pictures/objects rather than words but that yields similar measures of Immediate Memory Span, Level of Learning, Immediate Recall, Delayed Recall, Recognition Accuracy, and Total Intrusions. (Lezak, 1984; 1994). 4) Story Recall from Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) Logical Memory Test Battery, a standardized neurospychological test designed to measure memory functions (Lezak, 1994; Talley, 1986). 5) Autobiographical memory (AM) is the recollection of specific personal events in a multifaceted higher order cognitive process. It includes episodic memory - remembering of past events specific in time and place, in contrast to semantic autobiographical memory is the recollection of personal facts, traits, and general knowledge. Episodic AM is associated with greater activation of the hippocampus and a later and more gradual developmental trajectory. Absence of episodic memory in early life (infantile amnesia) is thought to reflect immature hippocampal function (Herold et al., 2015; Fivush, 2011). 6) Staged Autobiographical Memory Task. In this version of the AM test, children participate in a staged event involving a tour of the hospital, perform a series of tasks (counting footprints in the hall, identifying objects in wall display, buy lunch, watched a video). It is designed to contain unique event happenings, place, time, visual/sensory/perceptual details. Four to five months later, interviews are conducted using Children's Autobiographical Interview and scored according to standardized scheme (Willoughby et al., 2014). In Honey Bees : For over 50 years an assay for evaluating olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) has been used as a reliable method for evaluating appetitive learning and memory in honey bees (Guirfa and Sandoz, 2012; LaLone et al., 2017). These experiments pair a conditioned stimulus (e.g., an odor) with an unconditioned stimulus (e.g., sucrose) provided immediately afterward, which e licits the proboscis extension (Menzel, 2012). After conditioning, the odor alone will lead to the conditioned PER. This methodology has aided in the elucidation of five types of olfactory memory phases in honey bee, which include early short -term memory, late short - term memory, mid-term memory, early long-term memory, and late long -term memory (Guirfa and Sandoz, 2012). These phases are dependent on the type of conditioned stimulus, the intensity of the unconditioned stimulus, the number of conditioning trials, and the time between trials. Where formation of short -term memory occurs minutes after conditioning and decays within minutes, memory consolidation or stabilization of a memory trace after initial acquisition leads to mid -term memory, which lasts 1 d and is characterized by activity of the cAMP -dependent PKA (Guirfa and Sandoz, 2012). Multiple conditioning trials increase the duration of the memory after learning and coincide with increased Ca2+ -calmodulin -dependent PKC activity (Guirfa and Sandoz, 2012). Early long-term memory, where a conditioned response can be evoked days to weeks after conditioning requires translation of existing mRNA, whereas late long -term memory requires de novo gene transcription and can last for weeks (Guirfa andSandoz, 2012). Regulatory Significance of the AO A prime example of impairments in learning and memory as the adverse outcome for regulatory action is developmental lead exposure and IQ function in children (Bellinger, 2012). Most methods are well established in the published literature and many have been engaged to evaluate the effects of developmental thyroid disruption. The US EPA and OECD Developmental Neurotoxicity (DNT) Guidelines (OCSPP 870.6300 or OECD 426) both require testing of learning and memory (USEPA, 1998; OECD, 2007) advising to use the following tests passive avoidance, delayed -matching -to-position for the adult rat and for the infant rat, olfactory conditioning, Morris water maze, Biel or Cincinnati maze, radial arm maze, T-maze, and acquisition and retention of schedule -controlled behaviour. These DNT Guidelines have been deemed valid to identify developmental neurotoxicity and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (Makris et al., 2009). Also in the frame of the OECD GD 43 (2008) on reproductive toxicity, learning and memory testing may have potential to be applied in the context of developmental neurotoxicity studies. However, many of the learning and memory tasks used in guideline studies may not readily detect subtle impairments in cognitive function associated with modest degrees of developmental thyroid disruption (Gilbert et al., 2012).

Selenoproteins contain selenocysteine amino acid residues. The selenoprotein family is composed of proteins exerting diverse functions, among them several are oxidoreductases classified as antioxidant enzymes (Labunskyy, 2014; Reeves, 2009). Relevant for this KER there are two well -studied selenoprotein families which are described to be expressed in the brain; (i) the Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) family, involved in detoxification of hydroperoxides; (ii) the Thioredoxin Reductase (TrxR) family, involved in the regeneration of reduced thioredoxin (Pillai, 2014), but also the less studied SelH, K, S, R, W, and P selenoproteins (Pisoschi, 2015; Reeves, 2009). As summarized in the table 1, binding to the thiol/selenol groups of the selenoproteins cited above can result in structural modifications of these proteins, which in turn inhibits their catalytic activity and thereby reduces or blocks their metabolic capacity to neutralize reactive oxygen species (Fernandes, 1996; Rajanna, 1995). Similarly, binding to the thiol group of glutathione will decrease its anti-oxidant capacity. Figure (Poole, 2015) Structures of cysteinyl and selenocysteinyl residues within proteins. The aminoacyl groups are shown to the left, with dotted lines representing peptide bonds to the next residue on either side. Both protonated (left) and deprotonated (right) forms of these amino acids are depicted with average pKa values. Evidence Supporting this KER Biological Plausibility GPx family GPxs are tetrameric enzymes. Their thiol groups can either act directly as a reductant, or catalyze reduction of hydrogen peroxide and/or flavoenzymes, which mediate the reduction of oxidized Txn at the expense of NADPH (Birben, 2012). Inhibition of TrxR enzymes has been stress (Branco, 2017). SelP Downregulation of intracellular SelP by use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) impaired the viability of human astrocytes and made them more susceptible to hydroperoxide -induced oxidative stress, pointing to a direct contribution of SeP to ROS clearance (Steinbrenner, 2006). Table 1 Selenoprotein family Protein name Normal brain function Disruption leading to oxidative stress Reference Glutathione GSH GSH is a major endogenous antioxidant functioning directly in neutralization of free radicals and reactive oxygen compounds. GSH is the reduced form of glutathione and its SH group of cysteine is able to reduce and/or maintain reduced form of other molecules. Disruptions leads to increased oxidative stress and apoptosis.

Brain expression levels are highest in microglia and lower levels detected in neurons. Brains of GPx1/ mice are more vulnerable to mitochondrial toxin treatment, ischemia/ reperfusion, and cold- induced brain injury. Cultured neurons from GPx1/ mice were reported to be more susceptible to A- induced oxidative stress, and addition of ebselen reversed this.

The selenol group ( thiols ( -SH) towards mercury (Sugiura 1976, Khan, 2009). Methyl mercury (MeHg) can target both the GPx and TrxR proteins thereby decreasing protection against oxidative stress and therefore causing increased oxidative stress and neurotoxicity (Branco, 2017, Carvalho, 2008, Farina, 2011). Note: The binding of HgCl 2 and MeHg is always studied in vitro on the isolated protein, whereas the effects on the activity of the proteins involved in protection against oxidative stress is mostly studied in isolated cells, mitochondrial fractions or in animals. Therefore the concentrations cannot be compared. Binding of Hg to thiol groups and al., 2008, 2011; Wiederhold et al., 2010; Sugiura et al., 1978; Arnold et al., 1986; Han et al., 2001; Qiao et al., 2017).

Uncertainties and Inconsistencies Another important group of thiol-containing proteins are the metal -binging detoxifying metallothioneins. This protein family bind mercury and lead, and this binding thus serves as a protective mechanism and also protects against metal toxicity and oxidative stress (Aschner, 2006). Lactational exposure to methylmercury (10 mg/L in drinking water) significantly increased cerebellar GSH level and GR activity. Possibly a compensatory response to mercury -induced oxidative stress (Franco, 2006). MeHg was shown to inhibit cerebral thioredoxin reductase activity in vitro but not in brain of mice (Wagner et al., 2010). However, it has to be noted that the exposure of mice to MeHg was only 24h. Inhibition og GR and GrX by Hg2+ and MeHg was observed on the puried protein, but not in HeLa cells incubated with the same concentrations for 24h (Carvahlo et al., 2008).

Key Event Relationship Description High levels of oxidizing free radicals can be very damaging to cells and molecules within the cell. As a result, the cell has important defense mechanisms to protect itself from ROS, including reducing agents, glutathione peroxidases, thioredoxin reductases. Oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defenses. Ensuing from this definition, a decrease in cellular antioxidant protection will lead to the increase of oxidative stress. Evidence Supporting this KER Biological Plausibility The cell has important defense mechanisms to protect itself from oxidative stress. The cellular defense mechanisms are numerous and include repair mechanisms, prevention mechanisms, physical defenses, as well as antioxidant defense such as antioxidant enzymes, low-molecular -weight antioxidants and chelating agents (Kohen, 2002). Whenever one or many of these mechanisms are decreased, the balance will tilt towards the production of ROS, and thus generate oxidative stress. In this KER we focus on the decreased protection due to interference with the antioxidant defense system.

Key Event Relationship Description In the central nervous system (CNS), glutamate (Glu) is rapidly taken up at the synaptic cleft to mitigate potential excitotoxicity (Meldrum, 2000). Reuptake is carried out by the electrochemical gradient of Glu across the plasma membrane and is accomplished by Glu transporter proteins, referred to as excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs). These transporter proteins are predominantly expressed in astrocytes, but they are also be found in other neural cells, such as oligodendrocyte, neuron, and microglia membranes (Danbolt, 2001). Functional Glu transporters are located on cell surface membranes. The activities of these transporters are regulated by a redistribution of these proteins to or from the plasma membrane (Robinson 2002), under the control of several signaling pathways. Five different families of EAATs have been recognized (EAAT1 -EAAT5). They vary in Na+ and/or K+ coupling abilities. Their names differ based on the presence of the transporter in human or in other mammals (see Table 1 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5343888/table/ijms -18-00353 -t004/)). Transporter (Human) (retina) Table 1: Glu transporters in human and mammals and their occurrence in CNS cells. From Rajda et al., 2017 These transporters co-localize with, form physical (co-immunoprecipitable) interactions with, and functionally couple to various 'energy -generating' including enzymes, glycolytic enzymes, and mitochondria/mitochondrial proteins. This functional coupling is bi-directional with many of these systems both being regulated by glutamate transport and providing the 'fuel' to support glutamate uptake (Robinson and Jackson, 2016). The Na+ gradient, which depends on Na/K ATPase pump and consequently of ATP production and intracellular levels, provides the energy to move Glu from the outside into the cells, accompanied by two Na+ and an H+ ; at the same time, K+ moves in the opposite direction (Boron and Boulpaep, 2003). Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to a decrease in ATP synthesis, impaired Ca2+ content, and concomitant increase in the levels of ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) and RNS (Reactive Nitrogen Species) (Beal, 2005). Free radicals, which are electrically unstable, have a central role in several physiological and pathological processes. Both ROS and RNS originate and exogenous sources. Mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, phagocytic cells, and others serve as endogenous sources, and environmental factors, such as alcohol, tobacco, pollution, industrial solvents, pesticides, heavy metals, specified medicines, etc. make up the prepondarance of exogenous factors. Significant amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS,) are formed during oxidative phosphorylation, when the greatest amount of ATP is produced. Cellular antioxidants production serves as a countermeasure against this process (Su et al., 2013; Szalardi et al., 2015). Most cells, including astrocytes, have protective mechanisms against ROS, predominantly in the form of the tripeptide thiol, glutathione (GSH) (Hsie et al., 1996). This process stays in a highly sensitive balance. In the specific case when ROS and RNS synthesis exceeds antioxidant synthesis it results in oxidative stress (Reddy, 2006; Ghafouribar et al., al., 2003; and Manfredi, 2003). Evidence Supporting this KER Biological Plausibility Due to the tight coupling of Glu transporters with energy production, and to the important role of Glu transporters in Glu homeostasis, perturbations of energy metabolism such as mitochondrial dysfunction and increased production of ROS lead to Glu dyshomeostasis (Boron and Boulpaep, 2003). In particular, it was shown that ROS inhibit glutamate uptake by astrocytes (Sorg et al., 1997), and that glutamate release is mediated by ROS -activated volume -sensitive outwardly rectifying anion channels (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2697293/) (Liu et al., 2009). Empirical Evidence Porciuncula et al., (2003) . Methylmercury (2 -10 \u00b5M) inhibits glutamate uptake in synaptic vesicles isolated from rat brain in a concentration -dependent manner (with LD 50 at 50 \u00b5M). It also inhibits the H+-ATPase activity in a concentration -dependent manner with similar LD 50. This suggests that the vesicular glutamate uptake is impaired by methylmercury and that this effect involves the H+-ATPase. Roos et al., (2009) . Methylmercury induced ROS production in rat brain cortical slices after 2h exposure at 100 and 200 \u00b5M and after 5h exposure at 50 \u00b5M. Guanosine inhibitor receptors, MK801 (50 \u00b5M) equally blocked the methylmercury -induced ROS production by two potential mechanisms of action: (i) mercury by affecting mitochondria iincreased ROS formation, which decrease glutamate uptake and consequently increased extracellular glutamate acting on NMDA receptors; (ii) The ROS formation is secondary to overstimulation of NMDA receptors, due to mercury -induced decrease in glutamate uptake. Roos et al., (2011) . Experiments performed in isolated mitochondria from rat liver slices showed that methylmercury (25 \u00b5M) increased ROS production (measured by dichlorofluoroscein). Methionine treatment (50-250 \u00b5M) was effective in reducing ROS formation. Juarez et al., (2002) . Microdialysis probe in adult Wistar rats showed that acute exposure to methylmercury (10, 100 \u00b5M) induced an increase release of extracellular glutamate (9.8 fold at 10 \u00b5M and 2.4 fold at 100 \u00b5M). This extracellular glutamate level remained elevated at least 90 min following methylmercury exposure. Allen et al., (2001) . Cerebral cortical astrocytes were treated with methylmercury (1 \u00b5M for 24h or 10 \u00b5M for 30 min) and loaded with [U-13C] glutamate. In the methylmercruy -treated group, a decrease of [U -13C] lactate was observed. This lactate can only be derived from mitochondrial metabolism, via the tricarboxylic acid, showing a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and glutamate metabolism. In addition, the decreased lactate production might be detrimental to surrounding cells, since lactate has been shown to be an important substrate for neurons. Uncertainties and Inconsistencies The relationship between oxidative stress associated to mitochondrial dysfunction and glutamate dyshomeostasis is complex and may be bidirectional. Glutamate dysfunction, due to decreased glutamate uptake, can secondarly induce increased ROS production and consequently stress. enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS), transforming glutamate in glutamine, which is taken up by neurons, is also a SH-containing protein, which is inhibited by mercury binding (Kwon and Park, 2003). This participate to glutamate dyshomeostasis linking this KE directly to the MIE. Quantitative Understanding of the Linkage According to Porciuncula et al., (2003), a decrease of 50% of H+-ATP activity was associated to a decrease of 50% of glutamate uptake following exposure of synaptic vesicles with 5 uM of methylmercury. Xu et al. (2012) and Feng et al. (2014) observed that in rats treated with 12 umoles/kg for 4 weeks a 4-fold increase in ROS level in cerebral cortex, and a 2- fold increase in protein and DNA peroxidation were associated with about 20% increase of glutamate and 30% decrease of glutamine. Known Feedforward/Feedback loops influencing this KER In case of glutamate dyshomeostasis, when extracellular concentrations are very high (5 - 10 mM), a mechanism of toxicity called oxidative glutamate toxicity can be observed. It is mediated by an inhibition of cystein uptake leading to a depletion of GSH (Kritis et al., 2015). The GSH depletion decreases the protection against oxidative stress and exacerbates oxidative stress, which, in turn, exacerbates glutamate dyshomeostasis. References Allen, J. W., H. El-Oqayli, M.

However, as the neurotransmitter glutamate is already found in insects, it is plausible that this KER is valid throughout taxa (Harris et al., 2014). Key Event Relationship Description Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS, where it plays key roles in development, learning, memory and response to injury. However, glutamate at high concentrations at the synaptic cleft acts as a toxin, inducing neuronal in jury and death (Meldrum, 2000; Ozawa et al., 1998). Glutamate -mediated neurotoxicity has been dubbed as \"excitotoxicity\", referring to the consequence of the overactivation of the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) -type glutamate 48), leading Na+ and Ca2+ influx into neurons (Choi, 1992; Pivovarova and Andrews, 2010). Increased intracellular Ca2+ levels are associated with the generation of oxidative stress and neurotoxicity (Lafon -Cazal et al., 1993). Accordingly, the control of extracellular levels of glutamate dictates its physiological/pathological actions and this equilibrium is maintained primarily by the action of several glutamate transporters (such as GLAST, GLT1, and EAAC1) located on astrocytic cell excitatory neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft, keeping its extracellular concentrations below toxic levels (Anderson Swanson, 2000; Maragakis and Rothstein, 2001; Szydlowska and Tymianski, to synaptic transmission, physiological stimulation of glutamate receptors can mediate trophic effects and promote neuronal plasticity. During development, NMDA receptors initiate a cascade of signal transduction events and gene expression changes primarily involving Ca2+-mediated signaling, induced by activation of either Ca2+- permeable receptor channels or voltage -sensitive Ca2+ channels. The consecutive activation of major protein kinase signaling pathways, such as Ras-MAPK/ERK and PI3 -K-Akt, contributes to regulation of gene ex pression through the activation of key transcription factors, such as CREB, SRF, MEF -2, NF -kappaB. Metabotropic glutamate receptors signaling pathways, in part by transactivating receptor tyrosine kinases. Indirect effects of glutamate receptor stimulation are due to the release of neurotrophic factors, such as brain derived neurotrophic factor through glutamate -induced release of trophic factors from glia. The trophic effect of glutamate receptor activation is developmental stage -dependent and may play an important role in determining the selective survival of neurons that made proper connections. During this sensitive developmental period, interference with glutamate receptor function may lead to widespread neuronal loss (Balazs, 2006). Evidence Supporting this KER Biological Plausibility Glutamate dyshomeostasis and in particular excess of glutamate in synaptic cleft will lead to overactivation of ionotropic glutamate receptors and cause cell injury/death, as described in AOP 48. The excess of glutamate can result from decreased uptake in astrocytes (Aschner et al., 2000; Brookes and Kristt, 1989), or neurons (Moretto et al., 2005; Porciuncula et al., 2003). But also from the increased release (Reynolds and Rac z, 1987). This neurotoxic cascade involves calcium overload and ROS production leading to oxidative stress cause a direct oxidative stress by perturbing mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins and by decreasing anti -oxidant defense mechanism (see KER : MIE to KEdown oxidative stress) and an indirect oxidative stress via perturbation of glutamate homeostasis/excitotoxicity. Thus, there may be some redundancy in the empirical support between this KER and the KER linking KEup oxidative stress and KEdown cell injury/death. Glutamate has been shown to regulate BDNF production (Tao et al., 2002). Accordingly, glutamate may also indirectly contribute to cell injury/death by inducing modifications in the brain levels of trophic factors, since it is known that changes in trophic support can lead to cell injury/death, as well as to perturbation in the physiological establishment of neuronal network (Zhao et al., 2017).

Neuroinflammation has been described in mammals (rat, mouse, monkey, human). Key Event Relationship Description The pioneering work of Kreutzberg and coworkers (1995, 1996) has shown that neuronal injury leads to neuroinflammation, with microglia (fraktalkine, CD200) control the neuron -microglia interactions, and a loss of this control can trigger microglial reactivity (Blank and Prinz, 2013; Chapman et al., 2000; Streit et al., 2001). Upon injury causing neuronal death (mainly necrotic), signals termed Damage -Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) are released by damaged neurons and promote microglial reactivity (Marin -Teva et al., 2011; Katsumoto et al., 2014). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern - recognition receptors that recognize specific pathogen - and danger -associated molecular signatures (PAMPs and DAMPs) and subsequently initiate i nflammatory and immune responses. Microglial cells express TLRs, mainly TLR -2, which can detect neuronal cell death (for review, see Hayward and Lee, 2014). TLR -2 functions as a master sentry receptor to detect neuronal death and tissue damage in many different neurological conditions including nerve trans -section injury, traumatic brain injury and hippocampal excitotoxicity (Hayward and Lee, 2014). Astrocytes, the other cellular mediator of neuroinflammation (Ranshoff and Brown, 2012) are also able to sense tissue injury via TLR -3 (Farina et al., 2007; Rossi, 2015). Evidence Supporting this KER Biological Plausibility It is widely accepted that cell/neuronal injury and death lead to neuroinflammation (microglial and astrocyte reactivities) in adult brain. In the developing brain, neuroinflammation was observed after neurodegeneration induced by excitotoxic lesions (Acarin et al., 1997; Dommergues et al., 2003) or after ethanol exposure (Tiwari et al., 2012; Ahmad et al., 2016). It is important to note that physiological activation of microglial cells is observed during normal brain development for removal of apoptotic debris (Ashwell 1990, 1991). But exposure to toxicant (ethano l), excitotoxic insults (kainic acid) or traumatic brain injury during development can also induce apoptosis in hippocampus and cerebral cortex, as measured either by TUNEL, BID or caspase 3 upregulation associated to an inflammatory response, as evidenced by increased level of pro- inflammatory cytokines IL-1b, TNF-a, of NO, of p65 of astrogliosis, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), suggesting that, during brain development, neuroinflammation can also be triggerred by apoptosis induced by several types of insult (Tiwari and Chopra, 2012; Baratz et al., 2015; Mesuret et al., 2014). Empirical Evidence Pb In 3D cultures prepared from fetal rat brain cells exposed to Pb (10-6 - 10-4 M for 10 days), Pb -induced neuronal death was evidenced by a decrease of cholinergic and GABAergic markers associated to a decrease in protein content, and was accompanied by microglial and astrocyte reactivities (Zurich et al., 2002). These effects were more pronounced in immature than in differentiated cultures (Zurich et al., 2002). In adult rats, exposure to 100 ppm of Pb for 8 weeks caused neuronal death, evidenced by an increase in apoptosis (TUNEL) that was associated with microglial reactivity and an increase in IL -1b, TNF-a and i -NOS expression (Liu et al., 2012). Acute exposure to Pb (25 mg/kg, ip, for 3 days) increased GFAP and glutamate synthetase expression with impaiment probable neuronal injury (Struzynska, 2000; Struzynska et al., 2001). It is interesting to note that glial cells and in particular astrocytes are able to accumulate lead, suggesting that thes cells may be also a primary target of lead neurotoxic effects (Zurich et al., 1998; Lindhal et al., 1999). Domoic acid Astrogliosis is one of the histopathological findings revealed by the assessment of brains derived from patients diagnosed with Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP) (reviewed in Pulido, 2008). In a reference study, where the brain of a patient after acute DomA intoxication has been examined in great detail gliosis has been detected in the overlying cortex, dorsal and ventral septal nuclei, the secondary olfactory the nucleus accumbens (Cendes et al., 1995). Reactive astrogliosis has also been confirmed in the sixth cortical layer and subjacent white matter in the orbital and lateral basal areas, the first and second temporal gyri, the the parietal parasagittal cortex, and the insula (Cendes et al., 1995). Adult rats have been assessed seven days after the administration of DomA (2.25 mg/kg i.p.) and GSI- B4 histochemistry (Appel et al., 1997). More investigators have suggested that DomA can activate microglia (Ananth et al., 2001; Chandrasekaran et al., 2004). DomA treatment (2 mg/kg once a day for 3 weeks) in mice significantly stimulates the expression of inflammatory mediators, including IL-1 (1.7 fold increase), TNF - (2 fold increase), GFAP (1.4 fold increase), Cox -2 (3 fold increase), and iNOS (1.6 fold increase) compared to controls (Lu et al, 2013). Adult female and male mice have been injected i.p. with 4mg/kg (LD50) of DomA and Real-time PCR has been performed in the brain derived at 30, 60 and 240 min post -injection. The inflammatory response element cyclooxygenase 2 (COX -2) has been found to be 8 fold increased at the 30 and 60 min time points and then showed a descent back toward basal expression levels by 240 min (Ryan et al., 2005). Adult male rats treated with 2 mg/kg DomA i.p. have been sacrificed after 3 or 7 d and shown that GFAP and lectin staining could identify regions of reactive gliosis within areas of neurodegeneration however observed at higher magnifications compared to the ones used for neurodegeneration (Appel et al., 1997; Scallet et al., 2005). At 5 days and 3 months following DomA administration of male Wistar rats, a large number of OX -42 positive microglial cells exhibiting intense immunoreactivity in CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus have been detected. With an antibody against GFAP, immunoreactive astrocytes have been found to be sparsely distributed in the hippocampus derived from DomA treated rats after 3 months' time interval (Ananth et al., 2003). At 5 days after the administration of DomA, GFAP positive astrocytes have been found increased in the hippocampus (Ananth et al., 2003). Mercury Young mice receiving a fish diet (MeHgCl) for 3 months exhibited in cortex a decrease of the chemokine Ccl 2 and neuronal death, as measured by a decrease in cell density, as well as microglial reactivity (increase in Iba1-labelled cells) (Godefroy (GD7 -PD21, 0.5 mg/kg bw/day in drinking water) lead to a delayed decrease (PD 36) of cholinergic muscarinic receptors in cerebellum accompanied by astrogliosis (Roda et al., 2008). Immature rat brain cell cultures maintained in 3D conditions were exposed to either MeHgCl or HgCl 2 (10-9 - 10-6 M, for 10 days). This treatment caused microglial and astrocyte activation without neuronal death, but a reversible decrease of the expression of the neuronal marker MAP2 (Monnet -Tschudi et al., 1996 ; Eskes et al., 2002). Adult marmoset exposed acutely to 5 mg Hg/kg/day p.o. exhibited Mercury content in occipital cortex was 31 mg/g (Yamamoto et al., 2012). Monkeys exposed to MeHgCl (50 mg/bw for 6,12,18 months) showed microglial and astrocyte activation without any change in neuronal number. Both astrocyte and microglia accumulated elevated levels of inorganic mercury, suggesting a direct effect of mercury on glial cells (Charleston et al., 1996). Human LUHMES cells as model of dopaminergic neurons and the human astrocyte cell line CFF-STTG1 were exposed to MeHgCl (0.25 -5 mM), thiomersal (0.25 - 5 mM) or HgCl2 (5-35 mM), what affected their cell viability. Neurons were much more sensitive than astrocytes (Lohren et al., 2015). A direct activation of rat primary microglial cells and astrocytes was observed after exposure to MeHgCl (10-10-10-6 M, for 5 days). (Eskes et al., 2002). Astrocyte + microglia in co -cultures exposed to mercury (1-5 mM for 30 min to 6 days) showed lower levels of GSH in microglia than in astrocytes (Ni et al., 2011 ; 2012). Human primary astrocyte cell line exposed to MeHgCl (1.125 mM) for 24h and 72h did not exhibit an increase of GFAP, but of NfkB after the 72h (Malfa et al., 2014). Sex dependency In prairie voles 10 weeks exposure to 600 ppm HgCl 2 in drinking water lead to an increase of TNF -a in hippocampus of male, but not in female (Curtis et al., 2011). Acrylamide (acrylamide is a common food contaminant generated by heat processing) Adult mice received 10, 20, 30 mg/kg bw for 4 weeks. The dose of 20 mg/kg bw caused neurological symptoms (ex. cognitive impairment) associated to an increased oxidative stress, a decrease of GSH and glial Iba1 increase in TNF -a, IL-1b and i-NOS expression in all 3 brain regions was also observed. (Santhanasabepathy et al., 2015) Isolated and/or co -cultures of microglial cells or astrocytes treated with acrylamide 0 -1mM for 24 -96h exhibited an increased release of TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6 and G-CSF, suggesting a direct effect of acrylamide on glial cells (Zhao et al., 2017a,b,c). Neonatal rat astrocytes treated with acrylamide (0.1-1mM) for 7, 11, 15, or 20 days increased their proliferation rate as measured by PCNA staining. Astrocyte proliferation is also a sign of reactivity. (Aschner et al., 2005). Uncertainties and Inconsistencies Pb It is interesting to note that glial cells and in particular astrocytes are able to accumulate lead, suggesting that thes cells may be also a primary target of lead neurotoxic effects (Zurich et al., 1998; Lindhal et al., 1999). Sobin and coworkers (2013) described a Pb -induced decrease in dentate gyrus volume associated with microglial reactivity at low dose of Pb (30 ppm), but not at high doses (330 ppm), plausibly due to the death of microglial cells at the high dose of Pb. Pb decreased IL -6 secretion by isolated astrocytes (Qian et al., 2007). Such a decrease was also observed in isolated astrocytes treated with methylmercury, and was reverted in microglia astrocyte co-cultures, suggesting that cell-cell interactions can modify the response to a toxicant and that cultures of a single cell type may not be representative of the organ toxicity (Eskes et al., 2002). Domoic acid Adult male and female Sprague Dawley rats have received a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of DomA (0, 1.0, 1.8 mg/kg) and have been sacrificed 3 h after the treatment. Histopathological analysis of these animals has shown no alterations for GFAP immunostaining in the dorsal hippocampus and olfactory bulb, indicating absence of reactive gliosis (Baron et al., 2013). The exposed zebrafish from the 36 -week treatment with DomA showed no neuroinflammation in brain (Hiolski et al., 2014). At the same time, microarray analysis revealed no significant changes in gfap gene expression, a marker of neuroinflammation and astrocyte activation (Hiolski et al., 2014). Mercury Mouse developmental exposure to 50 mM of HgCl 2 in maternal drinking water from GD8 to PD21 did not induce any change in GM-CSF, IFN-g, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL -5, IL -6, -12p70. IL -13, IL -17, MCP1, MIP2 and TNF -a measured by Luminex in brain slices of PD21 and PD70. No sex differences, but brain increase of IgG and increased sociability in females (Zhang et al., 2012). 3D rat brain cell cultures treated for 10 days with HgCl2 or MeHgCl (10-10 - 10-6 M) exhibited increased apotosis measured by TUNEL, but exclusively in immature cultures. The proportion of cells undergoing apoptotis was highest for astrocytes than for neurons. But the apoptotic nuclei were not associated with reactive microglial cells as evidenced by double staining (Monnet -Tschudi, 1998). Acrylamide A 2 week exposure to acrylamide in drinking water (44mg/kg/day) induced behavioral effects, such a decreased in locomotor activity, but with no effect at gene level on neuronal and inflammatory markers analyzed in somatosensory and motor cortex (Bowyer et al., 2009).

Upon injury causing neuronal death (mainly necrotic), signals termed Damage -Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) are released by damaged neurons and promote microglial reactivity (Marin -Teva et al., 2011; Katsumoto et al., 2014). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern - recognition receptors that recognize specific pathogen - and danger -associated molecular signatures (PAMPs and DAMPs) and subsequently initiate inflammatory and immune responses. Microglial cells express TLRs, mainly TLR-2, which can detect neuronal cell death (for review, see Hayward and Lee, 2014). TLR -2 functions as a master sentry receptor to detect neuronal death and tissue damage in many different neurological conditions including nerve trans - section injury, traumatic brain injury and hippocampal excitotoxicity (Hayward and Lee, 2014). Astrocytes, the other cellular mediator of neuroinflammation (Ranshoff and Brown, 2012) are also able to sense tissue injury via TLR -3 (Farina et al., 2007; Rossi, 2015). LIVER: Damaged hepatocytes release reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytokines such as TGF -1 and TNF -, and chemokines which lead to oxidative stress, inflammatory signalling and finally activation of the resident macrophages in the liver, Kupffer cells (KCs). ROS generation in hepatocytes results from by NADH oxidase (NOX) and cytochrome 2E1 activati on as well as through lipid peroxidation. Damaged liver cells trigger a sterile inflammatory response with activation of innate immune cells through release of damage -associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which activate KCs through toll-like receptors and recruit activated neutrophils and monocytes into the liver. Central to this inflammatory response is the promotion of ROS formation by these phagocytes. Upon initiation of apoptosis hepatocytes undergo genomic DNA fragmentation and formation of apoptotic bodies; these apoptotic bodies are consecutively engulfed by KCs and cause their activation. This increased phagocytic activity strongly up-regulates NOX expression in KCs, a superoxide producing enzyme of phagocytes with nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA transcriptional levels with consequent harmful reaction between ROS and nitricoxide (NO), like the generation of cytotoxic peroxinitrite (N2O3). ROS and/or diffusible aldehydes also derive from liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) which are additional initial triggers of KC activation. [Winwood and Arthur,1993; Luckey and Petersen, 2001; Roberts et al., et al., 2000] Evidence Supporting this KER LIVER: There is convincing theoretical evidence that hepatocyte injury and apoptosis causes KC activation, as well as inflammation and oxidative stress. But there are only limited experimental studies which could show that there is a direct relationship between these two events with temporal concordance. Specific markers for activated KCs have not been identified yet. KC activation cannot be detected morphologically by staining techniques since cell morphology does not change, but cytokines release can be measured (with the caveat that KCs activate spontaneously in vitro) and used as marker for KC activation. [Canbay et al., 2003; Soldatow et al., 2013] Tukov et al. examined the effects of KCs cultured in contact with rat hepatocytes. They found that by adding KCs to the cultures they could mimic in vivo drug-induced inflammatory responses. Experiments on cells of the macrophage lineage showed significant aldehyde - induced stimulat ion of the activity of protein kinase C, an enzyme involved in several signal transduction pathways. Further, 4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE) was demonstrated to up-regulate TGF -1 expression and synthesis in isolated rat KCs. [Tukov et al., 2006] Canbay et al could prove that engulfment of hepatocyte apoptotic bodies stimulated KC generation of cytokines. [LeCluyse et al., 2012] Biological Plausibility It is widely accepted that cell/neuronal injury and death lead to neuroinflammation (microglial and astrocyte reactivities) in adult brain. In the developing brain, neuroinflammation was observed after neurodegeneration induced by excitotoxic lesions (Acarin et al., 1997; Dommergues et al., 2003) or after ethanol exposure (Tiwari et al., 2012; Ahmad et al., 2016). It is important to note that physiological activation of microglial cells is observed during normal brain development for removal of apoptotic debris (Ashwell 1990, 1991). But exposure to toxicant (ethano l), excitotoxic insults (kainic acid) or traumatic brain injury during development can also induce apoptosis in hippocampus and cerebral cortex, as measured either by TUNEL, BID or caspase 3 upregulation associated to an inflammatory response, as evidenced by increased level of pro- inflammatory cytokines IL-1b, TNF-a, of NO, of p65 of astrogliosis, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), suggesting that, during brain development, neuroinflammation can also be triggerred by apoptosis induced by several types of insult (Tiwari and Chopra, 2012; Baratz et al., 2015; Mesuret et al., 2014). Empirical Evidence Mercury Young mice receiving a fish diet (MeHgCl) for 3 months exhibited in cortex a decrease of the chemokine Ccl 2 and neuronal death, as measured by a decrease in cell density, as well as microglial reactivity (increase in Iba1-labelled cells) (Godefroy et to MeHgCl (GD7 -PD21, 0.5 mg/kg bw/day in drinking water) lead to a delayed decrease (PD 36) of cholinergic muscarinic receptors in cerebellum accompanied by astrogliosis (Roda et al., 2008). Immature rat brain cell cultures maintained in 3D conditions were exposed to either MeHgCl or HgCl 2 (10-9 - 10-6 M, for 10 days). This treatment caused microglial and astrocyte activation without neuronal death, but a reversible decrease of the expression of the neuronal marker MAP2 (Monnet -Tschudi et al., 1996 ; Eskes et al., 2002). Adult marmoset exposed acutely to 5 mg Hg/kg/day p.o. exhibited Mercury content in occipital cortex was 31 mg/g (Yamamoto et al., 2012). Monkeys exposed to MeHgCl (50 mg/bw for 6,12,18 months) showed microglial and astrocyte activation without any change in neuronal number. Both astrocyte and microglia accumulated elevated levels of inorganic mercury, suggesting a direct effect of mercury on glial cells (Charleston et al., 1996). Human LUHMES cells as model of dopaminergic neurons and the human astrocyte cell line CFF-STTG1 were exposed to MeHgCl (0.25 -5 mM), thiomersal (0.25 - 5 mM) or HgCl2 (5-35 mM), what affected their cell viability. Neurons were much more sensitive than astrocytes (Lohner et al., 2015). A direct activation of rat primary microglial cells and astrocytes was observed after exposure to MeHgCl (10-10-10-6 M, for 5 days). (Eskes et a\u00e9., 2002). Astrocyte + microglia in co -cultures exposed to mercury (1-5 mM for 30 min to 6 days) showed lower levels of GSH in microglia than in astrocytes (Ni et al., 2011 ; 2012). Human primary astrocyte cell line exposed to MeHgCl (1.125 mM) for 24h and 72h did not exhibit an increase of GFAP, but of NfkB after the 72h (Malfa et al., 2014). Human mast cells (leukemic LAD2, derived from umbilical cord blood) showed an increase of IL-6 release when exposed to HgCl 2 (0.1-10 mM, for 10 min to 24h). It is hypothesized that mast cell activation could lead to BBB disruption and to neuroinflammation. (Kempurai et al., 2010). Sex dependency In prairie voles 10 weeks exposure to 600 ppm HgCl 2 in drinking water lead to an increase of TNF -a in hippocampus of male, but not in female (Curtis et al., 2011). Acrylamide (acrylamide is a common food contaminant generated by heat processing) Adult mice received 10, 20, 30 mg/kg bw for 4 weeks. The dose of 20 mg/kg bw caused neurological symptoms (ex. cognitive impairment) associated to an increased oxidative stress, a decrease of GSH and glial Iba1 increase in TNF -a, IL-1b and i -NOS expression in all 3 brain regions was also observed. (Santhanasabepathy et al., 2015) Isolated and/or co -cultures of microglial cells or astrocytes treated with acrylamide 0 -1mM for 24-96h exhibited an increased release of TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6 and G-CSF, suggesting a direct effect of acrylamide on glial cells (Zhao et al., 2017a,b). Neonatal rat astrocytes treated with acrylamide (0.1-1mM) for 7, 11, 15, or 20 days increased their proliferation rate as measured by PCNA staining. Astrocyte proliferation is also a sign of reactivity. (Aschner et al., 2005). Acrolein Adult rat received an infusion of acrolein (15, 50, 150 nmoles/0.5 ml) directly in substantia nigra which caused a decrease of Tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining, an increase in caspase 1 and an activation of microglial cells and astrocytes (Wang et al., 2017). Similar treatment as above induced an increase in lipid peroxidation, of hsp32 and of caspase 1 with an increase in GFAP and in ED1 (marker of macrophagic microglial cells) as well as of IL-1b (Zhao et al., 2017). Uncertainties and Inconsistencies Mercury Mouse developmental exposure to 50 mM of HgCl 2 in maternal drinking water from GD8 to PD21 did not induce any change in GM-CSF, IFN-g, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL -5, IL -6, -12p70. IL -13, IL -17, MCP1, MIP2 and TNF -a measured by Luminex in brain slices of PD21 and PD70. No sex differences, but brain increase of IgG and increased sociability in females (Zhang et al., 2012). 3D rat brain cell cultures treated for 10 days with HgCl2 or MeHgCl (10-10 - 10-6 M) exhibited increased apotosis measured by TUNEL, but exclusively in immature cultures. The proportion of cells undergoing apoptotis was highest for astrocytes than for neurons. But the apoptotic nuclei were not associated with reactive microglial cells as evidenced by double staining (Monnet -Tschudi, 1998). Acrylamide A 2 weeks exposure to acrylamide in drinking water (44mg/kg/day) induced behavioral effects, such a decreased in locomotor activity, but with no effect at gene level on neuronal and inflammatory markers analyzed in somatosensory and motor cortex (Bowyer et al., 2009). LIVER: The detailed mechanisms of the KC - hepatocyte interaction and its consequences for both normal and toxicant - driven liver responses remain to be determined. KC activation followed by cytokine release is associated in some cases with evident liver damage, w hereas in others this event is unrelated to liver damage or may be even protective; apparently this impact is dependent on the quantity of KC activation; excessive or prolonged release of KC mediators can switch an initially protective mechanism to a damaging inflammatory response. Evidence suggests that low levels of cytokine release from KCs constitute a survival signal that protects hepatocytes from cell death and in some cases, stimulates proliferation.

Key Event Relationship Description Cells of the innate (microglia and astrocytes) and of the adaptive (infiltrating monocytes and lymphocytes) immune system of the brain have various ways to kill neighboring cells. This is in part due to evolutionary -conserved mechanisms evolved to kill virus -infected cells or tumor cells; in part it is a bystander phenomenon due to the release of mediators that should activate other cells and contribute to the killing of invading micro -organisms. An exaggerated or unbalanced activation of immune cells can thus lead to parenchymal (neuronal) cell death (Gehrmann et al., 1995). Mediators known to have such effects comprise components of the complement system and cytokines/death receptor ligands triggering programmed cell death (Dong and Benveniste, 2001). Various secreted proteases (e.g. matrix metalloproteases), lipid mediators (e.g. ceramide or gangliosides) or reactive oxygen species can contribute to bystander death of neurons (Chao et al., 1995; Nakajima et al., 2002; Brown and Bal-Price, 2003; Kraft and Harry, 2011; Taetzsch and Block, 2013). The equimolar production of superoxide and NO from glial cells can lead to high steady levels of peroxynitrite, which is a very potent cytotoxicant (Yuste et al., 2015). Already stressed neurons, with an impaired anti -oxidant def ence system, are more sensitive to such mediators (Xu et al., 2015). Healthy cells continuously display anti \"eat-me\" signals, while damaged and stressed neurons/neurites display \"eat-me\" signals that may be recognized by microglia as signals to start phagocytosis (Neher et al., 2012) or by astrocytes (Wakida et al., 2018; Byun and Chung, et al., 2017). astrocytes are also able neurotoxic molecules and Garcia de Ybenes, 2008; Niranjan, 2014). However, astrocytes may also be protective due to their capacity to quench free radicals and secrete neurotrophic factors. The activation of astrocytes may reduce neurotrophic support to neurons (for review, Mena and Garcia de Ybenes, 2008). Evidence Supporting this KER Biological Plausibility In vitro co -culture experiments have demonstrated that reactive glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) can kill neurons (Chao et al., 1995; Brown and Bal - Price, 2003; Kraft and Harry, 2011; Taetzsch and Block, 2013) and that interventions with e.g. i-NOS inhibition can rescue the neurons (Yadav et al., 2012; Brzozowski et al., 2015). Drugs that block Toll like receptor pathways, which are expressed by glial cells have been proven to be protective by decreasing ROS and RNS production (Lucas et al., 2013). Reactive microglia can remove synapses, a process known as synapse stripping (Banati et al., 1993; Kettenmann et al., 2013). Reactive astrocytes also associated with neurite and synapse reduction -Ochoa et al., 2014). Microglia can modulate synapse plasticity, an effect mediated by cytokines. During development, microglia can promote synaptogenesis or engulf synapses, a process known as synaptic pruning (for review, Jebelli et al., 2015). It is hypothesized that alterations in microglia functioning during synapse formation and maturation of the brain can have significant long-term effects on the final established neural circuits (for review, Harry and Kraft, 2012). The fact that astrocytes can receive and respond to the synaptic information produced by neuronal activity, owing to their expression of a wide range of neurotransmitter receptors, has given rise to the concept of tripartite synapse (for review, Perez - Alvarez and Araque, 2013; Bezzi and Volterra, 2001). Pro -inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF -a, IL -1b and IL - 6, which are produced by reactive astrocytes, are on one side implicated in synapse formation and scaling, long-term potentiation and neurogenesis (for review, Bilbo and Schwartz, 2009) and on the other side can kill neurons (Chao et al., 1995; Kraft and Harry, 2011). Taken together, this suggests that neuron -glia interactions are tightly regulated and that an imbalance, such as increased or long-term release of these inflammatory mediators may lead to deleterious effects on neurons. Empirical Evidence Mercury Mercury accumulates in the brain particularly in astrocytes and induce astrocyte swelling, excitatory amino acid release and decreased anti -oxidant protections (Shanker et al., 2003; Allen et al., 2001), features that are also observed in reactive astrocytes. Due to the central role of astrocytes for neuronal function (control of water transport, production of trophic factors, of anti-oxidants, 2004; et al., 2011), it is thought that neuronal dysfunction may be secondary to disturbance in astrocytes (Aschner et al., 2007). Perinatal exposure (GD7 -PD21) of rat to MeHgCl (0.5 mg/kg bw/day) in drinking water lead to gliosis in cerebellum of immature rats (PD21) without affecting the cholinergic system. In contrast, at PD36, astrogliosis was accompanied by an increase of muscarinic M2-immunopositive Bergman cells and a lack of M3 muscarinic receptors in the molecular layer. These results suggest that astrogliosis which is observed first at PD21 may be responsible of the delayed effects of mercury on neurons (Roda et al., 2008). Developmental exposure of mice from GD8 to PD21 to 50 mM HgCl 2 in maternal drinking water: Female offsprings exhibited higher neuroinflammation which is associated with altered social behavior (Zhang et al., 2013). MG17, a novel triazole derivative, was able to reduce mercury -induced upregulation of IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF -a (measured by RT-PCR) and proved to be protective against mercury -induced neurodegeneration (Matharasala et al., 2017). Adult rats exposed to MeHg (5mg/kg bw) for 12 consecutive days exhibited piknotic nuclei in cerebellar granule cells, what was reverted by a co - administration of CA074 an inhibitor of cathepsin released by activated microglia. These observations strongly suggest that the mercury -induced neuronal pathological changes are secondary to microglial activation (Sakamoto et al., 2008). Acrylamide Rats exposed to acrylamide (20 mg/kg bw for 4 weeks) together with farmesol (sequiterpene) showed a downregulation of astrogliosis (i.e. decreased GFAP) and of microgliosis (i.e. decreased Iba1) and of TNF Il-1b and i -NOS in cortex, hippocampus and striatum. This was associated with a marked improvement in motor coordination and a decrease in markers of oxidative stress, as compared to rats exposed to acrylamide alone (Santhanasabapathy et al., 2015). Uncertainties and Inconsistencies In 3D rat brain cell-cultures, co-administration of the pro-inflammatory cytokine cytotoxic concentrations of MeHgCl (3 x 10-7 M) for 10 days protected from the mercury -induced decreased in MAP2 immunostaining, suggesting a positive effect of IL-6, in accord with its descibed trophic activity (Eskes et al., 2002).

This is in part due to evolutionary -conserved mechanisms evolved to kill virus -infected cells or tumor cells; in part it is a bystander phenomenon due to the release of mediators that should activate other cells and contribute to the killing of invading micro -organisms. An exaggerated or unbalanced activation of immune cells can thus lead to parenchymal (neuronal) cell death (Gehrmann et al., 1995). Mediators known to have such effects comprise components of the complement system and cytolkines/death receptor ligands triggering programmed cell death (Dong and Benveniste, 2001). Various secreted proteases (e.g. matrix metalloproteases), lipid mediators (e.g. ceramide or gangliosides) or reactive oxygen species can contribute to bystander death of neurons (Chao et al., 1995; Nakajima et al., 2002; Brown and Bal-Price, 2003; Kraft and Harry, 2011; Taetsch and Block, 2013). The equimolar production of superoxide and NO from glial cells can lead to high steady levels of peoxynitrite, which is a very potent cytotoxicant (Yuste et al., 2015). Already stressed neurons, with an impaired anti -oxidant defence system, are more sensitive to such mediators (Xu et al., 2015). Healthy cells continuously display anti \"eat-me\" signals, while damaged and stressed neurons/neurites display \"eat-me\" signals that may be recognized by microglia as signals to start phagocytosis (Neher et al., 2012). Reactive astrocytes are also able to release neurotoxic molecules (Mena and Garcia de Ybenes, 2008; Niranjan, 2014). However, astrocytes may also be protective due to their capacity to quench free radicals and secrete neurotrophic factors. The activation of astrocytes may reduce neurotrophic support to neurons (for review, Mena and Garcia de Ybenes, 2008). Evidence Supporting this KER Biological Plausibility In vitro co-culture experiments have demonstrated that reactive glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) can kill neurons (Chao et al., 1995; Brown and Bal - Price, 2003; Kraft and Harry, 2011; Taetzsch and Block, 2013) and that interventions with e.g. i-NOS inhibition can rescue the neurons (Yadav et al., 2012; Brzozowski et al., 2015). Drugs that block Toll like receptor pathways, which are expressed by glial cells have been proven to be protective by decreasing ROS and RNS production (Lucas et al., 2013). Reactive microglia can remove synapses, a process known as synapse stripping (Banati et al., 1993; Kettenmann et al., 2013). Reactive astrocytes also associated with neurite and synapse reduction -Ochoa et al., 2014). Microglia can modulate synapse plasticity, an effect mediated by cytokines. During development, microglia can promote synaptogenesis or engulf synapses, a process known as synaptic pruning (for review, Jebelli et al., 2015). It is hypothesized that alterations in microglia functioning during synapse formation and maturation of the brain can have significant long-term effects on the final established neural circuits (for review, Harry and Kraft, 2012). The fact that astrocytes can receive and respond to the synaptic information produced by neuronal activity, owing to their expression of a wide range of neurotransmitter receptors, has given rise to the concept of tripartite synapse (for review, Perez - Alvarez and Araque, 2013; Bezzi and Volterra, 2001). Pro -inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF -a, IL -1b and IL - 6, which are produced by reactive astrocytes, are on one side implicated in synapse formation and scaling, long-term potentiation and neurogenesis (for review, Bilbo and Schwartz, 2009) and on the other side can kill neurons (Chao et al., 1995; Kraft and Harry, 2011). Taken together, this suggests that neuron -glia interactions are tightly regulated and that an imbalance, such as increased or long-term release of these inflammatory mediators may lead to deleterious effects on neurons. Empirical Evidence Mercury Mercury accumulates in the brain particularly in astrocytes and induce astrocyte swelling, excitatory amino acid release and decreased anti -oxidant protections (Shanker et al., 2003; Allen et al., 2001), features that are also observed in reactive astrocytes. Due to the central role of astrocytes for neuronal function (control of water transport, production of trophic factors, of anti-oxidants, 2004; et al., 2011), it is thought that neuronal dysfunction may be secondary to disturbance in astrocytes (Aschner et al., 2007). Perinatal exposure (GD7 -PD21) of rat to MeHgCl (0.5 mg/kg bw/day) in drinking water lead to gliosis in cerebellum of immature rats (PD21) without affecting the cholinergic system. In contrast, at PD36, astrogliosis was accompanied by an increase of muscarinic M2-immunopositive Bergman cells and a lack of M3 muscarinic receptors in the molecular layer. These results suggest that astrogliosis which is observed first at PD21 may be responsible of the delayed effects of mercury on neurons (Roda et al., 2008). Developmental exposure of mice from GD8 to PD21 to 50 mM HgCl 2 in maternal drinking water: Female offsprings exhibited higher neuroinflammation which is associated with altered social behavior (Zhang et al., 2013). MG17, a novel triazole derivative, was able to reduce mercury -induced upregulation of IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF -a (measured by RT-PCR) and proved to be protective against mercury -induced neurodegeneration (Matharasala et al., 2017). Adult rats exposed to MeHg (5mg/kg bw) for 12 consecutive days exhibited piknotic nuclei in cerebellar granule cells, what was reverted by a co - administration of CA074 an inhibitor of cathepsin released by activated microglia. These observations strongly suggest that the mercury -induced neuronal pathological changes are secondary to microglial activation (Sakamoto et al., 2008). Acrylamide Rats exposed to acrylamide (20 mg/kg bw for 4 weeks) together with farmesol (sequiterpene) showed a downregulation of astrogliosis (i.e. decreased GFAP) and of microgliosis (i.e. decreased Iba1) and of TNF Il-1b and i -NOS in cortex, hippocampus and striatum. This was associated with a marked improvement in motor coordination and a decrease in markers of oxidative stress, as compared to rats exposed to acrylamide alone (Santhanasabapathy et al., 2015). Uncertainties and Inconsistencies In 3D rat brain cell-cultures, co-administration of the pro-inflammatory cytokine cytotoxic concentrations of MeHgCl (3 x 10-7 M) for 10 days protected from the mercury -induced decreased in MAP2 immunostaining, suggesting a positive effect of IL-6, in accord with its descibed trophic activity (Eskes et al., 2002).

(for references, see empirical evidences) Key Event Relationship Description Under physiological conditions, in the developing nervous system, apoptosis occurs during the process of synaptogenesis, where competition leads to the loss of excess neurons and to the connection of the appropriate neurons (Buss et al., 2006; Mennerick and Zorumski, 2000; Oppenheim, 1991). When a stressor increases the number of apoptotic cells this KE has a negative effect on synaptogenesis as the reduced number of neurons (besides the ones that have been already eliminated through the physiological process of apoptosis) provides limited dendritic fields for receiving synaptic inputs from incoming axons. At the same time the loss of neurons also means that there are less axons to establish synaptic contacts (Olney, 2014), leading to reduced synaptogenesis. The ability of a neuron to communicate is based on neural network formation that relies on functional synapse establishment (Col\u00f3n - Ramos, 2009). The main roles of synapses are the regulation of intercellular communication in the nervous system, and the information flow within neural networks. The connectivity and functionality of neur al networks depends on where and when synapses are formed. Therefore, the decreased synapse formation due to cell death during the process of synaptogenesis is critical and leads to decrease of neural network formation and function in the adult brain. Synaptic transmission and plasticity require the integrity of the anatomical substrate. The connectivity of axons emanating from one set of cells to post- synaptic side of synapse on the dendrites of the receiving cells must be intact for effective communication between neurons. Changes in the placement of cells within the network due to delays in neuronal migration, the absence of a full formation of dendritic arbors and spine upon which synaptic contacts are made, and the lagging of transmission of electrical impulses due to insufficient myelination will individually and cumulatively impair synaptic function. Therefore, chemicals inducing neuronal cell death by apoptosis or necrosis, or interfering with a particular system of neurotransmitters, will alter network structure and function. Evidence Supporting this KER Biological Plausibility Recently, Dekkers et al. 2013 have reviewed how under physiological conditions components of the apoptotic machinery in developing brain regulate synapse formation and neuronal connectivity. For example, caspase activation is known to be required for axon pruning during development to generate neuronal network (reviewed in Dekkers et al., 2013). Experimental work carried out in Drosophila melanogaster and in mammalian neurons shows that components of apoptotic machinery are involved in axonal degeneration that can consequently interfere with synapse formation (reviewed in Dekkers et al., 2013). Furthermore, Bax mutant mice studies indicate that the lack of this pro-apoptotic protein BAX leads to disruption of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells spacing and dendritic stratification that affects synapse localization and function (Chen et al., 2013). Neuronal network formation and function are established via the process of synaptogenesis. The developmental period of synaptogenesis is critical for the formation of the basic circuitry of the nervous system, although neurons are able to form new synapses throughout life (Rodier, 1995). The brain electrical activity dependence on synapse formation is critical for proper neuronal communication. Alterations in synaptic connectivity lead to refinement of neuronal networks during development (Cline and Haas, 2008). Indeed, knockdown of PSD-95 arrests the functional and morphological development of glutamatergic synapses (Ehrlich et al., 2007). Studies of the last 30 years demonstrated that astrocytes possess functional receptors for neurotransmitters and respond to their stimulation via release of gliotransmitters, including glutamate. These findings have led to a new concept of neuron -glia intercommunication where astrocytes play an unsuspected dynamic role by integrating neuronal inputs and modulating synaptic activity (Rossi and Volterra, 2009). According to the concept termed \"tripartite synapse\", the emerging view is that brain function actually arises from the coordinated activity of a network comprising both neurons and astrocytes. Furthermore, myelinating glial cells are well-known to insulate axons and to speed up action potential propagation. Be it motor skill learning or social behaviors in higher vertebrates, proper myelination is critical in shaping brain functions. Neurons rely on their myelinating partners not only for setting conduction speed, but also for regulating the ionic environment and fueling their energy demands with metabolites. Also, long-term axonal integrity and neuronal survival are maintained by oligodendrocytes and loss of this well-coordinated axon -glial interplay contributes to brain diseases (Saab and Nave, 2017). Therefore, reduction in glial cell number and/or reduction in myelination of axons, will very much impact the neural network function.

Although it appears evident that a decrease in cell number, in dendritic arborization or in axonal growth, as well as synapse alterations may lead to decreased neuronal network formation and function, the exact mechanism remain to be elucidated.

LTP has been recorded in aplysia, lizards, turtles, birds, mice, guinea pigs, rabbits and rats. Deficiencies in hippocampally based learning and memory following developmental hypothyroidism have been documented mainly in rodents and humans. Key Event Relationship Description Learning and memory is one of the outcomes of the functional expression of neurons and neural networks from mammalian to invertebrates. Damage or destruction of neurons by chemical compounds during development when they are in the process of synapses formation, integration and formation of neural networks, will derange the organization and function of these networks, thereby setting the stage for subsequent impairment of learning and memory. Exposure to the potential developmental toxicants during neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis will increase risk of functional neuronal network damage leading to learning and memory impairment. Impairments in learning and memory are measured using behavioral techniques. It is well accepted that these alterations in behavior are the result of structural or functional changes in neurocircuitry. Functional impairments are often measured using field potentials of critical synaptic circuits in hippocampus and cortex. A number of studies have been performed in rodent models that reveal deficits in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus as a result of developmental thyroid insufficiency (Wang et al., 2012; Oerbeck et al., 2003; Wheeler et al., 2011; Wheeler and Sui, 2006; Gilbert et al., 2016; Gilbert, 2011; Gilbert et al., 2016). A well -established functional readout of memory at the synaptic level is known as long -term potentiation (LTP) (i.e., a persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity). Deficiencies in LTP are generally regarded as potential substrates of learning and memory impairments. In rodent models where synaptic function is impaired by TH deficiencies, deficits in hippocampus -mediated memory are also prevalent (Gilbert and Sui, 2006; Gilbert et al., 2016; Gilbert, 2011; Gilbert et al., 2016). Evidence Supporting this KER A number of studies have consistently reported alterations in synaptic transmission resulting from developmental TH disruption, and leading to decreased cognition. Biological Plausibility Long -term potentiation (LTP) is a long -lasting increase in synaptic efficacy (not always and not always high frequency stimulation leads to LTP), and its discovery suggested that changes in synaptic strength could provide the substrate for learning and memory (reviewed in Lynch, 2004). Moreover, LTP is intimately related to the theta rhythm, an oscillation long associated with learning. Learning -induced enhancement in neuronal excitability, a measurement of neural network function, has also been shown in hippocampal neurons following classical conditioning in several experimental approaches (reviewed in Saar and Barkai, 2003). On the other hand, memory requires the increase in magnitude of EPSCs to be developed quickly and to be persistent for few weeks at least without disturbing already potentiated contacts. Once again, a substantial body of evidence has demonstrated that tight connection between LTP and diverse instances of memory exist (reviewed in Lynch, 2004). A review on Morris water maze (MWM) as a tool to investigate spatial learning and memory in laboratory rats also pointed out that the disconnection between neuronal networks rather than the brain damage of certain regions is responsible for the impairment of MWM performance. Functional integrated neural networks that involve the coordination action of different brain regions are consequently important for spatial learning and MWM performance (D'Hooge and De Deyn, 2001). Moreover, it is well accepted that alterations in synaptic transmission and plasticity contribute to deficits in cognitive function. There are a number of studies that have linked exposure to TPO inhibitors (e.g., PTU, MMI), as well as iodine deficient diets, to changes in serum TH levels, which result in alterations in both synaptic function and cognitive behaviors (Akaike et al., 1991; Vara et al., 2002; Gilbert and Sui, 2006; Axelstad et al., 2008; Taylor et al., 2008; Gilbert, 2011; Gilbert et al., 2016), described in the indirect KER \"Decrease of TH synthesis leads to learning and memory deficits\". Empirical Evidence Developmental hypothyroidism reduces the functional integrity in brain regions critical for learning and memory. Neurophysiological indices of synaptic transmission of excitatory and inhibitory circuitry are impaired in the hippocampus of hypothyroid animals. Both hippocampal regions (area CA1 gyrus) exhibit alterations in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission following reductions in serum TH in the pre and early postnatal period (Vara et al., 2002; Sui and Gilbert, 2003; Sui et al., 2005; Gilbert and Sui, 2006; Taylor et al., 2008; Gilbert, 2011; Gilbert et al., 2016). These alterations persist into adulthood despite a recovery to euthyroid conditions in blood. The latter observation indicates that these alterations represent permanent changes in brain function caused by transient hormones insufficiencies induced during critical window of development. Because the adult hippocampus is involved in learning and memory, it is a brain region of remarkable plasticity. Use- dependent synaptic plasticity is critical during brain development for synaptogenesis and fine tuning of synaptic connectivity. In the adult brain, similar plasticity mechanisms underlie use - dependency that underlies learning and memory, as exhibited in LTP model of synaptic memory. Hypothyroidism during development reduces the capacity for synaptic plasticity in juvenile and adult offspring (Vara et al., 2002; Sui and Gilbert, 2003; Dong et al., 2005; Sui et al., 2005; Gilbert and Sui, 2006; Taylor et al., 2008; Gilbert, 2011; Gilbert et al., 2016). Decrease of neuronal network function and plasticity are observed coincident with deficits in learning tasks that require the hippocampus. - Wang et al., 2012: This study showed that maternal subclinical hypothyroidism impairs spatial learning in the offspring, as well as the efficacy and optimal time of T4 treatment in pregnancy. Female adult Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups: control, hypothyroid (H), subclinical hypothyroid (SCH) and SCH treated with T4, starting from GD10, GD13 and GD17, respectively, to restore normal TH levels. Results indicate that progenies of SCH and H groups demonstrated significantly longer mean latency in the water maze test (on the 2nd training day, latency was ~83% higher in H group, and ~50% higher in SCH), and a lower amplification percentage of the amplitude (~15% lower in H group, and 12% lower in SCH), and slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) recording (~20% lower in H group, and 17% lower in SCH), compared to control group. T4 treatment at GD10 and GD13 significantly shortened mean latency and increased the amplification percentage of the amplitude and slope of the fEPSPs of the progeny of rats with subclinical hypothyroidism. However, T4 treatment at GD17 showed only minimal effects on spatial learning in the offspring. Altogether these data indicate direct correlation between decrease of neural network function and learning and memory deficits. - Liu et al., 2010 This study assessed the effects of hypothyroidism in 60 female rats who were divided into three groups: (i) maternal subclinical hypothyroidism (total thyroidectomy with T4 infusion), (ii) maternal hypothyroidism (total thyroidectomy without T4 infusion), and (iii) control (sham operated). The Morris water maze tests revealed that pups from the subclinical hypothyroidism group showed long-term memory deficits, and a trend toward short -term memory deficits. - Gilbert and Sui, 2006 Administration of 3 or 10 ppm PTU to pregnant and lactating dams via the drinking water from GD6 until PND30 caused a 47% and 65% reduction in serum T4, in the dams of the low and high -dose groups, respectively. Baseline synaptic transmission was impaired in PTU -exposed animals: mean EPSP slope (by ~60% with 10 ppm and population spike amplitudes (by ~70% with 10 ppm PTU) in the dentate gyrus were reduced in a dose -dependent manner in adult offspring of PTU -treated dams. High -dose animals (10 ppm) demonstrated very little evidence of learning despite 16 consecutive days of training (~5-fold higher mean latency to find the hidden platform, used as an index of learning). - Gilbert et al., 2016 Exposure to PTU during development produced dose -dependent reductions in mRNA expression of nerve growth factor (Ngf) in whole hippocampus of neonates. These changes in basal expression persisted to adulthood despite the return to euthyroid conditions in blood. Developmental PTU treatment dramatically reduced the activity -dependent expression of neurotrophins and related genes in neonate hippocampus and was accompanied by deficits in hippocampal -based learning (e.g., mean latency to find a hidden platform, at 2nd trial resulted ~60% higher in rats treated with 10 ppm PTU). - Gilbert, 2011 Trace fear conditioning deficits to context and to cue reported in animals treated with PTU and who also displayed synaptic transmission and LTP deficits in hippocampus. Baseline synaptic transmission was impaired in PTU -exposed animals (by ~50% in animal treated with 3 ppm PTU). EPSP slope amplitudes in the dentate gyrus were reduced in a dose-dependent manner in adult offspring of PTU -treated dams. BPA, an environmental toxicant known to inhibit NIS-mediated iodide uptake (Wu Y et al., 2016) has been found to cause learning and memory deficits in rodents as described below: - Jang et al., 2012 In this study, pregnant female C57BL/6 mice (F0) were exposed to BPA (0.1 -10 mg/kg) from gestation day 6 to 17, and female offspring (F2) from F1 generation mice were analysed. Exposure of F0 mice to BPA (10 decreas e of hippocampal BrdU+ cells vs control) in F2 female mice. High -dose BPA (10 mg/kg) caused neurocognitive deficit (i.e., reduced memory retention) as shown by passive avoidance testing (~ 33% decrease vs control) in F2 mice. Furthermore, 10 mg/kg BPA decreased the hippocampal levels of BDNF (~ 35% lower vs control) in F2 mice. These results suggest that BPA exposure (NIS inhibitor) in pregnant mothers could decrease hippocampal neurogenesis (decreased number of neurons) and cognitive function in future generations. In humans , the data linking these two specific KE are much more limited, but certainly clear reductions in IQ, with specific impairments in hippocampus - mediated functions have been observed. - Wheeler et al., 2015 This study assessed hippocampal functioning in adolescents with congenital hypothyroidism (CH), using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 14 adolescents with CH and 14 typically developing controls (TDC) were studied. Hippocampal activation was greater for pairs than items in both groups, but this difference was only significant in TDC. When the groups were directly compared, the right anterior hippocampus was the primary region in which the TDC and CH groups differed for this pair memory effect. Results signify that adolescents with CH show abnormal hippocampal functioning during verbal memory processing, in order to compensate for the effects induced by TH deficit in the brain. - Wheeler et al., 2012 In this study hippocampal neuronal network function was measured based on synaptic performance using fMRI and was altered while subjects engaged in a memory task. Data showed paired word recognition deficits in adolescents with congenital hypothyroidism (N = 14; age range, 11.5- 14.7 years) compared with controls (N = 15; age range, 11.2-15.5 years), with no impairment on simple word lists. Analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging showed that adolescents with congenital hypothyroidism had both increased magnitude of hippocampal activation relative to controls and bilateral hippocampal activation when only the left was observed in controls. Furthermore, the increased activation in the congenital hypothyroidism group was correlated with the severity of the hypothyroidism experienced early in life. - Willoughby et al., 2013 Analogously, in this study, fMRI revealed increased hippocampus activation with word pair recognition task in CH and children born to women with hypothyroxinemia during midgestation. These d ifferences in functional activation were not seen with single word recognition, but were revealed when retention of word pair associations was probed. The latter is a task requiring engagement of the hippocampus. A series of important findings suggest that the biochemical changes that happen after induction of LTP also occur during memory acquisition, showing temporality between the two KEs (reviewed in Lynch, 2004). - Morris et al., 1986 This study found that blocking the NMDA receptor of the neuronal network with AP5 inhibits spatial learning in rats. Most importantly, in the same study they measured brain electrical activity and recorded that this agent also inhibits LTP, however, they have not proven that spatial learning and LTP inhibition are causally related. Since then a number of NMDA receptor antagonists have been studied towards their ability to induce impairment of learning and memory. It is worth mentioning that similar findings have been found in human subjects: - Grunwald et al., 1999 By combining behavioural and electrophysiological data from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy exposed to ketamine, involvement of NMDA receptors in human memory processes was demonstrated. The last KE preceding the AO (learning and memory deficits), i.e. \"Decreased Neural Network Function\", is also common to the AOP 13, entitled \"Chronic binding of antagonist to N-methyl -D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) during brain development induces impairment of learning and memory abilities\" (https://aopwiki.org/aops/13 (https://aopwiki.org/aops/13 )). In this AOP 13, data on lead (Pb) and mercury exposure as reference chemical s are reported. While these studies do not refer to TH disruption, they provide empirical support for the same KER described in the present AOP. Pb2+: Exposure to low levels of Pb2+, during early development, has been implicated in long -lasting behavioural abnormalities and cognitive deficits in children (Needleman et et al., 2008; Neal 2010) and experimental animals (Brockel and Cory -Slechta, 1998; Murphy and Regan, 1999; Moreira et al., 2001). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that Pb2+ can impair hippocampus -mediated learning in animal models (reviewed in Toscano and Guilarte, 2005). - Jett et al., 1997 Female rats exposed to Pb2+ through gestation and lactation have shown more severe impairment of memory than male rats with similar Pb2+ exposures. - De Souza Lisboa et al., 2005 This study reported that exposure to Pb2+ during both pregnancy and lactation caused depressive -like behaviour (detected in the forced swimming test) in female but not male rats. - Anderson et al., 2012 This study investigated the neurobehavioral outcomes in Pb2+-exposed rats (250, 750 and 1500 ppm Pb2+ acetate in food) during gestation and through weaning and demonstrated that these outcomes are very much influenced by sex and rearing environment. In females, Pb2+ exposure lessened some of the benefits of enriched environment on learning, whereas, in males, enrichment does help to overcome detrimental effects of Pb2+ on learning. Regarding reference memory, environmental enrichment has not been beneficial in females when exposure to Pb2+ occurs, in contrast to males. - Jaako -Movits et al., 2005 Wistar rat pups were exposed to 0.2% Pb2+ via their dams' drinking water from PND 1 to PND 21 and directly via drinking water from weaning until PND 30. At PND 60 and 80, the neurobehavioural assessment has revealed that developmental Pb2+ exposure induces persistent increase in the level of anxiety and inhibition of contextual fear conditioning. The same behavioural syndrome in rats has been described in Salinas and Huff, 2002. - Finkelstein et al., 1998 These observations are in agreement with observations on humans, as children exposed to low levels of Pb2+ displayed attention deficit, increased emotional reactivity and impaired memory and learning. - Kumar and Desiraju, 1992 In Wistar rats fed with lead acetate (400 \u00b5g/g body weight/day) from PND 2 until PND 60, EEG findings showed statistically significant reduction in the delta, theta, alpha and beta band EEG spectral power in motor cortex and hippocampus, but not in delta and beta bands power of motor cortex in wakeful state. After 40 days of recovery, animals were assessed for their neurobehaviour, and revealed that Pb2+ treated animals showed more time and sessions in attaining criterion of learning than controls. Further data obtained using animal behavioral techniques demonstrate that NMDA mediated synaptic transmission is decreased by Pb2+ exposure (Cory - Slechta, 1995; Cohn and Cory -Slechta, 1993 and 1994). - Xiao et al., 2014 Rat pups from parents exposed to 2 mM PbCl 2 three weeks before mating until their weaning (pre-weaning Pb2+) and weaned pups exposed to 2 mM PbCl 2 for nine weeks (post -weaning Pb2+) were assessed for their spatial learning and memory by MWM on PND 85 -90. The study revealed that both rat pups in pre-weaning Pb2+ and post-weaning Pb2+ groups performed significantly worse than those in the control group. The number of synapses in pre-weaning Pb2+ group increased significantly, but it was still less than that of control group. The number of synapses in post-weaning Pb2+ group was also less than that of control group, although the number of synapses had no differences between post-weaning Pb2+ and control groups before MWM. In both pre-weaning Pb2+ and post-weaning Pb2+ groups, synaptic structural parameters such as thickness of postsynaptic density (PSD), length of synaptic active zone and synaptic curvature increased, whereas width of synaptic cleft decreased compared to controls. Mercury Sokolowski et al. 2013. Rats at postnatal day 7 received a single injection of methylmercury (0.6 microgr/g, that caused caspase activation in the hilus of granule cell layer in hippocampus. At PD 21, a decrease in cell number or 22% in hilus and of 27% in granule cell layer, as well as a decreased proliferation of neural precursor cells of 25% were observed. This was associated with a decrease of spatial memory as assessed by Morris water maze. Eddins et al., 2008. Mice exposed during postnatal week 1 -3 to 2-5 mg/kg mercury chloride in 0.01 ml/g of NaCl injectd s.c. The behavioral tests at 3 months of age revealed learning deficits (radial maze), which was associated with increased levels of monoamines in frontal cortex. Zanoli et al., 1994. Single injection of methylmercury (8 mg/kg by gavage) at gestational day 15. Offsprings analyzed at 14, 21, and 60 days of age exhibited a decrease in the number of muscarinic receptors at 14 and 21 days and a decrease in avoidance latency at 60 days, indicating learning and memory deficits. Zanoli et al., 2001. Single injection of methylmercury (8 mg/kg) at gestational day 8. Brain was removed at PD 21 and 60. An increase in tryptophan level in hippocampus was detected at both days. At PD 21, a decrease in anthranilic acid and an increase in quinolinic acid was found. No change in glutamic acid nor in aspartic acid were detected. Montgomery et al., 2008. C57/B6 mice exposed during pregnancy (GD 8-18) with food containing methylmercury (0.01 mg/kg body wheight). Tested when adult, they showed deficits in motor function, coordination, overall activity and impairment in reference memory. Glover et al., 2009. Balb mice exposed to methylmercury in diet (low dose: 1.5 mg/kg; high dose: 4.5 mg/kg) during 11 weeks (6 weeks prior mating, 3 weeks during gestation and 2 weeks post-partum). Offsprings tested at PD 15 showed an accumulation of Hg in brain (0.08 mg/kg for low dose and 0.25 mg/kg for the high dose). At hte cellular level, there was alterations in gene expression for cytoskeleton, cell processes, cell adhesion, cell differentiation, development), which could be all involved in cellular network formation. This was associated with behavioral impairment, i.e. a decrease in exploratory activity measured in open field. Onishchenko et al., 2007. Pregnant mice received 0.5 mg methylmercury/kg/day in drinking water from gestational dy 7 until day 7 after delivery. Offspring behavior was monitored at 5-15 and 26-36 weeks of age. Mercury - induced alterations in reference memory were detected. Cagiano et al., 1990. Pregnant rat received at GD 15 8mg/kg of methylmercury by gavage. Offsprings were tested at day 16, 21 and 60. A reduced functional activity of glutamatergic system associated with disturbances in learning and memory were observed. Rice, 1992. Female monkeys exposed to 10, 25 and 50 microg/kg/day to methylmercury. Male unexposed. Infants separated from mother at birth and exposed to similar doses did not show gross intellectual impairment, but interferences with temporal discrimination. Sahin et al., 2016. Exposure of rat pups for 5 weeks or 5 months with mercury chloride (4.6 microg/kg as first injection, followed each day by 0.07 microg/kg/day). Learning and memory impairment measured by passive avoidance and Morris -water -maze was found in 5-weeks group, but not in the 5- month group. This was accompanied by hearing loss. In humans: Orenstein et al., 2014. Maternal peripartum hair mercury level was measured to assess prenatal mercury exposure. The concentrations of mercury was found in the range of 0.3-5.1 microg/g, similar to fish eating population in US. However, statistical analyses revealed that each microg/g increase in hair Hg was associated with a decrement in visula memory, learning and verbal memory. Yorifuji et al., 2011. A survey of the Minamata exposed population made in 1971 to assess pre- and post-natal exposure revealed a methylmercury -induced impairment of intelligence as well as behavioral dysfunction. Uncertainties and Inconsistencies One of the most difficult issues for neuroscientists is to link neuronal network function to cognition, including learning and memory. It is still unclear what modifications of neuronal circuits need to happen in order to alter motor behaviour as it is recorded in a learning and memory test (Mayford et al., 2012), meaning that there is no clear understanding about the how these two KEs are connected. Several epidemiological studies where Pb2+ exposure levels have been studied in relation to neurobehavioural alterations in children have been reviewed in Koller et al. 2004. This review has concluded that in some occasions there is negative correlation between Pb2+ dose and cognitive deficits of the subjects due to high influence of social and parenting factors in cognitive ability like learning and memory (Koller et al. 2004), meaning that not always Pb2+ exposure is positively associated with learning and memory impairment in children. The direct relationship of alterations in neural network function and specific cognitive deficits is difficult to ascertain given the many forms that learning and memory can take and the complexity of synaptic interactions in even the simplest brain circuit. Linking of neurophysiological assessments to learning and memory processes have, by necessity, been made across simple monosynaptic connections and largely focused on the hippocampus. Alterations in synaptic function have been found in the absence of behavioral impairments. This may result from measuring only one component in the complex brain circuitry that underlies 'cognition', behavioral tests that are not sufficiently sensitive for the detection of subtle cognitive impairments, and behavioral plasticity whereby tasks are solved by the animal via different strategies developed as a consequence of developmental insult. Finally, in order to provide empirical support for this KER, data on the effects of lead (Pb) exposure are reported. However, Pb exposure is not always associated with learning and memory impairment in children. In this regard, Koller's review has commented that in some occasions, low-level Pb dose and cognitive deficits of the subjects are negatively correlated, and this may be due to the high influence of social and parenting factors in cognitive ability, like learning and memory (Koller et al., 2004). Mercury Olczak et al., 2001. Postnatal exposure of rats to Thimerosal (4 injections with 12, 240, 1440 and 3000 microgHg/kg per injection). Effects were measured in adult, which exhibited alterations in dopaminergic system with decline in the density of striatal D2 receptors, with a higher sensitivity for males. No alterations in spatial learning and memory was observed, but impairments of motor activity, increased anxiety (open fiel measurment), which are other symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. Franco et al., 2006. Lactational exposure of mice to methylmercury in drinking water (10 mg/L). Analysis at weaning revealed only impairment in motor performances. Franco et al., 2007. Lactational exposure of mice with mercury chloride (0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg, i.p. injection once a day). At weaning , animals exhibited an increased level of mercury in cerebellum associated with motor deficit. Cardenas et al., 2017 showed that maternal red blood cell mercury of 3.8 ng/g was associated to increased DNA methylation of PON1 in umbilical cord blood only in male and observed deficit in cognitive performances, such as visual motor ability, vocabiary and verbal intellgence.

Mercury chloride promoted a significant decrease in acetylcholinesterase activity and the antioxidant competence was also decreased. (Berntssen, Aatland and Handy, 2003) - Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) were supplemented with mercuric chloride (0, 10, or 100 mg Hg per kg) or methylmercury chloride (0, 5, or 10 mg Hg per kg) for 4 months. Methylmercury chloride accumulated significantly in the brain of fish fed 5 or 10 mg/kg No mortality or growth reduction - 2-fold increase in the antioxidant enzyme super oxide dismutase (SOD) in the brain 10 mg/kg - 7-fold increase of lipid peroxidative products (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS) and a subsequently reduced neural enzyme activity (5-fold reduced monoamine oxidase, MAO, activity), and reduced overall post-feeding activity behaviour. Mercuric chloride accumulated significantly in the brain only at 100 mg/kg No mortality or growth reduction 100 mg/kg - significant reduced neural MAO activity and pathological changes (astrocyte proliferation) in the brain, however, neural enzyme activity, lipid peroxidative products (TBARS ), and post feeding behaviour did not differ from controls. Key Event Relationship Description Oxidative stress (OS) as a concept in redox biology and medicine has been formulated in 1985 (Sies, 2015). OS is intimately linked to cellular energy balance and comes from the imbalance between the generation and detoxification of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) or from a decay of the antioxidant protective ability. OS is characterized by the reduced capacity of endogenous systems to fight against the oxidative attack directed towards target biomolecules (Wang and Michaelis, 2010; Pisoschi and Pop, 2015). Glutathione, the most important redox buffer in cells (antioxidant), cycles between reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione disulfide (GSSG), and serves as a vital sink for control of ROS levels in cells (Reynolds et al., 2007). Several case- control studies have reported the link between lower concentrations of GSH, higher levels of GSSG and the development of diseases (Rossignol and Frye, 2014). OS can cause cellular damage and subsequent cell death because the ROS oxidize vital cellular components such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids (Gilgun -Sherki, Melamed and Offen, 2001; Wang and Michaelis, 2010). The central nervous system is especially vulnerable to free radical damage since it has a high oxygen consumption rate, an abundant lipid content and reduced levels of antioxidant enzymes (Coyle and Puttfarcken, 1993; Markesbery, 1997). It has been show th at the developing brain is particularly vulnerable to neurotoxicants and OS due to differentiation processes, changes in morphology, lack of physiological barriers and less intrinsic capacity to cope with cellular stress (Grandjean and Landrigan, 2014; Sandstr\u00f6m et al. , 2017). However, it has to be noted that neural stem cells distinguish themeselves from post -mitotic neural cells by their lower ROS levels and higher expression of the key antioxid ant enzymes glutathione peroxidase. This increased \"vigilance\" of antioxidant mechanisms might represent an innate characteristic of NSCs, which not only defines their cell fate, but also helps them to encounter oxidative stress (Madhavan et al., 2006). OS has been linked to brain aging, neurodegenerative diseases, and other related adverse conditions. There is evidence that free radicals play a role in cerebral ischemia -reperfusion, head injury, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Down's syndrome, and Alzheimer's disease due to cellular damage (Markesbery, 1997; Gilgun - Sherki, Melamed and Offen, 2001; Wang and Michaelis, 2010). OS has also been linked to neurodevelopmental diseases and deficits like autism spectrum disorder and postnatal motor coordination deficits (Wells et al., 2009; Rossignol and Frye, 2014; Bhandari and Kuhad, 2015). Evidence Supporting this KER Biological Plausibility A noteworthy insight, early on, was the perception that oxidation -reduction (redox) reactions in living cells are utilized in fundamental processes of redox regulation, collectively termed 'redox signaling' and 'redox control' (Sies, 2015). Free radical -induced damage in OS has been confirmed as a contributor to the pathogenesis and patho -physiology of many chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer, atherosclerosis, Parkinson, but also in traumatic brain injury, sepsis, stroke, myocardial infraction, inflammatory diseases, cataracts and cancer (Bar-Or et al., 2015; Pisoschi and Pop, 2015). It has been assessed that oxidative stress is correlated with over 100 diseases, either as source or outcome (Pisoschi and Pop, 2015). Therefore, the fact that ROS over-production can kill neurons is well accepted (Brown and Bal-Price, 2003; Taetzsch and Block, 2013). This ROS over- production can occur in the neurons themselves or can also have a glial origin (Yuste et al., 2015). Empirical Evidence Mercury Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of methylmercury (MeHg) neurotoxicity. Studies of mature neurons suggest that the mitochondrion may be a major source of MeHg -induced reactive oxygen species and a critical mediator of MeHg -induced neuronal death, likely by activation of apoptotic pathways. (Polunas et al., 2011) (Lu et al., 2011) - MeHg in the mouse cerebrum (in vivo) and in cultured Neuro -2a cells (in vitro). In vivo - 50\u00b5g/kg/day MeHg for 7 consecutive weeks - increased levels of lipid peroxidation in the plasma and cerebral cortex. Decreased GSH level and increase the expressions of caspase -3, -7, and -9, accompanied by Bcl-2 down -regulation and up-regulation of Bax, Bak, and p53. In vitro - 3 and 5 \u00b5M MeHg - reduced cell viability, increased oxidative stress damage, and induced several features of mitochondria -dependent apoptotic signals, including increased sub-G1 These MeHg -induced apoptotic -related be remarkably reversed by antioxidant NAC . (Sarafian et al., 1994) - Hypothalamic mouse neural cell line GT1-7 without and with for -oncogene, bcl-2. formation of reactive ROS, and decreased levels of GSH, associated with 20% cell death. Cells transfected with an expression construct bcl-2, displayed attenuated ROS induction and negligible cell death. 24h exposure, 5 \u00b5M MeHg - killed 56% of control cells, but only 19% of bcl-2-transfected cells. By using diethyl maleate to deplete cells of GSH, we demonstrate that the differential sensitivity to MeHg was not due solely to intrinsically different GSH levels. The data suggest that MeHg -mediated cell killing correlates more closely with ROS generation than with GSH levels and that bcl -2 protects MeHg -treated cells by suppressing ROS generation. (Castoldi et al., 2000) - In vitro exposure of primary cultures of rat CGCs to MeHg resulted in a time- and concentration -dependent cell death. 1 hr exposure, 5-10 \u00b5M MeHg - impairment of mitochondrial activity, de-energization of mitochondria and plasma membrane lysis, necrotic cell death. 1hr exposure, 0.5-1 \u00b5M MeHg - did not compromise cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential and function at early time points. 1hr exposure, 1 \u00b5M MeHg - only a small population of neurons (+-20%) dies by necrosis. The surviving neurons show network damage, but maintain membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential and function at early time points. Later, however, the cells progressively display the morphological signs of apoptosis. 18hr exposure, 0.5-1 \u00b5M MeHg - cells progressively underwent apoptosis reaching the 100% cell death insulin - like growth factor -I partially rescued CGCs from MeHg -triggered apoptosis. (Kaur,et al., 2006) - primary cultures of cerebellar neurons and astrocytes from 7-day-old NMRI mice. 5 mM MeHg for 30 Twenty -one days post-astrocyte N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) or 3mM di-ethyl maleate (DEM) added to the wells 12 h prior to MeHg exposure 7 days post-neurons isolation - 200mM of NAC or 1.8mM of DEM added to the wells 12 h prior to MeHg exposure The intracellular GSH content was modified by pretreatment with NAC or DEM for 12 h. Treatment with 5 mM Me Hg for 30 min led to significant (p < 0.05) increase in ROS and reduction (p < 0.001) in GSH content. Depletion of intracellular GSH by DEM further increased the generation of MeHg - induced ROS in both cell cultures. NAC supplementation increased intracellular GSH and provided protection against MeHg -induced oxidative stress in both cell cultures. (Franco et al., 2007) - Mitochondrial enriched fractions from adult (2 months old) Swiss Albino male mice. MeHg and HgCl2 (10-100 \u00b5M) significantly decreased to mercurial -induced glutathione oxidation. Both mercurials induced a significant reduction of GSH in a dose-dependent manner. Correlation analyses showed significant positive correlations between mitochondrial viability and glutathione content for MeHg (Pearson coefficient) 0.933; < 0.01) and or P < -induced disruption of mitochondrial viability. Moreover, quercetin, which did not display any chelating effect on MeHg or HgCl2, prevented mercurial (Polunas et al., 2011) - Murine embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, which differentiate into neurons following exposure to retinoic acid. 4h exposure, 1.5 mM MeHg - earlier and significantly higher levels of ROS production and more extensive mitochondrial depolarization in neurons than in undifferentiated EC cells. cyclosporin A (CsA) completely inhibited mitochondrial depolarization by MeHg in EC cells but only delayed this response in the neurons. In contrast, CsA significantly inhibited MeHg -induced neuronal ROS production. Cyt c release was also more extensive in neurons, with less protection afforded by CsA. (Sandstr\u00f6m et al., 2016) - in vitro 3D human neural tissues from neural progenitor cells derived from human embryonic stem cells. Single MeHg exposure at day 42 of 3D culturing (week 6) and material was collected 72 h after. 1-10 \u00b5M - LDH activity increased, confirming induced cell death. 5 and 10 \u00b5M - increased HMOX1 gene expression as indirect marker of oxidative stress. Acrylamide (Allam et al., 2011) - sixty albino Rattus norvegicus , 45 virgin females and 15 mature males. This study examined its effects on the development of external features in cubs. prenatal intoxicated group - newborns from mothers treated with ACR (10 mg/kg/day by gastric intubation) from day 7 (GD 7) of gestation till birth perinatal intoxicated group - newborns from mothers treated with ACR (10 mg/kg/day by gastric intubation) from GD7 of gestation till D28 after birth ACR administered either prenatally or perinatally has been shown to induce significant retardation in the new - borns' body weights development, increase of thiobarbituric acid - reactive substances (TBARS) and oxidative stress (significant in reduced glutathione, total thiols, superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activities) in the developing cerebellum. ACR treatment delayed the proliferation in the granular layer and delayed both cell migration and differentiation. Purkinje cell loss was also seen in acrylamide -treated animals. Ultrastructural studies of Purkinje cells in the perinatal group showed microvacuolations and cell loss. (Lakshmi et al., 2012) - Wistar male albino rats, four groups (n = 6 per group) II - (Acrylamide) ACR - 30 mg/kg ACR for 30 days : increase in the lipid peroxidative (LPO), protein carbonyl, hydroxyl radical and hydroperoxide levels with subsequent decrease in the activities of enzymic antioxidants and level of GSH. Cortex showed condensed nuclei along with damaged cells. Decrease in the expression of Bcl2 along with simultaneous increase in the expressions of Bax and Bad as compared to control. II rats - ACR + Fish oil -0.5 ml/kg b.w.fish oil orally 10 min before ACR induction with 30 mg/kg for 30 days - reversed significantly all the OS markers. Uncertainties and Inconsistencies Mercury -induced upregulation of GSH level and GR activity as an adaptive mechanism following lactational exposure to methylmercury (10 mg/L in drinking water) associated with motor deficit, suggesting neuronal impairment (Franco et al., 2006).
