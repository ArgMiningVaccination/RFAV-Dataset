At Restore BioClinic, we perform a thorough evaluation and couple that with a diagnostic process that uses precise lab testing to determine your specific situation. We then use deliberate and methodical treatments that are directed at removing the root causes of disease and any obstacles to healing. Our treatments provide the cells and body the essential cornerstone structural and repair molecules and also nutrients to re-engage cellular regulation and cellular energy production. Our Mission: Dr. Vosloo, ND MHom created Restore BioClinic for people suffering from chronic illnesses that weren't see results with traditional treatments. A naturally inquisitive and determined person, he resolved to help the sickest people that he saw in his clinic by digging deep and finding the true root and maintaining causes of illness. In his search to determine why certain people didn't respond to treatment or the numerous factors that enabled a patient to become sick, he saw one common denominator: high toxic burdens. Once he was introduced to a cell membrane stabilization protocol/cell membrane therapy and found a lab that was able to look deep enough into a person's genetic makeup, he was able to paint a full picture of how to help people: remove the toxic residue that was stuck to a person's DNA, giving the optimal chance that their body will function properly. By digging to the DNA level, scrubbing the DNA clean, and restoring each cell to its innate composition, the body can function as designed, allowing itself the best conditions for healing. Dr. Vosloo's mission is to help people get their lives back through the use of medicine that encourages the body to heal itself, giving patients the opportunity to get well and stay well. About Dr. Vosloo Dr. Werner Vosloo is a Naturopathic and Homeopathic Physician who focuses on and has a passion for helping people with chronic conditions heal through the use of natural and integrated medicine.

Wanting to improve treatment outcomes and decrease treatment time, Dr. Vosloo opened Restore BioClinic in St George, Utah in 2018.

Enjoy the treatment and atmosphere but also heal outside the office by visiting state parks and beautiful weather. \u2014 Aaron S. \"My body is stronger then before treatment\" I was very excited to start treatment in Southern Utah, being from Oregon it isn't the best environment for my mold symptoms.

My experience was excellent! \u2014 Julie N. \"This is game changing\" The top symptoms that have improved for me are: feeling more alert, better energy, and better confidence that I'm on a path forward.
