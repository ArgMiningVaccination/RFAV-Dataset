The information below has been updated. Boosters Booster doses help build up immunity which can weaken over time. Antibody levels wane for most adults over time, although the level of antibody needed to protect against infection is higher than the level needed to protect against severe disease if infected. For COVID-19, protection against any infection, especially infection with minimal or no symptoms, wanes relatively quickly (within a few months), but protection against severe disease lasts longer, even against delta and omicron variants. Booster doses can assist to build protection back up. Details on schedules are [available here](https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/immunisation-handbook-2020/5-coronavirus-disease-covid-19#23-5) in the Immunisation Handbook. Vaccines to use as a boosters - Comirnaty 15/15mcg grey cap vaccine is the preferred booster vaccine in Aotearoa New Zealand and can be used for people over 16 years of age. - Nuvaxovid vaccine can be used as a booster for people over 18 years of age. First booster doses First boosters are recommended for everyone over 16 years after completing their primary course. This is given at least 6 months after either a previous COVID vaccination or COVID-19 infection. Additional COVID-19 boosters Additional boosters are recommended for those at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 at least 6 months after either a previous COVID booster or COVID-19 infection. This means eligible people can have more than 2 boosters over time. For those who are not considered at risk of severe illness from COVID-19, a two-dose primary course and a single booster dose provides very good protection against severe illness from COVID-19. People recommended to receive a second booster as a priority include: - people aged 65 years and over - Mori and Pacific peoples aged 50 years and over - residents of aged care and disability care facilities - severely immunocompromised people who received a three-dose primary course and a fourth dose as a first booster (noting this would be a fifth dose for these people) - people aged 16 years and over who have a medical condition that increases the risk of severe breakthrough COVID-19 illness and - people aged 16 years and over who live with disability with significant or complex health needs or multiple comorbidities. [Clinical criteria in support of additional booster eligibility](https://www.health.govt.nz/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines/clinical-criteria-support-second-booster-eligibility) for those 16 years and over. Additional boosters are also available for: - Everyone aged 30 years and over. Additional COVID-19 boosters and healthcare workers under 30 years If your workplace is using effective infection control measures you are more likely to be infected with SARS CoV-2 outside of the workplace. Numerous studies support this. Continue to protect yourself, your patients and your colleagues by staying home if symptomatic or infected, wearing well-fitting masks and following testing protocols. The first booster dose remains the most important protection against severe COVID disease. An additional booster is not expected to provide that much additional benefit to healthy individuals, but is recommended for those at risk of severe illness from COVID-19 infection. Any protection against infection is limited and brief with the current variants, however, protection against severe disease is good. Clinical discretion Clinical discretion can be applied to spacing rules, following an informed consent discussion, either for clinical, or equity reasons. Minimum 4 months between booster doses; 5 months between primary and first booster; and from 3 months after COVID infection. "}
