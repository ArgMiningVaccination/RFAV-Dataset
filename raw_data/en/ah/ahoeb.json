For a little over a year, we enjoyed having TIMELESS Aromatics, a small retail shop in South St Paul, Minnesota. It was fun to meet many of our local customers ! Current events have made it difficult for many small businesses to keep doors open, and we made the decision to close the shop. Thank you to all who shopped at TIMELESS Aromatics. We look forward to continuing to serve you online. "}
