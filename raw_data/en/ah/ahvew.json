Out-of-State Table 4.9 Georgia Tech's HOPE and Zell Miller Scholarship Program Summary, 2006-2007 through 2014-2015HOPE Scholarship ProgramThe President's Scholarship Program is Georgia Tech's premier merit-based scholarship. Since its inception in 1981, the program has maintained as its objective the selection and enrollment of students who have demonstrated excellence in scholarship, leadership, progress, and service and have strong potential to become leaders on campus and in the community. The scholarship offers three levels of awards. For the students who entered Georgia Tech as first-years in fall of 2015, the four-year award amounts were: Georgia resident: 1) full cost of attendance Stamps Scholarship (n=5), and 2) full scholarship incl. tuition & fees, room & board (n=11); non- Georgia resident: 1) full cost of attendance Stamps Scholarship (n=5), 2) full scholarship incl. tuition & fees, room & board (n=20), and 3) Gold Scholarship (non-resident tuition waiver). To ensure consideration for the President's Scholarship, a student must submit the Georgia Tech application for admission by October 15 of the fall prior to enrolling. The most quali - fied applicants in terms of high school grades, course rigor, standardized test scores, writing ability, and demonstrated leadership and involvement in activities are selected as scholarship semifinalists. Each semifinalist is interviewed by a Regional Committee in January or February. Approximately 100 of the top-ranked candidates in the competition are invited as finalists to attend the President's Scholarship Weekend on campus in the spring. About 40 will be offered a President's Scholarship in 2016. HOPE -- Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally -- is Georgia's unique program, created by Governor Zell Miller, that rewards students' hard work with financial assistance in degree, diploma, or certificate programs at any eligible Georgia public or private college, university, or public technical institute. HOPE is funded by Georgia's Lottery for Education.Table 4.8 President's Scholarship Program Institutions Public InstitutionsNational Merit Scholars, Fall 2014Table 4.10 National Merit and Achievement Scholars, as of Fall 2014 Institution RankFreshmen Enrollment# of Scholars% of ClassInstitution RankFINANCIAL AID # of Scholars National Achievement Scholars, Fall 2014 Source: National Merit Scholarship Corporation (NMSC).

Those words from one of America's most famous fight songs typify the spirit of athletics at Georgia Tech, a school with a tradition of integrity and success that is second to none. Ever since 1892, when the first football team was organized on The Flats, Georgia Tech teams in all sports have represented the Institute in outstanding fashion while producing some of the best-known names in athletics. Georgia Tech participates in 17 varsity sports, and also includes the following departments: a Total Person program, compliance, business, development, ticketing, marketing, facilities, communications and sports medicine. The most important function of Georgia Tech athletics, however, is academic support. The Georgia Tech Athletic Association is a non-profit organization responsible for maintaining the intercollegiate athletics program at Tech. The Athletic Association (GTAA) is overseen by the Georgia Tech Athletic Association Board, chaired by the president of the Institute and composed of the Executive Vice President of Administration and Finance, eight faculty members, three alumni members, and three student members. Over the past 100 years, Tech has had only 12 head football coaches: John Heisman (namesake of the coveted Heisman Trophy), William Alexander, Bobby Dodd, Bud Carson, Bill Fulcher, Pepper Rodg - ers, Bill Curry, Bobby Ross, Bill Lewis, George O'Leary, Chan Gailey and current coach Paul Johnson. Tech has won four National Championships in football in the years 1917, 1928, 1952, and 1990. Other major highlights in sports have been two Final Four appearances by the Tech men's basketball team in 1990 and 2004, nine NCAA Tournament appearances by women's basketball and three College World Series berths in baseball. The GT women's tennis team captured the 2007 NCAA Championship, our first ever NCAA team championship. In 2008, Amanda McDowell became the first Yellow Jacket tennis player to earn an individual national championship by winning the NCAA Singles title. The Georgia Tech golf team is consistently among the top national finishers and has won 16 ACC titles and eight in the last 10 years. Some of the most prominent names in Georgia Tech athletic history have been Grand Slam Champion Bobby Jones, former Masters champion Larry Mize, British Open champions David Duval and Stewart Cink, Tour Money Titleist Matt Kuchar in golf; a host of football starts including 18 College Football Hall of Famers and Tech also produced four Olympic gold medal winners in track: Anto - nio McKay, Derek Mills, Derrick Adkins and Angelo Taylor, as well as three-time NCAA high jump champion and 2004 U.S. Olympian Chaunte Howard in women's track. Major League baseball stars include graduates Mark Teixeira, Nomar Garciaparra, Kevin Brown, Jason Varitek and Matt Weiters. Georgia Tech's men's basketball has a rich history with star players that include Roger Kaiser, Rich Yunkus, Mark Price, John Salley, Kenny Anderson, Stephon Marbury, Jarrett Jack, Chris Bosh and Derrick Favors. Tech's facilities rank among the finest in college athletics. Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field, one of America's oldest and most recognized football venues, has undergone an expansion and renovation project that raised its capacity to 55,000. Tech boasts Russ Chandler Baseball Stadium, a consistant site of NCAA Regional and Super Regional play. The McCamish Pavilion, home to Georgia Tech's men's and women's basketball teams, replaced the Alexander Memorial Coliseum beginning with the 2012-13 seasons. The Georgia Tech Aquatic Center will be the site of the 2016 NCAA Men's and Women's Swimming & Diving Championships. The Aquatic Center also hosted the 2006 NCAA Men's Swimming and Diving Championships, and was originally home to the 1966 Olympic swim - ming and diving competition. In 2009, the softball team began playing in the Shirley Clements Mewborn Field, and the men' s and women's basketball teams moved into a new state-of-the-art practice facility, the Zelnak Center. The Ken Byers Tennis Facility opened in January 2013. The hub of Georgia Tech athletics is the Arthur Edge Intercollegiate Athletics Center, which houses administrative and coaching staffs, a dining hall, locker rooms, training and weight facilities and the Andrew Hearn Academic Center. Georgia Tech teams participate in the Atlantic Coast Conference, generally regarded as one of the best collegiate conferences in the country. The primary purpose of the Athletic Association is to help each student-athlete grow as a person, develop as an athlete, earn a meaningful degree and become a productive citizen.

The mission of the Georgia Tech Alumni Association is to promote and serve our alumni and the Institute. We will continually create relevant and meaningful programs for current and future alumni to foster lifelong participation and philanthropic support. We will communicate the achievements of the Institute, maintain its traditions and engage the campus community. Underlying all that we do is the belief in the value of education, the commitment to integrity and exceptional customer service, and a pledge that we will perform in a fiscally responsible manner . The association's business can be categorized into four major disciplines: the proactive acquisition and management of information about Tech's alumni and friends; communication to these constituents; engagement of these supporters and fund raising. These disciplines are at the heart of building value for Tech's alumni in their relationships with the Institute. The association is currently organized into five departments: Administration, Marketing & Communications; Alumni Outreach; Events & Student Outreach; and Fund Raising & Business Development. Administration is responsible for three major operations at the association: treasury functions, including accounting, purchasing, finance and budgeting; data management operations, including data and gift entry and maintenance of biographical and gift records for all alumni and friends of the Institute; and technical services for the association' s hardware, information services and management of the facilities and other assets. During FY 2015, Administration processed 188,000 changes affecting 89 million fields of data in the database and entered more than 50,000 gifts and pledges. The Marketing Department serves a crucial role at the Alumni Association by providing important research and communicating with Tech alumni. Through research, the department provides key data and analytics to shape the association's strategies and planning. With print and electronic marketing campaigns, the marketing team delivers the alumni association's message to its numerous constituents. Marketing's web department drives the Alumni Association's online presence through social media and the recently revamped website, gtalumni.org. Last year, the new gtalumni.org was launched with the goal of creating a data-driven marketing tool that would increase alumni engagement and personalized communication. Over 25,000 alumni have registered on the new website which fosters networking, communicates relevant news and provides a forum for personalized alumni profiles, photos, event registrations, giving and biographical update capabilities. Through social media, the marketing department engages with alumni on sites they visit regularly such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and Instagram. The Communications Department consists of Alumni Publications and the Living History program. Alumni Publications produces the quarterly Georgia Tech Alumni Magazine, the primary news link between Georgia Tech and its alumni, with an annual circulation of more than 300,000. Alumni Publications also produces the association's monthly e-newsletter, Buzzwords, sent to an average of 70,000 subscribers. Publications provides supplemental content through the magazine website, gtalumnimag.com, along with timely news and updates through various media. The Living History program collects, preserves and presents the history of Georgia Tech and its traditions through video interviews with alumni, retired Georgia Tech faculty, staff and friends. To date, this popular program has collected over 1,000 stories in its archive. In addition, Living History produces several documentary films and provides an average of 35 presentations about the Institute's history to the Georgia Tech community each year. Alumni Outreach focuses on the engagement and involvement of alumni in support of each other and Georgia Tech. Advocacy, philanthropy, career services and student recruiting are strategic focal points. Responsibilities include Alumni Career Services, Alumni Groups, Geographic Alumni Networks and Alumni Travel. For over 90 years, Alumni Career Services has provided job search support for Tech alumni, including job postings and resume database through JacketNet Jobs, career advisement, skill-building workshops and the annual Alumni Career Fair. More than 100 Georgia Tech geographic networks and affinity groups located throughout the United States and abroad provide opportunities for alumni to network professionally, socialize, recruit students, raise funds and perform community service. The Travel Department led over 30 educational group tours to exciting destinations around the world for over 450 Tech alumni and friends. Events & Student Outreach is responsible for engaging alumni, students and the rest of the Tech community in a variety of ways. The Events team planned and executed approximately 75 of the association's major events and engaged 14,338 members of the Tech community in FY 2015. Events included the George C. Griffin Pi Mile 5k Road Race, The Gold & White Honors Gala, The Orange Bowl tailgate, and Homecoming among many others. The team partners with other association departments to stage events such as the Alumni Career Fair, association board meetings STUDENT RELATED INFORMATIONGeorgia Tech Fact Book 2015 133and student graduation event, Ramblin' On. The Events team also planned one of Georgia Tech's most exclusive events, the President's Dinner, a celebration for Roll Call Leadership Circle donors. The Student Outreach department actively engaged 60,392 members of the campus community while focusing on its primary goal: to collaborate with students and various campus or ganizations to construct and implement a comprehensive student loyalty program. The foundation of this program is the Student Alumni Association (SAA) which re-launched on 9/9/10. SAA ended this year with 5,282 members/donors, the largest student organization on campus. Student Outreach also manages the Student Ambassadors and the nationally recognized GT Student Foundation. The Fundraising/Business Development department is responsible for raising monies through the Association's annual Roll Call and for building external revenue streams to support the Association's ability to run its operations. The Business Development department handles advertising and sponsorships, merchandise and affinity relationships with the Association's vendors. Partnering companies include Liberty Mutual, Commerce Energy and Sam's Club. Roll Call is the single largest source of predictable, unrestricted funds at Georgia Tech, representing the broadest base of support for the Institute. More than 34,900 donors contributed more than $9.4 million to the 68th annual Roll Call. Research-driven direct marketing, telemarketing and personal solicitations are used to manage a program that is among the leading group of public institutions in the percentage of alumni annual giving. Unrestricted funds provide for student scholarships and financial aid, assist the Institute in recruiting and retaining top faculty and support new academic programs. Offices of the Alumni Association are located in the L. W. \"Chip\" Robert, Jr. Alumni House at 190 North Avenue, Atlanta, GA 30313.

With nearly 3,000 academic and research faculty and more than 25,000 graduate and undergraduate students, the Institute conducts research of national significance, provides research services and facilities to faculty , students, industry, and government agencies, and supports the economic and technological growth of the state and nation. Georgia Tech ranks among the nation's top ten universities (without a medical school) in sponsored expenditures, which top $730 million. This is a reflection of both the caliber of our faculty and staff and the scope of our research enterprise. Georgia Tech's research strategy is focused on creating transformative opportunities, strengthening collaborative partnerships, and enhancing economic and societal impact. Research activities are carried out through Georgia Tech's academic units, research institutes, centers, and laboratories. All of our research is faculty led and powered by ideas. Most of the research is supported by contracts with government organizations and private industry. The Georgia Tech Research Corporation (GTRC), a non-profit organization incorporated under the laws of the state of Georgia, serves as the contracting agency. It also licenses intellectual property created at Georgia Tech, including patents, software, trade secrets, and other similar properties. We believe that much of the research that will change our world will be interdisciplinary in nature, and as a result we continue to work to create the world's foremost innovation ecosystem that incorporates the pursuit of game changing research and then helps build the research leaders of tomorrow and moves our research results from the lab to real-world use. This provides our government and industry research partners with a competitive advantage, while benefiting the economy and society . An additional benefit our partners and sponsors realize through collaboration with Geor gia Tech is access to our students. Through a number of experiential learning activities, students get real-world, hands-on, experience that helps them become job-ready upon graduation. They also bring a new level of creativity and innovative thinking to some of the tough research problems we are trying to solve. Many companies have also established innovation centers on or near Geor gia Tech to allow easier access to students and the Institute's world-class research expertise and research infrastructure. Georgia Tech is proud of the diversity and strength of its research programs and conducts research in a wide range of engineering, science, computing, architecture, public policy, social sciences, management, and related areas. The Institute's core research areas are: Data Engineering Science Bioengineering & Bioscience Electronics & Nanotechnology Manufacturing, Trade & Logistics Materials National Security Renewable Bioproducts People & Technology Public Service, Leadership & Policy Robotics Energy & Sustainable Infrastructure Systems The Executive Vice President for Research (EVPR) is the chief research officer for Georgia Tech. Working closely with Georgia Tech's colleges, affiliated units, and faculty, the EVPR provides strategic and central administration leadership for all research, economic development, and related support units within the Institute. This includes direct oversight of the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI), the Enterprise Innovation Institute (EI2), Georgia Tech's Interdisciplinary Research Institutes, Georgia Tech's Office of Industry Collaboration, and the Georgia Tech Research Corporation (GTRC).
