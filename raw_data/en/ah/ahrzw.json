HHS modified the Privacy Rule to permit a covered entity (such as the Department) to disclose a decedent's health information to family members and others who were involved in the care or paym ent for care of the decedent prior to death. This rule change permits the Depar tment to use or disclose health information, as allowed by the Privacy Rule. This does not change the authority of a decedent 's personal representative with regard to the decedent's health information. Thus, a personal repr esentative would continue to have a right to access the decedent's health information releva nt to such personal re presentation, and have authority to authorize uses and disclosures of the decedent's health information that are not otherwise permitted or required by HIPAA.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The Division of Behavioral Health (DBH) is currently working on building a peer recovery system and one issue that has come up as a ba rrier in Idaho is the requirement around criminal history and background checks. The current requireme nt does not work for the services that are being provided nor does it fit the model of recovery services th at is being promoted. DBH has received complaints from SUD service providers regarding the current rule as it negatively impacts their workforce and ability to provide treatment services. DBH has negotiated with providers and other inte rested parties to develop a criminal history and background check rule that both protects the client and acknowledges those who have been successful in their recovery by allowing them to work in the treatment field. The text of these proposed rule changes provides an administrative review on a case -by-case basis for individuals who do not receive a criminal history clearance to request a waiver. These rules provide for this waiver to help establish a peer recovery syst em for providers of al cohol and substance use disorders services. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: N/AFISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thous and dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: There is no anticipated fiscal impact to th e state general fund due to this rulemaking.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The Division of Behavioral Health (DBH) is currently working on building a peer recovery system and one issue that has come up as a ba rrier in Idaho is the requirement around criminal history and background checks. The current requireme nt does not work for the services that are being provided nor does it fit the model of recovery services th at is being promoted. DBH has received complaints from SUD treatment provide rs regarding the current rule as it negatively impacts their workforce and ability to provide treatment services. DBH has negotiated with providers and other inte rested parties to develop a criminal history and background check rule that both protects the client and acknowledges those who have been successful in their recovery by allowing them to work in the treatment field. The text of these proposed rule changes provides an administrative review on a case -by-case basis for individuals who do not receive a criminal history clearance to request a waiver. These rules provide for this waiver to help establish a peer recovery syst em for providers of al cohol and substance use disorders treatment a nd recovery programs. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: None.FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thous and dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: There is no anticipated fiscal impact to th e state general fund due to this rulemaking.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The Division of Behavioral Health (DBH) is currently working on building a peer delivery system and one issue that has come up as a ba rrier in Idaho is the requirement around criminal history and background checks. The current requireme nt does not work for the services that are being provided nor does it fit the model of services that is being promoted. DBH has received complaints from mental health service providers regarding the current rule as it negatively impacts their workforce and ability to provide mental health services. DBH has negotiated with providers and other inte rested parties to develop a criminal history and background check rule that both protects the client and acknowledges those who have been successful in their recovery by allowing them to work in the mental health field. The text of these proposed rule changes provides an administrative review on a case -by-case basis for individuals who do not receive a criminal history clearance to request a waiver. These rules provide for this waiver to help establish a peer delivery system for providers of adult mental health services. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: None. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thous and dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: There is no anticipated fiscal impact to th e state general fund due to this rulemaking. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220( 1), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was conducted. The Notice of Intent to Promulgate Rules - Negotiated Rulemaking was published in the April 3, 2013, Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 13-4, pages 15 and 16 , under Docket No. 16-0720-1301.

The action is aut horized pursuant to Section 54-1404, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerni ng this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-fiv e (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than September 18, 2013. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Delegation is the process of transferring to a competent individual the authority to perform a selected nursing task in a selected situation. The nurse's decision to delegate a specific task/ function/activity should not be restricted by re gulation but should, instead, be dependent on the needs of the client, stability of client condition, complexity of the task, predictability of outcome and available resources to meet these needs and th e judgment of the nurse. This rule is necessary to allow licensed nurses to appropriately delegate w ithout limiting their authority to determine which tasks can be safely delegated in any individual circumstan ce and/or setting and to engage in other relationships where the structure and/or se tting is not conducive to the delegation process and where the patient/client will benefit from the identified role and responsibilities of the nurse. Thus rulemaking deletes the list of specific functions codified at IDAPA 23.01.01.490.06 that cannot be delegated to an unlicensed assistive person by a licensed nurse, thereby allowing nurses to determine appropriate tasks/functions/activities th at can be safely delegated in a given situation based on the nurse's informed judgment that the sa fety and well-being of the client will not be compromised by delegation of the task; and adds to the partial listing of tasks that fall within a licensed nurse's functions to include engaging in interfaces other than delegation in certain settings codified at IDAPA 23.01.01.401.02 and 460.02. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: None.FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than te n thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: N/ANEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220( 1), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was conducted.
