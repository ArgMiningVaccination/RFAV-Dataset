Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) frequently uses topical treatments to treat muscle injuries, although scientific evidence supporting their efficacy is scarce. In this study, an in vitro assay was used to test the cytotoxicity of a topical TCM formula containing Carthami Flos, Dipsaci Radix, and Rhei Rhizoma (CDR). Then, a muscle contusion rat model was developed to investigate the in vivo effect and basic mechanisms underlying CDR on muscle regeneration. The in vitro assay illustrated that CDR was non-cytotoxic to immortalized rat myoblast culture and increased cell viability. Histological results demonstrated that the CDR treatment facilitated muscle repair by increasing the number of new muscle fibers and promoting muscle integrity. The CDR treatment also upregulated the expression of Pax7, MyoD and myogenin, as evidenced by an immunohistochemical study. A gene expression analysis indicated that the CDR treatment accelerated the regeneration and remodeling phases during muscle repair. This study demonstrated that topical CDR treatment was effective at facilitating muscle injury repair.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-08-12", "cleaned_text": "Traditional Chinese Medicine for Topical Treatment of Skeletal Muscle Injury [https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16081144](https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16081144) [The Pharmacological Management of Skeletal Muscle to Bone Cross Talk]( /journal/pharmaceuticals/special_issues/N1292606Q7 )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. Notably, within this category, contusions alone contribute to 13% of the reported cases. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that over 90% of sports-related injuries manifest as either contusions or sprains [ [2](#B2-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. [3](#B3-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)] and are subsequently referred to physiotherapists for rehabilitation [ [4](#B4-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. In terms of pharmaceutical treatments, analgesics for pain relief [ [5](#B5-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)] and anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce swelling [ [6](#B6-pharmaceuticals-16-01144), [7](#B7-pharmaceuticals-16-01144), [8](#B8-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)] are commonly prescribed. However, there is controversy surrounding the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, as inflammation may have positive effects on injury recovery and is necessary for skeletal muscle regeneration [ [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-16-01144), [10](#B10-pharmaceuticals-16-01144), [11](#B11-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. Prolonged use of anti-inflammatory drugs may extend inflammation inhibition and potentially impede the healing of muscle injuries. Therefore, the benefits of administering anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of muscle injury are under debate [ [12](#B12-pharmaceuticals-16-01144), [13](#B13-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. [14](#B14-pharmaceuticals-16-01144), [15](#B15-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. Generally, adverse effects of these applications are rare, although instances of contact allergy and dermatitis have been occasionally reported [ [16](#B16-pharmaceuticals-16-01144), [17](#B17-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. However, many topical TCM products consist of multiple herbs, often ranging from 5 to over 20. This complex herbal mixing poses a challenge for scientists seeking to elucidate the underlying therapeutic mechanisms. Only a few of these products have been able to provide evidence-based scientific data to support their efficacy. Moreover, there is a lack of international publications reporting in vivo studies on the effects of topical TCM treatment specifically targeting skeletal muscle injuries. [18](#B18-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. As scientific techniques and understanding have progressed, modern biological platforms have facilitated the evaluation of medicinal herbs to uncover their pharmacological activities. In light of this, herbs demonstrating angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and cellular regeneration properties were screened in this study. Subsequently, we carefully selected the most popular and easily accessible herb from each category to compose a potent herbal formula. The three selected herbs were: - (1) - Carthami Flos (Carthamus tinctorius L.). A Chinese herb traditionally used for cardiovascular disease and bone injury in China with pharmacological effects on improving blood circulation. Its proangiogenic effect has been proven in both in vitro and in vivo studies [ [19](#B19-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. - (2) - Dipsaci Radix (Dipsacus C.Y. Cheng T.M. Ai). A common herb in traumatology that promotes blood circulation to remove a hematoma and alleviate pain. Recent scientific studies illustrated that Akebia Saponin D, the most abundant constituent of Dipsaci Radix, exhibits anti-inflammatory effects Rhizoma (Rheum palmatum Linn). A widely and traditionally used Chinese herb for wound healing. One of its derivatives, emodin, has been reported to promote the repair of rat excisional wounds through a complex mechanism involving the stimulation of tissue regeneration and regulation of the Smads-mediated transforming growth factor-1 signaling pathway [ [22](#B22-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. [23](#B23-pharmaceuticals-16-01144), [24](#B24-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. Furthermore, our research group has shown that when used in conjunction with oral pharmaceutical agents, CDR exhibits an additive effect, facilitating the healing process of fractures [ [25](#B25-pharmaceuticals-16-01144), [26](#B26-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. According to the principles of TCM, a similar or even identical topical TCM formula has traditionally been used to address minor injuries, including minor fractures, tendon and muscle injuries resulting from sprains, strains or contusions. Based on this knowledge, we hypothesized that CDR may also prove effective at treating muscle injuries. 2. Results 2.1. Effect of the Herbal Extract on Cell Viability of L6 [Figure 1](#pharmaceuticals-16-01144-f001)) showed that none of Dipsaci Radix, effect on L6 cells, even at a concentration of up to 1600 \u00b5g/mL. In fact, the extract of Rhei Rhizoma increased the L6 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, with a significant increase of 11.60% (p = 0.0429), 21.17% (p = 0.0001) and 28.23% (p = 0.0001) for 400, 800 and 1600 \u00b5g/mL, respectively, starting from 400 \u00b5g/mL. Additionally, the CDR extract at a concentration of 1600 \u00b5g/mL also boosted the L6 cell viability by 13.87% 0.0317). 2.2. Incapacitance Test [Supplementary Materials](#app1-pharmaceuticals-16-01144), [Figure S1](#app1-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)). Additionally, there was no significant difference in the SWR between the CDR and the Ctrl groups. These findings suggested that the degree of sensitivity in the incapacitance test was limited and incapable of distinguishing the level of pain experienced by the rats in the gastrocnemius between the two groups. 2.3. Morphological Change in Muscles after Contusion [Figure 2](#pharmaceuticals-16-01144-f002)A,D,G). Seven days post-contusion, fibrotic tissue dominated the injured area and the presence of centronucleated myofibers indicated that muscle regeneration of the damaged muscle fibers had begun ( [Figure 2](#pharmaceuticals-16-01144-f002)B,E,H). The CDR treatment, but not VTR, increased the number of new muscle fibers compared to the control group. By Day 14, there was evidence of clearing of necrotic tissue, and the area was being remodeled by normal tissue. The presence of centronucleated myofibers indicated that the regeneration of muscle fibers was still ongoing. Compared with the control group, muscle integrity was increased in both the CDR- and VTR-treated groups. Fascicles were formed primarily in the CDR and VTR groups but not in the control group ( [Figure 2](#pharmaceuticals-16-01144-f002)C,F,I). 2.4. Immunostaining of Muscle [Figure 3](#pharmaceuticals-16-01144-f003)). A significant increase was observed in the CDR group on both Day 2 (4.71-fold increase, p = 0.0014) and Day 7 (3.87-fold increase, p = 0.0109), as well as in the control group on Day 7 (3.33-fold increase, p = 0.0397). The Pax7 density in both groups then decreased by Day 14, with a significant decrease observed in the CDR group from Day 2 to Day 14 (p = 0.0391). Generally, the Pax7 density was higher in the CDR group, although not significantly, than in the control group at all time points, especially on Day 2 (1.60 folds, p = 0.1348). [Figure 4](#pharmaceuticals-16-01144-f004)and [Figure 5](#pharmaceuticals-16-01144-f005)). The CDR treatment boosted both MyoD and MyoG expression at all time points, especially on Day 2, with the MyoD expression significantly higher than that of the Ctrl and VTR groups by 1.40-fold (p = (p 0.043), respectively ( [Figure 4](#pharmaceuticals-16-01144-f004)J). The expression of MyoD was highest on Day 2 and then decreased significantly by Day 7 and Day 14 post-injury in all groups ( [Figure 4](#pharmaceuticals-16-01144-f004)J). The peak of the MyoG expression, however, was at Day 7 post-injury ( [Figure 5](#pharmaceuticals-16-01144-f005)J), after which the MyoG level in the control and CDR groups decreased significantly by Day 14 (p = 0.043 and 0.0136, respectively). 2.5. Gene Expression [Figure 6](#pharmaceuticals-16-01144-f006)A). The results showed that Pax7, Myod1 and significantly upregulated by 2.16-fold (p = 0.0005) and 2.42-fold (p = 0.0153), respectively, on Day 2 post-injury compared with the normal muscle, but it returned to normal levels thereafter. The peak expression of Col1a1 and Acta2 was observed on Day 7 post-contusion, where they were significantly higher than the normal muscle by 8.01-fold (p = 0.0006) and 2.23-fold (p = 0.0104), respectively. The expression of Myh4 was highest on Day 14 post-contusion and was 1.95-fold higher (p = 0.047) than the normal muscle. [Figure 6](#pharmaceuticals-16-01144-f006)B). These two genes were also significantly higher in the CDR group than in the VTR group. The expression of Pax7, Myod1, Myog and Myh4 in the CDR group was higher than in the control group on Day 7, although the difference was not significant ( [Figure 6](#pharmaceuticals-16-01144-f006)C). Meanwhile, Acta2 and Vegfa in the CDR group were higher than in the control group on Day 2 and Day 14 ( [Figure 6](#pharmaceuticals-16-01144-f006)D), but without significant differences. 3. Discussion [27](#B27-pharmaceuticals-16-01144), [28](#B28-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. However, despite the significance of these phases, there is a notable scarcity of in-depth scientific studies published in international journals that explore the direct effects of the topical TCM on muscle injury repair, particularly during the latter three phases. A thorough search of the English language literature reporting in vivo studies utilizing various reputable search engines (such as PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus and Google Scholar) with specific keywords including \"(Soft tissue OR muscle) AND (injury OR inflammation) AND (regeneration OR repair) AND (topical OR transdermal OR external) AND (Chinese Medicine)\" yielded only five relevant publications [ [29](#B29-pharmaceuticals-16-01144), [30](#B30-pharmaceuticals-16-01144), [31](#B31-pharmaceuticals-16-01144), [32](#B32-pharmaceuticals-16-01144), [33](#B33-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. Notably, these studies primarily focused on the anti-inflammatory, analgesic or anti-swelling effects of TCM on soft-tissue injuries. Consequently, researchers investigating the topical application of TCM for muscle injury treatment should prioritize these crucial phases as they represent the key steps in the overall muscle repair process. To achieve this purpose, it is imperative to conduct well-designed in vivo controlled studies. Such studies not only have the potential to validate the efficacy of TCM in facilitating muscle healing directly but also shed light on the morphological changes and the molecular mechanisms involved. [34](#B34-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. [35](#B35-pharmaceuticals-16-01144), [36](#B36-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)], further validating our observations. Additionally, our gene expression analysis using qPCR demonstrated a significant upregulation of Pax7 following contusion, consistent with the findings reported by Tian et al. [ [36](#B36-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. Pax7 serves as a key marker for satellite cells, playing a crucial role in maintaining their proliferation and preventing apoptotic cell death. While Pax7 can be detected during the quiescent state of satellite cells, its expression becomes more prominent once satellite cells are activated. [37](#B37-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. It exhibits an upregulation during the initial stages of muscle regeneration [ [38](#B38-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. Consistent with the findings of Tian et al. [ [36](#B36-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)], our IHC and qPCR results demonstrated a significant upregulation of MyoD in parallel with Pax7 following skeletal muscle injury. These results collectively indicate the activation of muscle regeneration following contusion injury. Additionally, MyoG, a muscle-specific transcription factor, is involved in the coordination of skeletal muscle development and repair processes. In normal muscle, MyoG-positive nuclei are not detectable, but they appear three days after injury and increase further by Day 7 as myogenic progenitors (myoblasts) differentiate into myocytes [ [38](#B38-pharmaceuticals-16-01144), and 5](#pharmaceuticals-16-01144-f005)J, respectively). CDR was less effective than VTR at inducing Myod expression. Although Myog expression was reduced in both the CDR and VTR groups, the difference was not statistically significant ( [Figure 6](#pharmaceuticals-16-01144-f006)B). These discrepancies could potentially be attributed to differences in the specific regions investigated during the two assessments. The IHC results were derived from the images captured specifically within the central damaged zone, whereas the qPCR analysis involved harvesting the entire contused region of the gastrocnemius muscle, encompassing the damaged zone, border zone and the non-damaged tissue. In a separate study, the findings from in situ hybridization demonstrated that while both Myod and Myog mRNA were expressed post-injury, the density of MyoD and MyoG staining was highest at the periphery of the damaged site rather than at the central damaged site [ [40](#B40-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. [41](#B41-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. ECM serves as the scaffold for the establishment of novel myofibers and neuromuscular junctions. The active deposition of ECM components closely accompanies the connective tissue remodeling process during muscle healing. Notably, Type I collagen deposition occurs later than Type III during the formation of the connective tissue scar, with its expression peaking after 7 days post-injury [ [42](#B42-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. Coinciding with this timeline, our qPCR analysis demonstrated a significant upregulation of Col1a1 gene expression on Day 7 following contusion. Similarly, the qPCR analysis of Acta2, a gene encoding the vascular tissue in skeletal muscle, revealed a significant upregulation after contusion, reaching its peak on Day 7. This finding suggests that the revascularization rate in our contused rat model was highest on Day 7. Remarkably, the CDR treatment resulted in increased expression of Col1a1, Acta2 and Vegfa on Day 2. This observation indicates that CDR treatment accelerated fibrogenesis and angiogenesis and shifted the remodeling phase of muscle regeneration forward during muscle repair effectively. [27](#B27-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. In our study, the gene expression level of Myh4 exhibited a significant peak on Day 14 following contusion, signifying the advanced stage of muscle regeneration. Notably, topical CDR treatment demonstrated a trend toward upregulating Myh4 expression compared with the Ctrl group, although statistical significance was not achieved. These results strongly suggest that topical CDR treatment also enhances the maturation phase of the healing muscle, further promoting the development of functionally mature muscle fibers. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Herbal Materials and Authentication [43](#B43-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. The herbarium voucher specimens of the tested herbs were deposited in the museum at the Institute of Chinese Medicine, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, with voucher numbers were prepared according to a previous report [ [43](#B43-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. Briefly, each herb was extracted individually with refluxing in distilled water. The remaining solid herbal residue was further extracted with refluxing in 95% ethanol. The aqueous and ethanol filtrates were mixed and concentrated into paste form. The CDR paste was formed after mixing the three individual herbal pastes in a dry weight ratio of 1:1:1. [Table S1](#app1-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)in the [Supplementary Materials](#app1-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)) and CDR samples were separated using a gradient mobile phase consisting of water (A) and acetonitrile (B). The gradient condition was 0 to 3 min, 10-27% B; 3 to 5 min, 27-33% B; 5 to 12 min, 33-33% B; 12 to 13 min, 33-80% B; 13 to 16 min, 80-90% B; and 16 to 20 min, 90-90% B. The flow rate was set at 0.5 mL/min, and the injection volume was 20 \u00b5L. The MS analysis was monitored in negative ion mode and multiple reaction monitoring mode using target ions at m/z for rhein. The abundance of the markers was determined quantitatively ( [Supplementary Materials](#app1-pharmaceuticals-16-01144), [Table S1](#app1-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)). All the chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MI, USA), and both methanol and acetonitrile were HPLC-grade (99.9%). The chemical markers were purchased from Tauto Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). 4.2. In Vitro Study 4.3. Animal Model and In Vivo Study [44](#B44-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. Animal ethics approval was obtained from the Animal and Experimental Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) for the in vivo study (13/058/MIS). A total of 54 male Sprague-Dawley rats with a mean body weight of 353.3 \u00b1 17.7 g, supplied by the Laboratory Animal Service Centre (LASEC), CUHK, were used. The rats were housed in standard cages at a constant temperature of 22 \u00b0C with a 12 h light-dark cycle and given ad libitum access to food and water. The experimental procedures were commenced after 7 days of acclimatization. 4.4. Incapacitance 4.6. Gene Expression on Muscle Regeneration [45](#B45-pharmaceuticals-16-01144)]. First, the change in (within Ctrl) was analyzed. Then, their expressions were compared among different groups at different time points. The gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) was used as the reference gene. The primer sequences of the genes are listed in [Table 1](#pharmaceuticals-16-01144-t001). 4.7.
