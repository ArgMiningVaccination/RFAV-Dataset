Maintaining our health and strengthening our immune system has never been more important. Our immune system is always working to protect our bodies. However, at times it can be overwhelmed. Never has it been so crucial to educate and empower ourselves to advocate for our own and our family's health. Eastern Medicine practitioners have been dealing with strengthening the immune system for centuries. Acupuncture and Chinese herbs have been critical to addressing immune system deficiencies. A weakened immune system is generally the result of qi deficiency. A balanced qi is vital to our physical and mental health. Qi is our life force. When one's qi is deficient, illness is likely to occur. Qi deficiency can happen anywhere the body does not have enough energy to perform its functions properly. Acupuncture and Chinese herbs can be immensely helpful in strengthening your immune system and balancing your qi. Many Chinese herbs have strong immunity-enhancing effects. In addition, there are several lifestyle changes that can have a positive impact on our immune system and help alleviate qi deficiency. There is clear evidence that increased stress and anxiety, inadequate sleep, poor nutrition, and lack of exercise and movement weaken the immune system. In a recent poll, half of Americans believe that stress has increased over the last 5 years. And COVID-19 has taken stress and anxiety to unprecedented levels. Reducing stress and anxiety through acupuncture, adequate sleep, meditation, movement, proper nutrition can make a significant difference in overall health. Equally important is adequate sleep. Lack of quality sleep reduces the immune system's ability to fight infection. Sleep deprivation significantly increases our chances of getting ill. The combination of herbal medicine, stress management, enhanced sleep, proper nutrition and exercise, and the appropriate herbs and health supplements can significantly boost the immune system and help the body fight off viruses and disease. Be resilient during these challenging times, take the best care of your body as you can, and stay safe and healthy as we navigate the next several months. You Might Also Enjoy...
