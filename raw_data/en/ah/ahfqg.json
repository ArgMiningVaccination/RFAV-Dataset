EVOX Perception is key but your perception is not always right. Evox is all about perception and reframing false perceptions. When you speak your voice carries energy of how you perceive or see the topic you are speaking about. The Evox records this energy and plots it on a graph called a perception index. It then evaluates the energy signatures that compliment your body's needs and then we introduce these frequencies into your body. We use this device to help our clients with deep emotional issues that are not obvious to them. These energy patterns start with our parents and grandparents and are passed down. We see amazing results in personal relationships, improving personal performance in sports, work or school. We have seen improvement and resolution of addictions and energetic shifts in our clients thinking when they see the emotions that are driving their lives. Because of 90% of our physical issues involve trapped emotions we have seen instantaneous resolution of physical signs and symptoms that previously were not treated. If you are dealing with stress which we all are then EVOX definitely needs to be included in your schedule. It usually takes 30-45 minutes per sessions and there are no known side effect but health. Call us today! Comra & Delta Laser Hocatt Plus If you want to experience relaxing, healing, and regeneration at its finest then Hocatt plus is right for you. The technology is from Asia and this clinic has one of the few in the United States. The Hocatt combines 8 different modalities to promote healing and detoxification in the fastest and easiest way. Ondamed For highly focus electromagnetic technology one must experience Ondamed. Ondamed is a German technology that involves highly focus electromagnetic field that penetrates deeply into a specific location of the body. Over 25 years of research in biophysical medical testing and therapy resulted in this technology. The session involves painless activation of energy pathways that improves cell metabolism and function. Ondamed compliments other treatments such as pharmaceutical, homeopathic, nutritional supplements and other therapeutic modalities. When people have past injuries whether it be due to physical, emotional, or spiritual it leaves scar tissue (aberrant energy patterns). When electromagnetic waves are applied one is able to find enhanced pulse waveform. It is like driving over a speed bump too fast with similar results. Your car can sustain lots of damage and if you do not treat properly holistically well you will only enhance the speed bump and cost more money in the long run. Ondamed smoothes out the speed bump that allows rapid healing from about any malady. Ondamed is without side effect and is safe and one study at the University Clinic Maastricht, the Netherlands indicated 90% of patients with different type of pain recovered within 2-12 treatments. In our clinic we find this tool is invaluable to clients with difficult to treat issues or issues were there is no known treatment or the treatment is worse than the condition. PEMF Why do professional athletes use PEMF? Because they are looking for results and boy do they find it with PEMF. So what is PEMF? Pulse Electromagnetic Frequency. Athletes suffer from all types of injuries and need to get back in the game fast. PEMF technology will allow for repair of damage tissues, increased circulation to tissue providing better oxygenation and improved healing time. The earth has lost about 90% of its magnetic field and the earth poles are constantly shifting albeit slowly. With the loss we also lose electrons which is the currency for healing of our body. Our bodies and cells are like batteries that require a voltage potential to get the nutrients in and the toxins out. When our batteries are drained life becomes stagnant and when life moves toward stagnation illness occurs. PEMF increases the voltage potential and regardless of the illness label health is improved. \"PEMF Therapy is already approved by the FDA to promote the healing of non-healing bone unions and has been used in Europe for over 20 years in over 400,000 sessions with individuals experiencing migraines, sport injuries, and other pain syndromes including back and joint problems, edema and swelling, lack of circulation, skin wound healing, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and arthritis.\" With our experience in over 3 years of using this technology we have seen expected healings and also unexpected healings. We had one client that came in with a serious problem which we focused our attention on but the side effect from one session was a rotator cuff tear that had left him with a frozen shoulder for 20 years spontaneously healed. For the first time in 20 years he was able to lift his arm with full range of motion. "}
