In North America, distinct virus variants associated with specific wild reservoir species exist. Bats are the only reservoir for rabies in British Columbia (BC). Rabies is transmitted through saliva and cerebrospinal fluid from an infected mammal. Infection in humans and animals with rabies virus results in an acute, progressive viral encephalomyelitis and is uniformly fatal once clinical signs develop. The goal of the provincial Rabies Control Program is to prevent the acquisition of human and animal rabies. Prevention of rabies is undertaken through: Evaluation of human and animal exposures for the risk of rabies transmission ; Provision of post -exposure immunoprophylaxis to persons or animals exposed or potentially exposed to the rabies virus ; Provision of pre- exposure immunization of persons at increased ri sk of exposure to rabies ; Provision of pre- exposure immunization to domestic animals; Testing of suspect animals for rabies; and Collaboration and consultation with provincial and federal authorities regarding rabies incidence and control in Britis h Columbia humans and in domestic and wild animals. The intent of this guideline is to provide direction for BC veterinarians on: Risk assessment and risk management of domestic animals exposed or potentially exposed to rabies ; Collection and submission of specimens for rabies testing; and Reporting of positive cases and potential human exposures to the rabies virus . 2.0 REGULATIONS AND REPORTING Rabies is a reportable animal disease to the Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) in BC under the Reportable and Notifiable Disease Regulation, pursuant to the BC Animal Health Act [2014]. The CVO shares reports of zoonotic diseases in animals with the Provincial Health Officer (PHO) under an Information Sharing Agreement. Rabies is a reportable animal disease to t he Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) under the federal Reportable Diseases Regulations, Health of Animals Act . Owners, veterinarians and laboratories fulfill their reporting requirements to the CFIA by submitting suspect animals for testing. In Brit ish Columbia, the Reporting Information Affecting Public Health Regulation requires veterinarians to report to a medical officer of health all known or suspected cases of a person exposed to rabies. BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 3 3.0 RISK ASSESSMENT Figure 1: Quick guide for veterinarians to assess risk and manage exposures. Supporting information follows. BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 4 3.1. Exposure assessment Direct contact with a potentially rabid animal is necessary for transmission of the rabies virus. A rabies exposure is defined as any bite, scratch or other situation in which saliva or nervous tissue from a potentially rabid animal enters an open or fresh wound, abrasion or break in the skin, or comes in contact with a mucous membrane of another animal or person. Rabies virus becomes non -infectious when it dries out and when it is exposed to sunlight. When assessing the risk of rabies in an animal, the following need to be considered: Animal species ( Table 1, Section 3.1.1 ) Geographic location ( Table 1 and Section 3.1.1 ) Animal behaviour ( Section 3.1.2 ) Animal rabies vaccination status ( Section 3.1.3 ) Type of exposure (bite vs. other) ( Sectio n 3.1.4 ) Table 1. Criteria to determine if rabies exposure has occurred by species and location, assuming saliva or neural tiss ue from the exposing animal may have contaminated an open wound or mucous membranes \"Exposing\" species Geographic location of exposure Likelihood of exposure Bat Globally Consider rabies exposure unless bat is tested and shown to be negative Domestic or wild terrestrial mammal BC Unlikely rabies exposure, unless animal: demonstrated neurological behavior indicative of rabies or dies; if so, consider rabies exposure unless tested and shown to be negative known to have contact with bat in last 6 months impo rted from, or travel to, a rabies -endemic area in last 6 months Skunk, raccoon, coyote, bobcat, fox, monkey and other wild animals Outside BC (except in rabies -free countries )a Consider rabies exposure unless tested and shown to be negative Domestic an imals Enzootic areas outside BC Consider rabies exposure unless animal tested and shown to be negative. The vaccination status of the 'exposing' animal should be considered. a WHO rabies risk map http://gamapserver.who.int/mapLibrary/Files/Maps/Global_Rabies_ITHRiskMap.png?ua=1 CFIA animal testing results: http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/anima/disemala/rabrag/statse.shtml BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 5 3.1.1 Animal species and geographic location 3.1.1.1 In British Columbia In BC, bats are the only known reservoir. Since 2014, approximately 8% of BC bats submitted for testing have tested posi tive for rabies2. Bats submitted for testing have a higher likelihood of being infected. The true prevalence of rabies in BC bats is likely lower. Active surveillance of bats collected randomly in Alberta between 1979- 1983 found that 0.1% (1/769) of bats tested positive for rabies ( Pybus et al, 1986 ). In BC, terrestrial mammals are not known to be reservoirs of rabies. However, occasional spill- over of bat -variant rabies to other species has occurred in the following cases but there was no evidence of continued transmission within these species in BC: 2007 - a cat in Maple Ridge 2004 - 4 skunks in Stanley Park 1992 - 3 cats in Delta3 Late 1980s - a beaver 1984 - a horse in the Sorrento area 1969 - a cat on Vancouver Island In all geographic jurisdictions, squirrels, hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, chipmunks, rats, mice and other rodents, rabbits and hares are very rarely infected with rabies. These species are not known to have caused human rabies in North America. 3.1.1.2 Outside of British Columbia In other parts of North America, bats, skunks, raccoons and foxes are reservoir s for rabies that can lead to spill-over events in other wildlife species . In developing countries, dogs are the primary reservoir and source of infection. Dog -mediated rabies is responsible for up to 99% of rabies deaths globally (WHO 2018 ). Rabies is extremely rare in small rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits and hares). In most cases, no action is needed with exposure to these species, unless unusual behaviour of the animal warrants it. Exceptions include woodchucks found to be rabid in parts of the US in association with raccoon rabies expansion and the occasional report of an infected rodent in other parts of the world (Moro 1991, Childs 1997, Kamoltham 2002, Wang 2009). In tropical regions, monkeys may be in fected with rabies and may transmit rabies virus to humans ( Gautret 2014 ) and potentially to other animals. Dog-variant rabies in enzootic in many developing countries. Dog bites provide the greatest risk of rabies transmiss ion in enzootic countries. Unvaccinated dogs import ed 2 CFIA animal testing results: http://www.inspecti on.gc.ca/english/anima/disemala/rabrag/statse.shtml 3 Skunk strain of rabies virus was recovered from one of the Delta cats and the beaver. A wildlife survey in Delta (prior to 1989) following the isolation of the skunk strain rabies in a beaver, and intensified testing of cats following the Delta incident, indicated that the skunk strain of rabies is not enzootic in BC. The skunk strain identification has never been fully explained, although a lab error is possible. Strain testing was not available for the 1969 cat case, but it was most likely due to bat strain of virus. BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 6 into Nor th America from high risk areas present a risk for rabies to people and other animals. 3.1.2. Animal behavior The signs of rabies infection can vary considerably between species and individual animals. An animal exhibiting behaviour that is considered unusual for that particular species could potentially be rabid. Entering an animal's territory or close interactions, especially hand feeding, could be considered provocation. When an animal at tacks for no known reason or has no history of aggression, it can be considered an unprovoked attack. If an animal had physical contact with a rabid animal (e.g., a cat played/fought with a bat that is later determined to be rabid) and then had direct co ntact with an individual or another animal , it is unlikely that rabies would be transmitted. There are no known incidents of rabies transmission by such indirect contact. The minimum time for animal rabies to incubate is 2 weeks but is often much longer ; transmission of rabies will not occur until the virus is being shed in the animal's saliva. Many wild terrestrial animals may act aggressively when approached by a human or another animal, particularly if they are protecting their young, are food condition ed or habituated to humans or have no ability to escape the situation. Bites and scratches from these animal encounters are not rare in urban and suburban settings. 3.1.3. V accination status A domestic animal that has been vaccinated against rabies routinely is likely protected from rabies. The majority of vaccinated domestic animals are considered protected. However, a small proportion (about 5%) are not protected or can become rabid through overwhelming viral challenge, incomplete vaccine efficacy, im proper vaccine administration or host im munocompromise ( NASPHV 2016 , Murray 2009, Jakel 2008 , Kennedy 2007 ). However, if the animal behaviour is highly unusual, the animal may need to be observed or euthanized and tested for rabies regardless of vaccination status. 3.1.4. Type of exposure In a potentially infected animal, the following body substances/tis sues may be infectious: Saliva and salivary glands Neural fluid and tissue As such, the highest risk exposure is from the bite of an infected animal that breaks the skin. Scratches from an infected animal can theoretically introduce rabies virus if, for BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 7 example, the animal had licked its nails prior to the scratch. This is a theoretical risk given that no cases have been reported from this type of secondary transmission pathway. WHO categories of contact with suspect rabid animals (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs099/en/ ) Category I: touching or feeding animals, licks on intact skin Category II: nibbling of uncovered skin, minor scratches or abrasions without bleeding Categor y III: single or multiple transdermal bites or scratches, licks on broken skin, contamination of mucous membranes with saliva from licks, [direct] contact with bats Virus can rarely be found in urine, muscle and lungs. Contact with such materials has not been documented to lead to transmission of rabies. There is a theoretical risk of airborne transmission of rabies virus from bat feces ( Brown , 1971 , Heymann, 2008 ). As viremia has not been detected in infected animals, blood is generally considered non-infectious. 4.0 Rabies in animals 4.1. Virus characteristics Rabies is caused by the rabies virus, a lyssavirus in the Rhabdovirus family. It is an enveloped RNA virus that survives in saliva and CNS fluid. The virus is inactivated when it dries out and when it is exposed to sunlight or UV radiation; it can also be inactivated by sodium hypochlorite, 45- 75% ethanol, quaternary ammonium compounds, and iodine preparations and some detergents. 4.2. Clinical manifestations All mammals are susceptible to infectio n. Clinical presentation can be quite variable. The initial clinical signs are often nonspecific. Animals may show behavioural changes: nocturnal species may be active in the day, calm animals may be excitable and timid ones may become vicious. After 2 to 5 days, these signs may be followed by a stage during which either the paralytic or the furious form of rabies predominates. \"Furious\" rabies is marked by aggression and a loss of fear of humans and other animals. The animal may attack suddenly and without provocation. There are seizures and loss of muscle coordination. Progressive paralysis results in death. In \"dumb\" or \"paralytic\" rabies, the throat and masseter muscles are paralyzed, resulting in excessive salivation and inability to swallow. The animal is generally passive and death results rapidly (<10 days) from progressive paralysis (CFSPH 2012 , Tepsu methanon 2004 ). 4.3. Transmission Infection occurs by percutaneous introduction of the virus -laden saliva or cerebrospinal fluid of a rabid animal through a bite or scratch, or into a fresh break in the skin, or by contact with intact mucous membranes . The virus travels via the peripheral nerves to BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 8 the spinal cord and ascends to the brain. After reaching the brain, the virus travels via peripheral nerves to the salivary glands. Involvement of the salivary glands and oral mucosa is responsible for trans missibility ( CFSPH 2012 ). 4.4. Incubation The incubation period in domestic animals (from initial exposure to clinical symptoms) may range from two weeks to many months (Figure 2). It can depend on a number of factor s, including the variant of rabies virus, the amount of inoculated virus, and the anatomic location of the bite or introduction of the virus. The majority of dogs and cats that develop rabies do so within four months of exposure, a minority will incubate longer. It is important to note that animals may shed the virus in saliva and be able to transmit the disease several days before showing clinical signs. In cats, dogs and ferrets, this period is 10 days when infected animals can shed the virus before showi ng clinical signs (Vaughn 1963, Vaughn 1965, Niezgoda 1998 ). Only one study of dogs experimentally infected with rabies virus showed 1/16 dogs wi th viral excretion longer than 10 days prior to symptom onset (13 days prior) ( Fekadu 1982 ).The duration of pre- symptomatic infectious peri od is unknown for other species . Figure 2 : Rabies progression in animals and i nfectious period BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 9 4.5. Case definition Suspect case: Any animal exhibiting non- specific central nervous system (CNS) clinical signs (ataxia, abnormal vocalization, biting and eating abnormal objects, aggression, etc.) that include rabies as a differen tial diagnosis should be considered a suspect rabies case, particularly where there is a supportive history of potential exposure and where the local geographic rabies epidemiology supports the possibility of rabies. OR Any animal with a positive screening test including: direct rapid immunohistochemical test ( DRIT) ; or immunohistochemistry Confirmed case: Any animal whose CNS tissue tests positive for rabies in a Fluorescent Antibody Test (FAT). 5.0. RISK MANAGEMENT 5.1. Human exposure Local public health authorities, under the direction of the MHO, are responsible for assessing risk in potentially exposed humans. When a veterinarian becomes aware that a human has been exposed to a potentially rabid animal (domestic or wild) they will: explai n that rabies is a serious, zoonotic disease; and encourage the client to consult their physician or local public health authority for further guidance; and report the potential human rabies exposure to the health authority where the exposed human resides (see Appendix A for contact information). The College of Veterinarian of BC (CVBC) Bylaws, The College of Veterinarian of BC (CVBC) Bylaws, Part 4 - Ethics and Standards, s. 249 ( 4) (b), Access to information (CVBC ) permits disclosure of information about an animal's health under certain conditions, including to an MHO , Environmental Health Officer (EHO) , or communicable disease nurse. For further informa tion see Appendix B : Disclosure of confidential patient information to BC public health authorities . If human exposure has been identified, local public health authorities will perform a human risk exposure assessment and determine what actions are required, including if the animal specimen should be submitted to the CFIA laboratory for testing. Some health authorities may send an Environmental Health Officer to pick -up and submit the sample. If the local public health authority does not have a designated person to pick -up BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 10 and submit the sample, they may ask the private veterinarian to collect, package and submit the sample to CFIA. In cases of human exposure where public health asks a veterinarian to submit samples, the public health authority will provide reasonable compensation to the veterinarian for their work. 5.2. Concurrent human and domestic animal exposure If there has been both potential domestic animal exposure and human exposure, the private veterinar ian will: encourage the client to consult their physician or local public health authority for further guidance; and report of the potential human rabies exposure to the health authority where the exposed human resides (see Appendi x A for contact information); and carry out an animal risk assessment and management measures (see ' Domestic animal exposure' below); and Vaccinate the exposed animal against rabies. For situations of domestic animal exposure without concurrent human exposure, all veterinary fees (e.g. examination, vaccination, sample collection, packaging and shipping) are the sole responsibility of the client. If there is concurrent human exposure, public health authorities wil l work with the private veterinarian to coordinate sample collection and shipping, and fees for collecting, packaging and shipping the sample may be covered by the local health authority at their discretion. Assistance with rabies risk assessment and managemen t of domestic animals can be obtained from the BCCDC's public health veterinarian at publichealthve t@bcc dc.ca . Advice regarding risk assessment of wild animals, and contacts for handling or management of wil d animals can be obtained from BC's wildlife veterinarian (see contact information in Appendix A ). In cases where a wild animal is available for testing and the risk assessment for humans and domestic animals does not support testing for rabies, laboratory submission of the wild animal for other purposes may still be appropriate. In these situations, please contact the BC wildlife veterinarian. BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 11 5.3. Domestic animal exposure 4,5 Figure 3 : Quick guide for veterinary management of rabies exposures in animals Exposed animal is currently vaccinated (up -to- date) Exposed anima l is vaccinated but out- of-date Exposed animal is unvaccinated If a domestic animal may have been exposed to rabies , the private veterinarian will conduct an animal risk assessment. A domestic animal is deemed exposed if the exposing animal species: is known to carry rabies (see section 3.1.1 ) OR is behaving abnormally AND saliva or neural tissue from the exposing animal may have contaminated an open wound or m ucous membranes (i.e. single or multiple transdermal bites or scratches, licks on broken skin, or contamination of mucous membranes , nibbling of uncov ered skin or minor scratches or abrasions without bleeding ). See section 3.1.4 . 4 Recommendations are based on the Council of Chief Veterinary Officer Subcommittee for the management of potential domestic animal exposures to rabies, literature review, expert opinion, and a local risk assessment taking into account the epidemiology of rabies in BC. 5 Livestock exposures should be discussed with the Ministry of Agriculture Public Health Veterinarian or Chief Veterinary Officer ( see contact information in Appendix A ). BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 12 For domestic animal exposures, the private veterinarian should classify the vaccine status of the pet as either 1) currently vaccinated (up- to-date) (see Section 5.3.1 ); 2) previously vaccinated but out -of-date (see Section 5.3.2 ); or 3) unvaccinated (see Section 5.3.3 ) and then follow the steps described in the relevant section . In every scenario, administration of a post -exposure rabies vaccine with 7 days is indicated. There is no clear evidence to indicate the serum antibody level that is protective against rabies in animals. However, >0.5 International Units (IU) of antibody per milliliter (ml) of serum is defined as a protective response in humans and by analogy, in animals. In dogs and cats, antibody levels >0.5 IU/ml are expected to develop within 14 days after vaccination ( Minke 2009, Manick am 2008 ). An animal is considered currently vaccinated if it has been administered a licensed rabies vaccine in accordance with the labelled directions and at least 14 days have elapsed since the animal's first (primary) vaccination (i.e. both primary and fully vaccinated animals are considered currently vaccinated), and when the exposure occurs within the labelled duration of protection for the vaccine. An animal is considered unvaccinated if it does not have documented proof of receiving an initial rabies vaccination at least 14 days prior to rabies exposure. An animal is considered previously vaccinated but out of date if it has been administered one or more doses of a licensed rabies vaccine in accordance with the labelled directions, but when the expos ure occurs after the labelled duration of protection for the vaccine. 5.3.1. Exposed animal is currently vaccinated (up -to-date) For domestic animal exposures assessed by the veterinarian to pose a risk of rabies transmission and in which the exposed dom estic animal is currently vaccinated, the private veterinarian should provide a rabies booster vaccination to the exposed animal within a 7 day window of the exposure event . No further action is required. In cases where a rabies booster vaccination is n ot administered within 7 days, a booster vaccination should still be administered as soon as possible after the exposure event. The private veterinarian, together with the PHV, will make decisions about further actions (e.g. need for isolation and observat ion) on a case- by-case basis based on the exposure event and age, health status and vaccination history of the exposed domestic animal. In most cases, an animal that is currently vaccinated at the time of exposure will not require isolation, even if admini stration of the post -exposure booster vaccination is delayed until after 7 days. The decision to recommend isolation and observation is not without impacts on pet owners and animals, and, as such , should be based on a careful risk assessment. As the risk of rabies transmission from wild animals to domestic animals is very low in BC, there was consensus on the expert panel drafting the BC guidelines that recommending isolation in fully vaccinated animals (including those that did not receive a booster withi n 7 days) was unnecessarily restrictive and might lead to decreased uptake of prophylactic rabies vaccination, as well as create a disincentive to reporting potential animal rabies exposures . BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 13 For currently vaccinated animals, the main purpose of administering a rabies vaccination booster is to reduce the risk associated with a possible previous vaccine failure. Licensed vaccines must show protection of 88% of vaccinates in a challenge trial that kills 80% of controls. The rabies vaccine failure rate (tit re <0.5 IU/ml) has been reported to be 0.01 to 8% ( Berndtsson 2011, Kennedy 2007 ). A secondary purpose is to stimulate protective immunity in animals with partial but inadequate response to previous vaccinations. This reasoning is based on general vaccine theory, and there is no supporting evidence specific to licensed rabies vaccines in animals. Finally, there is evidence that in exposed animals that do go on to develop rabies, post -exposure rabies vaccination may reduce the incubation period and hasten death, and therefore serve to decrease the chance of an animal that is incubating rabies being lost to follow up ( Wilson 2010 , Hanlon 2002, Wilson 2001 ). For currently vaccinated animals exposed to rabies, there is no evidence to support a specific minimum interval from recent previous vaccination to administering a booster vac cination, therefore this decision will need to be made on a case- by-case basis. 5.3.2. Exposed animal is vaccinated but out -of-date For animal exposures assessed to pose a risk of rabies transmission and in which the exposed domestic animal has been prev iously vaccinated, but out of date, the private veterinarian should: 1. Administer a rabies booster vaccination to the exposed domestic animal within 7 days of the exposure event . In cases where a booster vaccination is not administered within 7 days, a boos ter vaccination should still be administered as soon as possible after the exposure event. 2. If the suspect animal (e.g. the bat) is available, offer to have it tested. If testing is agreed upon, the private veterinarian coordinates the suspect animal's euthanasia (if required) ( Appendix D), sampling (if required), packaging and shipment to the CFIA Rabies Laboratory in Lethbridge, Alberta ( Appendices C and E). a. If the suspect animal tests negative, no further steps are recommended. b. If the suspect animal is unavailable or tests positive, the private veterinarian, together with the PHV, will make decisions about further actions (e.g. isolation and observation) on a case- by-case basis bas ed on the exposure event and age, health status and vaccination history of the exposed domestic animal. i. When the exposed animal is administered a booster vaccination within 7 days, no isolation and observation period is necessary . ii. In cases where a booste r vaccination is not administered within 7 days, the private veterinarian, together with the PHV, will make decisions about further actions (e.g. need for isolation and observation) on a case by case basis. A 90-day isolation and observation period would be required in most cases . For previously vaccinated, but out -of-date animals, the main purpose of administering a rabies vaccination booster is to generate an anamnestic response and stimulate protective immunity. There is evidence that most animals that are previously vaccinated, but out of date, develop an antibody titre >0.5 IU/ml by day 15 after being administered BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 14 a booster and that the response is not inferior to currently vaccinated animals ( Moore 2015 ). There is also evidence that in exposed animals that do go on to develop rabies, post-exposure rabies vaccination may reduce incubation times and hasten death, and therefore serve to decrease the chance of an animal that is incubating rabies from being lost to foll ow up ( Wilson 2010, Hanlon 2002 , Wilson 2001). 5.3.3. Exposed animal is u nvaccinated (never vaccinated) For animal exposures assessed to pose a risk of rabies transmission and in which the exposed domestic animal is unvaccinated, the private veterinarian should: 1. Administer a rabies vaccination to the exposed domestic animal within a 7 -day window of the exposure event. In cases where a vaccinat ion is not administered within 7 days, a vaccination should still be administered as soon as possible after the exposure event. Note: In some cases, the unvaccinated, exposed animal may be a puppy or kitten under the vaccine manufacturer's recommended age for vaccination. In these cases, the veterinarian may consider administering the vaccine to the puppy or kitten (\"off-label use\"), with re- vaccination once the animal has reached the age indicated by the vaccine manufacturer. 2. If the suspect animal (e.g. the bat) is available, offer to have it tested. If testing is agreed upon, the private veterinarian coordinates the suspect animal's euthanasia (if required) ( Appendi x D ), sampling (if required), packaging and ship ment to the CFIA Rabies Laboratory in Lethbridge, Alberta ( Appendices C and E). a. If the suspect animal tests negative, no further steps are recommended. b. If the suspect animal is unavailable or tests positive, the private veterinarian will recommend: i. that the owner isolate and observe the domestic animal on the owner's property AND for the owner to consult their veterinarian immediately if the animal exhibits changes in behavior or health that indicate signs of rabies (Appendix F ). The recommended isolation and observation period is: 90 days for animals that receive a rabies vaccination within 7 days of the exposure event, 180 days for animals that do not receive a rabies vaccination, or that received a rabies vaccination more than 7 days after the exposure event . Note: If there is any concern that the owner will not comply with the conditions of isolation and quarantine, then the veterinarian should inform the public health veterinarian ( publichealthvet@bccdc.ca ) and/or the local health authority (see contact information in Appendix A ). BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 15 OR ii. euthanasia of the exposed domestic animal. For unvaccinated animals, the main purpose of administering a rabies vaccination is to stimulate protective immunity for both the immediate exposure event, and potential future exposure events. There is equivocal evidence that vaccination soon after rabies exposure may decrease the likelihood of developing clinical rabies ( Wilson 2010 , Murray 2009, Leslie 2001 ). There is evidence that in exposed animals that do go on to develop rabies, post -exposure rabies vaccination may reduce incubation times and hasten death, and therefore serve to decrease the chance of an animal that is incubating rabies from being erroneously rel eased from isolation ( Wilson 2010, Hanlon 2002 , Wilson 2001 ). A 180 -day observation period for unvaccinated pets exposed to rabid or suspect rabid animals has been the precedent and is based on the maximum reasonable incubation period for rabies in a dog or cat ( Murray 2001 ). A 90 day isolation period for pets being administered a rabies vaccination is based on evidence that shows that in exposed animals that do go on to develop rabies, vaccination immediately after exposure may shorten the incubation period ( Wilson 2010 , Hanlon 2002, Wilson 2001). (See Section 4.0) 5.4. Domestic animal bites Dog bites are not provincially reportable in BC. The situations listed below have been identified as elevated risk for rabies transmission. A veterinarian should immediately inform the local public health authorities if they are aware that a person has been bitten/scratched by a domestic animal in the following circumstances: the animal is exhibiting clinical signs compat ible with rabies at the time of the bite/scratch; or the animal was imported from or travelled out of BC in the preceding 6 months; or the animal has been known to have had contact with a bat in the preceding 6 months; or the animal is not available for assessment and management (e.g. stray or feral). In these situations, the public health authorities will assess the rabies risk and determine what actions are required, if any. Possible actions include the implementation of a 10 -day observation period, eut hanasia and testing of the animal and/or administration of rabies post -exposure prophylaxis to the exposed individual. The rationale for the 10- day observation period is that rabies virus is excreted in a rabid animal's (dogs, cats, ferrets) saliva for a f ew days prior to and during illness. If the animal is clinically well after 10 days, it was not shedding rabies virus and is deemed non-infectious at the time of the exposure and can be releas ed from isolation and observation (see Section 4.0 ). BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 16 See Appendix A for contact information, and the public health veterinarian is available at publichealthvet@bccdc.ca for consultation as required. 6.0 COM MUNICATION WITH CLIENTS Messages addressing the risk of disease in both animals and humans should include the following information, also found in the section below on Communication resources and in Appendix F : Epizoology and species of animal(s) which carry or could be affected by rabies. How to avoid risk of exposure: o Receive pre- exposure immunization if in a high risk occupation or area. o Vaccinate pets. o Avoid physical contact with suspect animals. What to do in the event of exposure: o First aid. o Seek medical attention, including rabies post -exposure prophylaxis. Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 17 7.0 WORKPLACE SAFETY Veterinary practice facilities that employ workers are required to be compliant with the WorkSafe BC Occupational Health and Safety Regulations. The OH&S Regulation requires that a risk assessment be conducted by the employer to determine if there is a potential for occupational exposure (to a biological agent) by any route of transmission and that workers be appropriately protected. WorkSafeBC has published the reference document \" Exposure Control Plan for Rabies Virus in Veterinary Practices .\" This document states \"All staff who are at low, moderate, or high risk of rabies exposure (as determined by a risk assessment) will be offered the pre-exposure rabies vaccination at the employer's expense. Any staff members who refuse to be vaccinated will be given work that will not expose them to potentially rabid animals\". As part of the risk assessment, recommendations from appropriate sources, such as the BCCDC, must be considered. Veterinarians can consult their local public health authority or the BC Communicable Disease Control Manual for further adv ice. The BCCDC recommends veterinarians and their staff receive an initial series of rabies pre- exposure prophylaxis vaccination. A booster is only required following a rabies exposure. No serological testing is required, unless the worker is considered at moderate or high risk. If a decision is made to not provide veterinary staff with rabies vaccine, the employer should be able to provide a written rationale regarding their decision not to adopt the recommendations. Rabies vaccine can be purchased from, and administered in most travel clinics. Veterinary staff may discuss with their physician the need to be immunized against rabies and the possibility of an adverse reaction. It is noted that vaccination of all staff at risk against rabies may be a signif icant cost to the employer. BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 18 8.0 REFERENCES BCCDC.

The CVO shares these reports of zoonotic diseases in animals with the Provincial Health Officer (PHO) under an Information Sharing Agreement. The PHO shares the information with the BCCDC and with the Medical Health Officer (MHO) in the Health Authority of residence of the client. On occasion, a practice facility may be contacted by a BC MHO who is seeking to obtain information in a client's medical recor d. Public health authorities are responsible for assessing and protecting public health. They prevent, investigate and control infectious diseases (e.g. outbreaks), environmental health risks (e.g. toxic chemical spill), chronic diseases (e.g. cancer), a mong others. Medical Health Officers and Environmental Health Officers in BC have statutory authority under the Public Health Act to request and obtain any information necessary from anyone who may have it to help them investigate a potential human health hazard or infectious disease. Most such information is reported by laboratories, physicians and patients to Medical Health Officers. In some instances, veterinarians may have animal health information that could help public health authorities assess a publ ic health risk. The circumstances under which a practice facility may disclosure information in a client's record is provided in the CVBC Bylaws, Part 4 - Ethics and Standards, s. 249, Access to information (see end of article). Specifically, s. 249 (4) (b) permits disclosure of information about an animal's health under certain conditions, including to a Medical Health Officer or Environmental Health Officer. The practice facility designated registrant has the responsibility to determine whether the person representing themselves as a Medical Health Officer or an Environmental Health Officer is legitimate and that their request meets the requirements of the bylaws, s. 249 (4) (b). Public health authorities have the responsibility to ensure confidentialit y of the information provided to them. CVBC Bylaws, s. 249, Access to information: Access to information 249(1) In this section, \" access\" includes the opportunity to examine or obtain a copy of a client personal information or medical information as recorded in a medical record. (2) A registrant must allow a client access to their own personal information or their animal's medical information, except if there is a reasonable likelihood that such access may result in serious harm to a patient, client or a third person. (3) A registrant must respond in a timely fashion to a client's request for access to their own personal information or medical information, by providing (a) full access to the records, or BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 24 (b) written reasons for the refusal to provide full access to the records. (4) Despite the above, a registrant must provide full access to client personal information or medical information or provide a copy of a medical record to: (a) any party that has an urgent and compelling need for the information in order to ensure the well -being of an animal; (b) any party that has an urgent and compelling need for the information in order to ensure the health or safety of the general public or a particular person; (c) the college for the purpose administering the Act or bylaws; (d) a government agency or its designate, as required or authorized by law; (e) a party on the basis of a court order or subpoena. BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 25 Appendix C: Instructions for Shipment of a Rabies Specimen to the CFIA Rabies Laboratory Planning (prior to a n exposure event) Review CFIA guidance and review module 2 on sample collection and submission to the CFIA rabies packaging samples for rabies testing https://www.canadianveterinarians.net/veterinary -resources/practice- tools/rabies - guidance/ Order gloves and packing supplies include bags, boxes, labels, freezer packs and absorbent material Store freezer packs in freezer Preprint shipping labels As app ropriate, ensure staff have training in Transportation of Dangerous Goods (TDG) (http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/tdg/training -menu- 266.htm ). Who pays for Rabies testing? Rabies diagnostic testing is covered by the CFIA Rabies laboratory. However the shipping costs are the responsibility of the submitter. o In cases of animal exposure to a potentially rabid animal, the cost of shipping the specimen to the laboratory is the responsibility of the animal owner. o In some circumstances, public health may cover the shipping cost (e.g. human exposure where testing is recommended by public health). Who can submit a sample to the CFIA Rabies Laboratory ? Public health professionals or animal health professionals w ho are fulling their duty to respond to rabies exposures can submit samples to the CFIA Rabies laboratory Members of the public should be dissuaded from submitting samples directly to the lab as samples may be submitted incorrectly and inappropriate report ing of results may occur For animal only exposures, members of the public should be directed to take the specimen to a veterinarian For human exposures, members of the public should follow the instructions of their local health authority Rabies testing i s available on weekends and holidays for any samples that meet the established submission criteria and are identified to the laboratory in advance of weekend or holiday. Weekend or holiday testing only occurs at the CFIA's Ottawa Laboratory - Fallowfield. If requiring weekend or holiday testing, contact the Ottawa lab at cfia.rabieseast -rageest.acia@canada.ca or at 343 -212-0340 during regular business hours. Note: CFIA rabies laboratory staff at both the Lethbridge or Ottawa labs do not carry cell phones on Friday evenings, Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, or evenings prior to a federal holiday. BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 26 Preparation (w hen a specimen needs to be submitted) Follow the CFIA information sheet \" Rabies Testing at the CFIA: Packaging of Samples \". Ensure animal is dead and sample is suitable6: o For most animals: Submit entire head ( Appendix E). Include cervical spinal cord if the skull has been damaged, e.g. shot in the head. o For small animals (<500g): Submit the entire carcass to aid species identification (e.g. bats). o For large animals (>100 kg) and all livestock: Submit the entire brain and portion of the cervical spinal cord (Appendix E ). If entire brain cannot be submitted, collect portions of the brain tissue bilaterally from the cerebellum, hippocampus and brain stem. Ensure proper protective equipment is worn when collection the sample (i.e. disposable waterproof gloves, disposable mask, safety glasses or goggles, and coveralls and/or waterproof apron). Keep animal/sample in fridge prior to packaging. Avoid freezing the specimen as it may delay testing . Sample preparation DOs DON'Ts Ensure that animals are dead before packaging Spray with insecticide, if infested with ticks or fleas Remove maggots Remove any needles or darts Make level cuts duri ng disarticulation Leave the head intact and do not remove skin, ears or snout Note quills, jagged bone fragments, possible bullets or shot on the submission form in \"Submitter Comments\" Remove excess bags, or ones that are opaque, before packaging Use abs orbent material, such as newsprint, between primary and secondary package, and as cushioning in the outer container Ship sample as soon as possible after collection Wrap brain with absorbent material or place into whirl -pak bags Use gel sachets as absorbent material Use wet ice, frozen water bottles, soft gel packs or dry ice for cooling sample Use Styrofoam or other granular packing material 6 Test sensitivity is decreased for decomposing samples. Samples exhibiting decomposition should still be submitted for testing following a suspected human/dom estic animal rabies exposure - it may still be possible to get a definiti ve positive result. BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 27 Temperature conditions Samples should be refrigerated, not frozen. Use ice packs to keep the sample cool during shipping according to outdoor temperature: o Winter (< 5 oC): DO NOT use ice packs. o Fall/Spring (5 -30oC): USE ice packs. o Summer (>30oC): USE additional ice packs. Completing the online Rabies Sample Submission form 7 The CFIA rabies submission form must be submitted electronically Each sample needs its own Rabies Sample Submission form Refer to the CFIA information sheet https://www.canadianveterinarians.net/media/b5ydbrzp/completing -the- electronic -submission -form.pdf The CFIA here: http://www.inspection.gc.ca/DAM/DAM -aboutcfia- sujetacia/STAGING/text- texte/c2908V1_re_1396296694437_eng.pdf Accessing the form: o You must have Adobe Reader version 9 or higher.

See contact information in Appendix A . Packaging Keep the sample in a refrigerator prior to packaging. Freezing should be avoided as it may delay testing. If the sample is already frozen, ship it without ice packs Primary packaging: o Place the specimen in the first bag /container and close tightly. If possible, use two knots OR us e a zipper bag and fold over and seal with tape to make leak-proof. Ideally, extracted brain tissue or bats should be placed into a screw -cap, leak -proof container. o Place first bag/container into a second bag and close tightly (tie knot OR zipper bag and f old over and seal with tape to make leak -proof Attach a label with the Sample ID to the primary packaging Wrapped the primary package in absorbent material such as newspaper. Secondary packaging: o Place the primary package into a single bag and close tightl y (for air transport, this bag must be pressure compliant) o Secure completed rabies sample submission form to the secondary package with tape Outer shipping container : o Place bagged specimen into a shipping box and add absorbent material and rigid ice packs (in spring, summer and fall) to e nsure the specimen remains cool for at least 48 hours o Add additional cushioning materials as needed o Seal box securely o Apply labels (see below) BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 29 YOUR COMPLETE NAME YOUR EMPLOYER YOUR STREET ADDRESS CITY, PROVINCE, POSTAL CODE YOUR PHONE NUMBER CFIA LETHBRIDGE LABORATORY (ADRI) (403) 382- 5559 Labeling Addressee and shipper info needs to be on the box. Label box with shipping type: Biological substance, Category B or Exempt animal specimen If \"Biological Substance, Category B\", apply both of the following labels to box: Type of sample for shipping is determined on a case- by-case basis 8 Most samples will be \"exempt animal specimens\": animal specimens not believed to contain infectious substances. If there is a very high likelihood of rabies, the sample should be considered \"biological substance, Category B\": animal specimen believed to contain infectious substances. 8 Based on expert opinion (21), a decision on type of sample should be made on a case- by-case basis. There are risk s and operational issues to consider. The type of sample affects labelling and courier selection but does not affect pa ckaging; packaging should always follow TDG standards. The risk of transmission from a packaged specimen is deemed very low; if exposure did occ ur, effective RPEP is available. Most samples submitted from BC for rabies testing are not infectious (only 3- 10% of submitted BC animals test positive). In other settings, diagnostic specimens are shipped using the Exempt category. Occasionally, the suspicion of rabies is high enough to warrant Biological Substance labelling and transportation. Operational consider ations include whether the available courier can transport Biological Substances and whether TDG training and annual certification is feasible. More information can be found: https://www.tc.gc.ca/media/documents/tdg- eng/TDG_BULLETIN___SHIPPING_INFECTIOUS_SUBSTANCES.pdf BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 30 Shipping Specimens can be shipped by courier (e.g. Purolator, Fedex), air, bus or medical laboratory transport. Verify that the shipper can deliver to the CFIA Rabies Lab within 48 hours . If submitting over the weekend or during holidays, verify that the shipper delivers during weekends and holidays. If shipping an exempt animal substance, the shipper's waybill should indicate \"Exempt Animal Substance\". If using Transportation of Dangerous Goods, verify that the shipper ac cepts infectious substances. The shipper's waybill should indicate \"Biological Substance Category B UN3373\" and the shipper should be TDG certified. BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 31 Appendix D: Bat capture and euthanasia Advice for the public about bat capture In situations where a bat is acting strangely but there has been no human or domestic animal contact, do not attempt to capture the bat. Further advice, resources and professional assistance can be accessed by contacting the BC Community Bat Program at http://www.bcbats.ca . Do not encourage someone who was not exposed to try and capture the bat, thus increasing their risk of exposure, since an attempt to capture a bat may increase the risk of direct contact. If a person is already exposed and is willing, they should : Close all doors and windows in the area, put on a hat, leather gloves, a long - sleeved jacket and pants; Use a blanket, net, broom or towel to catch the bat (without touching it and while protecting any exposed area such as the face); Use tongs to put it in a container with air holes; Place the container in a cool, safe place away from human or pet contact; Not kill the bat; Bring the bat to the private veterinarian for euthanasia, packaging and shipping; Dispose of or disinfect and wash any tools/surfaces that had contact with the bat in a 10% bleach solution; and Wash clothing in hot, soapy water and dry in a hot dryer. Advice for veterinarians about bat euthanasia For instruction on euthanasia of bats see BC Ministry of Forests, Lands , Natural Resource Operations , and Rural Development Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Bat -health- documents/bat_euthanasia_sop_may_2023.pdf Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 32 Appendix E: Removing he ad and extraction of a brain for rabies testing Sample selection For most domestic small animals including dogs and cats: Submit entire head Include cervical spinal cord if the skull has been damaged, e.g. shot in the head For very small animals such as bats (<500g): Submit the entire carcass to aid species identification For large animals (>100 kg) including all domestic large animals: Submit the entire brain and portion of the cervical spinal cord If entire brain can not be submitted, collect portions of the brain tissue bilaterally from the cerebellum, hippocampus and brain stem Procedure Purpose Submit a good specimen that will allow for accurate testing Prevent human infection Supplies Sharp knife and sharpener Optional - sharp hacksaw, dehorner, lopping shears, pruning shears, or brush cutters Protective clothing: o Waterproof gloves (disposable) o Mask (disposable) o Safety glasses or goggles o Coveralls and/or waterproof apron Cleaning Supplies: o Detergent o Disinfectant o Paper towels o Plastic tras h bags Collecting the sample (Figure A) These methods are suggestions where submission of a whole carcass is impractical. Use the technique with which you are most familiar and feel most comfortable. Removal of the head (Fig. A): Used for domestic smal l and large animals Lay animal on its back and extend the head by pushing top of nose toward ground or bend neck back over edge of table. Locate the larynx. Immediately caudal to the larynx (see example that follows), using a sharp knife, make an incision through the skin and continue cutting down through the trachea and esophagus to the backbone. Identify the membrane covering the spinal cord between the first vertebrae (atlas) and the skull (occipital bone). The joint made by these two bones can be visualized and palpated as the animal's head is flexed and extended. BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 33 Disarticulate the atlanto- occipital joint. It is possible to dissect the ligaments connecting this joint, but probably easier and faster to hyperextend the head and manually tear the ligament s. You will hear and feel a snap when this is accomplished. After disarticulation of the atlanto- occipital joint, the remaining muscle and skin can be cut with a knife to completely free the head from the body. Some individuals may prefer to cut through the vertebra instead of disarticulating the joint. After cutting down to the backbone, use shears or a hacksaw to cut through the first vertebra. DO NOT use an axe, hatchet or power saw because of the danger created by flying debris. Identify and package each animal individually as per previous instructions. Extraction of a brain: Used for domestic large animals Secure head with dorsal aspect upright. A vice may be helpful for this. Skin head from neck to snout across the cranium. Make 3 cuts with a chis el or hand- saw such that they penetrate full depth of the cranium, and intersect above the eyes (Fig. B). Pry the cut piece of cranium free from the underlying brain. Extract the brain and spinal cord immediately distal to the brain stem (Fig. C). Clean u p Instruments and contaminated surfaces should be washed with detergent and water, and disinfected with a virucidal solution such as clorox (100 ppm), alcohol (40- 70% ethanol), iodine (25 ppm), or quaternary ammonium (200 ppm) compounds. The body of the animal should be incinerated or properly disposed of according to local guidelines and regulations. Figure A: Diagram showing positioning of domestic animal cadaver for removal of head for submission for rabies testing BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 34 Figure B: Diagram show ing location of cuts required to open cranium for removal of brain (large animal rabies suspect) Figure C: Areas of brain (medulla oblongata and brain stem) most critical for rabies testing BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 35 Appendix F: Recommendations for animal isolation and obser vation by owners of a domestic animal that has been exposed to a rabid or potentially rabid animal The private veterinarian should provide the following information to the owner of an unvaccinated or vaccinated but out -of-date domestic animal that has bee n exposed to a potentially rabid animal that is either unavailable for testing or tests positive. The exposed animal should be isolated and observed for the period of time recommended by the veterinarian in accordance with these guidelines. There is a ris k of zoonotic transmission of rabies should their animal be infected. o The incubation period (from initial exposure to clinical symptoms) may range from two weeks to many months. It is important to note that they may be able to transmit the disease up to 10 days before showing clinical signs (see Section 4.0 ). Isolation and observation scenarios may include: Pet exposed to an animal that tested positive for rabies Pet exposed to a potentially rabid animal and owner decli ned to submit the specimen for testing (no human contact) Pet exposed to a potentially rabid animal and specimen was not available for testing. If the private veterinarian does not think that the owner will comply with the recommendations for observation and there is a high risk exposure (e.g. pet was exposed to an animal that tested positive for rabies) or there is an imminent public health risk, the private veterinarian should consult the BCCDC public health veterinarian (PHV) at publichealthvet@bccdc.ca . The PHV will conduct a risk assessment including a possible discussion with the client. If the PHV feels there is a public health risk that cannot be mitigated, the PHV will inform the relevant Health Auth ority for further assessment and management. Provide owners with a take- home copy of the information below: \"Instructions for Owners: Isolation and observation protocols after rabies exposure in a pet\". BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 36 Instructions for Owners: Isolation and observa tion protocols after rabies exposure in a pet Your pet may have been exposed to the rabies virus. Rabies is a very serious disease that can be transmitted between animals, and from animals to people, through bites and/or scratches. The virus infects the brain and nervous system of animals. It is fatal for unvaccinated animals, and also in humans unless preventive treatment is taken immediately after exposure. It is very important that you follow the protocol described below in order to protect the heal th of people and animals that might come into contact with your pet. The isolation period is 3- 6 months (depending on your pet's vaccination status) because rabies can take this long to become apparent following exposure. Your pet is only at risk of transmitting rabies if it is showing signs of the disease or up to 10 days before it shows signs of rabies . Contact your veterinarian immediately if there is any change in your pet's behaviour or if you observe other signs consistent with rabies. Dogs, cats and ferrets with rabies may show a variety of signs including lethargy, nervousness, loss of appetite, excitement, wanting to be alone, fearfulness, aggression, excessive drooling, difficulty swallowing, staggering and seizures. Isolation and observation protocols after rabies exposure in a pet : Identify an age- appropriate person(s) to be responsible for the pet during the observation period. Vaccinate all pets against rabies as soon as possible, recommended within 7 days of the exposure event. Confine al l pets indoors - in your residence only - and observe it for a period of ___ months , ending on ______________ ( fill in date ). o If a cat, this includes moving your cat's litter box indoors. o If a dog, keep the dog on -leash/harness and under the control of t he identified -responsible person when taking it outside to go to the bathroom. Close all windows that are not completely screened and seal any openings your pet may use to gain access to the outdoors. Secure your pet in a room with the door shut or in a pet carrier when you are opening a door to areas not within your residence (i.e. outside or a hallway in an apartment building). Limit potential exposures to any visitors to your home by securing your pet in a room with the door closed or within a pet carr ier while visitors are present. It is not recommended to acquire any additional pets during this confinement and observation period, and you are not to permit pets of others to have access to your pet. Should you need to have your pet cared for by someone other than yourself, either make arrangements for your pet to be boarded at your veterinarian or care is to be provided in your home. Inform any other person caring for your pet temporarily that your pet has been exposed to rabies and the conditions o f the observation. They should also be informed of their personal risk, of what signs and symptoms they should watch for in your pet and to whom they should report any changes in your pet's behaviour. Keep a list of any person(s) that is/are exposed to y our pet either while caring for it, or through accidental exposure. Make your pet available for observation/assessment by your veterinarian or public health official periodically upon request. BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 37 Appendix G : Clinical Presentation in Humans a nd Epidemiol ogy This section is included for background knowledge only. Veterinarians are advised to direct anyone with questions about human rabies to speak directly with their physician or local public health authority (see contact information in Appendix A ). Clinical description: The first signs of illness are non- specific and include fever, anxiety, and malaise. Often there is tingling and severe pruritus at the site of the animal bite. After 2 - 10 days, frank neurological signs appear, r anging from hyperactivity to paralysis. The disease is and paralytic (\"dumb rabies\") forms: signs of irritation of the CNS predominate, including agitation, confusion, hydrophobia, aer ophobia, hyperventilation, hypersalivation, priapism, and convulsions. After a few days to a week, the person may experience a stage of excitement that lasts only a few days before the person lapses into coma and death. The paralytic form of rabies differ s in that the person does not experience a stage of excitement, but retreats steadily and quietly downhill, with some paralysis, to coma and death. Once the virus enters the nervous system, treatment rarely affects the rapid progression to death. In 2004 , a teenager who had not received RPEP developed rabies disease but survived following aggressive treatment ( Willoughby 2005 ). This is the only known instance of survival following disease. Incubation period: After inoculation, the virus may persist and replicate at the inoculation site for hours to weeks before progressing to nerve endings at the site of the bite. As the virus does not travel through the bloodstream or lymph system, it does not readily induce an immune r esponse prior to entering the nerves. Once the virus enters the nerves, it is virtually impossible to treat it. The virus slowly travels up the nerves to reach the CNS where it replicates and then disseminates through nerves to many body sites including the cornea, hair follicles, and salivary glands where there is further replication. The incubation period is usually 3 - 8 weeks, rarely as short as a few days or as long as several years. The length of the incubation period depends on the severity of the wound, site of the wound in relation to the richness of the nerve supply and its distance from the brain, and the amount and strain of virus introduced ( Heymann 2008 ). Infectious agent: The rabies virus is a rhabdovirus belonging to the genus Lyssavirus. Mode of transmission: Infection occurs by percutaneous introduction of the virus -laden saliva or CFS of a rabid animal through a bite or scratch, or into a fresh break in the skin, or by contact with intact mucous membranes. Transmission has been reported through the transplantation of organs taken from persons who died of undiagnosed rabies. Also, wild animals may bite and infect domestic animals which in turn may infect humans. BC Rabies Guidance for Veterinarians August 2023 Page 38 Airborne transmission has been reported in 2 instances in a laboratory setting, where there was significant aerosolization and possible lack of personal protection. Also, there have been 2 reports of rabies acquired in a bat infested cave attributed to aerosol transmission, but there is no proof in either case that a bite or wound contamination did not occur ( Irons 1957, Humphrey 1960 ). No well -documented natural transmission of rabies by aerosols has occurred ( Gibbons 2001 ). Human epidemiology: In Canada, there have been 26 human cases reported since 1924 and 3 of these occurred in BC. Among them, a 25 year old male, Alberta resident was infected by a bat while in Alberta and died in BC in 1 983, a 60 year old male BC resident was infected by bat variant rabies virus in BC and died in 2003 and a 21 year old male BC resident was infected following bat exposure in BC and died in 2019.
