This protocol provides members with some practical approaches to community ev ent planning and implementation. DESCRIPTION OFPOLICY Displays include presentations of printed or other visual material to members of the public, in a place normally frequented by the public, by a person or persons who are physically present when such material is distributed or presented. They do not include signage, billboards, or other forms of visual adv ertising that do not ordinar - ily require that the person adv ertising be physically present. Public display is a type of community service that includes educational sessions and/or public health screenings. These public ev ents are used to encourage and promote chiropractic in a positiv e and professional manner . An educational session is a liv e communication to a group, organization or the public at large. This may include a formal lecture, informal discussion or presenta - tion. Professional accountability is imperativ e as these sessions are usually per - formed in the absence of formal ev aluations. Apublic health screening is an assessment procedure to identify possible chiropractic/health concerns that may require attention. Members may only perform a screening assessment on willing participants. Members may conduct a public display/health screening only at the following events - health fairs and trade shows.

Public health screenings that stress the importance of prev entativ e health strategies are used in health professions and are widely recognized to promote public health. Public displays and public health screenings are of v alue to the public because they may identify early signs of potential health problems and educate the public about chiropractic. They can be used to help build a stronger chiropractic presence in the professional and public communities. These ev ents are intended to promote chiropractic as a legitimate, safe and effectiv e health care choice. Set-up/Present ation All aspects of public displays/health screenings will be ev aluated by the participating public and other professions and, for that reason, must remain professional. Signs, communication, marketing material, and professional appearance are all important factors to consider when planning the set-up and deliv ery of a public display/health screening. Signs should state the purpose and intent of the ev ent (e.g., chiropractic talks, spinal ev aluation, postural ev aluation, etc.). Members may hav e signage listing their affiliation with groups, societies or associations, provided that the affiliated group officially recognizes the ev ent. CCO requires notification, in writing , informing of a public display/health screening at least 10 business days prior to the ev ent. The notification must include the names of participating member(s) and the ev ent's date, time and location. Chiropractic Represent ation CCO requires that at least one licensed member be present at a public display/ health screening at all times.

Participation must be v oluntary . For the purpose of the public display protocol, \"fully informed\" means the participant understands that the purpose of the screening is not to diagnose but to screen him/her for potential problems that may require further inv estigation in a formal office setting. Amember must provide the participant with a description and explanation of the purpose of the screening procedure. Prior to performing any assessment procedure, a member shall obtain consent that is: fully informed; v oluntarily giv en; related to the patient' s condition and circumstances; not obtained through fraud or misrepresentation; and evidenced in written form and signed by the participant or otherwise documented in the patient health record. Amember shall: advise the participant that he/she may withdraw his/her consent at any time; offer the participant the option of having the assessment performed in a priv ate area (e.g., separated or sectioned off with a curtain); and perform a screening in compliance with the current priv acy legislation. Amember shall not: disrobe or gown any participant at a public display/health screening; use a method of assessment that uncov ers, shifts or alters a participant' s clothing (e.g., shirts, slacks, dresses, etc.) in a w ay that w ould be construed as disrespectful, embarrassing and/or inappropriate; and perform therapeutic interv entions, e.g., soft tissue therapy or massage, stretching, mobilizations, manipulation or adjustment (manual/instrumented).POLICY P-016Public Display Protocol 3College of Chiropractors of Ont arioAmembers is reminded: if a fee is charged for the screening procedure, the fee must be disclosed to the participant before the service is provided; to comply with section 4 of Standard of Practice S-016: Adv ertising; to be sensitiv e to the fact that he/she may be screening a participant who is already receiving chiropractic care; and to not compare their services to any other chiropractor , directly or indirectly .
