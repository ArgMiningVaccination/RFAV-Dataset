Chinese herbs are unique in that there are more than 2500 years of documented clinical uses of these herbs for a myriad of illnesses. The ancient Chinese were meticulous in their investigating and documenting of the effects of herbs and what herbs work best together.

How are Herbs Prescribed It is important to take Chinese herbs as prescribed by a qualified herbalist or acupuncturist. Most Chinese herbs are very safe, but they must be used properly to maximize their benefits and to be safe for patients to take. In East Asian Medicine, herbs are prescribed \"holistically,\" meaning that all factors such as disease/ condition, symptoms, and previous health history are all taken into account when deciding which herbs are appropriate. Further, herbs are combined together into complex formulas- this helps to prevent adverse reactions and side effects, as different active ingredients in the herbs counter-balance each other. At Skamania Acupuncture Clinic, Chinese herbs are prescribed in granular formulas. Traditionally, herbs were cooked together to make a tea. In modern times, to expedite the process, large, industrial batches of herbs are cooked together, then freeze dried into concentrated powders (\"granulars\"). Using traditional examination and diagnosis, a granular formula is constructed based on each individual patient's needs- CUSTOM HERBAL FORMULAS!

Are Chinese herbs safe? It depends. Chinese herbs from reputable sources are safe. Herbs should only be prescribed by qualified herbalists or acupuncturists. Just because an herb has been linked to a specific health benefit does not mean that anybody can take that herb. At Skamania Acupuncture Clinic, we only prescribe herbs from reputable companies that obtain their herbs from Asian sources that meet organic standards and are free of harmful pesticides and heavy metals. The herbs that you can buy in a store does not necessarily come from a reputable source, and there is no guarantee that the product you are buying contains a therapeutic level of the herbal substance. To take Chinese herbs safely, it is important to obtain your herbs from a qualified herbalist using the best quality ingredients.

If you have a chronic, degenerative illness, herbs might be necessary for a long term. The length of treatment with herbs, just like acupuncture, is dependent on your health history and what we are trying to accomplish with treatment. While you may take herbs for a long time, many beneficial effects of the herbal formulas are noticeable in a few days after starting to take them.
