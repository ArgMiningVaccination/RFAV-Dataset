Especially for those who are trying to balance a life full of work, family, home, school and social obligations. It can drain your energy if you don't give yourself a break once in a while. Now imagine not having enough energy to complete even the most basic tasks, such as getting out of bed, or taking a shower. Then imagine feeling like this for weeks or months on end. This is how it feels for those with chronic fatigue syndrome, a debilitating illness that affects up to 24 million people worldwide. Oftentimes this affliction seriously affects an individuals quality of life, and influences everything from career to personal relationships. Extreme exhaustion and physical pain can make it difficult to live a normal life, which can take a toll on mental and emotional health. Unfortunately, extreme fatigue is not the only significant symptom in these individuals. Other physical ailments commonly associated with chronic fatigue syndrome are not only profound and long-lasting, but the symptoms and their severity may fluctuate daily and manifest differently from person to person. These symptoms are what make this disabling illness a [syndrome](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/syndrome) which is defined as \"a group of signs and symptoms that occur together and characterize a particular abnormality or condition.\" Some common symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome include: As you can see, chronic fatigue syndrome is a multi-piece puzzle that affects all areas of the body's physical and mental wellbeing. This is why [Integrative](/content/integrative-medicine) Medicine is best suited l in the diagnosis and treatment of those with chronic fatigue syndrome. To understand and successfully treat this syndrome we have to treat the basis of the fatigue - which is mitochondrial dysfunction. Our mitochondria are the powerhouse of our cells and are responsible for almost all of the body's energy production. When the mitochondria are functioning abnormally, an energy crisis is created. Mitochondrial dysfunction is triggered when the body's energy needs exceed the body's ability to produce energy. This scenario can be likened to an overloaded circuit breaker blowing a fuse. Your body is the same, and loss of functioning mitochondria can trip your body's energy breaker. Finding and treating the source of this mitochondrial dysfunction is the number one objective in Integrative Medicine. The underlying cause for mitochondrial dysfunction can be that the body is overwhelmed by toxic exposure and/or inflammation. This can be further exacerbated by other factors such as: hormonal imbalance, nutritional deficiencies, immune dysfunction, unresolved infections, and other physical or situational stressors. Chronic fatigue syndrome is a multi-piece puzzle that affects all areas of the body's physical and mental wellbeing. Integrative medicine uses a holistic approach to treat chronic conditions. Meaning that treatment focuses on all aspects of a person's health and lifestyle, not just the treatment of individual symptoms. If you or someone that you know has been suffering through chronic fatigue syndrome, treatment with integrative medicine therapies can help to find the underlying cause of your condition.
