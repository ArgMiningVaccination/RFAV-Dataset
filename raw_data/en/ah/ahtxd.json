Appliance suppliers are subject to different remuneration arrangements but must follow the same procedures to become an NHS contractor by applying for entry to an NHS Board's pharmaceutical list, and thereby are subject to the same terms of service as detailed in regulations. However, they are not subject to any formal standards or quality assurance in the way that pharmacists are bound by Royal Pharmaceutical Society requirements. Capitation General Dental Services for those patients aged under 18. There is a requirement for a dentist to secure and maintain oral health and to provide a treatment plan and emergency cover. Continuing Care General Dental Services for those patients aged 18 and over. There is a requirement for a dentist to secure and maintain oral health and to provide a treatment plan and emergency cover. Dental Officer There is a legal duty to ensure that dental treatment in the NHS is carried out to a satisfactory standard and that any treatment carried out is actually necessary. Patients are randomly selected and invited to attend an examination by a Dental Officer, who is a qualified and experienced dentist, to achieve this. A patient's own dentist is informed when the patient is selected. Dental Sub-Contract Each Dentist has a contract which permits them to provide dental services with a separate sub-contract for every practice in which they work. Dispensing Opticians Dispensing opticians do not test eyes for glasses but make up, fit and sell glasses or contact lenses from the optometrists' prescriptions. They follow a three or four year course to qualify. Dispensing Patients These are patients to whom dispensing doctors are permitted to dispense drugs either at the Health Centre, Branch Surgeries or in the patients' homes. Dispensing Practices & Doctors Dispensing doctor practices usually exist in remote areas where the population density is considered too low to support a pharmacy or areas where there is sufficient need identified. Dispensing Doctors may dispense drugs to dispensing patients. The number of these is on the decline in Northern Ireland. Practices & Doctors receive extra fees for providing this service. Domiciliary Visits These are for those patients who require treatment but are unable to leave their residence due to illness or disability and thus are visited in their home by the relevant practitioner. Forms (General Ophthalmic Services) These are forms completed by Ophthalmic Practitioners for services rendered (e.g.: sight tests; domiciliary visits). If a patient is entitled to free or subsidised eye care, they must present evidence of this to the practitioner who will then submit a claim form for the services provided which is signed by both the practitioner and the patient for the processing of payment. GlossaryGlobal Sum Weighted Lists The Department bases its figures on a Weighted List Registered population for the allocation of resources under the new General Medical Services Contract as agreed with the BMA. This is intended to be a more accurate reflection (rather than simple headcount) of the service provided where figures are based on the list registered population per GP weighted for factors that influence relative need. The 6 key determinants of practice workload used for weighting are: gender & age; additional needs due to morbidity & mortality; newly registered patients who generate more workload in the first year; patients in nursing and residential homes who generate longer consultations, partly due to travel time; costs of delivering services in rural areas and costs of living via a Market Forces Factor (MMF). List Size Number of patients registered to a practitioner or practice. Ophthalmic Medical Practitioner (OMP) A registered medical practitioner with a qualification in ophthalmology who is employed to work in the premises of an optometrist to carry out medical eye examinations and prescribe glasses. In order to work as an ophthalmic medical practitioner a doctor must be on the Central List of the Ophthalmic Qualifications Committee. This is a statutory list that is administered by the British Medical Association. OMPs are often trainees who work to supplement their income. Optometrist (Ophthalmic Optician) Optometrists (historically known as ophthalmic opticians) are health professionals who test eyes for defects in sight and prescribe and fit glasses or contact lenses as required. They examine eyes for disease and also general health problems and refer to the general medical practitioner or hospital eye service if necessary. Optometrists study for 3 years at university followed by a year of supervised training and professional examinations with the College of Optometrists. They must be registered with the General Optical Council to practice and are governed by the Opticians Act. The majority of optometrists work in a community setting but some work in Hospital Eye departments and often specialise in paediatrics, contact lenses, low vision and sports vision. Net Ingredient Cost In Pharmaceutical Services in Northern Ireland the Net Ingredient Cost is the cost of medicines AFTER discounts. In England and Wales it refers to the cost of the drug BEFORE discounts and does not include any dispensing costs or fees. It does not include any adjustment for income obtained where a prescription charge is paid at the time the prescription is dispensed or where the patient has purchased a pre-payment certificate. Pharmaceutical Receipts Payments in lieu of prescription charges received from patients for Pharmaceutical Services. Population Figures Throughout this document this refers to NISRA 2003 Mid-Year Estimates for Northern Ireland. Quality Preparation Payment This a payment under the terms of the new GMS Contract which came into effect on 1st April, 2004 for entering the quality and outcomes framework and was guaranteed to all practices in 2003/04. Implementing the quality framework will take time for practices. In recognition of this, substantial quality preparation payments will be made in 2003/04, 2004/05 and 2005/06. These payments are not conditional on achievement but they will enable practices to collect initial data to establish their current position in the framework. This will assist them in determining their aspiration for achievement in the following year. These will be made on a practice weighted population basis using the Carr-Hill formula. The payment amounts to an average of \u00a39,000 per practice in each of the three years and is paid at the beginning of the financial year. Vouchers (General Ophthalmic Services) Vouchers towards the cost of glasses or contact lenses are available to those who qualify (e.g. under 16s, people in receipt of income support...). A patient should mention their entitlement to their optician before the glasses/contact lenses are made and will be given a claim form to complete. Applications should be made before treatment is sought on a form available from Social Security Offices / Jobs & Benefits Offices. 6061 Abbreviations A&E Accident and Emergency BNF British National Formulary CSA Central Services Agency DFP Department of Finance and Personnel FPS Family Practitioner Services GP General Practitioner MIU Minor Injuries Unit NI Northern Ireland NIC Net Ingredient Cost NISRA Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency SLA Service Level Agreement UPE Unrestricted Principal and Equivalent WTE Whole Time Equivalent Tel: 028 9032 4431 and ask for the Department of the Service you require.
