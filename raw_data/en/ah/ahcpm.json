Our body is made up of many cells. Healthy cells follow the \"rules\" when they divide and they know when to die. Cancer happens when cells start to grow out of control. When these cells grow and divide, they can form a lump called a tumour. Not all tumours are cancer. Some are non-cancerous (also called benign ). It might help to use the example of a garden: Cancer cellsGood cellsA Healthy Body Imagine your body as a garden. The soil is your immune system, the good plants are your good cells, and the weeds are the cancer cells. When you're healthy, the good plants grow and the soil helps keep the weeds away. When the odd weed starts to grow, the body is able to get rid of it by itself. Cancer cellsGood cells A Body with Cancer Cancer cells are like weeds in your garden. Sometimes the body cannot get rid of the weeds and needs help. Just Diagnosed Types of Systemic Cancer Treatments A Healthy cells dividing: Normal CellsCancer CellsJust Diagnosed 4 Systemic Cancer Treatments There are different types of systemic cancer treatments including: chemotherapy, targeted therapy, hormone therapy and immunotherapy. This book deals with chemotherapy, targeted therapy and hormone therapy. Systemic treatment is any medication that travels through your body in the bloodstream to find, damage and destroy cancer cells. This medication can also reach and affect healthy cells in your body. Systemic treatment can be used alone or combined with other treatments. It can be given by IV (intravenous), injection or in pill form (orally). Types of systemic treatment include: Cancer cellsGood cells Targeted Therapy Weeds are directly sprayed with weed killer. Good plants may still be damaged. (page 9 ). Cancer cellsGood cellsChemotherapy Chemotherapy is like spraying a weed killer on the whole garden. The goal is to kill the weeds, but sometimes some of the healthy plants are also affected (page 11) Cancer cellsGood cellsHormone Therapy (Endocrine Treatment) Hormone therapy is like spreading mulch on the garden. The mulch blocks the sunlight and air that the weeds need to grow. It also helps stop more seeds from taking root. (page 13 ) Find out about all types of cancer treatment in the Newly Diagnosed With Cancer Book The Immunotherapy. Book gives detailed information about that form of systemic treatment 5 Just Diagnosed What are the goals of systemic treatment? The goals for systemic treatment are different for everyone and can change over time. The 3 goals for treatment are to: Become cancer-free \u2014 to get rid of the cancer from your body Get control \u2014 to stop the cancer from growing and spreading to other parts of your body Relieve or reduce symptoms the cancer may cause such as pain, or shortness of breath How are treatment decisions made? You and your health care team will talk about your treatment options together. The options depend on the type of cancer you have and where it is in your body. Research has shown us which treatments work best for different types of cancer. Other things we look at include your overall health, if you had treatment before, and what you would like to do. Terrie's Tip ~ cancer survivor: \"Feel secure and cared for in the treatment plan that has been created with you.\" Things You May Want to Know About Your Treatment B The Basics of Systemic Treatment Write down the goals you make with your oncologist here: You can use the free AHS My Care Conversations app to prepare for your next appointment and to record conversations with your health care team. You can listen to your recordings at home and share with family or trusted friends. Download it from the App Store or Google Play. Just Diagnosed 6 Consenting to treatment Your Medical Oncologist (cancer doctor) may recommend systemic treatment as part of your cancer treatment, but you need to decide if you want to have the treatment. To help make your decision, you need to know the: Goals for treatment Risks and benefits to getting the treatment Other possible treatment options other than systemic treatment Possible outcomes if you do not have treatment How will I get my systemic treatment? Systemic treatment can be given many ways. You may get: An IV (intravenous) \u2014 the medication is put directly into a vein. Most patients get a temporary IV inserted and at the end of the treatment appointment, the IV is taken out. A central line. This is inserted into a vein and stays in until you no longer need treatment. Your doctor will prescribe this for you if needed. Pill form, either tablets or capsules or sometimes a liquid that you swallow by mouth. These are called oral medications. A needle \u2014 the medication is injected into a muscle or just under the skin. How often will I get my treatment? Every treatment is different. Some people may: Get all of their medications in 1 day Come for several days in a row, or on different days. They may get different medications each day Get their medications continuously as an outpatient or inpatient How long will my treatment appointments be? Each treatment is different. Some treatments take a few minutes, while others can take several hours. Your nurse will tell you how long your treatment will take. Preparing you for the treatment takes time, so you will be at the treatment appointment longer than just the amount of time it takes to give you the medication.Before the nurse starts your treatment, or even after treatment has started, you can say stop at any point if you have concerns. If the nurse has any concerns, he or she may also stop the treatment. We want you to feel safe. Common Questions Outpatient means you get your treatment without being admitted to the hospital. Inpatient means that you're admitted to the hospital to get your treatment. 7 Just Diagnosed How often will I get my treatment? In general, treatments are given in cycles. This allows the treatment to attack the cancer cells and then gives your body time to recover from the treatment and side effects before you move on to the next cycle. Your doctor will recommend the number of cycles you need. Can I take other medications or supplements when I'm on systemic treatment ? Tell your doctor about any other pills, injections, or medicines you take, including vitamins, or herbal remedies. Some systemic treatments do not mix well with other medications and they may make the treatment less effective, and some can make the side effects worse. Tell your health care team if you have any changes to your medications. (See page 57 ) Your treatment cycle starts The treatment attacks the cancer cellsRest period - lets your body heal before your next treatment For medication lists and tools, go to: www.myhealth.alberta.ca and search \"medication tools\" Systemic treatment may be a single drug or a combination of drugs. Either way, the systemic treatment is considered a \"protocol \" or \"regimen .\" Where will I go to get my systemic treatment? It will depend on the type of treatment you get. Most patients go to their local cancer centre. After your treatment is done, you can usually go back home or to work and continue with your day. Some systemic treatments take several hours and a nurse needs to monitor you. In these cases, you would be admitted to the hospital for your treatment. Some patients have a pump they take home. The medication inside the pump slowly infuses (flows) into your vein for a day or several days.After you leave your appointment, if you notice pain, redness or swelling in the arm that received the treatment, call the contact numbers your health care team gave you. Is systemic treatment painful? There is usually no pain other than a needle prick at the start. Sometimes your vein may get irritated or discoloured. If you feel any burning, redness or swelling while you get your treatment, tell your nurse right away.Just Diagnosed 8 Pregnancy If you think you are pregnant talk to your medical oncologist before you start your treatments. Systemic treatments can affect the unborn baby. Both men and women should use some form of birth control before and during treatments. Ask your oncologist when it would be safe to try to become pregnant or father a child after treatment. There are 17 cancer centres in Alberta. Depending on where you live, you may be able to receive some or all treatment or support services closer to home. For example, some patients start their chemotherapy in Calgary or Edmonton, and complete it at a cancer centre closer to home. Talk to your doctor or clinic nurse at your next visit to see if this is an option for you. Care Closer to Home How often will I get my treatment? In general, treatments are given in cycles.

This target may be inside the cancer cell or on the outside of the cancer cell. The drug acts like a key and can only fit into a specific lock on the cancer cell. The key blocks messages that tell the cancer cells when to grow, divide and spread to other areas of the body. There are many types of targeted therapies and each work on different targets of the cancer cell. Why was this treatment chosen? Targeted therapy medications will only work on cancer cells that have the target. Your cancer cells were checked in the lab to see if they have the targets the drug can attach to. How do the side effects happen? Sometimes the targets on cancer cells are the same targets found on healthy cells. Side effects happen when the treatment blocks messages for the healthy cells to grow and divide. Each medication has different side effects. Your health care team will review the possible side effects with you.Targeted Therapy C Targeted therapy (key) Cancer Cell The target or \"lock\" (receptor) The \"key\" fits into the lock and blocks messages to the cancer cell.Cancer Cell Cancer cell dies For more information about targeted therapy, visit: bit.ly/targetedtherapy As soon as you notice any changes or side effects, let your health care team know.

It's used to destroy cancer cells or to prevent new cancer cells. It is also known as \"chemo.\" How do the side effects happen? Chemotherapy works on the fast dividing cells in our bodies. Cancer cells divide quickly, but so do some of the healthy cells in our body. The parts of the body that include fast dividing cells are: hair skin nails blood reproductive cells - sperm and eggs gastrointestinal tract \u2014 mouth, throat, stomach and intestines Chemotherapy cannot tell the difference between cancer cells and healthy cells, so side effects can happen when the chemotherapy attacks the healthy cells. Side effects are usually temporary \u2014 your health care team will explain what side effects you may have. There are some great medications available to help manage or prevent the side effects.Chemotherapy D Chemotherapy finds the cancer cells and attacks them, or keeps them from dividing and making more.

These hormones are made in different parts of our body. Some cancers use these hormones to tell the cancer cells to make more cells. Hormonal treatment blocks the messages from reaching the cancer cells or stops the hormones from being made in the body. This type of treatment does not work on all cancers. What are the side effects for hormonal treatment? There are side effects with hormonal treatment, but they will depend on the type of hormonal treatment used. The medication teaching sheets your health care team gives you will have more information on what to expect. Women may have: Fatigue Headaches Memory problems Weight gain Menopausal symptoms - hot flashes, sweating, and decreased sex drive Mood swings, depression Bone and joint problems Constipation, diarrhea, or nausea Hair thinning Increased risk for developing a blood clot Men may have: Fatigue Problems with getting an erection Weight gain Mood swings, depression Pain Hot flashes and sweating Bone problems Increased risk of having a heart attack Memory problemsHormone Therapy E Cancer cellHormone The hormones tell the cancer cells to make more cancer cells.

Check your appointment slip to see if there are any special instructions and to check your appointment time Pick up your anti-nausea medications or other pre-medications from your local pharmacy Have your questions ready, secure your ride, confirm who is coming with you \u2014 you might not feel up to driving yourself home Food : Eat a meal - your body needs nutrition and you will feel much better if you have something in your stomach Medications: Take your regular medications as you normally would, unless you were told not to Take your anti-nausea medications or \"pre-meds\" as instructed (some may need to be taken during your appointment) Bring all your medications to your appointment What to bring: Money or a way to pay for food or parking. You can also bring food to your appointment This book if you have any questions about the information Identification and your health care card A book or an electronic device (tablet/iPad) to help pass the time Questions you have written down to ask your health care team All your medications In Treatment The Day Before Your Appointment Drink 2-3 glasses of water more than you normally do the day before your appointment. Drinking water helps \"plump up\" your veins making them easier to find, and may mean less pokes when you get your bloodwork done or an IV started. Your Treatment Appointment F The Day Of Your Appointment Wear comfortable clothes Do not schedule other activities or appointments for the first treatment day 15 In Treatment Can I bring family or friends to my appointment? Family and friends are important but we have limited space. If you plan to bring more than 1 person, check with your health care team before your appointment to see if there are any limits with how many people you can bring. Can I bring children? We recommend that children 15 years of age or younger should not come for safety reasons. If you have difficulty getting childcare, call your cancer centre and ask to speak with a social worker to see what resources are available in your community. Continue to take your anti-nausea medications as directed by your health care team Follow any special directions your health care team gave you Keep track of how you feel using your symptom tracker (Keeping Track of Your Symptoms) Call your cancer centre if you have any questions or concerns Carry a current list of your medications. Some medications do not work well with other medications and can affect your treatment. Your health care team can review your list to make sure this does not happen. Let your health care team know if your medications change, including those prescribed outside of the cancer centre, such as from your family doctor.For more information, check \"Your Systemic Treatment Appointment\" pamphlet that came with this booklet. After Your Appointment Information about Your Medications G Keep a Medication List Keep your list up to date Share your list with your health care providers at your appointments Know what time of day you take each medication, how much (dose) and how often Make sure you understand your medications and how to take them safely If you need refills on prescriptions not related to your cancer treatment (such as high blood pressure pills, or allergy medications), talk to your family doctor . In Treatment 16 What do I put on my medication list? Anything prescribed for you such as: Pills Liquids Patches Inhalers Eye/ear/nose drops Creams, lotions, and ointments Samples of medicationAnything you buy over the counter, such as: Pain killers Cold medications Laxatives Vitamins, supplements, or minerals Others: Homeopathic, natural, or herbal remedies Any recreational drugs, such as alcohol or marijuana (cannabis) The pharmacy at your cancer centre only provides cancer treatment medications. You need to pick up all other medications at your local pharmacy like those that treat or prevent nausea, hypersensitivity or allergic reactions, or pain medications. Remember to tell the pharmacist and health care team if you have any allergies to medications. We also want to know what kind of reaction you had \u2014 was it a rash, or did you have difficulty breathing? If you are taking systemic treatment at home that is oral (pills or tablets) or you inject with a needle: Take them how and when you have been directed Review the \"Safety at Home\" section (page 17 ) Call your cancer centre pharmacy for refills at least 2 business days (48 hours) before you need to pick them up Call at least 2 weeks ahead if you need your refills mailed to you Pharmacy Services at Your Cancer Centre You can find information and resources to help you learn more. https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Alberta/Pages/know-your-medications.aspx Do not stop or change the dose of any medication unless you talk with your doctor. Take only the medications that have been prescribed or approved for you. If you have any questions or concerns, about any medications, talk to your health care team or a pharmacist. Tell your health care team if you have any allergies to medications. 17 In Treatment Most systemic treatments (page 5) are very strong medications, so there are some special things you or your caregiver need to do to keep you and the people (and pets) around you safe. Why do I need to be careful at home? Systemic treatments leave your body through fluids and wastes like urine, stool or vomit. When people or pets come in contact with affected waste or fluids, it can be harmful and they could also get side effects. Generally, it can take up to 48 hours for systemic treatments to leave your body. It's important to follow these safety precautions while you are taking your treatment and for 48 hours after you finish your treatment. Some treatments stay in your system longer than 48 hours. Ask your health care provider if this applies to you. Is it safe to have contact with others when I am taking these treatments? Yes. Being with your loved ones is important. Eating together, enjoying favourite activities, hugging and kissing are all safe. Is it safe to be sexually active? Most often, yes. There may be some medication in vaginal fluid and semen up to 48 hours after treatment, so use a condom to keep you and your partner safe. If you need to do this longer than 48 hours, your nurse will tell you. You and your partner should also avoid getting pregnant during treatment. How do I handle my body fluids or wastes? Using the toilet: It is safe to use the same toilet (septic or city sewage) as other people Men should sit when using the toilet to avoid urine from splashing Flush the toilet 2 times (with the lid down) after you use it Wash any skin that touched urine or stool Wash your hands well with soap and water Use your own hand towel or paper towel if possible Clean any waste on the toilet with soap and water including the lid and handleIf you do not have control of your bladder or bowels: Use a plastic-backed pad, diaper or sheet that's disposable to absorb urine or stool Change the diaper or pad as soon as it gets soiled Wash any skin that comes in contact with the urine or stool with soap and water Wear disposable gloves when you handle the waste If you have an ostomy: You or your caregiver should wear disposable gloves when you empty or change the bags Wash your hands with soap and water after you remove your glovesSafety at Home H If you are worried about whether or not you can have children after treatment. Go to page 34 Handling Body Fluids and Waste at Home In Treatment 18 If you vomit (throw up): Try to vomit in the toilet if possible for easier clean up. Flush the toilet 2 times (with the lid down) after you use it. If you use a bucket to vomit in: Wear gloves when you empty the bucket Wash the bucket with soap and water after each use Wash your hands with soap and water after you remove your glovesIf you use a bedpan, urinal or commode: Wear gloves when you empty it Wash it with soap and water after each use Wash your hands with soap and water after you remove your gloves What if my body wastes spill? Always wear disposable gloves Use paper towels, toilet paper or disposable absorbent pads to soak up as much of the spill as possible Wash the area well with soap and water 3 times. Put all of the materials in a bag and doublebag. Tie tightly. What do I do with soiled laundry? Wear disposable gloves when handling the soiled laundry Wash them separately from other clothes and linens Wash through 2 complete washing machine cycles before you wear or use them again What do I do with the garbage? Anything that may have come in contact with your body fluids must be handled with care. Wear gloves when you handle anything soiled. Put things you cannot flush down the toilet in a garbage bag, and tie it tightly . Put this bag in a second garbage bag. Remove and throw away your gloves into the second garbage bag also. Tie it tightly. Wash your hands well with soap and water. Once the garbage is double-bagged, you can throw it out with your regular garbage. Keep garbage out of reach of children and pets.Disposable nitrile gloves offer the best protection when you're handling body fluids and waste. You can buy them at your local pharmacy. 19 In Treatment You may need to take some of your treatment at home \u2014 this could be in the form of an injection, pills, or maybe liquids. Whatever the form, you need to make sure you know how to handle them safely, and what to do if some of it spills. Oral systemic treatments (taken by mouth, pill form) You may get systemic treatments that you'll need to take by mouth (oral). It's important that you and your caregiver handle these medications safely. Pour the oral medication into a medication cup or the lid of the pill bottle to pour into the patient's mouth. Wash the cup with soap and water If you do not have a medication cup, wear displosable gloves Always wash your hands with soap and water after you are done To stay safe: Do not chew, cut, crush or dissolve your medication unless you have spoken to the cancer centre pharmacist first. If the pills or capsules are damaged, do not breathe in the particles. If you accidentally get some in your eyes or nose, see page 20 for what to do. If you like to use pill boxes to help you remember when to take your medications, you will need to use one just for your cancer medications. If you notice the pill box or pill vial has powder inside it from the cancer medications breaking, call your cancer centre pharmacist on how to handle it. Do not throw the medications into your garbage. If you have any extra oral medications, bring them back to your cancer centre pharmacy for proper disposal. Most local pharmacies are not able to dispose of cancer medications. Injection systemic treatments You may need to inject the treatments into a muscle or under the skin using a needle If you use a needle for your medications, you will get instructions from your nurse or pharmacist on how to safely handle the injection Wash your hands with soap and water after you're done Put all used cancer medication supplies such as syringes, tubes, cassettes, vials and bottles in a hard plastic container like a bleach or pop bottle and return them to your cancer centreHandling Cancer Medications at Home If you are pregnant or breast feeding, do not handle systemic treatment medications. Can I travel with my systemic medications? Yes, you can travel with them, but check with your pharmacist or health care team for more information. Sometimes you need to make special arrangements. For example, some medications need to be stored in the fridge. When you travel, always seal the medications in a plastic bag. If you are flying, keep your medications in: their original containers your carry-on luggage so you always have them with you In Treatment 20 The spill came in contact with:What you can do: My eyes Wash your eyes under running water for at least 10 to 15 minutes. Keep your eyes open when you do this. Get medical attention right away. My skin Wash the area with soap and running water for at least 10 to 15 minutes. Tell your health care team as soon as possible. My clothes or linens Wear disposable gloves Wash your hands with soap and water after removing your gloves Wash them separately from other clothes and linens Wash through 2 complete washing machine cycles before you wear or use them again. A surface like the floor or table Put on disposable gloves. If it's a liquid, absorb the spill using a paper towel before wiping up. Wash the area well with soap and water 3 times. Put all of the materials in a bag and doublebag. Tie tightly. Paper materials (for example Kleenex, books, magazines) If you spill medicine on paper items you cannot clean, add them to the bag of garbage. If you have a special pump for your treatment, use the spill kit the cancer centre gave you to clean up any spills from the pump.Handling Systemic Treatment Spills at HomeFor more information: https://bit.ly/cleaningupspills A spill is not just a liquid \u2014 it could be the powder from a tablet cut in half or a broken capsule. 21 Possible Side Effects How does systemic treatment cause side effects? Systemic treatment adds the chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or hormone therapy to the bloodstream, which travels around the body. While it works to attack the cancer cells, sometimes it affects the healthy cells too and this is what causes side effects. This section will talk about some of the common side effects that can happen and what you can do about them. When will the side effects happen? Side effects can happen anytime during treatment. You should know what side effects are possible so you can recognize them. Always talk to your health care team if you notice anything different. If I have to go to the emergency room, what information is important? If you ever have to go to the emergency room: tell the triage nurse what type of treatment you are on and the name of the medication. if you have a fever, make sure you give your emergency letter to the triage nurse. It tells the health care providers what tests and treatment to start. Possible Side Effects Side effects are different for everybody. You may get a lot of side effects, or just a few. Sometimes the side effects may be severe, or you might not notice them at all. Possible Side Effects 22 Blood is made up different cells, but the most important are the white blood cells, platelets and red blood cells. Chemotherapy and targeted therapy can affect the blood cells, and can cause you to have low blood counts from days 7-14 after your treatment. Your blood count will start to slowly increase 2 weeks after your treatment. If your blood counts become too low, you may need a blood transfusion. This may decrease the side effects you get with low blood counts. Platelets and red blood cells can be transfused but white blood cells cannot. Low Blood Counts Red blood cellsBlood Plasma White blood cellsPlateletsBlood is made up of:Recognizing and Managing Your Side Effects I Remember low blood counts are: temporary side effects from a drug or drugs you are getting to treat your cancer most patients' blood counts will start to improve with time once the drug effects wear off around 14 days after you received it You'll get a blood test 1 or 2 days before each treatment (or more often if needed) to check and see if your blood counts have increased enough to give you your next treatment. 23 Possible Side Effects White Blood Cells White blood cells help your body fight off infection. There are many different types of white blood cells but the ones we watch closely are called neutrophils. They help fight infection in your body. If your neutrophils are low, you will not be able to fight infection as easily. What are the signs and symptoms of a low neutrophil count? A high temperature may be the first or only sign of a possible infection. Infections can be serious so make sure you remember to monitor your temperature. Fever: A temperature of 38.3\u00b0C/100.9\u00b0F or higher at any time OR A temperature of 38.0\u00b0C/100.4\u00b0F to 38.2 (100.8\u00b0F) for at least 1 hour Chills or shakesInfection: areas of redness or tenderness sore throat mouth sores productive cough itching or burning in the genital area pain or burning when you pee the need to pee oftenYour neutrophil count should be at its lowest 7 to 14 days after treatment. If your body's neutrophil count is too low, your treatment may be delayed so your body can heal first. To get more information on how to prevent and manage symptoms of fever and infection. Go to page 25 Tell your health care team right away or go to your nearest emergency centre if you have any of the above signs or symptoms of fever or infection. Red blood cells Red blood cells have a very important job to do in your body. They carry the oxygen around your body to keep it working. The red blood cells also carry carbon dioxide to your lungs so when you breathe out, it gets rid of that waste.Tell your health care team if you have any of these symptoms. If your red blood cell count is low, you may: feel more tired than usual (fatigue) become short of breath with minimal activity look pale feel cold feel dizzy become irritablePossible Side Effects 24 Here are a few tips you can do to manage these symptoms: Eat a healthy diet to help your body heal itself (see page 54) To get up from a lying flat position, sit up slowly and take a minute for your body to adjust, then stand up slowly. This may help with dizziness Take rest periods Do not try to do too much \u2014 listen to what your body is telling you Try to build in regular walks as you are able. Adjust your walking pace and distance based on how you feel \u2014 more brisk, further distances on days when you feel best, and slower, shorter walks when you have less energy Platelets Platelets help to clot blood or stop the bleeding when you cut yourself. If your platelet count is low: you may have bruises on your body or small purple spots called petechiae (p-tea-key-eye) your nose and gums may bleed more easily you may have blood in your urine or stool To get more information on how to prevent and manage symptoms of fatigue. Go to page 33 If you notice any of these symptoms, let your health care team know right away. 25 Possible Side Effects Some systemic treatments can put you at risk for developing an infection, and a fever may be the first or only sign of an infection. Infections can be life-threatening and need to be taken seriously. What are the signs and symptoms? Why does it happen? Some systemic treatments can lower your blood counts. One type of blood cell that treatment can affect are your white blood cells (see page 23), which help fight infection. What can I do to monitor it? You must have a thermometer at home when you are on systemic treatment. Use this to monitor your temperature as directed by your clinic nurse, or whenever you feel unwell. Do not take any medications that help lower your temperature. Some medications, such as acetaminophen or Aspirin\u00ae (A.S.A.), or ibuprofen can hide a fever. If you need to take a medication that contains this product, talk to your health care team first. Fever A fever is a temperature of: 38.3\u00b0C/100.9\u00b0F or higher at any time OR 38.0\u00b0C/100.4\u00b0F to 38.2 (100.8\u00b0F) for at least 1 hour We recommend a digital thermometer because they give you an accurate temperature reading quickly. Carry your emergency letter with you, or take a picture of it with your phone so you always have it with you. If you have a fever, call your health care team right away, or go to your nearest emergency centre. Remember to take your emergency letter with you to give to the health care team. Possible Side Effects 26 Here is a partial list of these medications: 282 or 292 Tablets What can I do to help prevent infection? Cleaning your hands removes or kills germs so you do not spread them to yourself or other people. This is the most important thing you, your family and friends can do to protect you from infection. Clean your hands: after you cough, sneeze or blow your nose when you can see your hands are dirty or soiled after you use the bathroom before you prepare or eat food, or feed someone after you have contact with blood or body fluids when you enter and leave a health care facility To clean your hands, use one of the following: Soap and water use plain soap and water do not use anti-microbial soap wash and lather the soap for 15 seconds scrub fingertips, between the fingers, back of the hands and wrists rinse well use soap and water when you can see or feel that your hands are dirty , or you are vomiting or have diarrhea Hand sanitizer make sure it has an alcohol base to be the most effective in killing germs contains skin softeners, so it is gentler on your hands than soap and water rub the sanitizer over all the surfaces of your hands, including fingertips, in between the fingers, the back of hands and wrists. Use enough to keep your hands wet for 15-20 seconds to help kill all the germsThere are many other things that may lower your temperature like cold and flu medications, and cough syrup. This is not a complete list, so always check with your pharmacist to see if a medication you are buying contains A.S.A., acetaminophen or ibuprofen. 27 Possible Side Effects Other things that will help prevent infection: Avoid sick people and crowds, influenza or other infections Ask your doctor if you should have seasonal or routine vaccines Bathe or shower daily Keep your lips moist Keep your skin moist and healthy \u2014 use non-perfumed lotions Wear sunscreen if outside \u2014 we recommend SPF 50 or higher Use an extra soft toothbrush to brush your teeth and keep your mouth clean Clean your dentures with a toothbrush nightly Do not empty the cat litter box \u2014 bacteria from the waste could increase risk of infection Avoid being scratched by an animal Wear gloves when gardening Keep wounds/scratches clean and dressed Practice good respiratory hygiene: Cover your cough and sneezes with a tissue Sneeze or cough into your sleeve if you don't have a tissue Clean your hands often Avoid eating meats or fish that are raw or not cooked properly Wash all fruits and vegetables before you eat them Possible Side Effects 28 A poor appetite that lasts longer than a few days can lead to a loss of weight, muscle and strength. You also will not have the nutrition your body needs to heal and repair itself to fight the cancer. Things that can cause you to lose your appetite: Changes to how your body breaks down your food and uses it for energy Advanced cancer A buildup of fluid in the abdomen (ascites) that may make you feel full Other medications, such as medications to treat pain These side effects from cancer treatment can also decrease your appetite: Nausea and vomiting (see page 41 ) Dry mouth Difficulty chewing Constipation (see page 31 ) Fatigue (see page 33 ) Mouth sores and mouth pain (see page 39 ) Difficulty swallowing Changes in taste and smell Pain (see page 43 ) Depression (see page 50 ) What can I do to maintain or improve my appetite? Try new foods and drinks to find flavours that taste good to you. Make a list of foods you like. Eat them often, even if you eat the same foods over and over for awhile. Choose soft foods that need less chewing. Don't eat foods that taste bad to you. If your mouth is dry, try to increase the amount of fluids you drink to 8 cups (2 litres) each day. This will help keep your mouth moist and improve your appetite. If you have been told to limit your fluids, speak with your doctor or dietitian. Brush your teeth and tongue with a soft toothbrush before and after each meal. Wait 10-15 minutes after you brush to eat \u2014 this will help \"wake up\" your taste-buds. Try not to use tobacco products \u2014 they can make food taste bad (page 56 ).Appetite Changes If you have a poor appetite and are eating only small amounts or not eating at all, let your health care team or a dietitian know. Christine's Tip ~ cancer survivor: \"Sweet was super sweet and salty was super salty. Then I couldn't taste anything. Find foods neutral in taste when your taste buds change and go from there. When you can't taste anything it's hard but I stuck to meal times and healthy foods so I knew I was getting what I needed even if I didn't feel like chewing, never mind swallowing\". 29 Possible Side Effects What are the signs and symptoms? Cuts that will not stop bleeding A nose bleed that will not stop Blood in your vomit \u2014 it can look like coffee grounds Black or bloody bowel movements Red or pink in your urine Bleeding gums Bruises but you're not sure what caused them Small purple or red spots under the skin. Dizziness, headaches, or changes in your vision Coughing up blood or blood in your saliva or phlegm Why does it happen? Some systemic treatment can cause a low platelet count and bleeding can happen when you have low platelets. What can I do to help prevent or manage the bleeding? Do not take A.S.A. (Aspirin\u00ae), any products containing A.S.A., or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen, or ibuprofen, unless you have spoken with your oncologist Blow your nose gently If you get a nose bleed, apply pressure to your nostrils. This should stop the bleeding If the bleeding does not stop after 10 minutes go to your nearest emergency centre Use an extra soft toothbrush, sponge stick or waterpic on low setting to brush your teeth Avoid flossing if you do not usually floss.

Possible Side Effects 44 It is normal to feel nervous about taking pain medications? Some people do not take pain medications because they worry about getting addicted. If you take your medication as your doctor prescribed, you should not worry . Addiction happens when a person takes medications for reasons other than pain. Side effects of pain medications: Nausea and vomiting (see page 41) Drowsiness Constipation Some people think they should save their pain medication in case the pain gets worse later. Pain should be treated early, so make sure you take the medication as prescribed. Your doctor can change your dose of pain medication, or the type of medication you take if you need. Constipation caused by pain medications will not go away on its own. You will need to take laxatives while on pain medication.
