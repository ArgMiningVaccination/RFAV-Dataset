Thomas A. Cellucci, Ph.D., MBA Chief Commercialization Officer U.S. Department of Homeland Security September 2008 Partnership Program Benefits Taxpayers as well as Private and Public Sectors SECURE Program enables the cost-e ffective and efficient de velopment of products and services for Homeland Security. Thomas A. Cellucci, Ph.D., MBA Chief Commercialization Officer Commercialization Office U.S. Department of Homeland Security A recently announced initiative at the U.S. Depart ment of Homeland Security (DHS), called the SECURE (System Efficacy through Commercialization, Utilization, Relevance and Evaluation) Program is part of an overall effort at the Department to create a \"Co mmercialization Mindset\" by leveraging the fact that while DHS has a limited budget compared to the Department of Defense, it does have something much more valuable - a large potential available ma rket comprised of the seven DHS operating components (USCIS, TSA, FE MA, CBP, ICE, U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Secret Service) and other large ancillary markets such as the dive rse, yet substantial first responder market. The SECURE Program is based on the premise that th e private sector has show n that it is willing and able to use its own money, resources, expertise an d experience to develop and produce fully developed products and services for DHS. When an attracti ve business case can be made related to large revenue/profit opportunities, which cert ainly exist at DHS and its ancill ary markets. The private sector requires two vital pieces of information from DHS: 1. detailed operational requirement(s), and 2. a conservative estimate of the potential available market(s). This information can then be used to generate a business case for possible private sector participation in a program or project. Figure 1: This Market Potential Template is used to estimate the given size of a particular market that DHS has identified as an area requiring new products or services. This Market Potential Template is used to demonstrate how large (in both a dollar and unit volume perspective) a given market is for a particular product or service. Coupled with an Operational Requirements Document (ORD), the private sector receives ample information from DHS to generate a business case for developing a product or service sought after by DHS for its operating components or first responders, whose combined ranks ar e significant, as delineated in Figure 2.

In return for providing this critical information, thus saving the private sector considerable time and money related to both market and business developm ent activities, DHS expects the private sector to offer solutions - utilizing the free market system with open and fair competition - to meet published requirements. Simply stated, the private sector r eceives significant business opportunities, DHS and its supported entities, like the first responder communities, receive produc ts and services developed at faster execution rates at the private sector's cost - all to the benefit of the American taxpayer.
