The CARD system (Comfort, Ask, Relax, Distract) incorporates evidence-based strategies to mitigate fear and pain. We examined CARD's effectiveness in reducing student fear, pain and related symptoms during school vaccinations. Methods: Randomized cluster trial in 40 Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph schools during fall 2019. Schools were randomly assigned (1:1) to CARD or control. Students reported fear, pain and dizziness scores. Nurses reported coping tools used and post-vaccination reactions. Results: 1424 of 1919 students across participating schools were vaccinated at school. Fear and pain were lower in CARD vs. control: OR 0.65 (95% CI 0.47-0.90) and OR 0.62 (95% CI 0.50- 0.77), respectively. No CARD students fainted compared to 0.8% control (p=0.02). Dizziness or post-vaccination reactions did not differ. Coping tools were used more frequently in CARD schools. Discussion: CARD reduced stress-related symptoms during school-based vaccinations. iii Acknowledgements My master's has been nothing short of fortunate. I was fortunate to fall into (and in love with) clinical pharmacology. I was fortunate enough to le arn from some very talented teachers. But most of all, I was fortunate to work with my superv isor. In fact, I feel so lucky that an alternative title for 'acknowledgements' should be 'a professio nal love letter to Dr. Anna Taddio'. It takes a lot of effort for someone to set high ex pectations for you, and then provide the mentorship that is needed so that you can meet such standards. Often when Anna and I would work together, we would go through rounds of edits. And even more often, just before I was ready to give up, Anna would say 'this is a re-iter ative process. It takes time. But it is also how you create good work.' This is exactly how I feel a bout myself reflecting on my past two years. I have gone through rounds, and rounds (and rounds!) of edits, but in turn I have become better than when I started. I am proud of what I have achi eved, but everything I have achieved is because I had a supervisor that was not afraid to h ave high expectations for me. I hope I have found the words here to express how thankful I am t o have been her student. I would be remiss if I did not thank Dr. Noni MacDo nald and Dr. Heather Boon, my advisory committee members. They shared the most valuable of insight that has challenged me, taught me, and made me a better researcher, and for this I am truly appreciative. It is also important to thank the wonderful staff o f Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph public health and each one of the 1919 students that participated in this study. Their contributions have made this work possible. Of course, I need to thank the members of the Taddi o lab. Not only were they willing to help at a moment's notice, but they also granted me the pleas ure of their company. My master's would have been filled with much less laughter without th em. Penultimately, I need to thank my family - my mom, dad, brother, babcia, dziadek, as well as my numerous aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends for th eir endless support. I cannot begin to express how much I love and appreciate them. To have a netw ork that is as strong as it is wide is not a common occurrence, and it is my greatest privilege to have been born into - and chosen - a family as selfless and loving as mine. And finally, to my gramps - Verasamy Ramsamy. I lov e you, and I miss you. I am so happy to have reached this milestone, so that I can dedicate it to you. iv Table of contents ................................................... ........ of - Introduction 1.1 Statement of the problem ...................... ................................................... ................................................... . 1 1.2 Study purpose and 1.3 Study objectives 1.4 Study hypothesis ..................................................

Students' fear, pain and stress-related responses can lead to negative vaccination experiences, negative attitudes about vaccination t hat can influence adult health seeking behaviours and outcomes, such as future vaccination avoidance 3,4. Evidence-based interventions exist to mitigate pain and fear and efforts should be made to integrate them into practice to prevent these harms of vaccination 5,6,7. 1.2 Study purpose and rationale The purpose of this study was to evaluate a multi-f aceted intervention designed to improve school-based vaccination experiences. This intervention is called the CARD system. CARD i s a framework that is used to plan and deliver vaccines in a student-centered manner. In addition to this, CARD is an acronym (C-comfort, A-ask, R-relax , D-distract) where each letter stands for a category of evidence-based coping tools that studen ts can choose from to promote student-led and individualized coping that can help make their vaccination experiences more positive 8. The CARD system is based on a clinical practice gui deline (CPG) that provides recommendations about how to mitigate fear and pain during vaccination (first created in 2010 and then updated and expanded in 2015)5,9. CPGs are the highest-level of research evidence a nd following these evidence-based recommendations is c onsidered part of good vaccination clinical practice. Additionally, CARD was developed with inp ut from student stakeholders 8. The involvement of students (who are the primary CARD u sers) is best practice as it ensures that the CARD system meets the needs of the students and inc reases the likelihood that CARD is accepted and liked by students. While the CPG on needle fear and pain management de scribes various evidence-based interventions that can be used by healthcare provid ers, it does not include a framework for how to integrate the recommendations for the mass vacci nation context, including school-based vaccinations 9. CARD is the first vaccination delivery framework to integrate the CPG recommendations into school settings and informs th is gap in knowledge 8. CARD was first used 2in Niagara, Ontario region schools as a controlled clinical trial where researchers were involved during implementation 7. In Niagara, CARD was effective in reducing studen t fear and dizziness. What is now needed is confirmatory evidence of CARD effectiveness in improving student vaccination experiences when implemented in 'real w orld' contexts. 1.3 Study objectives 1.3.1 Primary study objective To evaluate the effectiveness of CARD on reducing f ear during school-based vaccinations in a 'real world' setting. 1.3.2 Secondary study objectives 1. To determine the effectiveness of CARD on reducing pain, dizziness, fainting and post- vaccination reactions. 2. To determine the impact of CARD on students' use of coping tools during vaccinations. 3. To determine students' attitudes about CARD and vac cinations. 4. To explore issues with CARD implementation using st udent feedback and nurse-reported CARD compliance. 1.4 Study hypotheses We hypothesize that the use of the CARD system comp ared to usual care in school-based vaccination clinics will result in: (1) reduction i n stress-related responses (fear, pain, dizziness, fainting and post-vaccination reactions), (2) incre ase in the use of coping tools used by students during vaccination, and (3) more positive attitudes towards vaccinations. Additionally, we will (4) explore student feedback and nurse-reported com pliance with the CARD system to identify issues related to implementation and make recommend ations. Given the exploratory nature of (4), it is not associated with a specific hypothesi s. 3Chapter 2 - Literature review 2.1 Importance of vaccinations Vaccinations prevent more than 3 million deaths per year and are considered the most influential scientific contribution to the maintenance of publi c health 10,11 . Vaccines not only provide individual protection for those who have been vacci nated, they can also increase community immunity ('herd immunity') against infectious disea ses by reducing the likelihood of transmission between unvaccinated individuals, as v accinated individuals can interrupt the chain of human-to-human transmission. By extension, vacci nations have a huge positive economic impact, saving over 69 billion dollars each year in the United States alone by reducing the need for expensive and resource-consuming health-related procedures associated with vaccine- preventable diseases 12 . One economic analysis expanded the scope of econo mic benefit past the United States and determined that use of a 10-vacci ne program in 94 low- and middle-income countries resulted in savings of $586 billions in c osts associated with vaccine-preventable diseases 11 . Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exemplifi ed the importance of vaccination13 . In Ontario alone, most COVID-19 cases (94.8%) occ ur in unvaccinated individuals. Unvaccinated cases are also more likel y to be result in hospitalization and fatality 14 . Therefore, vaccination is critical to the reduction of global disease burden, eradication of many serious infectious diseases, the maintenance of hea lth and well-being, and a strong global economy. 2.2 School-based vaccination programs 2.2.1 History of school-based vaccination programs In 1987, the first school-based vaccination clinics began in Canada by offering Hepatitis B vaccines 15 . However, the popularization of school clinics is largely attributed to a major measles outbreak that occurred in 1989. The measles outbrea ks occurred in several regions across Canada and prompted Canadian government officials to promo te vaccination in schools to increase uptake 16 . Today, school-based vaccination programs are used in all Canadian provinces and territories for a variety of vaccines. 42.2.2 Vaccines offered in Canadian school vaccinati on programs School based vaccination program schedules vary acr oss the country. Table 1 below summarizes the various provincial/territorial vaccination sche dules as of 2021 as reported by the Government of Canada 17 . Table 1.

They also reduce socio-economic inequalities in v accine distribution as many children may not have access to health care providers and therefore vaccines offered at school increases accessibility. Vaccination rates a re higher in children participating in school programs compared to those obtaining vaccinations u sing other strategies, such as home visits or 6other community strategies 18. School-vaccination programs also positively impac t on parents' attitudes towards vaccinations 19 . Thus school-vaccination programs are an important tool for reaching many students in Canada. All Canadian scho ol-based vaccination programs have a target of vaccinating 90% of students 20 . However, uptake rates for vaccines offered at sch ools vary distinctly by province or territory and by vac cines offered. As seen in Table 2, the targeted 90% uptake rate for vaccines offered in schools is not reached in the majority of jurisdictions 17 . Table 2.

HPV: Human Papillomavirus 2.3 Fear, pain, dizziness, fainting and immunizatio n stress-related responses 7Individual factors can undermine or promote vaccine acceptance in school-based vaccination programs. Concerns about fear of needles and pain c an impact on a students' acceptance of vaccinations 35 . The rest of this section will define fear, pain a nd related stress responses. Fear, pain, dizziness, fainting and immunization stress-r elated responses are collectively referred to as 'negative symptoms' throughout the remainder of thi s thesis. 2.3.1 Definitions 2.3.1.1 Fear Fear is a proximal alarm reaction to an immediate t hreat (real or perceived). Fear is typically adaptive in dangerous situations (e.g., a bear in t he woods) but can also be maladaptive if reaction is excessive or limits functional ability (e.g., freezing rather than escaping a burning building) 3. 2.3.1.2 Pain The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defines pain as 'an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, o r resembling that associated with, actual potential tissue damage 36.' There are six key considerations about pain: 1) pain is always a personal experience that is influenced to varying d egrees by biological, psychological, and social factors; 2) pain and nociception are different phen omena. Pain cannot be inferred from activity in sensory neurons only; 3) through their life experie nces, individuals learn the concept of pain; 4) a person's report of the experience of pain should be respected; 5) pain may have adverse effects on function, social and psychological well-being an d 6) verbal description is only one of several behaviours to express pain; inability to communicat e does not negate the possibility that a human experiences pain 36 . 2.3.1.3 Dizziness Dizziness is an ambiguous term that patients often use to describe many different sensations ranging from light-headedness to the sensation of i mpending loss of consciousness37 . 2.3.1.4 Fainting 8Vasovagal syncope (otherwise known as fainting) is a loss of consciousness due to an initial increase in blood pressure and heart rate is follow ed by an over compensatory and sudden reduction in both, resulting in insufficient blood flow in the brain. Vasovagal syncope can occur before, during or shortly after (<5 min) vaccinatio n 3,38 . While fainting commonly occurs after a vaccination, a history of fainting can also precipi tate and perpetuate needle fear for future vaccination procedures 3,39,40,41,42 . 2.3.1.5 Immunization stress-related responses (ISRRs) ISRRs cover the spectrum of manifestations that ari se in response to the stress that some individuals feel when receiving an injection. This spectrum of reactions is included in adverse reactions normally monitored after vaccination refe rred to as Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFIs). The term ISRR was developed t o capture all elements of the presentation of stress-related AEFIs 43 . ISRRs encompass manifestations (signs and symptoms) including acute stress responses, hyperventilation and dissociative neurological symp tom reactions (DNSRs). Acute stress responses include fainting, and DNSRs include non-e pileptic seizures (formerly known as 'conversion reaction'). ISRRs can present before, d uring or after immunization. ISRRs may affect patients on an individual level, or in group s of individuals clustered in time/location 43 . 2.3.2 Prevalence Children have reported that receiving needles is on e of their most fear and painful experiences 44,45 . Needle fear is more prevalent in girls than boys 46 . However, fear and pain are commonly associated with school-based vaccination c linics regardless of sex 1,2 . In a study from 2011, 130 girls were interviewed about their experi ences getting the HPV vaccination in school- based clinics and fear of pain was the most frequen tly mentioned concern; fear of needle puncture was second most common 47 . In a more recent study, 277 students (50% male) w ere probed about their school vaccination experiences. When asked about 'the worst thing about getting vaccination needles,' 35% of students said pain from the needle, and the majority (59%) said fear of needles 1. Additionally, in a 2019 study, it was reported th at school-based vaccination clinics that do not provide interventions to reduce needle fear, pain, or dizziness, 31% of students 9have high fear; 10% of students have high pain and 8% of students have high dizziness 7. The prevalence of fainting is subject to wide variation due to methods of surveillance 48 . Reported rates of fainting range from 0.054/100,000 (0.00005 4%) to 88/100,000 (0.088%) 49,50 . Additionally, one study was able to determine that nearly half (45.4%) of all faints occurring after vaccination are reported for individuals betw een 10 and 19 years old, which encompasses the ages that children are vaccinated in school set tings 51 . Prevalence rates for dissociative neurological symptom reactions following immunizati on are unknown 43 . However, it was noted in 2013 that DNSRs can affect individuals in cluste rs 52 . These studies confirm that needle fear, pain and dizziness are prevalent and common concern s for students getting vaccinated at school. 2.4 Harms of unmitigated negative symptoms When pain and fear are not addressed in school sett ings, negative consequences can manifest. Some of these negative consequences are reviewed he re. 2.4.1 Mass psychogenic illness In school settings, there is evidence that when an individual's fear of needles is not addressed, it can contribute to collective distress and increased anxiety amongst clusters of students. This anxiety can lead to mass psychogenic illness 43 .Treating mass psychogenic illness symptoms typically requires cognitive-behavioural therapy, s upportive psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy 52 . Diagnosis and treatment can be a stressful experi ence for patients, especially when considering that incidence can be avoided by m itigating against needle fear. 2.4.2 Injury from fainting Fainting can lead to injury from falling. In one st udy that collected all reports of fainting submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Sy stem (VAERS) over 5 years there were 697 documented faints, 67 (9.6%) of which resulted in falls and subsequent hospitalization. All falls occurred within 15 minutes of vaccination. Fa inting-induced falls after vaccination resulted in head injuries involving skill fracture, intracra nial bleeding or cerebral contusion 51 . These cases of head trauma demonstrate that fainting can result in life-threatening injuries and permanent disability. 10 2.4.3 Risk of developing high needle fear and needl e phobia The amount of pain reported during needle procedure s tends to decrease with age 3. However, for some individuals, poorly managed needle pain can ha ve a lasting impact on their fear of needles. Repeated painful procedures in childhood without be nefit of pain treatment represents a risk factor for high needle fear. Altogether, 14% to 28 % of adults report some degree of needle fear 40,53,54,55,56 . When pain is not mitigated, individuals can becom e fearful of the pain associated with needle procedures, which can result in an esca lating relationship between pain and fear over time. For approximately 3 to 4.5% of the population , this can develop into needle phobia 57,58 . Needle phobia is a persistent and severe form of an xiety. It is maladaptive and can negatively interfere with day-to-day life. 2.4.4 Risk of negative vaccination perceptions and vaccine avoidance Unmitigated fear and pain can lead to negative atti tudes towards vaccinations. In one study, there was a 30% increase in parents' willingness to be va ccinated and a 40% increase in their willingness to have their children vaccinated again st influenza if they were able to receive vaccinations in a non-painful way 4. This study demonstrates that people view vaccines negatively because of their accompanying pain. Additionally, negative attitudes towards vaccinatio ns due to needle fear and pain can contribute to future vaccine avoidance. Several studies have documented that about 5-10% of the population declines or delays vaccinations because of fear of pain concerns 4,59,60,61,62,63 . Vaccination is critical for the maintenance of publ ic health and vaccine avoidance can contribute to the resurgence of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. 2.5 Benefits of managing vaccination-related sympto ms (pain, fear, dizziness, ISRRs) There are benefits to addressing negative symptoms during vaccinations. Some of the positive impacts from managing negative symptoms are detaile d here. 2.5.1 Reduction in symptoms 11 Mitigating pain, fear, and related vaccination reac tions (e.g., dizziness and fainting) can have multiple positive effects. Vaccine processes can co ntain several environmental cues that can increase the fear and pain individuals' experiences , such as the sight of a needle, or the pain from injection 64 . Reducing these cues can reduce the fear individua ls may feel before vaccinations and reduce the incidence of ISRRs. Prioritizing the tre atment of pain and fear during vaccine delivery can improve an individual's vaccine experience by r educing the frequency of unwanted and negative reactions. The impact of symptom reduction extends beyond individuals to the system level. Decreasing ISRRs can result in reduced deman d for health services such as emergency rooms (to treat patients that have fainted) and red uced healthcare provider time (to treat patients with reactions) 63 . This is important to emphasize as healthcare reso urces are limited. Managing pain and fear preventively can benefit healthcare s ystems by ensuring resources are readily available when needed in other circumstances. 2.5.2 Positive attitudes about vaccinations Secondly, treatment can help students to have more positive attitudes about vaccination. This will potentially translate to greater acceptance of vaccination. In our foundational research with the CARD system, students assigned to CARD (vs. con trol) were more knowledgeable about vaccinations and more willing to be vaccinated in t he future 7. Therefore, providing individuals with ways to mitigate their fear and pain can resul t in more positive perceptions of the vaccination experience and future vaccination accep tance. 2.6 How to better manage negative symptoms: A clini cal practice guideline (CPG) on needle pain management 2.6.1 Methods In 2010 a team of expert researchers, \"HELPinKIDS\" developed a clinical practice guideline (CPG) intended for all healthcare providers who vac cinate children 9. The guideline outlines evidence-based strategies that can be used to mitig ate needle pain during vaccinations. In 2015, the scope of the guideline was expanded to include adults, and the team of researchers was subsequently renamed \"HELPinKIDS&ADULTS\" 5. All members of the interdisciplinary team 12 met and delineated the scope of clinical questions that the guideline ultimately answered. In total, the team outlined 49 clinical questions. Each question was allocated into one of 5 domains o f pain management (the 5P approach): procedural, physical, pharmacological, psychologica l and process. One systematic review was completed for each of the 5 domains to synthesize t he evidence base and inform the recommendations 65,66,67,68,69,70,71 . Many included primary studies used self-reported pain as their main outcome, and therefore, mitigation strategies were determined as effective for reducing self-reported pain. However, some research did have other relevant outcomes including self- reported fear or - in the absence of self-reported measures (such as in young infants) - observer- rated distress scales were used. The guideline deve lopment process followed the AGREE II and GRADE methodologies. Recommendations were divided b y developmental stages; infants and young children ( 3 yrs.), children (3-12 yrs.), ad olescents (12-17 yrs.) and adults ( 18 yrs.)5. 2.6.2 CPG recommendations The CPG recommendations on pain management are orga nized according to the \"5P\" approach to pain management. The \"5P\" approach outlines 5 wa ys reduce patient pain: 1) procedural; 2) physical; 3) pharmacologic; 4) psychological and 5) process. The first four \"P's\" represent interventions (actions that can be taken to reduce pain) while the fifth \"P\" (process) outlines education (i.e., how to teach individuals to use th e first 4 \"P\"). Table 3 outlines the evidence- based CPG recommendations made for school-aged chil dren 5. The recommendations are also detailed below. Table 3. CPG evidence-based recommendations for sch ool-aged children CPG recommendations Procedural Vaccines should be injected in increasing pain orde r Individuals getting vaccinated can use muscle tensi on Individuals getting vaccinated can use an external cold vibrating device Physical Individuals should sit up during vaccinations Pharmacologic Individuals can use topical anesthetics before inje ction Psychological Individuals can use verbal distraction during vaccinations 13 Individuals can use video distraction during vaccinations Individuals can use music distraction during vaccinations Individuals can use toy distraction during vaccinat ions Process Education of clinicians on pain mitigation Parents should be present during their children's vaccinations (under 10 years old) Education of parents on pain mitigation Education of individuals undergoing vaccinations on pain mitigation 2.6.2.1 Procedural interventions Order of vaccination Individuals often receive more than one vaccine inj ection at a time. One study determined that order of vaccination injection can impact pain. Res earchers randomized 120 infants to receive DPTap-HiB and PCV vaccines in different orders. Pai n was assessed after each injection and overall. When administered first, DPTap-HiB was les s painful than PCV. During the second injection, pain was lower when DPTap-HiB was admini stered first (followed by PCV). Overall, pain was lower when DPTap-HiB was given first 72 . Therefore, providing less painful vaccines first reduces overall pain from multiple vaccinatio ns 73 . Order of injection is also important to reduce risk of ISRR49 . The CPG recommends that painful vaccines should b e given last as pain can escalate with each subsequent injection 65. Muscle tension Muscle tension is a technique that is used to maint ain an individual's blood pressure and prevent rapid drops in blood pressure that can lead to a fa int. It is a simple intervention, where the patient is asked to tense their large muscle groups such as the legs and abdomen 37. The patient engages the muscles for approximately 15 seconds, and then releases for the same amount of time. This cycle is repeated throughout the vaccination proced ures. The CPG recommends the technique for those aged seven or older 67,74 . Adolescents are at greater risk for fainting and therefore is recommended to be used in school settings 4,48. 14 Cold vibrating device Tactile stimulation with an external vibrating devi ce and cold (i.e., ice pack) to the same arm that is receiving the injection is shown to reduce pain.75 The CPG recommends use of an external vibrating device and cold for children ages 3 to 17 years old 5. 2.6.2.2 Physical interventions Sitting up Sitting up provides individuals with a sense of con trol during vaccine injections. This can have a positive impact on their pain. Studies have also sh own that sitting up can help decrease fear 73 . However, those with a history of fainting or high d izziness may prefer a different vaccination position (see next section). Laying down If an individual is at risk for fainting, they may be immunized in a reclining or supine position64. This reduces their likelihood of injury if a faint is to occur. 2.6.2.3 Pharmacologic interventions Topical anesthetics Topical anesthetics work to \"numb pain sensations\" by blocking the transduction of pain signals from the skin to the nervous system. Topical anesthetics have been shown to reduce pain and distress in children receiving vaccine injections 76 . Despite this evidence-base, topical anesthetics are underused 77 . Clinical practice guidelines recommend that topic al anesthetics be a standard offering for all children undergoing needle procedu res to prevent needle fear and ISRRs 5,9,78 . 2.6.2.4 Process implementations Education for vaccine administers 15 The CPG recommends that clinicians (and other vacci ne administers) are educated in pain management. It has been shown that clinician educat ion on pain management increases the use of pain interventions during vaccine injection 71 . The increased use of interventions improves patient pain management. Parental presence For children 10 years and younger, the CPG recommen ds that parents stay for their children's vaccine injection(s). There is evidence that childr en may show less distress when parents stay compared to when they leave. Children have also voc alized that they prefer their parents to be present 71 . It is recommended that parents engage in coping-p romoting behaviours during their children's procedures as their behaviour can impact on their children's levels of fear and pain. Older children may also want a parent to be present , or to have a substitute support person (e.g., friend). While there is no consensus about whether older children should be vaccinated with a friend, it should be offered as a consideration for those that are interested 5. Additional consideration for school settings: Peer support School vaccinations are usually students' first nee dle procedure without parents present, so it is understandable that they would want support. In a s tudy examining fear mitigation during HPV school vaccine clinics, it was noted that many stud ents liked having the opportunity to be supported by their friends (i.e., holding hands or talking) during their vaccinations 47. It is also recommended to have support people present for vacc inations to reduce ISRR risk 64. In studies that examined students' preferences for coping with vaccinations, having the choice to have friends present was encouraged by students 8. In a study that offered peer support, nearly half (47%) of students chose to have a friend present to help cope with vaccination fear and pain 7. However, it should be noted that in 2020, only 25% of Ontario public health units allow the presence of peer support in their school-based clin ics 83 . This indicates that peer support is important to students but is currently sub-optimall y utilized in school settings. Education for parents 16 Educating parents both ahead of time and on the day of vaccination increases the use of pain interventions during vaccine injection 71 . Educating parents in advance provides them with t he opportunity to plan and discuss their children's pr eferences for interventions. Education for individuals undergoing vaccination Individuals should be given information about what will happen during the procedure, how it will feel, and how to cope with any needle fear or pain79,80,81 . There is evidence that education reduces pre-procedural fear in children undergoing vaccinations 71 . The CPG recommends that information should be given in advance. When provid ing information, language should be neutral 5. Additional consideration for school settings: Stude nt specific education Students should be educated on how vaccines work an d the logistics of vaccination day. In previous research, students said that understanding the purpose and value of their vaccinations helped reduce their fear 47. Nurses interviewed in the same study supported pa rents discussing the vaccinations with their children to help them prepa re for the experience. One systematic review on effective approaches to educating children about needle procedures recommends to the use of videos and modeling (case scenarios) to teach stude nts 79. An additional study demonstrated that students want to take action to mitigate their need le fear and pain as 50% of students did not know how to make needles less scary and painful, bu t 37% of students wanted to learn 1. It is recommended that students should be educated on fear and pain mitigation, in addition to learning about why vaccines are important 83 . 2.6.2.5 Psychological interventions Distraction Use of various distraction interventions (verbal, v ideo, music, toy) are recommended for use during vaccination for children by the CPG 5. Distraction is the most studied psychological intervention for procedural pain in children, inclu ding vaccinations. It is unclear what the effective components of distraction are, but they r equire minimal instruction and can be easily tailored to different child preferences and setting s 70 . It is also recommended to use age- 17 appropriate distraction items such as video games, videos, bubbles, toys and music for children aged 6 to 12 years to minimize risk of ISRRs 64. 2.6.2.6 Setting and situational considerations The clinical practice guideline was not able to inc lude recommendations for mass vaccination settings due to a limited evidence base. However, b ased on qualitative reviews of available research, some considerations can be stated 45,89. Privacy There is a general agreement that individuals shoul d not be visible to groups of others that are waiting to receive their vaccinations 5. Privacy can help individuals avoid witnessing oth ers' fear. Additional considerations for school settings: Plan ning for privacy Privacy screens and reducing the number of students waiting in an a rea before vaccination as importance procedural factors for reducing needle f ear in school settings 47. It is recommended for nurses to meet with principals before vaccinati on clinics to identify suitable clinics spaces that can support the use of privacy interventions ( privacy screens or additional private rooms) 83 . It is recommended that students with high risk of I SRRs use privacy when getting vaccinated 64. Order of student vaccinations Triaging the order of individuals who are getting v accinated was not included in the CPG as most childhood vaccinations occur by appointment an d on an individual basis. When possible, school vaccinations should happen early in the day and clinics should be equipped with enough staff so vaccinations can be done quickly, and so t hat less time is available for rumors to circulate 47. It is also recommended to have students that are more fearful and at higher risk of ISRRs to be vaccinated at the beginning of the clin ic to reduce the duration of time that they were anticipating the injection, as extended wait t imes can increase fear 64. 2.6.3 Implementation of the pain management CPG: Co nsiderations for age and settings The CPG includes recommendations that healthcare pr oviders vaccinating children can use. A comprehensive approach to pain management, involvin g use of multiple interventions is 18 recommended for infants and young children 5. This is because there are high levels of distress associated with vaccinations in these age groups, a s well as higher potential for long-term harm (such as the development of high needle fear or fut ure vaccine avoidance). As children mature, they are expected to participate in their own pain management and vocalize their needs and preferences 5. School vaccination settings are vastly different th an individualized clinical settings and were not included in the CPG. School-based vaccination clini cs are complex and require the coordination of multiple stakeholder groups, such as healthcare providers, students, school staff and parents. Optimizing vaccination experiences in individual cl inical settings is dependent on improving the patient-healthcare provider interaction. However, i n school settings, optimizing vaccination experiences requires changes with others as well (e .g., teacher interactions) and setting (e.g., physical space) 8,82 . Because of the distinct differences and challenge s in delivering vaccinations at school, additional research is needed to transla te the CPG recommendations for the school vaccination context. 2.7 School setting challenges to managing negative symptoms There are additional challenges in operating school -based vaccine clinics that are not present when vaccinating children in individual clinical se ttings. Some of these additional challenges are outlined below. To translate the CPG to be used in school settings, these challenges needed to be considered. 2.7.1 Environmental factors Witnessing others fear ('social contagion') In 2011, a study explored the experiences of 130 gi rls receiving their HPV vaccinations at school. It was observed that lack of privacy screen s and organizing clinics, so students were waiting for their vaccinations in the clinic space exacerbated students' fear as it provided a direct 'line-of-sight transmission of anxiety'47. Girls waiting to be vaccinated were able to see t he other students getting vaccinated and becoming \"really tr aumatized\", which resulted in the waiting 19 students having more anxiety. As of 2019, only 29% of Ontario public health units consistently offer privacy to students being vaccinated at schoo l 83 . Vaccination time and order Students who are vaccinated later in the day/clinic are often more fearful and distressed than students vaccinated earlier 47. It has been postulated that this occurs because s tudents talk about others' experiences while they wait, and often thes e conversations revolve around how much the needle hurt 47. As vaccination clinics progress, more rumours can circulate and students' fear can increase. This phenomenon is further exacerbated if students with high baseline fear are not vaccinated early in the clinic 43. As of 2019, only 46% of public health units routi nely order their school clinics such that students with the highest baseline fear are vaccinated first 83 . 2.7.2 Unmitigated symptoms No distraction from needles Pain and fear mitigation strategies are undervalued in school settings, as one study from 2017 showed only 20% of schools offered distraction item s or rewards (food, stickers, etc.) to help students have manage their pain and fear 1. Additionally, in 2019 only 13% of public health u nits provide distraction items (juice box, stress balls, toys, books) to students to help cope with their vaccinations 83 . 2.7.3 Psychological factors Lack of information As of 2019 in Ontario, only 62.5% of public health units operating school vaccination clinics provide students with education on the reason for v accine, how it works and side effects. Only 50% of public health units are educated on needle f ear and pain mitigation 83 . In one study where parents were asked about their perceptions towards their children's school-based vaccinations, parents felt that their children's needle fear was exacerbated by a lack of education 47. 2.8 Development of the CARD system 20 CPG authors used an integrated Knowledge Translatio n (KT) approach to address the evidence- to-care gap in school settings 84 . In 2019, selected authors from the CPG partnered with members from a public health unit and school board (collect ively hereby known as the \"Pain Pain Go Away\" team) to develop a multi-faceted KT intervent ion (i.e., CARD) that tailored the CPG recommendations for school settings 8. The Pain Pain Go Away team used the Knowledge to Ac tion (KTA) framework and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to translate the CPG research evidence into practice in school settings 85,86 . There were 3 steps in developing the KT intervention. First (1), the team identified potent ial areas for intervention by exploring students' needs in current practices. They undertook studies to understand student perceptions of fear and pain on vaccination acceptance/experiences 1,4,45,87 . These studies demonstrated that fear and pain largely impact students' vaccination experiences an d that fear/pain mitigation strategies are underused in school settings. Using this feedback a nd the CPG, the team then developed tools that could help guide healthcare providers in imple menting fear/pain mitigation recommendations. However, the tools were still not tailored to school settings. After tool development, the team undertook the seco nd step (2) of KT intervention design - obtaining feedback on the tools so they could be ad apted for school settings. This involved focus groups with healthcare providers to understand thei r vaccination experiences and receive feedback on the KT template tools 88 . After this, the team was able to identify CPG spe cific interventions that were adaptable for school. They then completed another round of focus groups, this time with four key stakeholder groups - students, parents, school staff and public health nurses where all participants provided more detailed feedback on the KT template tools. Finally (3), the team packaged and tailored the KT tools into a framework that would be used to plan and deliver vaccinations in school settings. T he finalized version of this evidence based multifaceted KT intervention framework was called t he \"CARD system\". In addition to being the name of the system, CARD is also an acronym where e ach letter (C - comfort, A - ask, R - relax, D - distract) represents a category of evide nce-based interventions (otherwise known as 'coping tools') that students can use to optimize t heir vaccination experience 8. 21 2.9 Components of CARD This section outlines the components of the CARD sy stem. CARD addresses all aspects of the 5P approach to pain management. It offers students' the opportunity to use interventions from the first 4Ps (procedural; physical; pharmacologic and psychological) as well educating (the 5 th P; process) key stakeholders involved in school vac cine clinics on how to use the interventions. Below in Table 4, CARD components are organized int o 3 key sections that must occur in chronological order: 1) implementation planning for public health, 2) education and preparation of relevant stakeholders and 3) vaccination day. Table 4. Components of the CARD system CARD component Overview of component Previous rese arch supporting component Implementation planning for public health Implementation planning Content experts and local implementation leader review CARD resources and tailor for local implementation. Nurses and school staff recognize that vaccination procedures vary by school and by public health unit 89 . Therefore, they value systems that are flexible and open for adaptation to local settings. Training day Content experts and local implementati on leader organize and attend training workshop for staff involved in CARD implementation whereby CARD and key implementation components are reviewed and staff provided opportunity to provide input to refine implementation. Parents identify public health nurses to be one of the most useful sources of to address their children's school-based vaccination concerns 82 .It is important that nurses are well-informed on pain and fear mitigation strategies, as needle fear is the most common concern for students during vaccination 1. Finalized implementation plan Content experts and local implementation leader finalize the implementation plan (including all material/resources, process checklists, data collection tools). It is important to public health and school staff that there is clear communication and expectations of roles to improve school vaccine clinic flow 8. Education and preparation of relevant stakeholders Principal planning meeting A meeting of public health school liaison (nurse) and school principal (or designate) to review intervention, education, and planning for clinics. Principal responsible for certain items (e.g., education of parents and school staff, vaccination day reminders, securing and executing agreed upon spaces and processes for vaccination day). Support of principal is crucial to prepare school-based vaccination programs 88. Student education Discussed as part of the principa l planning meeting. In-class lesson for all students in grade eligible for vaccination and distribution of vaccine consent packages; delivered by school liaison. CPG recommends education on procedure, needle sensation and fear/pain coping 5. Providing students with education increases their knowledge about vaccines and improved their attitudes towards receiving vaccines 90 . 22 Students want to take action to mitigate against their needle fear. One study showed that 50% of students did not know how to make needles less scary and painful, but 37% of students wanted to learn 1. Students express interest in having videos to explain pain and fear mitigation strategies. They also want to have more information on topical anesthetics 8. Education of school staff and parents Discussed as part of the principal planning meeting. CARD education to parents and school staff provided by the principal. The CPG recommends the use of parental education to increase the use of pain mitigation interventions 5. Parent education has possible reductions in adolescent anxiety 82 . In one study, it was noted that students and nurses noticed how the knowledge and attitudes of teachers towards vaccinations impacted the students' vaccination experiences. Teachers' negative or nonchalant attitudes towards vaccinations increased the anxiety and fear for students, while a caring approach was appreciated by students 89. Education of teachers has been identified as important in school settings 91 . Greater knowledge and understanding in school staff can encourage staff to be more supportive, promote vaccination and interact appropriately with students on vaccination day 89. Vaccination day reminders Discussed as part of the principal planning meeting. Reminders for parents, school staff and students about vaccination clinic day provided by the principal. Vaccination reminders positively impact on vaccine knowledge and attitudes 82 . Vaccination day Preferred room/location (e.g., library) for clinic Discussed as part of the principal planning meeting. Preferred school spaces booked for vaccine clinic. It is important to both students and nurses to host school clinics in large areas that allow for a steady flow of traffic in and out of the room. A spacious clinic space is thought to help reduce student anxiety 89. Private room secured for students that select privacy as a coping strategy Discussed as part of the principal planning meeting. Private rooms (e.g., office in library) booked for vaccine clinic. Both parents and students are interested in having a support person (friend or parent) present for the vaccination as well as the option to be vaccinated in private 88. It is recommended that public health units meet with principals before vaccination clinics to identify suitable clinics spaces that can support the use of privacy interventions (privacy screens or additional private rooms) 83 . 23 It is also recommended that individuals that are at higher risk of ISRRs are vaccinated in private 64. Separate pre-vaccination waiting area with chairs Discussed as part of the principal planning meeting. Separate waiting spaces pre- vaccination. Having space/privacy between the vaccination space and the waiting area to reduce the spread of needle fear in students 47. Introduction by public health staff Part of finalized implementation plan. Public health staff greet students. In previous CARD studies, students liked when the nurses introduced themselves to the classes before the clinic started because it helped instill students' confidence in the nurses and acted as another reminder for them to prepare for their vaccinations 7,88. Triaging students (number and order) Part of finalized implementation plan. Lead clinic nurse (same as the school liaison) organizes clinic flow (including order and number of students). It is recommended that students who are more fearful and at higher risk of ISRRs to be vaccinated at the beginning of the clinic 64. Reducing the number of students waiting in an area before vaccination helps to reduce needle fear in school settings 47. Students, teachers, and nurses believe it is important to have less students in the waiting area. Schools that triage many students at once have more students waiting for longer. This can result in more noise and contribute to more fear and anxiety 89. Clinic set-up (minimize visual and auditory fear cues) Part of finalized implementation plan. Public health clinic staff minimize sources of fear (e.g., separate pre-vaccination students from those being vaccinated, separate clinic room workstations, obscure supplies/equipment and prevent students from seeing each other getting vaccinated, prevent interruptions, and excessive noise). Nurses noted that having privacy barriers or strategies to minimize stressful visual cues (like needles) are beneficial for mitigating against student fear 87. Student assessment Part of finalized implementatio n plan. Public health staff assess student level of fear immediately before vaccination. Self-report is the validated approach for collecting information on fear 5. Student-led coping during vaccination (CARD) Tools offered: Verbal distraction Distraction items (fidget spinners, squishy balls, books, electronic devices) Adult support Peer support Muscle tension Topical anesthetic Lying down Part of finalized implementation plan and student education. Public health staff solicit student- preferred coping strategies and accommodate them. Students were interested in having a support person (friend or parent) present for the vaccination as well as the option to be vaccinated in private 7,92 . UNICEF's 'ladder of participation' framework promotes patient-centered care and calls for student involvement in their own healthcare procedures 93 . Nurses and students who are provided the option to use distraction items (music devices, stress balls) think they are helpful in facilitating students' positive vaccination experiences 89. 24 Students like having friends to hold their hands when they are scared or nervous. Nurses also perceive peer support as beneficial 89. 2.10 Preliminary research with CARD A small-scale cluster trial involving 323 grade 7 s tudents across 10 schools (5 CARD and 5 control) in Niagara. This pilot study was conducted by the Niagara Public Health unit (the health unit that was also involved in CARD development). I mplementation was guided and supported by the Pain Pain Go Away research team. The trial w as undertaken to explore clinical effectiveness and implementation of CARD. The study found that students in the CARD schools used more coping tools during vaccination and were less fearful and less dizzy than their counterparts in schools where CARD was not used 7. Additionally, less students returned to the clinic feeling unwell (i.e., with post-vaccination reactions) in CARD schools. After the clinics were completed, focus groups were completed to obtain feedback of stakeholders on program delivery. Student feedback about the CARD system was positive. Students said they felt that they understood the CA RD system and that it helped prepare them for vaccinations 7,92 . Students liked having the option of using externa l distraction objects (like phones), being vaccinated in privacy and/or bringin g a friend with them. In addition to student focus groups, fifty-five nur ses, school staff and parents participated in 15 adult focus groups 7. All stakeholders approved of CARD and thought it should be continued to be used in future clinics. School staff liked the s tudent educational videos and thought the educational pamphlet was helpful for preparing stud ents for vaccination. Parents liked the pamphlet as it prompted conversation about managing needle fear and pain with their children. Stakeholders also liked that students could select their own coping tools and appreciated the student-led nature of CARD. Most of the feedback re ceived from adult stakeholders was positive, however they did discuss the gradual buy- in for CARD. While nurses were confident that CARD improved the delivery of vaccine clinics, some school staff were hesitant to agree 7. CARD does require some additional planning and reso urces (time, personnel). Therefore, CARD implementation may require more time and continuous check-ins for stakeholders to buy-in and 25 understand the exchange between additional resource investment and positive vaccination experiences for students. 2.11 Limitations to prior work The CARD system was shown as effective in reducing fear and dizziness in Niagara. It was positively received by the various stakeholders tha t were responsible for implementing CARD, and most importantly, was liked by student users. H owever, there were some limitations to the previous CARD research. First, a designated implementation leader was parti ally funded for implementation in Niagara. While this gave program delivery managers and resea rchers more control over CARD implementation (which was beneficial for the first attempts at implementation), this was not a pragmatic approach to implementation. In 'real worl d' settings, teams would not have access to additional funding and content experts/researchers during implementation. The additional resources may have exaggerated the benefits of CARD compared to more usual real world setting implementation approaches as teams did not need to handle implementation barriers alone and could consolidate challenges with the guidance of content experts. Second, schools were not randomized to group assign ment (CARD or control) in Niagara. This acts as a limitation as schools were selected to us e CARD or usual care. By extension, study conclusions were at risk of selection bias. Risk of selection bias was additionally increased as the school board selected the schools that would partic ipate in the study and may have picked schools that were better prepared to adopt the CARD system 92 . Third, Niagara had a relatively small sample size o f 10 schools (13.2% of all grade 7 schools in the District School Board of Niagara) 94 . This small sample reduced the confidence in the s tudy conclusions. Additionally, the small sample size li mited the generalizability of the study conclusions, as only a small percentage of all scho ols were involved in the study. Finally, Niagara was a large urban population cente r, as it had a population of 447,888 in 2016 95 . All the schools managed by Niagara Public Health we re therefore urban. This was a limitation as 26 study results cannot be extended to other populatio n centres where implementation barriers and facilitators may be different than those faced in a n urban area like Niagara. 2.12 Literature review conclusions This literature review has established the followin g: 1) needle fear and pain are common concerns for students being vaccinated in school se ttings; 2) there are benefits to addressing needle fear and pain (reduction in negative symptom s and demand on healthcare services; positive vaccination attitudes; future vaccine comp liance); 3) there is already an evidence-based framework (the CARD system) that is designed to red uce student fear, pain and related responses; 4) preliminary work evaluating the effec tiveness of the CARD system in the school setting is promising, but the evidence-base needs t o be expanded and limitations of preliminary work need to be addressed. 27 Chapter 3 - Methods 3.1 Study design and setting A partially blinded, cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted with schools receiving school vaccination services from the Wellington-Duf ferin-Guelph (WDG) Public Health Unit. A cluster randomized controlled design was selected for this study based on the nature of the CARD intervention system. Many aspects of CARD need ed to be implemented on a cluster level (school) rather than individual (student) level whi ch required the unit of randomization to be the school. In addition to this consideration of interv ention feasibility, a cluster randomized trial was also used as it decreases the risk of experimental contamination (spread of information about the CARD system) to control groups. 3.2 Participants All grade 7 students (mean age, 12 years) from part icipating schools were included (population- based study). 3.2.1 Inclusion criteria Grade 7 students in the school calendar year of 201 9-2020 registered in one of the participating schools. 3.2.2 Exclusion criteria There were no a-priori exclusion criteria (due to o ur study objective of examining CARD effectiveness in real world settings). 3.3 Ethics Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Toronto Health Sciences Research Ethics Board (REB). Consent was obtained for the students on behalf of the two school boards that operate within WDG (Upper Grand District School Boa rd and the Wellington Catholic School Board). As per Article 3.7A of the Tri-Council Poli cy Statement (TCPS) page 35, individual consent was waived from students/parents or guardia ns to have the data available on a population level 96 . The requirement for study consent was waived for the following reasons: 28 Firstly, the CARD system implements interventions t hat are already evidence-based 8. Therefore, this study can be viewed as a quality improvement p roject since we did not implement any new treatments that needed evaluation. As well, the stu dents were not subjected to more than minimal risk and were not subjected to significant burden, so the study was unlikely to negatively affect the welfare of the students. Additionally, vaccination procedures already requir e the consent of students and parents/guardians. Introducing another consent form may cause confusion and result in less parents' consenting to vaccination overall. Requiri ng consent for the study may have negatively impacted the health of the students. Finally, CARD is a program level intervention. If c onsent was required, the study risked having a low participation rate and we would be unable to co mment on the impact of CARD for those that chose not to participate. Therefore, waiving consen t was important to maintain the scientific merit of the study. The University of Toronto Resea rch Ethics Board agreed with waiving the consent. The study was registered with ClinicalTria ls.gov (NCT03966300). 3.4 Randomization The unit of randomization for this study was the sc hools (clusters) in which students were enrolled. Randomization was performed by a statisti cian external to the study. The statistician used a computer program (randomize.net) to randomiz e schools in a 1:1 allocation ratio to CARD or control with proportional representation by school board (Upper Grand District School Board, Wellington Catholic School Board) and school size (small, large). In total, 20 schools were allocated to the CARD group, and 20 schools we re allocated to the usual care group. 3.5 Procedures The study was initially planned to be conducted ove r two vaccine clinics in the school year of 2019 to 2020. The first round of clinics would happ en in the fall, and the second in the spring. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, schools were closed a nd the second round of second clinics were subsequently not possible. Therefore, this stu dy only collected data from the first round of clinics that occurred in the fall of 2019. Students were offered one dose of both Hepatitis B and 29 Human papillomavirus vaccines. Students would have been offered a second dose of Hepatitis B and Human papillomavirus and the single required do se of Meningococcal virus vaccines during the second round of clinics. 3.5.1 Overview of WDG public health staff school va ccination program A description of usual activities undertaken by WDG public health unit staff as part of the school vaccination program is provided here. Each school clinic has one designated lead nurse wh o communicates with the school principal to plan the clinic date, time, and space; organizes va ccine consent hand-out and subsequent collection; and manages clinic flow on clinic day. Managing clinic flow includes organizing consents, triaging students by class to receive the ir vaccination, and supporting the vaccinating nurses in anything they may need, which may include making telephone calls to parents to clarify consent information or acting as a support person during a student's injection. Nurses do not typically vaccinate students when acting as the lead nurse. However, the nurse acting as the lead nurse at each school clinic rotates throughout the round of school clinics. In addition to the lead nurse, each clinic has several vaccinating nur ses. The exact number of vaccinating nurses present at each clinic is dependent on the number o f grade 7 students at each school and is determined by the WDG manager, although the ratio o f vaccinating nurses to students needed is not standardized. Vaccinating nurses are responsibl e for vaccine administration and documentation. Finally, each clinic has registration clerks presen t. Registration clerks help the lead nurse with clinic flow and are responsible for retrieving stud ents from classrooms pre-vaccine and sending them back to classrooms after the required 15-minut e wait period post-vaccine. In WDG usual care, there is only one registration clerk at each school clinic. At the 20 CARD clinics, two registration clerks were present as one was in-trai ning during the study period. It was decided that this individual continue to attend and oversee the post-vaccine area students. 3.5.2 Study procedures 30 The TIDieR checklist (Appendix 1) shows the details for the study procedures for both groups. Study procedures are also briefly summarized in chr onological order here. 3.5.2.1 Public health staff education program CARD schools Prior to the first round of school clinics, the WDG manager, program assistant, CARD nurses and registration clerks (hereby known as the 'CARD team') all participated in a CARD training day. The training was a full day in length. The fir st portion of the training involved the CARD team watching a PowerPoint presentation delivered b y researchers and the local vaccination program manager. This presentation included informa tion about the prevalence of needle fear, pain, and stress-related responses as well as how n eedle concerns relate to vaccine hesitancy. The presentation also included 3 videos (2 directed to students and 1 directed to adults). One of the student-directed videos was 4.45 minutes long a nd explained the purpose and value of vaccinations. The other student-directed video was 7.45 minutes long and explained the CARD system. The adult-directed video was 12.28 minutes long and discussed integration of the CARD system into school vaccination programs, and is int ended to be viewed by parents, public health staff and school staff. After the presentation, sta ff reviewed CARD integration approaches and study data collection tools. They were also informe d not to disclose any information about the intervention to control staff. The CARD team was gi ven the opportunity to ask researchers and the program manager questions and provide feedback on any aspects of CARD or its implementation. Control schools The nurses and registration clerks that were assign ed to control schools did not attend CARD training. The WDG manager, who attended the CA RD training session, was responsible for showing the control staff how to complete the s tudy data collection tools but did not discuss CARD. The manager did not educate staff on coping i nterventions included on data collection tools to avoid the potential for this information t o impact practices. The manager did not disclose any information about CARD and informed staff train ed in CARD not to discuss the study with non-trained staff. 31 3.5.2.2 Communication with principals CARD schools Round one of school vaccination clinics took place between September and October of 2019. During the summer prior to the vaccination clinics, the lead nurse contacted the principal of each school, as per usual practices. The lead nurse firs t emailed the principal to set up either a phone or in person meeting. During this meeting, the lead nurse communicated the requirements of the CARD program (Appendix 2). Key requirements for pri ncipals included providing 1) a large space for the main clinic (ideally the library); 2) a separate room for private vaccinations; 3) spaces to accommodate waiting students (one for stu dents before vaccination, and one for after vaccination) as well as 4) educating parents and sc hool staff on the CARD system; 5) sending reminders for parents, school staff and students; a nd 6) agreeing to let students use phones as distractions or to provide an alternative. A large space was needed so multiple students could be vaccinated at the same time while remaining far enough away from each other that the individual conversations between student and vaccinating nurse could not be heard. An additi onal separate room was needed so students could be vaccinated in privacy if they requested it as a coping tool. In WDG, students are required to wait 15 minutes after their vaccination so they can be monitored for post-vaccination stress reactions. Therefore, separate waiting space s were needed for students before and after vaccination so that students waiting after their va ccinations did not communicate with students still waiting to receive their vaccinations. Remind ers were needed so that school staff, parents and students were able to prepare for vaccination d ay (e.g., wear appropriate attire such as short- sleeved shirt, bring distraction device). The lead nurse provided the principal with scripts they could use for the reminders. Principals were told t hat they were able to select their preferred method of sending reminders (e.g., emails, robocall s, announcements). Finally, cell phones or alternative electronics were encouraged as they are effective coping tools but needed additional planning as using cell phones at school may violate school policies. After discussing the necessity and value of the various CARD requirement s, the principal signed an agreement indicating their intentions to provide the requirem ents to the best of their ability. The meeting was also used to confirm the round one clinic date and time. 32 Control schools The lead nurse emailed the principal of the school to confirm the date and time of the clinic. 3.5.2.3 In school education CARD schools One to four weeks prior to the round one vaccinatio n clinics, the lead nurse and one accompanying nurse visited each school. At the visi t, the nurses showed a PowerPoint presentation and two educational videos to students . The presentation reviewed the vaccines being offered and the vaccination day processes. Th e first video explained how vaccines work and the second explained how to use the CARD system . After the presentation, nurses answered any student questions. Then, students were given a CARD pamphlet where selected the coping tools they wanted to use for vaccination (Appendix 3). They were also asked to write down a score that represented their fear of the impending vaccinations (e.g., on a scale from 0- 'not scared at all' to 10- 'the most scared possible'). The students handed pamphlets back to the nurses after completion, who reviewed the requests and made their own record of the student requests and fear scores. Nurses handed out vaccina tion consent forms to each student to take home. An additional consent was provided to student s who requested topical anesthetics for vaccination (authorizing nurses to apply it). The n urse completed an in-class education session checklist to document their perceptions of how the education session went (Appendix 4). Control schools Usual practices were followed with no formal educat ion session for these control schools. Nurses gave vaccination consent forms to school sta ff, who disseminated them to students. Any student questions about the vaccination procedures were answered on an individual basis on vaccination day. 3.5.2.4 Vaccination day CARD schools Before Principals sent reminders to parents, school staff and students prior to vaccination day. Parents were encouraged to discuss vaccinations and CARD wi th their children. School staff were 33 reminded not to enter the clinic space on vaccinati on day. Students were reminded of what day the vaccinations were on, and to play their CARDs . In addition to reminders before vaccination day, principals were encouraged to have an announce ment on vaccination day. On vaccination day, lead nurses set up the vaccinat ion clinic in the space planned with the principal. Nurses were required to set-up their vac cination clinic space in a way that reduced fear-inducing visual and auditory cues. This includ ed hiding equipment and needles, creating separate waiting spaces, and using CARD table-top p osters so students do not observe equipment. Before vaccinating each class of a schoo l, the nurses and registration clerks were required to visit each class at the beginning of va ccination day and introduce themselves, collect the students' completed CARD pamphlets (i.e., from the education session) and answer any student questions. The nurses reminded students to bring any desired coping tools with them when they attended the clinic space (e.g., book, mu sic devices, cell phones). During The registration clerks triaged students according to level of fear and accommodations (e.g., use of topical anesthetics), with those with high level s of fear and those authorized to use topical anesthetics going to the clinic before others. The fear scores and accommodation requests were obtained from the student pamphlets that the studen ts completed on education day. In descending order of fear score (i.e., most nervous students fi rst) on a class-by-class basis, the registration clerk would collect 4-5 students at a time from the ir classroom and escort them to the clinic waiting area allocated to students waiting before t heir vaccination (i.e., a different space than the one designated for students after vaccination). Once the students were in the waiting area, the reg istration clerk handed their CARD pamphlets and respective vaccination consent forms (and topic al anaesthetic forms if relevant) to available vaccinating nurses. Either the lead or vaccinating nurse then retrieved the student from the waiting area and brought them to their vaccinating station in the main clinic, or the private room if requested. Nurses asked students the standard va ccination consent questions. 34 After, nurses would review students' CARD pamphlets with them to confirm their coping tools or accommodations (i.e., confirm that they still wa nted to use topical anesthetic). In the case of students using topical anaesthetics, nurses applied the cream and told students to return to the waiting area for approximately 30 minutes (which wa s the required application time for the preparation used - liposomal lidocaine cream). Stud ents were also provided the opportunity to change their coping tools at this time. Once studen ts were provided with any of the distraction tools they had requested, nurses asked them to rate their fear once again on a scale from 0-10; asked if they wanted both injections (if relevant) in the same arm or different; and asked if they wanted to look away or towards the needle. Once the se steps were completed, nurses vaccinated the students. After After vaccination, nurses charted procedural inform ation on a computer (usual care). Then they completed a separate study form - nurse feedback fo rm (Appendix 5). Each nurse feedback form took approximately 30 seconds to complete. It conta ined procedural information, including student gender, vaccine administration details and coping strategies used. A researcher was present at 10 of 20 clinics and completed their own version of the nurse feedback form for approximately 5% of the students as a reliability c heck. After the student left the vaccinating station, they were required to wait for 15 minutes in the post-vaccination waiting area (N.B. this space is separate from the waiting area for student s before vaccination). A different registration clerk was present in this waiting area. During the 15-minute waiting period, students completed a symptom and feedback survey (Appendix 6). Students self-reported symptoms (pain, fear, dizziness) and answered some questions about CARD a nd vaccination. Nurses additionally recorded any post-vaccination stress reactions that occurred (Appendix 7). Finally, the lead nurse was asked to complete a CARD compliance checklist, where they reported on adherence to various key steps of CARD planning and delivery for the specific school (Appendix 8). Control school Before The lead nurse collected students one class at a ti me. There was no limit on the number of students that could be collected at one time. At so me schools, all students from one class were 35 collected by the lead nurse at one time. At others, the lead nurse would collect only a few students at a time and return to the classroom mult iple times until all consenting students had been vaccinated. This depended on teacher preferenc es. Once students were collected from the classrooms, they were instructed to wait outside th e clinic space. No specific method was used to order the students for their vaccinations (i.e., no t alphabetically or by fear score). Depending on the layout of the clinic space, students may have s een their peers' vaccinations (a separate waiting area for students before vaccination was no t required). After the students had lined up, the lead nurse provided an explanation of the vacci nes and how they worked. Students may or may not have been aware that they were receiving va ccinations on the clinic day, as this was dependent on if the school announced the vaccinatio n clinic or not in advance. During Standard practice was to perform vaccinations in bo th arms when two vaccines were being administered. Nurses did not ask students about the ir fear level as this was not part of usual practice. In addition, nurses typically engaged in verbal distraction and encouraged students to look away from the needle. Nurses in the control sc hools filled in the Nurse Feedback Form after vaccination. A researcher attended 10 of 20 school clinics and completed a reliability check on approximately 5% of the data. After The students were required to wait for 15 minutes p ost vaccination. There was no designated \"post vaccination\" waiting space and students may h ave waited in the pre-vaccination waiting area or in the main clinic space. Students filled o ut a symptom and feedback survey that was modified slightly from the version used in CARD sch ools (Appendix 9). Nurses additionally recorded any post-vaccination stress reactions. 3.6 Blinding 3.6.1 Public health staff The public health staff that were assigned to CARD schools were not blinded. These staff were aware of school group assignment as they were requi red to implement the intervention. The public health staff that were assigned to control s chools were blinded to the intervention. This 36 helped to minimize contamination as the CARD traine d staff did not disclose specific details of the intervention (CARD system) to the public health staff assigned to control schools. 3.6.2 Students Students were blinded to their school group assignm ent and to the study hypotheses. This minimized risk of bias in outcome detection. 3.6.3 Research team The research team was not blinded to the study grou p assignment and study outcomes. However, the research team was not responsible for implement ing the intervention. 3.7 Outcome measures All outcome measures are described here. They are a lso outlined in Table 5. 3.7.1 Primary outcome: Fear 3.7.1.1 Measurement tools Fear is a subjective experience and ideally measure d through validated single item self-report measures of fear 97 . The 2015 CPG recommends the use of numerical rati ng scales (NRS) for fear assessment 98 . NRS for fear uses an 11-point scale (0 - 'not sca red at all' to 10 'most scared possible'). The NRS has been used in this populatio n previously and has been validated for use in children over the age of 8 97. Additionally, the 11-point NRS was used in previo us CARD studies. When fear was assessed using this scale, s tudents in CARD has less fear than control students 7. Since CARD provides evidence-based strategies to reduce needle fear, these findings were in line with the study hypothesis and demonstr ate construct validity for the use of this scale in our study's context. 3.7.1.2 Outcome measurement In our study, fear was independently self-reported by students on the structured student symptom survey. Fear was scored on a 11-point numerical rat ing scale (0 - 'not scared at all' to 10 - 'most scared possible'). 37 3.7.2 Secondary outcome: Pain 3.7.2.1 Measurement tools Pain is a subjective experience and can vary across individuals. Therefore, self-reporting pain measures are considered the gold standard for asses sment 99 . The 2015 CPG recommends the use of a NRS to assess pain 5. NRS for pain uses a 11-point scale (0 - 'no pain' to 10 - 'worst pain', or 'pain as bad as it could be'). NRS have been used f or adolescents previously and are validated for use in children over the age of 8 5. There are other scales that can be used to assess pain, such as the visual analog scale (VAS), but the NRS is pr eferred for its reliability and simplicity 98. 3.7.2.2 Outcome measurement Pain was independently self-reported by students on the structured student symptom survey. It was scored on a 11-point numerical rating scale (0 - 'no pain at all' to 10 - 'most pain possible'). 3.7.3 Secondary outcome: Dizziness 3.7.3.1 Measurement tools The numeric dizziness scale (NDS) can be used to se lf-report acute dizziness intensity in individuals on an 11-point scale 100 . Dizziness can be rated on a scale of 0-10 as it i s a subjective and individual experience, and it is accepted commo n practice to inquire about subjective experiences using numerical rating scales. In addit ion, past research with CARD provided evidence to suggest that using a scale from 0 to 10 to measure dizziness has construct validity 7. When this scale was used in the prior Niagara CARD study, students allocated to CARD had less dizziness than control students. Since CARD provide s evidence-based strategies to reduce dizziness, these findings were in line with the stu dy hypothesis. Therefore, this 0-10 scale has evidence of construct validity. 3.7.3.2 Outcome measurement 38 Dizziness was independently self-reported by studen ts on the structured student symptom survey. It was scored on a 11-point numerical rating scale (0 - 'not dizzy at all' to 10 - 'most dizziness possible'). 3.7.4 Secondary outcome: Fainting 3.7.4.1 Measurement tools In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) develo ped a manual to help health professionals prevent, identify, and respond to immunization stre ss-related responses. In section 4.2.1 of the manual, experts provide guidance on the diagnosis o f one ISRR - vasovagal reaction with syncope, otherwise known as fainting 38. Fainting can occur suddenly, before, during or sh ortly after immunization. Fainting is assessed as present or absent. Nurses are trained on recognizing and treating fainting. Fainting that occurred while nurses were at the school were recorded. 3.7.4.2 Outcome measurement Fainting was reported by nurses as a dichotomous 'y es' or 'no' variable and is a separate outcome from other post-vaccination reactions. If s tudents fainted during the vaccine appointment (i.e., while student was interacting wi th the vaccinating nurse), the faint was recorded on the structured nurse feedback form. If students fainted after the vaccination appointment (i.e., during the 15-minute post-vaccin ation waiting period or when back in class), the faint was recorded on a different structured su rvey (post-vaccination checklist). Documentation of fainting is part at WDG. 3.7.5 Secondary outcome: Post-vaccination reactions 3.7.5.1 Measurement tools The WHO manual on ISRRs lists symptoms associated w ith general acute stress responses following vaccination 38. The comprehensive symptoms are categorized by phy siological system; skin, respiratory, cardiovascular; gastrointestinal , neurological, and other symptoms. 3.7.5.2 Outcome measurement 39 We developed a comprehensive checklist on post-vacc ination stress-related reactions based on the WHO ISRR manual (post-vaccination checklist). S tudents returning to nurses with symptoms post-vaccination were assessed for the presence of post-vaccination stress-related responses. Nurses recorded symptoms dichotomously, either 'yes ' or 'no'. For each reported symptom, nurses also documented onset, treatment and resolut ion. 3.7.6 Secondary outcome: Use of coping tools 3.7.6.1 Measurement tools During CARD development, content experts communicat ed with public health staff to determine which evidence-based coping tools outlined in the C PG were feasible to implement in school settings 8. After this cross-reference, students were asked f or their feedback on the selected tools. Tools that were encouraged by students, evidence-ba sed and feasible to use at school vaccination clinics were compiled into a checklist and included on the nurse feedback form. The nurse feedback form was used in previous CARD studies, wh ich demonstrated construct validity for the feedback form in reporting use of coping tools 7. 3.7.6.2 Outcome measurement Student use of coping tools was reported by vaccina ting nurses dichotomously, either 'yes' or 'no' on a structured survey (nurse feedback form). 3.7.7 Secondary outcome: Student attitudes about CARD 3.7.7.1 Outcome measurement CARD students were asked two unique questions about their attitudes towards CARD. The first question 'Do you think CARD helped you with getting your vaccinations?' examines students' satisfaction with using CARD. The second question, 'Do you want to use CARD if you ever get another vaccination?' examines students' intent to use CARD again in the future. Both questions were scored on a 5.0 Likert scale (1 - No, 2 - Mayb e no, 3 - I don't know, 4 - Maybe yes, 5 - Yes). 40 CARD and control students were asked one question a bout their attitudes towards vaccinations; 'Do you think you should get vaccinations?' The que stion was scored on a 5.0 Likert scale (1 - No, 2 - Maybe no, 3 - I don't know, 4 - Maybe yes, 5 - Yes). 3.7.8 Secondary outcome: Implementation issues 3.7.8.1 Measurement tools Intervention implementation can be complex. Without complete descriptions of interventions, future implementers cannot reliability execute inte rventions that have been shown to be useful, and other researchers cannot build on research find ings 101 . To refine implementation of specific CARD interventions, we used the Template for Interv ention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist and guide 97. 3.7.8.2 Outcome measurement Nurses were asked to complete the CARD compliance c hecklist where they documented their adherence to key CARD components with a 'yes' or 'n o' for each CARD school (Appendix 8). After all the round one school clinics were complet ed, researchers completed the TIDieR checklist using checklist, supp 4,5,6) and researcher field notes. Sub- optimal compliance rates for CARD components were identified for discussion with resp ect to possible implications for implementation success. Additionally, students prov ided open-ended feedback on their experience with CARD on the student survey form. St udent feedback was used to triangulate implementation issues by examining if student comme nts were related to CARD components with low compliance rates. Table 5.

There was a total of 40 schools (assuming an average of 35 st udents vaccinated per school) which provided 80% power in declaring significance with alpha=0.05 , delta=1.0, standard 5% missing data and intra-cluster correlation coeffici ent (ICC)=0.01. 3.9 Statistical analysis All collected data were entered by a research team member and then independently verified for accuracy by another researcher before data analysis was conducted. We conducted an intent-to-treat analysis which incl uded all students (n=1919). Due to the skewed pattern of student symptom scores (fear, pai n, dizziness) that included many zero values, student symptoms were dichotomized. Fear and dizzin ess scores were dichotomized as \"0\" or 43 \">0\" and pain scores were dichotomized as \"0-2\" or \">2\". Groups were compared using a Generalized Estimation Equation (GEE) logistic regr ession, adjusted for clustering (school) and gender, consistent with our prior work 7. Analysis accounted for gender as previous work ha s suggested that high needle fear is more prevalent i n girls compared to boys 42 . Other dichotomous outcomes (fainting, post-vaccination symptoms, use of coping tools) were analyzed using GEE logistic regression or Chi squared test if there wa s zero frequency of an outcome. Student attitudes and compliance to the CARD were analyzed descriptively. 44 Chapter 4 - Results 4.1 Participant flow Study data was collected between September 2019 and November 2019. All 40 invited schools (65% of all eligible schools) participated in the s tudy. There were 900 students in CARD and 1019 students in control for a total of 1919 studen ts. A summary of participant flow is depicted in Figure 1 below. Figure 1.

However, students were als o eligible to receive Men C during their grade 7 sc hool year but were scheduled for the spring of 2020. One CARD stu dent was vaccinated against Men C only during the f all clinics. Due to our intent-to-treat approach to ana lysis, this student is still included in the study analysis. 4.4 Outcome measurements 46 4.4.1 Student fear, pain, dizziness, fainting and post-va ccine reactions Fear, pain, and dizziness scores were independently self-reported by students immediately after vaccination and are shown below in Table 8. Student fear and pain were lower in CARD compared to control: OR 0.65 (95% CI 0.47 - 0.90) a nd OR 0.62 (95% 0.50 - 0.77), respectively. There were 0 (0%) faints in CARD and 6 (0.8%) - 4 female, 2 male - faints in control (p=0.02). Each control faint occurred in a different school (i.e., faints were not clustered). Dizziness and post-vaccination reactions did not di ffer across groups. Details on post-vaccination reactions are outlined in Table 9. Female gender was associated with higher fear, pain and dizziness (p<0.001 for all analyses), but there was no group and gender interactions. ICCs were <0.02 for all applicable analyses. Table 8.

CARD students used the following coping tools more than control students: external distract ion items, privacy, peer support, deep breathing, topical anesthetics and muscle tension. The breakdown of use of distraction items is shown in Table 11. Control students used verbal dis traction and adult support more often than CARD students. These are the only two coping tools regularly offered to students in control schools (WDG usual care). Table 10.

Vaccinating nurses reported the use of all coping tools by 1422 students during vaccination (n=2 missing). Our team (n=2) observed the coping tools used by 90 and 72 students in CARD and control schools, respectively. Therefor e, we collected reliability data for 162 (11.4%) student vaccinations. Reliability between n urse report and observer report for use of student coping tools during vaccination can be seen below in Table 14. Table 14 presents the reliability data in terms of 'match' between nurse and observer report (i.e., both nurse and observer agreeing on the use/non-use of a coping to ol), or percent agreement for all items. In the CARD group, nurse and observer report were t he same for all students for use of privacy; peer support; adult support and laying down. Nurse and observer report varied by less than 5% for use of book; bubbles; spinners; squishy balls; topical anesthetics and muscle tension. The biggest variations between nurse and observer repor t were use of electronic devices and deep breathing. In control, nurse and observer report was the same for all students for use of bubbles; spinners; squishy balls; topical anesthetic; deep breathing a nd muscle tension (no use). Nurse and observer report varied by less than 5% for electronic device s; books; privacy; peer support; and laying down. The biggest variation between nurse and obser ver report for control was use of adult support. 50 Table 14.

CARD is an evidence-based framework for pla nning and delivering vaccinations in school settings. It is the only framework for deliv ering vaccinations at schools that is directly adapted from the CPG on pain management 8. CARD was designed to reduce student fear, pain and related reactions in a patient-centered approac h. CARD provides students with coping tools that they can use to improve their vaccination expe riences. In this study, we demonstrated that CARD reduced fe ar, pain and fainting for students in school- based vaccination clinics. We also showed that CARD students used more coping tools during vaccination, including distraction items, privacy, peer support, topical anesthetics and muscle tension compared to control students. As well, CARD students had positive attitudes towards the CARD system. These findings are consistent with pre vious pilot study research, where CARD in reduced student fear and dizziness and increased th e use of coping tools 92 . A few implementation issues were highlighted from s tudent feedback and nurse documentation (tracked on the TIDieR checklist). Confirming clini c space and private space presented the most challenges. Public health staff implementing CARD h ad difficulties honoring student-led coping when it involved more complex coping strategies, su ch as privacy, peer support, electronic devices and topical anesthetics. 5.2 Student fear, pain, dizziness and related respo nses 5.2.1 Primary outcome: Fear Student fear was selected as our primary outcome be cause it is well-documented that fear of needles is the biggest concern for students getting vaccinated at school 1,47,89. Our study showed that there was a statistically significant differen ce in the self-reported fear levels of students in CARD and control (Table 8). Fear scores were dichot omized at \"0\" or \">0\" as the distribution of fear scores were skewed and included a large number of 0 scores. While female gender was associated with higher fear, there was no group and gender interactions. This implies that CARD worked to reduce student fear, regardless of gender . 55 CARD is an adaptation of the CPG for school setting s designed - in part - to reduce student fear 8. Since CARD is based on an evidence-based guidelin e, and since any CPG adaptations were done with the feedback of key stakeholders (st udents; parents; school staff and public health staff), CARD is likely to have contributed t o the reduction in student fear as observed in our study. Our findings are also consistent with pr evious pilot study work, whereby CARD was shown to reduce student fear 7,92 . 5.2.2 Secondary outcome: Pain There was a significant reduction in pain for stude nts in CARD compared to control. Pain scores were dichotomized at \"0-2\" and \">2\" as the distribu tion of pain scores were skewed. Female gender was also associated with higher pain, but th ere were no group and gender interactions. Our findings suggest that CARD was effective in red ucing pain for both males and females. The same rationalization for why CARD is effective in r educing fear is also applicable for pain. This was the first study that documented significant red uction in pain when using CARD. In our previous work, CARD was not found to impact on stud ent pain 7. In Niagara, where the previous study was completed, students were not routinely of fered any pharmacologic interventions. Therefore, no students used pharmacologic intervent ions in Niagara. It is possible that this study's routine provision of topical anesthetic (wh ich are proven as effective in reducing pain) to CARD students was impactful in their reduced pain s cores compared to control students 65,76,77. 5.2.3 Secondary outcome: Dizziness There was no significant difference found in studen t dizziness between CARD and control students. Dizziness scores were dichotomized a \"0\" and \">0\" as the distribution of dizziness score were skewed, including many zero values. Fema le gender was associated with higher dizziness, but there were no group and gender inter actions. It could be expected from the literature that because CARD was effective in reduc ing student fear and pain compared to control that it would also be effective in reducing dizziness 92 . Previous pilot work with CARD did show less dizziness in CARD students compared t o control 7. While there was no significant difference, there was a trend towards lower dizzine ss in CARD schools. There are a couple of considerations that can explain the lack of signifi cance in dizziness between CARD and control 56 students. Not all components of CARD were implement ed equally well. It is possible that with stronger adherence to all CARD components, such as providing privacy or offering muscle tension, that dizziness could be significantly redu ced with the use of CARD. First, privacy is an important coping tool to provi de to students with high needle fear 47. Students with high needle fear are more likely to experience ISRRs, including high dizziness. Privacy can help students feel calm and not worry about their p eers watching 97. This helps reduce their fear, and by extension can act as a mechanism for reducin g dizziness. Therefore, not having routine access to privacy in CARD clinics could result in s imilar dizziness between CARD and control groups. Second, muscle tension is evidence-based an d recommended to reduce dizziness 102,103 . Muscle tension was not used frequently as only 8.6% of CARD students used it during vaccination. This could have contributed to the ine ffectiveness of CARD in WDG to reduce dizziness, as interventions specifically designed t o reduce dizziness were not routinely used by students. To address dizziness in the future, it is recommend ed that implementers emphasize the benefit on muscle tension and how it can contribute to reduced dizziness. Muscle tension is feasible and does not require additional clinic planning when ba lls are already available in CARD distraction kits. Alternatively, there is an evidence-base that suggests having individuals cross their legs during muscle tension is effective at reducing dizz iness 104 . Providing this as an alternative to using a ball during muscle tension can be considere d if the use of a prop is a deterrent to using muscle tension. It may be beneficial to include an explanation on using a prop during muscle tension to student education videos, so they are co mfortable using the technique. Nurses should consider offering muscle tension to students before vaccination and are encouraged to explain its value again to students that are interested. 5.2.4 Secondary outcome: Fainting The observed benefit of CARD on fainting is signifi cant and its clinical relevance should be emphasized. CARD was effective in reducing the inci dence of fainting (control = 0.8%; CARD = 0.0%; p<0.02). Faints are a dangerous post-vaccin ation response, due to the risk of hospitalization from injuries sustained during fall s and subsequent disability 51 . Fainting is 57 underreported as fainting without injury is not doc umented as 'fainting' in some areas. Still, even with this consideration, fainting is not a common o ccurrence post-vaccination. Reported rates ranging from 0.054/100,000 (0.000054%) to 88/100,00 0 (0.088%) 50 . While reports of fainting are more frequent in adolescents aged 11-18, our st udy documented 6 control faints in a population of 739 (0.8%). This is much higher (9 ti mes) than even the highest documented prevalence rates 39,50 . Additionally, control nurses all reported on the nurse feedback form that vaccine appointments took longer than usual when a student fainted. Therefore, not only is fainting dangerous, but it also hinders clinic flow as nurses need to spend more time monitoring students post-faint. In CARD schools where students used pain and fear mitigation strategies, no faints were documented. From these findings, we can suggest a mechanism for why significantly less faints (i.e., zero) happened in CARD schools. It is already documented that school vaccination settings contain factors that can exacerbate fear of needles and sub sequently precipitate fainting (visual and auditory cues, such as seeing needles or hearing ab out dramatized peer vaccination experiences) 47,82 . This is corroborated by our study findings as mor e faints occurred in control schools compared to anticipated baseline incidence (0.000054-0.088%) 50 . In addition to this, there is evidence that muscle tension (only used in CARD schools) mediates fainting by maintaining blood pressure. It is possible that mus cle tension was only encouraged for CARD students who presented with severe negative symptom s and a history of fainting. This can provide an explanation for why use of muscle tensio n in CARD reduced the incidence of fainting but did not result in a significant reduction of st udent dizziness. Muscle tension should be used to prevent dizziness for students that have more mild symptoms as well. Studies have demonstrated that use of muscle tension was effective in reducin g fainting symptoms specifically in women with high needle fear 105 . Therefore, there is an explicit link between fear of needles and fainting, and our study provides evidence that use of CARD re duces needle fear. By extension, it can be suggested that use of CARD is an effective mechanis m to reduce fainting by providing coping tools to mitigate against needle fear. 5.2.5 Secondary outcome: Post-vaccination stress re sponses Frequency 58 CARD and control both had 15 students with post-vac cination symptoms across 16 schools (8 CARD and 8 control). In both groups, 12 students ha d post-vaccination symptoms at a school that had at least one other student with symptoms a s well. Dizziness, headaches, and nausea were the three most frequently reported symptoms across both groups. Interestingly, 80% of CARD students with post-symptoms reported dizziness comp ared to 33% of control students. Dizziness as a post-vaccination symptom Students in CARD learned about symptoms that may ar ise following dizziness and were instructed on how to use muscle tension to avoid di zziness during their education sessions. It is possible that these sessions primed students to be more conscious of potential dizziness. Since there was no significant difference in the overall dizziness scores in CARD and control, it is unlikely that these education sessions increased th e dizziness CARD students' experienced, but rather, made these students' more comfortable in co mmunicating dizziness if they experienced it after their vaccination. It is also possible that C ARD nurses were biased to ask about dizziness when students returned to the clinic feeling unwell , if students required prompting to explain why they were feeling sick. There was no CARD scrip t to guide nurses when students came back to the clinic. During implementation training, CARD nurses were educated on how to use muscle tension and how CARD can work to reduce dizziness. Control nurses were not given this education, and WDG does not offer muscle tension to students under usual care. It is possible that this additional sensitivity/awareness of dizzi ness for CARD nurses led them to prompt students about feeling dizzy when they returned to the clinic. 5.3 Student use of coping tools CARD students used coping tools (including distract ion items, privacy, peer support, topical anesthetics, deep breathing and muscle tension) mor e often than control students. Control students used verbal distraction and adult support more often than CARD students. Research has shown that students want and value a variety of cop ing tools 7,88. Under WDG usual care, students are only routinely offered adult support ( typically the presence of another nurse) and verbal distraction (conversation with vaccinating n urse), which are the two coping tools that control students used more often than CARD students . Our study findings indicate that students use distraction items to cope with vaccination when available. We suggest that when students are 59 provided with an increased variety of coping tools, they will select from the tools rather than having a conversation with nurses. Use of coping tools were reported by nurses. Some c oping tools - including deep breathing and muscle tension - are more difficult to identify whe n not self-reported. This is because it is more challenging to determine their use. For example, if a student is using topical anesthetics or reading a book, it is easy for nurses to clearly id entify students' use of these as they are physical coping tools. Conversely for deep breathing, for ex ample, it was challenging to distinguish between regular breathing and deep breathing as a c oping tool, even if it was prompted by nurses during vaccination. Therefore, although CARD promot es student-led coping, having use of coping tools documented by nurses provides the oppo rtunity for bias in reporting, as nurses that suggest that a student use a coping tool might then report use of it (because they suggested it) when in fact the student never used it. We suggest that in the future, nurses do not report use of coping tools when they have suggested them, but rat her only when students have actively indicated that they have used a coping tool (i.e., by either using a physical coping tool or by verbally expressing that they have used subjective coping tools). Alternatively, future studies can consider having students' self-report their use of coping tools to avoid the discrepancies between student and nurse-led coping that occur when nurses report use. 5.3.1 Topical anesthetics Topical anesthetics are clinically effective in red ucing needle pain 5,78. The Government of Ontario website ( https://www.ontario.ca/page/vaccines-children-schoo l) recommends that parents/guardians ask their local public health uni t about using them for school-based vaccination clinics 106 . To our knowledge, no public health unit routinely offers them to students, however, and they need to be arranged by parents 86. WDG offered topical anesthetics (EMLA 107 ) to students as part of CARD implementation. All CAR D students were given the opportunity to request topical anesthetics prior to vaccination da y. If they were interested, their parents signed an additional consent form authorizing their use. T here was no cost to the student to receive the topical anesthetic. Barriers to implementation 60 Students and nurses both provided feedback on their experiences with topical anesthetics. Their feedback revealed some challenges with their implem entation 108 . First, from student survey feedback it was found that some students (2 student s; 10.5% that used topical anesthetic and provided feedback) complained about the wait times associated with using topical anesthetics. From focus groups with nurses, it was explained tha t after topical anesthetics were applied, students had to spend their 30-minute requisite tim e in the clinic waiting area. This meant that these students - who are likely more nervous since they wanted to use topical anesthetics in the first place - had to see many of their peers receiv e their vaccinations before them. Being in such anxiety-inducing spaces for extended periods of tim e may have increased students' distress. Second, nurses had mixed opinions on the value of t opical anesthetics (N.B., this information as collected as part of focus group discussions that a re not included in this thesis) 108 . Some nurses thought that it was important to offer topical anes thetics as some students have high fear and require more coping tools. However, other nurses th ought that they were not beneficial because they only reduced, rather than eliminated needle se nsations and required extensive planning. Future recommendations for implementation First, regarding students needing to wait for topic al anesthetic to become effective; it is recommended that students' receiving topical anesth etics are 1) made aware of the wait time in advance of education day so they can better prepare themselves and 2) are sent back to the classroom to wait so they are removed from clinic a rea, which may contain fear-inducing visual cues. Second, there is ample evidence that the use of top ical anesthetics is effective for reducing pain 108,109,110,111,112 . The CPG on pain mitigation also recommends the us e of topical anesthetics 5. Therefore, the benefit of topical anesthetics shoul d not be contested. Rather, the nurses concern about the efficacy of topical anesthetics highlight s the need for more education for CARD implementers. Future CARD implementers should be gi ven more training on the effectiveness of topical anesthetics so they can appreciate their va lue, despite the additional planning that they may require. CARD context experts should consider i ncorporating information about topical anesthetic effectiveness to educational videos. In summary 61 Our study has provided the first experience with ro utine offering of topical anesthetics to students in school-based vaccination clinics. Altog ether, 4.4% of all vaccinated students used topical anesthetics. It is important to note that m ore students (8.0%) indicated interest in using topical anesthetic but were unable to use them beca use they did not return the consent form (all 55 students that indicated interest were vaccinated but only 30 returned consent forms). Student and nurse feedback indicated that more refinement i s needed to the process of planning and delivering topical anesthetics, so they are impleme nted to their full benefit 108 . More research may be needed to determine if topical anesthetics are h elpful in reducing students' fear, pain and related reactions during school-based vaccination c linics after the recommendations regarding topical anesthetic wait times and training have bee n implemented. It may also be interesting to consider having students provide their own consent for topical anesthetics, but this may lead to additional implementation challenges if larger volu mes of students ask for topical anesthetic on clinic day. If student-led consent is challenging, it may be beneficial to consider incorporating topical anesthetic consent into the general vaccine consent form to ensure that parents actually see the topical anesthetic sign-off, as students ma y have misplaced the additional form. 5.3.2 Electronic devices In our study, electronic devices were defined as ce llphones, tablets or laptops. In CARD schools, 25.6% of students used an electronic device (by nur se-report on the nurse feedback form). In control schools, only 4.1% of students used electro nic devices. This indicates that students like to use electronic devices and will select to use them when given the opportunity. Barriers to implementation There were a few challenges with implementing elect ronic devices in the school vaccination clinics during our study. First, in CARD schools, t he use of electronic devices was decided by the school principal before the 2019 school year be gan. Nurses were instructed to recommend the use of cell phones to principals. If a principa l did not want to allow cell phones, they were asked to provide an alternative (such as Chromebook s/laptops). During education sessions, nurses were instructed to only suggest phones to st udents in schools that had principal-approval. Phones were approved for use at 70% of schools. How ever, in the fall of 2019, the Ontario premiere Doug Ford introduced a new policy to ban c ellphone use in schools 113 . The ban came 62 into place on November 4th , 2019. Six CARD school clinics occurred on Novembe r 4th or later, impacting the use of cellphones. Eighty percent of the schools that had clinics on or after November 4th had their education sessions before November 4th . Ultimately, for the schools that had education sessions after November 4th , cell-phones were still allowed in the vaccine cli nics if principals had originally approved their use during principal meetings. However, we had no way of knowing if the policy made students feel less co mfortable in bringing their cellphones as we do not know how the policy exception for vaccinatio n clinics was communicated to students. Second, there may be measurement error in documenta tion regarding this item. Based on researcher field notes, focus group transcripts and comments made by nurses on nurse feedback forms), it was determined that there may be a discr epancy in the definition of 'use' between the nurses and research team. The research team observe d less use of electronic devices because they determined that a student needed to not only bring the device to the vaccination, but also needed to actively engage in using it (i.e., screen on wit h the student looking at the screen). However, nurses were accepting bringing the device as suffic ient. Future recommendations for implementation First, to better manage student expectations for be ing able to use their electronic devices, communication should be strengthened between school staff and public health staff. At the principal meeting, it should be made clear that the principal should reach out to public health if there are any changes in school policies that could impact the school clinics. Additional details explaining this expectation of communication can be included in writing on the principal agreement. Second, to improve reliability between nurse and ob server report of use of electronic device, operational definitions of 'use' should be provided during implementer training sessions. As well, case scenarios detailing hypotheticals of stu dents bringing electronic devices to appointments but not using them can be included in training sessions so implementers can practice applying the operational definitions. 5.3.3 Privacy 63 Privacy was used by few students (6.6%) in CARD. Ac cording to student feedback during CARD development, privacy was defined as a separate room that had a closed door 8. In our previous work, privacy was used by 27% of students in CARD 88. Other research has also provided evidence that privacy is important, and a popular coping tool selected by students during vaccinations 46. There were a few challenges to implementation tha t may have resulted in less students using privacy during our study. Barriers to implementation Nurses reported fidelity to securing private space at all CARD schools. However, this is not consistent with observer reports, comments made on other documentation reports or in focus groups. First, in one school, there was no separate private space at all, and students (n=2) that wanted privacy were vaccinated in the main clinic s pace alone. While this was effective in providing students with clinic space, it disrupted the clinic flow as no other students could be vaccinated until the private appointment was comple ted. This disruption in clinic flow is also shown, as vaccinating nurses thought that both appo intments took 'longer than usual'. Interestingly, one of these two students had high f ear and pain scores (7 and 9 on scales from 0- 10, respectively) and the other one was unable to b e vaccinated due to high fear. This suggests that students requesting privacy are doing so to ma nage their needle fear. It is important to secure private space so that students have access to their coping tools as promised, and to manage clinic flow. Second, in two schools that had a nurse report the presence of a 'private space', the private space was far away from the main clinic space. Private sp aces should be close/within the main clinic space so that they are convenient to use. It appear s that the private spaces in these clinics were used less than in school clinics where there was a proper private space, as private spaces were used by 7% of students when the private space was a ccessible but only by 4% of students when they were far away. One student at a school where p rivate space was not accessible commented on how to improve their vaccination experience by ' more privacy'. Finally, at one of the two schools with a private s pace that was far away, the nurse and principal miscommunicated regarding the private space. The pr incipal interpreted 'private space' as 64 having a large main clinic space that would allow s tudents to be far away from each other. When this was resolved on vaccination day, the only priv ate space that was available was far away from the main clinic (on a separate floor). At this school, due to the inaccessibility of the private space and the inconvenience it would take for nurse s to go back and forth from the main clinic to the private space, the CARD nurses decided to triag e students that requested privacy by asking them if they would be satisfied by being vaccinated in the main clinic space while using privacy barriers. Through focus group discussions, nurses t hought this was an effective compromise as they could manage clinic flow while still provided students with privacy. However, at the 3 subsequent clinics (that had ideal private space) w here they continued to use this adapted privacy triaging method, many students provided feedback wi shing they had more privacy. In total, 5 schools had feedback from students requ esting more privacy, 1 of which had private space issues and 3 which immediately succeeded the clinic where the nurses changed their approach to private space. This indicates that stud ents do want more privacy when they are being vaccinated. When private spaces are inaccessible, i t may seem appealing to re-direct students to use other coping tools to manage clinic flow (I.e., settling for vaccinating in the main clinic space with a privacy barrier instead of a private r oom). However, as seen from student feedback, privacy is critical to creating positive vaccinatio n spaces. Future recommendations for implementation These findings suggest that more training is needed so that nurses understand the value of privacy for students during vaccination and are mor e comfortable in advocating for private space when communicating with principals. In real world s ettings, this additional training may take the form of an educational video segment that nurses ca n return to whenever necessary. CARD implementers should prioritize planning for accessi ble private spaces, so it is easier to meet student requests and manage clinic flow simultaneou sly. Second, more resources - such as fact sheets on the value of privacy, or scripts outlining how to communicate with principals - should be provided to nurses to use during principal meetings to secure a private space. It appears that some of the private spaces being relatively inaccessible was due to miscommunication between nurses and prin cipals. Scripts should be developed so 65 that principals 1) have a clear understanding of th e value of providing privacy 2) understand the requirements for privacy to be used successfully (e .g., close to the clinic, fully closed door). Third, more communication between the CARD nurses a nd research team is recommended in real time. The research team can help provide evide nce-based guidance and solutions to implementing complex interventions (like privacy) i f more regular communication is established. 5.3.4 Peer support Peer support was used more often in CARD than in co ntrol and was used by a total of 32.5% of all CARD students. This indicates that students lik ed having the option to bring a friend to their appointment. Friend support was also popular in our previous study, where 47.5% of students used peer support 7. Barriers to implementation Through nurse comments and feedback on study checkl ists, nurses discussed that the 'quality' of support person was variable. When students were abl e to remain calm, they were a positive resource and nurses felt like they helped the vacci nating student. However, sometimes the presence of another student would escalate the situ ation, and the nurse felt like the vaccination experience was more negative for the student receiv ing the vaccination. To ensure that the students' being selected as peer supports were a po sitive addition to the clinic, nurses should instruct the vaccinating student to communicate the ir expectations of their friend prior to injection. As well, nurses observed that sometimes vaccinating students would feel peer pressure when a different student would ask to be their support per son. To mitigate this in real time, nurses decided to bring students from the waiting area to their vaccination station alone. After reviewing the consent information, the nurse would then ask the student if they wanted to use a friend. This may have been beneficial to reducing p eer pressure, as students could say they were no longer interested in using a friend without bein g surrounded by their peers. However, it also may have discouraged some students from using frien d support as they had already begun the vaccination procedure and did not want to spend ext ra time going back to find their friend. 66 Future recommendations for implementation First, students should be educated on how to be a g ood peer support person during the education sessions. This could include an additional case sce nario in which the students had to model what it would look like to be a positive peer support du ring vaccination. Students should also be reminded at education sessions and the day of the c linic that a peer support doesn't need to be their best friend, but rather, a person that they t hink would be helpful to have during their vaccination. Second, students should be asked to confirm if they would like to use a friend privately, before entering the clinic space. This will reduce the eff ect of peer pressure on friend selection, but still allow students to use friends without extending the ir vaccination time if they would like to use support. 5.4 Student attitudes about vaccinations and CARD While not significant, students in CARD trended tow ards having more positive attitudes receiving vaccinations compared to control students (OR = 1.3, 95% Confidence Interval 1.0- 1.9). This is likely because students in CARD were educated on the value of vaccinations, the vaccination day process and how to mitigate against needle fear, pain and related reactions. Previous research has shown that education can impr ove students' self-efficacy and confidence in vaccinations as they are more familiar with the processes and understand the purpose of vaccinations. It has been demonstrated that childre n ages 7 to 9 have a reduced fear of needles and increased acceptance of future vaccinations aft er a training session about vaccines and needle injection 114,115 . CARD students also had positive attitudes towards t he CARD system. Students thought CARD helped them with getting their vaccinations and wou ld want to use CARD if they got another vaccination (median scores of 4.0 on a Likert scale of 1-5, where increasing scores are more positive). This indicates that students were satisf ied with the CARD system and reinforces that providing students with a patient-centered approach to their vaccinations is well-received. 67 5.5 Study strengths Pragmatic study approach Our study had various strengths. First, we used a p ragmatic study approach. Previous CARD pilot study research was conducted in Niagara using additional resources for an implementation leader and more regular communication and collabora tion of managers and researchers. This provided more support and guidance when Niagara pub lic health staff encountered implementation challenges, which allowed them to ge t resolved quickly and without impacting the adherence to the CARD system. However, our prag matic design allowed implementation to happen in 'real life practices'. This allows our re sults to be more easily translatable to other settings, as study results were obtained from imple menting CARD into otherwise standard practices (e.g., no additional staffing, no additio nal monetary resources required). Cluster design We used a randomized cluster trial design. This stu dy design had multiple strengths in and of itself. First, it allowed us to randomize at the cl uster (school) level rather than the individual (student) level. This was a strength as it reduced the likelihood for contamination. For example, many components of CARD are delivered on a cluster level, including student education. Delivering education on an individual level would i ncrease contamination, as students in the same school would belong to both CARD and control g roups. CARD students may tell their control peers about the CARD system. Second, our st udy design was also a strength regarding feasibility. For example, consider the CARD reminde rs. It increases the feasibility for reminder delivery when randomization occurs at a cluster lev el, as CARD principals can mass release reminders, or use the school announcement system to remind students about vaccinations. This would not be possible if CARD and control students were in the same school. Third, high quality cluster randomized designs account for the fact tha t groups (clusters) may be different and report an ICC. We did consider this in our study design as demonstrated a low ICC. Randomization, allocation, and baseline characteris tics Study schools were randomly allocated to study grou ps using a computer-generated program (randomize.net) which reduced selection bias. 68 Randomization was done with proportional representa tion by school board and school size (small, large). Schools in CARD and control groups had similar baseline characteristics (e.g., Number of public schools, number of small schools, SES). This is a strength at is it reduced risk of selection bias and ensured internal validity of the results and that baseline characteristics would not act as confounding variables to the study results. Collection of population level data Our study included a majority of the schools in the region (65%) and we collected population level data. We received approval from the Universit y of Toronto Research Ethics Board to waive consent for student participation in the study as p er Article 3.7A of the Tri-Council Policy Statement 2 96. Parents or guardians still needed to consent to t heir student's vaccinations, but there was no additional consent for study participa tion. This exemption was necessary to address the research question, as CARD is a population-leve l intervention system. The exemption was also granted as CARD does not have an adverse impac t on the welfare of participants as it is evidence-based and can be viewed as a quality impro vement project. Additionally, requiring an additional consent for the study may have confused parents and negatively impacted on vaccination uptake rates. Since all students in stu dy schools were included in data collection, and most regional schools were included in our study, o ur results have high external validity and are generalizable to similar populations and settings o utside of our study. Participants blinded to group/treatment assignment Students were blinded to the study hypothesis and g roup assignment. This helped to reduce bias in outcome assessment. If students in CARD knew tha t they were receiving special treatment, and that students in control schools were not using the patient-centered care system, they may have inflated positive results by overexaggerating the effect of CARD on their fear, pain and dizziness scores (social desirability bias). Parent s were also blinded to the study hypothesis and group assignment. Children often mimic their parent 's behaviours in vaccination settings. If CARD parents were aware of the study hypothesis, th ey could have contributed to observation bias by spending more time discussing the CARD syst em with their children, even if they were instructed not to disclose the hypothesis to the st udents. 69 Blinding of outcome assessors Control nurses were blinded to the study hypothesis and to the fact that the CARD system was being implemented in other schools. This helped red uce contamination (performance bias). If control nurses were aware of the study outcomes, th ey may have adjusted their usual practice to include more fear and pain mitigation strategies. T his would have undervalued the impact of CARD, as students in control would have been offere d interventions that were not a part of usual care and had lower symptom scores. CARD and control nurses were separated in their gro up assignment. A CARD nurse was not able to work at any control schools, and vice versa. Thi s was important as it reduced the likelihood for contamination. If CARD nurses worked at control clinics, it is possible that they would unintentionally use CARD interventions. Not only wo uld this dilute the positive effects of CARD, as control students would be provided with to ols to reduce their symptoms; but other control nurses would be able to pick up on the diff erent interventions and subsequently contaminate the study. To further reduce contaminat ion, CARD nurses were explicitly instructed not to disclose any details about CARD to the contr ol nurses if they interacted at the WDG public health offices. Reporting outcomes We used validated tools to collect our data. Our st udent survey used 11 numerical rating scales to report student fear, pain and dizziness. This scale has been validated for children 8 and older and its use is recommended by CPGs 5. NRS were also used in our previous CARD research, which proved they had construct validity in our context 7. Using validated data collection tools and methods helps reduce measurement bias in our study. We also used the same reporting tools and methods for both CARD and control group. This ensur ed that outcomes were measured the same, regardless of group assignment which reduced the li kelihood for confounding (e.g., if scores were asked at different times by group, time could have been a confounding variable). Additionally, students were requested to independen tly and self-report symptoms, which is the gold standard for reporting subjective symptoms. 70 As well, 11.5% of all student vaccinations were obs erved by researchers. Researchers and nurses had over 90% agreement for all coping tools. This i s a study strength as it shows that nurses were reliable in their report of coping tools used by st udents and that our study findings are accurate. Outcome analysis We used an intent to treat analysis. All participan ts were analyzed in the group (CARD, control) to which they were randomized, regardless of whethe r they were vaccinated against target vaccines or not. This ensures that the estimated ef fect of CARD is accurate and is not over/underexaggerated depending on which students r eceived vaccinations. Attrition/losses to follow-up Finally, we had a very low level of attrition in ou r collected data. All but nine vaccinated students completed a student survey and were includ ed in the analysis for the study primary outcome. This is a strength as it reduces the likel ihood of attrition bias and increases the generalizability of our results. 5.6 Study limitations Self-selection of participants Our study has a few limitations. First, our primary outcome of fear was only reported by students that were vaccinated. That is, students had to choo se to be vaccinated to complete student surveys and be included in our analysis. This intro duces the potential for self-selection bias, as students who agree to vaccination may have less fea r of vaccinations than students who refused to be vaccinated. Roughly 10% of children and adole scents refuse vaccination because of fear of needle pain 60,61,62 . If this prevalence rate held true for our study, the impact of CARD may have been underestimated as we were not able to examine it's impacts on those with severe needle fear as they did not participate in the study. Howe ver, risk of self-selection bias is reduced as students in control also needed to agree to vaccina tion, and students those that refused were also not included in analysis. Limited training for outcome assessors 71 Public health staff assigned to CARD schools needed to undergo training on how to implement the CARD system and were involved in provided feedb ack to refine implementation. However, training was only one day and communication between implementation staff and researchers was limited during school clinics. Deviation from CARD standards may have underestimated the effectiveness of CARD as it was not implemented ent irely as designed. These problems may have been reduced with increased communication and ongoing training during the study period. Reporting outcomes Students were asked to independently rate their fea r, pain and dizziness. Students completed their surveys during the 15-minute wait period post -vaccination. CARD students were asked to complete two extra questions about their attitudes towards CARD. If they were confused about the questions, they received clarity from the CARD registration clerk who was managing the post-vaccination clinic space. The registration cle rk was not blinded to study outcomes, this may have resulted in response bias as they may have inf luenced how the students responded in the way they clarified the survey questions. It is reco mmended that registration clerks (or those that are responsible for survey clarification) should be given more structured guidance on how to communicate with students when collecting data. As well, there was a risk of outcome detection bias from control nurses. While control nurses were blinded to study outcomes, they were aware tha t students were asked to report on their fear, pain and dizziness. They were also provided with a list of coping tools on the nurse feedback form. This may have prompted control nurses to use extra support outside of their usual care if they inferred the coping tools were related the stu dents' fear, pain and dizziness. This is a limitation, as if control nurses used more coping t ools than they would under usual care, the effects of CARD could have been underestimated. Reliability of reported outcomes Researchers were expected to complete inter-rater r eliability checks on 5-10% of all data collected by nurses on the coping tools used by stu dents. This was achieved, as we completed reliability checks on 11.4% of all nurse feedback f orms. While there was high inter-rater reliability for most coping tools, reports of elect ronic device use varied between nurse and 72 observer report. Nurses reported more use of electr onic devices than observers. Through feedback, it was communicated that nurses defined ' use' of electronic devices as the student bringing the device to the vaccination, while obser vers defined 'use' as the student actively engaging/turning on the device. This difference in report limits the validity of the magnitude of the effect. Using the nurse report of use of electr onic device may overestimate the use of electronic device as a coping tool, as students did not actually 'use' the coping tool. However, inter-rater reliability was still high for other co ping tools. In the future, more training is recommended. Nurses should practice completing nurs e feedback forms during some vaccinations where the collected data is not used f or outcome analysis, but rather to ensure correct entry. Researchers should provide operation al definitions for 'use' of coping tools. Follow-up Our study was supposed to be conducted over two rou nds of school clinics (Fall 2019, Spring 2020). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequ ent closure of Ontario schools, the second round of clinics were therefore not possible . Thus, only data form round 1 was collected. In our previous work, there was a significant inter action of group and time as student fear was significantly lower in CARD students at the second clinic, but not the first 7. CARD is a complex intervention system and may require time to learn. By only conducting our study over one clinic, CARD staff were given less time to refine implement ation. Therefore, the cancellation of the second round of clinics is a limitation as it may h ave resulted in the magnitude of CARD's effect on student fear, pain and dizziness being underesti mated. Generalizability Finally, the results of our study are limited to th e setting and population. We included various cities and townships within the WDG region in our s tudy. Areas had visible minority population percentages ranging from 1.90% (Fergus, Ontario) to 18.8% (Guelph, Ontario) 116,117 . While this range encompasses a higher visible minority populat ion percentage than Niagara region (9%) of our previous work, it is less than the Toronto Cens us Metropolitan Area visible minority population percentage of 51% (Canada's most diverse area) 118 . Larger cities are home to more visible minorities, as nearly all (98%) of Ontario' s visible minorities live in metropolitan areas 118. Therefore, our study results cannot be generalize d to larger cities that have higher 73 visible minority population percentages, as pain an d fear may be impacted by ethnicity 119,120 . As well, all students included in the study were in gr ade 7. More research is needed to confirm generalizability of results to other age groups, re gions outside of Southern Ontario and larger cities. 5.7 Clinical implications of study findings 5.7.1 Positive vaccination attitudes The CARD system can be used to reduce student fear, pain and incidence of fainting. CARD students use more coping tools than students in con trol. Students had positive attitudes about CARD. These findings indicate that the students had positive experiences in using CARD, and that their positive experiences resulted in decreas ed negative symptoms. It is possible that because of their more positive vaccination experien ce using CARD that may positively influence future vaccination acceptance although this would n eed to be tested. Of most importance is that in this pragmatic study, CARD did not require extra resources yet had a positive impact on fear and pain and fainting. 5.7.2 Potential to improve vaccination uptake Individuals who are fearful of needles can benefit from interventions to mitigate their fear and pain. Many children and adolescents avoid vaccinati on because they are afraid. Therefore, providing interventions to reduce fear and pain can also help to increase vaccination acceptance. It is important to examine the effectiveness of sys tems like CARD as increasing vaccination acceptance could potentially increase vaccination u ptake rates. Seeing as vaccines are critical for the maintenance of public health, CARD is a valuabl e intervention system that can have broad impacts across the globe. 5.7.3 CARD applications to COVID-19 In late 2019, a novel virus called 'severe acute re spiratory syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS- CoV-2) was discovered to cause the coronavirus dise ase, otherwise referred to as 'COVID-19'. COVID-19 has had detrimental effects for public hea lth on a global perspective, and in early 74 2020 COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic. One criti cal aspect to fighting against the COVID- 19 pandemic is for people to accept the COVID-19 va ccine. There are many reasons why people may be hesitant t o receive their COVID-19 vaccination, and with the rapid spread of misinformation uniquely sh rouding COVID-19 vaccines, hesitancy may be further increased 121 . It is important to remove any possible vaccination barriers so that community immunity can be reached as quickly as pos sible. Mass vaccination clinics are required to achieve high uptake rates as efficientl y as possible. Our study has shown that the CARD system is effective in mass vaccination settin gs and can be used as a framework to try to improve vaccination attitudes. In WDG, CARD was shown to reduce fear and pain from injection in a real-world school vaccination setting. This is important as 5-10% of people have been shown to refuse vaccines based on needle related fear and pain alone 4. Using the CARD system to reduce fear may improve attitudes towards receiving COVID-19 vaccin es. Additionally, the positive relationship between fai nting post-vaccination and negative attitudes towards vaccination is well documented 122,123 . Some individuals attribute fainting and the incidence of other ISRRs to vaccines rather than th e vaccination process, which increases their distrust in vaccines 34 . This is detrimental in the context of COVID-19, w here people are already concerned about vaccine development timelines and s afety 121 . Hearing about an ISRR and misattributing it to the vaccine rather than the pr ocess may be a deciding factor for someone receiving the COVID-19 vaccine or not. Our study do cuments that CARD is effective in reducing the incidence of fainting. This can be ben eficial in the context as COVID-19, as a reduction in fainting can reduce the spread of misi nformation regarding the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines. Finally, CARD encourages patients to advocate for t heir own individualized care. This can result in patients feeling more comfortable in requesting what they need to have a positive vaccination experience. Patients' preferences vary based on ind ividuals and their concerns. For example, a patient that is concerned about safety can use the \"ask\" CARD to talk to their healthcare provider 75 about vaccine side-effects. CARD promotes an open d ialogue between patients and providers that is important in mass vaccination settings to e nsure that patients have positive COVID-19 vaccination experiences and are confident in their decisions to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. 5.8 Future research directions 5.8.1 Different settings and populations CARD has now been evaluated in two public health re gions: Niagara (pilot study) and Wellington-Dufferin Guelph (pragmatic study). Both regions are in Southern Ontario. Research should look to examining different geographical are as, such as Northern Ontario or in other locations across Canada. First, it would be beneficial to examine CARD in mo re Northern regions as these public health regions may have different usual care practices, an d varying access to resources. As well rural remote locations may change student community persp ectives. It would be beneficial to learn about how CARD should be translated to these settin gs that have different needs and preferences compared to the Southern Ontario ones we have prese ntly examined. Second, students in Ontario are vaccinated against Hep B, HPV and Men-C in grade 7 30 . Across Canada, students are differing ages when receiving these vaccinations. For example, students in Quebec are in grade 4, and students in Alberta are in grade 9 21,32 . It would be beneficial to expand the evidence-base to these other populations to determine if CARD is generalizable to other populations. As well, students in different p rovinces may have different first languages so it is important to examine how CARD works when deli vered in English for these populations. As well, CARD should be implemented in other mass v accination settings. Due to the COVID- 19 pandemic, public health has become reliant on ma ss vaccination clinics to rapidly vaccinate large numbers of people. Many people still have nee dle fear into adulthood. It would be beneficial to examine CARD's effectiveness in these novel mass vaccination settings, and in adult populations. Research may be required to adap t CARD for older populations, or in mass 76 vaccination settings where there are different stak eholders involved in the planning and delivery of vaccinations. In the future, it may be also beneficial to collect information on student ethnicity and report on the diversity of study populations. Ethnic backgrou nd can play an important role in needle fear and pain perceptions 42 . Fear and pain are subjective experiences and can be influenced by various factors, such as family perceptions and pre vious healthcare interactions, both of which have relationships with ethnicity 119,120 . Collecting data on student demographics will allo w future research to analyze if students from various backgr ounds have different preferences and therefore, need CARD modifications, and if CARD is equally effective across ethnicities. Finally, future research should further investigate the preferences of boys and girls. While our study showed that CARD was effective in reducing st udent fear and pain for both genders, it is documented that high needle fear disproportionally effects girls 46. Future analysis can examine if girls use different or multiple coping tools compar ed to boys. This can help determine if CARD modifications need to be provided to students based on gender. 5.8.2 Quality improvement study approaches From our past two CARD studies collectively, we hav e demonstrated that CARD is effective in reducing student fear, pain and dizziness. Future s tudies should work on reducing the implementation barriers that have been identified i n this study. There is a learning curve associated with the CARD system, as it is a complex intervention system that requires a deep understanding of its core principles (e.g., the val ue of pain management, the importance of patient-centered care) and time to refine implement ation to local settings. Integrating the CARD system in its entirety for the first time during a study that evaluates its effectiveness does not provide enough time for learning and implementation refinement. In the future, we recommend different study approaches. One option is to provide a \"run-in\" or \"practice ph ase\" where public health units use CARD and study documentation in school clinics, but where th e data are not collected to determine 77 outcomes. The documentation collected would instead rather be used inform CARD implementation during the real data collection phas e. A different option would be to use a quality improv ement study design. In this option, different CARD components could be subsequently integrated ov er time. This would allow for implementers to plan and use CARD components in mor e 'manageable' parts; then study and reflect on how implementation went and potentially adjust before moving on and adding in the next layer of components 124 . This would give future implementers more time to communicate with CARD researchers on the implementation of comp lex interventions, as well as allow more time for them to 'buy-in' to the value of CARD. 5.9 Conclusions Our randomized controlled trial demonstrated that C ARD was effective in reducing student fear, pain and fainting. There was no difference in dizzi ness or post-vaccination reactions. Students in CARD used more coping tools than students in contro l. CARD was positively received by students. Inter-rater reliability in nurse and researcher rep ort of use of coping tools was generally high, except for use of electronic devices. In the future , the research team should provide clear operational definitions for use of various coping t ools and more training on data collection to improve reliability. Fidelity to the CARD system wa s high, but more guidance is recommended in reference to private space, topical anesthetics and peer support for future implementation. Overall, CARD is a promising vaccine planning and d elivery intervention system that promotes having patients at the centre of their healthcare. More work should be done to implement CARD in various settings and populations so it can be ea sily integrated into all mass vaccination services, including school and COVID-19 vaccine cli nics. 78 Appendix 1.

Please be sure you have returned the signed consent form to the school indicating your decision about these immunizations. If you have any questions, contact the Public Health Nurse. Immunizing your child at school is convenient. Some students can be nervous about getting a needle. We plan to teach ways to make the immunization experience more comfortable using The CARD System (C-Comfort, A-Ask, R- Relax, D-Distract). This method is described in a pamphlet that was sent home with the Consent form(s) and is also attached to this email. For additional information, video links about CARD are included below. You can help your child by reviewing this information with them. Other ways you can help on immunization day are: pack a snack, if possible have your child wear a short-sleeved shirt or something easy to roll-up to the shoulder remind your child to play their CARDs ! This can include bringing a personal item from home to use as a distraction during immunization (such as an ipad, book, or toy). We want to work together with the school community to make the immunization program a positive experience for students. We value your support and assistance in making these immunization days successful. \u0002 Students - immunization information https://youtu.be/z57vTp b19wQ 104 o Students will watch this video during the nurse teaching session when the consents are handed out in class.
