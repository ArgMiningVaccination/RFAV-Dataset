However, roles for IL-33 in promoting CD8, Th1, and T regulatory cell responses have also emerged. In this study, the role of IL-33 as a regulator of particulate vaccine adjuvant-induced Ag-specific cellular immunity was investigated. We found that polymeric nanoparticles surpassed alum in their ability to enhance Ag-specific CD8 and Th1 responses. IL-33 was a potent negative regulator of both CD8+ T cell and Th1 responses following i.m. vaccination with Ag and nanoparticles, whereas the cytokine was required for the nanoparticle enhancement in Ag-specific IL-10. In contrast to the effect on cellular immunity, Ab responses were comparable between vaccinated wild-type and IL-33-deficient mice. IL-33 did not compromise alum-induced adaptive cellular immunity after i.m. vaccination. These data suggest that IL-33 attenuates the induction of cellular immune responses by nanoparticulate adjuvants and should be considered in the rational design of vaccines targeting enhanced CD8 and Th1 responses. Introduction Vaccines are one of the most successful tools contributing to improved global health. However, despite the success of existing vaccines, further research into safe and efficient vaccination is required to combat challenging diseases, including cancer, tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and HIV, and emerging infectious agents and to overcome the suboptimal protection conferred by several existing vaccines. Currently there is a move toward subunit vaccines, which do not use whole organisms but instead incorporate specific Ags into formulations containing adjuvants. In these subunit vaccines, adjuvants are required to increase vaccine efficacy by enhancing or directing Ag-specific response ( [1](javascript:;)). Alum is advantageous as a vaccine adjuvant because of its safety record, Ag stabilization, and stimulation of high and sustained Ab titers but is a poor inducer of cellular immunity, particularly of Th1 responses ( [2](javascript:;)). Furthermore, the mechanism underlying the adjuvanticity alum to be fully elucidated ( [1](javascript:;), [3](javascript:;)). Polymeric micro- and nanoparticles have been proposed as alternative vaccine adjuvants with a greater potential to induce cellular immunity ( [4](javascript:;)- [6](javascript:;)) and consequently may find application in the development of vaccines against intracellular pathogens and cancer. However, despite ongoing efforts, there are currently no nanoparticle-based vaccines in clinical use, and the mechanisms by which nanoparticles induce and direct innate and adaptive immune responses remain unclear. Innate immune cells, particularly dendritic cells, activate the adaptive immune system over a 4- to 5-d time period, during which clonal expansion of Ag-specific effector cells occurs ( [7](javascript:;)). Adjuvants can dictate the magnitude and type of innate immune responses triggered following vaccination with a direct effect on the nature of the ensuing adaptive immune response. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying adjuvant-induced cellular immunity can provide valuable design principles for rational vaccine development. In 1983, data emerged identifying the adjuvant properties of IL-1 ( [8](javascript:;)) and since then, several members of the IL-1 family have been examined for their adjuvanticity, IL-1, is released necrotic cell death and is thus considered an alarmin or damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) ( [10](javascript:;)). On binding of IL-33 to transmembrane ST2 on IL-1RAcP joins the complex, MyD88, IRAK1, and IRAK4; activating Th2-associated cytokine production ( [10](javascript:;)). In addition to its defined role in promoting Th2 responses, IL-33 has also been described as a critical cofactor in driving antiviral Th1 ( Because polymeric particulate adjuvants do not generally express pathogen-associated molecular patterns, it has been proposed that DAMPs such as IL-33 play a key role in particulate-driven innate and adaptive immunity ( [15](javascript:;)). i.p. injection of alum triggered IL-33 release, which was required for rapid local cytokine and chemokine release, but although IL-33 itself showed adjuvant properties when injected with an Ag, it was dispensable for alum-induced Ab responses ( [16](javascript:;)). Alum can induce modest Ag-specific responses by i.p. ( [17](javascript:;)) or i.m. routes ( [18](javascript:;)). However, the role of IL-33 in cellular immune responses induced by alum or other particulate adjuvants has not been explored. Therefore, this research set out to determine the role of IL-33 in the induction of cellular immune responses by nanoparticles and alum. Materials and Methods Reagents The following adjuvants and Ags were used: Alhydrogel (Brenntag Biosector), referred to nanoparticles (50 nm) (Phosphorex); endotoxin-free OVA as \"OVA\" in manuscript; and H56 fusion protein comprising (BD Pharmingen) was used a positive to activate T cells. RPMI 1640 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 g/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies) was used to prepare complete RPMI (cRPMI). T cell media was prepared using cRPMI supplemented with 0.04 mM 2-ME (Life Technologies), 0.88 mM sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies), 0.88 mM l-glutamine 0.88% (v/v) 100\u00d7 MEM Vitamins (Life Technologies). Type 1 collagenase was purchased from Life Technologies, and DNase I from bovine pancreas was purchased from Sigma. Animals All animals were maintained according to the European Union and Irish Department of Health regulations. Experiments were conducted under the project authorization number AE19136/P079 and the individual license number AE19136/I258 and were approved by the Trinity College Dublin Animal Research Ethics Committee (ethical approval number 091210) and the Health Products Regulatory Authority. All mice were on a C57BL/6 background, with wild-type (WT) mice obtained from in-house colonies (derived originally from Charles River Laboratories) at the Comparative Medicine Unit in the Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin. Il33/ mice ( [20](javascript:;)) were provided by S. Nakae (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan), and Il1rl1/ (referred to as St2/) mice were provided by Prof. A. McKenzie ( [21](javascript:;)) (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K.). All animals were specific pathogen-free, maintained in individually ventilated cages, and handled in laminar flow units. Both males and females were used as no sex-linked differences were found during vaccination studies. In all experiments C57/BL6J, Il33/, and St2/ mice were age- (8-12 wk old) immunizations injected using 27G tuberculin syringes via the i.m. route with g/mouse), g/mouse), alum (1 mg/mouse), or nanoparticles (1 mg/mouse); a total volume of 50 l was injected in each thigh. Mice were primed on day 0 and boosted on day 14 with the same formulations. On day 21, mice were euthanized via cervical dislocation, and spleens, inguinal lymph nodes, and blood samples were collected. Isolation and culture of splenocytes and lymph nodes Splenocytes and cells from the draining lymph nodes were plated in T cell media at 2 \u00d7 106 cells/ml in sterile 96-well round-bottom plates (200 l/well) and cultured for 3 d with medium, Ag, or plate-bound anti-CD3 (0.2 g/ml). IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, and determined by ELISA. Serum Ag-specific Ab titers were determined using isotype-specific Abs. Isolation of serum Whole blood was collected on day 21 and kept at 4\u00b0C until the clot was formed. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 8000 \u00d7 g. Serum was collected and used for titers. Tetramers During tetramer analysis, 2 \u00d7 107 splenocytes or 2.5 \u00d7 106 lymph node cells were stained. An OVA-specific MHC class H-2 Kb/SIINFEKL tetramer purchased from MBL or provided by the National Institutes of Health Tetramer Core Facility (Emory University) was used. Splenocytes and cells from the draining lymph nodes were stained with the tetramer in T cell media for 2 h at 37\u00b0C in a tissue culture incubator (95% humidity and 5% CO2) with gentle shaking. A total of 2.5 l of tetramer was used per 200 l of sample. Flow cytometry staining then proceeded as described below. Tetramer staining for flow cytometry Lymph node cells and splenocytes were prepared as described above. The cells were pelleted via centrifugation at 400 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatants were removed, and the cells were washed by resuspending them in 1 ml of PBS before being centrifuged again at 400 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. All subsequent wash steps were conducted in this manner. Once washed, the supernatants were removed, and the cells were resuspended in a viability stain (Fixable Viability Stain 510 or 700; BD Biosciences) used at a 1/500 dilution with PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 10 min at 4\u00b0C with 100 l of FACS buffer supplemented with anti-CD16/CD32 mAbs to block FcRII/III (0.5 l/sample). Cells were then ready to be stained with the fluorochrome-labeled Abs prepared in FACS buffer (in combination with Brilliant Violet buffer, where required) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C in darkness. Abs used are were washed once again with PBS before being fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (200 l/tube) for 20 min at 4\u00b0C in darkness. Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 200 l of FACS buffer, ready for acquisition. At least 1 \u00d7 106 single, live cells were acquired for analysis. Intracellular cytokine staining Cells were plated in T cell media at 2 \u00d7 106 cells/ml, stimulated with and without the Ag of interest or a positive control (anti-CD3) at the concentrations outlined in the figure legends, and incubated for 1.5 h at 37\u00b0C in a tissue culture incubator (95% humidity and 5% CO2). Brefeldin A was added at a final concentration of 10 g/well to block cytokine release. Cells were incubated for 3.5 h, after which the plates were centrifuged at 400 \u00d7 g for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed. Cells were resuspended in a viability stain (as described above). Cells were then ready to be stained with the fluorochrome-labeled extracellular marker Abs (as described above) prepared in FACS buffer (mixed with Brilliant Violet buffer, where required) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C in darkness. Cells were washed again with PBS before being fixed in Fix/Perm solution (eBioscience) and left overnight at 4\u00b0C in darkness. Cells were washed in permeabilization buffer (eBioscience), resuspended in permeabilization (0.5 l/sample), and incubated for 10 min at 4\u00b0C in the dark. Intracellular staining was then carried out the presence of intracellular IFN- (clone XMG1.2; BD Pharmingen), and the cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in darkness. Cells were washed with 1 ml of permeabilization buffer. Once washed, the cells were resuspended in 200 l of FACs buffer, ready for acquisition. ELISA Concentrations of the cytokines IL-4, IL-10, IL-17 (BioLegend), and IFN- (R&D Systems) were determined using commercially available kits. Ag-specific serum Ab titers were measured using the following: goat anti-mouse total IgG purchased from Southern Biotech (working biotin from AbD Serotec (working concentration 1/2000 dilution). Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism V6.04 software. An unpaired t test was used to compare the means of two groups. The means of three or more groups, with one variable, were compared using one-way ANOVA. Where significant differences were observed, the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test was used to identify differences between individual groups with an unequal number of samples, whereas the Bonferroni multiple comparison test was used elsewhere to compare differences between selected groups. Results IL-33 is a negative regulator of nanoparticle-driven Ag-specific CD8+ T cell responses Polymeric nanoparticles are regarded as promising vaccine adjuvants for enhancing cell-mediated immunity. In this study, we found that polystyrene nanoparticles are strong drivers of Ag-specific cellular immunity following i.m. vaccination, being significantly more potent inducers of Ag-specific CD8+ T cells and Th1 responses than the widely used vaccine adjuvant, alum ( [Fig. 1](javascript:;)). Mice were primed i.m. with OVA alone, OVA plus alum, or OVA plus nanoparticles on day 0 and boosted on day 14; PBS alone was used as vehicle control. Seven days after the booster, Ag-specific CD8+ T cells were quantified in spleens and lymph nodes using H-2 Kb SIINFEKL tetramers via flow cytometry. A suitable gating strategy was developed, allowing for the identification of CD8+ CD44+ tetramer+ cells ( [Supplemental Fig. 1](/jimmunol/article-supplement/107358/pdf/ji_1800833_supplemental_figure_1/)). induce a detectable population of Ag-specific CD8+ T cells, this was significantly smaller than that induced by vaccination with Ag and nanoparticles ( [Fig. 1A](javascript:;), [1B](javascript:;)). Ag restimulation of splenocytes from these mice revealed that vaccination with OVA and nanoparticles, but not OVA and alum, ( Because establishing the mechanisms underlying adjuvanticity is a priority to facilitate rational vaccine design, we addressed the role of the alarmin IL-33 in nanoparticle-induced cellular immunity. C57BL/6 (WT) and Il33/ mice were vaccinated i.m. as above, and CD8 responses were measured 7 d after booster vaccination. IL-33 was found to negatively regulate the capacity of nanoparticles to promote the induction of Ag-specific CD8+ T cell responses in both the spleen ( negatively but not Ab responses, following i.m. vaccination Having shown that IL-33 is a negative regulator of nanoparticle-induced Ag-specific CD8+ T cell responses, it was important to further elucidate the role for IL-33 in nanoparticle-driven cytokine responses, particularly the Th1 responses combatting intracellular pathogens. Strikingly, the nanoparticle-driven Ag-specific Th1 response was significantly higher in Il33/ mice than in WT mice, indicating a strong negative regulation by IL-33 ( [Fig. 3A](javascript:;)). In contrast, vaccination with nanoparticles and OVA strongly enhanced Ag-specific IL-10 response, and this was partially dependent on IL-33, particularly when using a low dose of Ag to restimulate the cells ( [Fig. 3B](javascript:;)). Vaccination with OVA and nanoparticles did not induce a detectable Ag-specific IL-4 or IL-17 response in either WT or Il33/ mice (data not shown). [Close modal](javascript:;) In contrast to the potent inhibitory role in nanoparticle-induced Th1 responses, serum Ag-specific Ab titers in mice vaccinated with OVA and nanoparticles were comparable between WT and Il33/ vaccination with the candidate TB Ag, H56 To further examine the role for IL-33 as a negative regulator of nanoparticle-driven Ag-specific Th1 responses, and to determine if this negative regulation also applied with a more clinically relevant Ag, the candidate Mycobacterium tuberculosis vaccine fusion Ag H56, comprising Ag85B, ESAT-6, i.m. with H56 alone or H56 and nanoparticles on days 0 (prime) and 14 (boost); PBS was used as a control in WT nanoparticle-induced H56-specific IFN- production by restimulated cells. To identify the source of the Ag-specific IFN-, splenocytes were stained intracellularly with restimulation with H56 or anti-CD3. An appropriate gating strategy was established for the identification of intracellular ( [Supplemental Fig. response, principally associated with CD4+ T cells, was increased in the splenocytes of mice Th1 responses. IL-10 responses ( [Supplemental Fig. 1B](/jimmunol/article-supplement/107358/pdf/ji_1800833_supplemental_figure_1/)). In contrast to the negative regulation observed for IFN-, we found that IL-33 was necessary for the nanoparticle-induced were IL-10 production with the nanoparticulate vaccine. IL-33 does not negatively regulate alum-induced Ag-specific cellular immune responses following i.m. vaccination Given the role we found for IL-33 in nanoparticle adjuvanticity and the importance of alum as a clinically used vaccine adjuvant, we addressed whether alum-induced Ag-specific cellular immune responses were also negatively regulated by IL-33. Whereas i.m. injection of Ag and alum induced a modest population of Ag-specific CD8+ T cells, IL-33 was dispensable for this response in the spleen addition to assessing Ag-specific CD8 responses in these mice, we assessed whether i.m. vaccination with alum induced a splenic OVA-specific cytokine response and if this was regulated by no splenocyte Ag-specific cytokine production was detected WT or IL-33-deficient mice vaccinated with OVA and alum (data not shown). i.m. vaccination with alum and OVA induced a potent Ag-specific IgG response, but this was not dependent on IgG2c titers, there was no statistically significant difference in the response between WT and IL-33-deficient mice ( We a potent negative regulator of Ag-specific Th1 and CD8+ T cell responses induced by a nanoparticulate adjuvant. Because cellular immune responses including CTL and Th1 cells are critical for protection against intracellular pathogens, this research sought to employ the use of an adjuvant capable of driving both Ag-specific CD8+ T cell responses as well as a Th1 response following the clinically relevant route of i.m. immunization. We show that in contrast to alum, small polymeric nanoparticles are strong inducers of cellular immunity, pointing toward their potential in new-generation subunit vaccines. The mechanism employed by polymeric nanoparticles in the induction of Ag-specific T cell responses has received limited attention. Thus, the role of IL-33 in nanoparticle-driven cellular and humoral immune responses was addressed. Our data indicate that IL-33 inhibits nanoparticle-driven Ag-specific CD8+ T cell and Th1 responses. A positive role for IL-33 was demonstrated in IFN- production by CTL [cultured with IL-12 alone or together with IL-33 ( [12](javascript:;))] and in the context of a viral infection [in which IL-33 deficiency lea to reduced NK-cell IFN- production during acute viral hepatitis ( [22](javascript:;))]. IL-33 promoted IFN- production from hepatic T ( [22](javascript:;)). An enhancing effect of IL-33 on IFN- production by T cells was shown in the context of skin inflammation ( [23](javascript:;)). Our data contrasts with these findings regarding the effects of IL-33 on IFN- producing cells and uncovers a novel role for the cytokine in negatively regulating Th1 responses in the context of i.m. vaccination with a nanoparticulate subunit vaccine. There have been a number of previous reports on cross-regulation between IL-33 and IFN- ( [24](javascript:;)), including helminth infection of IL-33 as a negative regulator of nanoparticle-induced IFN- production following i.m. injection, the role of its receptor, ST2, in particle-induced Th1 responses was also investigated. Despite the IL-33/ST2 axis being implicated in several inflammatory conditions, there have also been reports that ST2 may act in an IL-33-independent manner. For example, in the murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, induction of pathology was IL-33 independent ( [20](javascript:;)), whereas deficiency of ST2 increased severity ( [25](javascript:;)). In the current study, the outcome of ST2 deficiency was comparable to that of IL-33 as both negatively regulated nanoparticulate adjuvant-induced Th1 responses, implicating the ST2/IL-33 axis as a key negative regulator of IFN- production after vaccination. This was shown for both the model Ag OVA and for the clinically relevant TB Ag H56. IL-33 has been implicated in driving protective CD8+ T cell responses to viral infections such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and herpes virus through its interaction with ST2 on CTLs, enhancing clonal expansion and ultimately determining effector cell differentiation, resulting in virus control ( [13](javascript:;)). Furthermore, in the context of a DNA vaccination approach, IL-33 enhanced Ag-specific effector cells and effector memory CD8+ T cell responses ( [14](javascript:;)). In contrast, our findings demonstrate that IL-33 reduces nanoparticle-driven Ag-specific CD8+ T cell generation. The route of vaccination may impact the role of IL-33 in vaccine-induced immunity. For example, myoblasts ( [27](javascript:;)) in humans and mice have been identified to constitutively express nuclear IL-33 ( [28](javascript:;)), so IL-33 may be a key regulator in the case of vaccination in the muscle. It may thus be difficult to compare outcomes from different routes of vaccination in mice with vaccine-induced responses in humans, highlighting the importance of using the i.m. route when possible. Other DAMPs, specifically uric acid ( [29](javascript:;)) and host DNA ( [30](javascript:;)) released following i.p. injection of alum, have been proposed to play key roles in its adjuvanticity. However, the adjuvant mechanisms may differ following vaccination by the more clinically relevant i.m. route. In this study, we found that IL-33 was dispensable for alum-induced Ag-specific CD8 responses and Ab production following i.m. vaccination. In conclusion, we demonstrate that IL-33 is a potent negative regulator of nanoparticulate adjuvant-induced cellular immunity. This suggests that the inclusion of an IL-33 or ST2 inhibitor in nanoparticulate vaccines may provide a strategy to enhance Ag-specific cytotoxic and Th1 immune responses.
