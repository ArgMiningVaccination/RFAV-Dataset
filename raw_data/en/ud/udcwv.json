Healing Touch is an energy therapy in which practitioners consciously use their hands in a heart-centered and intentional way to support and facilitate physical, emotional, mental and spiritual health. Healing Touch is a biofield (magnetic field around the body) therapy that is an energy-based approach to health and healing. Healing Touch uses the gift of touch to influence the human energy system, specifically the energy field that surrounds the body, and the energy centers that control the flow from the energy field to the physical body. These non-invasive techniques employ the hands to clear, energize, and balance the human and environmental energy fields, thus affecting physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health. It is based on a heart-centered, caring relationship in which the practitioner and client come together energetically to facilitate the client's health and healing. The goal of Healing Touch is to restore balance and harmonies in the energy system, placing the client in a position to self heal. What Is Reiki? The name reiki is derived from two Japanese words, rei meaning universal and ki means life force. We are made up of a Universal energy that emanates within and beyond our physical body. Reiki is a natural therapy that gently helps to balance this energy and brings health and well being to the recipient. Practitioners are able to access it to facilitate healing and spiritual growth for themselves and help guide it to others. Reiki flows through the practitioner from an unlimited source of Universal energy that they then channel to depleted or unbalanced energy centers that are located throughout our bodies. When it is practiced routinely it can promote good health. It is also an effective complementary therapy that can be combined with any medical treatment. This is not a replacement for professional medical care, but is meant to enhance our capacity for healing. There is no need to follow any religious belief or dogma in order for this therapy to work. The only requirement is for the recipient to be open to receiving the Reiki energy. The practice of Reiki can be easily embraced by all walks of life. This type of energy work involves all aspects of our being, mind, body and spirit. By addressing these aspects as a whole we can bring harmony to our lives and avoid manifesting disease. My sessions are a combination of different techniques selected for each individual client based upon their needs and goals. I embrace my intuition to guide me to facilitate the greatest healing. healing sessions investment Personal Healing sessions (Reiki/Healing Touch) - 60 minute $75 - 90 minute $100 Couples Harmonizing Sessions $125 (Reiki/Healing Touch, 60 minutes) What a beautiful way to bring your energies into alignment and build intention into your relationship. This technique involves two practitioners working together as the couple each lay upon a reiki table next to each other. They are close enough to hold hands if they choose. The practitioners goal is to create a harmonious blend of the couples energies infused with love and compassion. Distance Healing with Grid- $55 Reiki can be sent to anyone, anywhere. Energy is not limited by space or time. If there is someone you would like distance healing sent to, I would be happy to facilitate that. I incorporate crystal grids in this service for continued healing work. To find out more contact me, Anita, at 302-222-4804 or This email address is being protected from spambots.

It can be facilitated for a one on one practice or for a group. This guided meditation session is wonderful for couples beginning their lives together, husbands and wives who would like to reconnect or deepen their connection, families that would like to honor each other or friends who would like to be more present in their journey together. Ask about the other guided meditations I offer. Energetic House Clearing Spaces and places hold the energy of events, emotions, and activities that have occurred within them. A clearing can help to release these stuck, dense energies making way for harmony and peace. This helps to raise the vibration and fill the home with love and light. A good time to consider this service is: - when moving into a new home - after a divorce or separation - when there has been an argument or emotional trauma in the home - when a new member joins the family - after an illness or death - when things just are not going right - just because there feels like a heaviness to the energy Each clearing is created specifically for each home. The owners participate in the clearing ritual. Pricing starts at $125. What a Healing Session Looks Like You should arrive at your session in comfortable, loose-fitting clothing. There is no need to remove any clothing for treatment, but tight fitting or restrictive clothing may distract from relaxation. You may want to remove jewelry and watches for increased comfort, but this is not necessary to receive energy work. It is a good idea to wear socks as you will be asked to remove your shoes for the session and this will help to maintain warmth. Sometimes during deep relaxation body temperatures can drop. It is necessary to remove eye glasses. Energy work can be performed in a variety of positions depending on the need of the recipient. It is most commonly administered while the recipient is lying face up on a massage table. Pillows will be used under your knees and head for added comfort. If there is a situation where lying on a table is not possible due to a condition or if a table is not available, you could have a session done while seated in a chair or laying on a bed if necessary. Soothing music is usually incorporated into your session to help achieve relaxation. If you prefer a different selection of music or no music at all do not hesitate to share that with me. My goal is your comfort. Other techniques that may be intregrated are sound therapies, crystals and aromatherapy. The treatment itself consists of a series of hand positions where I place my hands gently on or slightly above the body. If you are receiving a back technique you will be asked to turn over onto your stomach. Again, if this is not possible the work can be done while seated in a chair or laying on your side. During the session you usually reaches a very relaxed state similar to meditation. Everyone experiences healing sessions differently and each session is unique. I have had client share a variety of different sensations while on the table. When the session is completed you will be gently invited to return to full awareness. I work in home, in hospital (Bayhealth Kent General) and in studio (you will love the cottage). Travel costs may apply.
