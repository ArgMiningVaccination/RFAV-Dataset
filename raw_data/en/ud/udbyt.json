I still HIGHLY recommend the L.c. of acirema products, which you can purchase by visiting their Etsy shop here: [http://www.etsy.com/shop/lcofacirema](https://www.etsy.com/shop/lcofacirema). You can also watch my more recent review (2015) of L.c.'s products in the video below: Welcome to the first installment of the 2012 Non-Toxic Summer Skin Care Series! I am very excited to get this series rolling and I hope you are too! The first company I am featuring is [L.c. of acirema](https://www.etsy.com/shop/lcofacirema). L.c. of acirema is my friend Lori's company and I am totally in love with her non-toxic herbal skin care products. Lori is a SAH mom of two adorable boys. She creates almost all of her family's body care products, which includes a wide range of scented oils, healing salves, facial cleansers, toners, and more! Her products are highly focused on herbs and essential oils. She has completed over 1,300 hours of studies from the Rocky Mountain Center for Botanical Studies in Boulder, CO. Lori is very particular about the ingredients that she uses in her products. Because of her training and her focus on high-quality ingredients, you can rest assured that her products are safe and effective, yet quite affordable. She will not sell anything that she, herself, would not use. Lori provided me with a wide range of samples, which was fantastic, because I got to experience products that I may have otherwise not known about! So, let's get started! DISCLOSURE: I was provided samples of these products at no charge. I was under no obligation to post a review or giveaway, nor did I receive any monetary compensation for this post. All views and opinions expressed are my own. [Read our full terms and conditions here](https://www.deliciousobsessions.com/about/disclaimer/). L.c. of acirema Product Review Mug Preference Facial Oil Cleanser. \"Your mug knows what's good for it.\" This product is sort of an all purpose cleanser, moisturizer, makeup remover, etc. You can use it in a wide variety of ways and it will leave your face feeling amazing! Some people might thing it's strange to cleanse their skin with oil, but trust me, it's not. It won't clog your pours and will leave your skin feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. This product contains a blend of oils that includes coconut and jojoba oil, in addition to certified organic herbs like chamomile, calendula and marshmallow. The product is rounded out with a few essential oils that are known for balancing the skin and restoring skin cells.

I use this product after I have cleansed my face with the Mug Preference Facial Oil Cleanser. This toner helps protect and maintain the skin's acid mantle and balance the skin's pH. Again, \"Your mug knows what's good for it!\" The toner is alcohol-free and includes a range of herbal ingredients, including organic chamomile, calendula, and comfrey. The base of the products is organic, raw apple cider vinegar, and the toner comes concentrated, so you can dilute it with filtered water, up to 50%. This toner is fantastic whenever you feel like your skin needs a little pick-me-up. It doesn't burn, smells great, and rejuvenates the skin. Learn more [here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/97809258/toner-herbal-mild-exfoliator-mug). Eye Pop Eye Treatment. I love the name of this! This product is designed to sooth, firm, and repair the eye area. Lori said that most of her clients end up using it all over their face, because they love the way it makes their skin feel. I know I did. I figure if it's good for the skin around my eyes, then it's good for my entire face! Ingredients include, aloe vera, shea butter, almond oil, royal jelly, green tea extract, and a blend of herbs. Learn more [here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/97811527/eye-pop-firming-all-natural-eye). Thai Ginger Hair and Body Oil. One of my all time favorite products. This oil smells SO good. I use it as a perfume, so I'll dab a little behind my ears, on my neck, and down my decolletage. I also put a tiny amount on my hand, rub my hands together vigorously, and then lightly run my fingers through my hair. Throughout the day, I'll get whiffs of myself and I always think, \"Wow! I smell GREAT!\" This oil blend can be used for massage, a soothing bath, or cuticle oil as well. Ingredients include, coconut oil, nettle, horsetail, comfrey, yarrow, and clove. Learn more [here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/87019600/thai-ginger-hair-and-body-herbal-oil-all). Lavender Hair and Body Oil. Another oil blend that is great for relaxation. I love incorporating this lavender oil into my yoga practice, especially during savasana (relaxation). Just like the Thai Ginger, this oil blend can be used as a perfume (both on the skin and hair), on your cuticles, in your bath, or as a massage oil. Ingredients include horsetail, comfrey, nettle, lavender, and coconut oil. Learn more [here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/86857821/lavender-hair-body-oil-all-natural). Cuddle Me Herbal Baby Oil. Now, I don't have any kiddos, but the two baby-based products Lori had me try are great for adults too! The Cuddle Me Herbal Baby Oil is very soothing. It is designed to help heal wounds and skin irritations, while softening and soothing the skin. The oil blend consists of anti-inflammatory ingredients and is safe for baby and parent alike. It can be used to help treat cradle cap, eczema, teething pain, fearfulness, and more. Ingredients include a blend of oils and essential oils, including chamomile, lavender, rosemary, and sweet orange. Learn more [here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/98224236/cuddle-me-herbal-baby-oil-after-bath-oil). Baby Bum and Boo Boo Salve. Like the Cuddle Me Herbal Baby Oil, this is designed with baby in mind, but I found that it also works great for adults as well. One evening, I noticed that I had severe razor burn under my arms, which doesn't normally happen. Before bed, I spread a thin layer of this salve under my arms and it immediately helped soothe the pain and irritation. When I woke up in the morning, the razor burn was gone. Also works great for the gents as an after shave soother. Oh, and if you do have babies, then you can use it for what it was originally intended for! Learn more [here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/98222191/baby-bum-and-boo-boo-salve-healing-salve). Dragon Juice Herbal Tea. This is the best. tea. ever. Even if this was the only product of Lori's that I had sampled, she would have a client for life. This tea is so refreshing and good for you too! There is no sugar and no caffeine. Lori originally created this blend as a natural alternative to Kool-Aid and fruit juices. It is super bright red and has a fresh citrus flavor. It can be served hot or cold, but I have enjoyed it this summer iced. The special blend of herbs that she uses are safe for every day consumption. Ingredients include rosehips, hibiscus, lemonbalm, nettles, and ginger. Learn more [here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/100672490/dragon-juice-high-in-vit-c-super-yummy). I was also able to try out a few of her newest products, which she doesn't have quite ready yet, but will in the very near future! Those products included a fantastic, non-toxic linen spray that really works, and a wonderful face scrub that left my skin feeling smooth and happy!
