It has been a tremendous honor to help establish a premiere outlet for undergraduate international studies and political science research, and a joy to work with the exceptional American University students who dedicated their time as authors, staff, and reviewers. As editors, we can claim little real credit for the success of the journal. Clocks and Clouds began with the idea that American University needed an outlet for outstanding undergraduate work, but once that idea took hold, the journal took on a life of its own. The vision of Clocks and Clouds united dozens of authors, editors, and reviewers behind a common goal. These collaborators, led by the power of an idea, contributed far more to the process and product than any single leader did. The production of this journal demonstrates that good ideas can make a real impact. The ideas contained within these pages, however, have an even greater potential to spark change. All six of our authors demonstrate that good scholarship does not involve choosing between analytical rigor and real-world relevance; to the contrary, it involves uniting the two. The power of this scholarship unites our authors' seemingly disparate subjects. Their articles use compelling and consistent academic methods to provide rich, sweeping, and novel perspectives on some of the most vexing questions in contemporary social sciences. They truly have potential to change how people think about and interact with their worlds. The articles in this volume lead through scholarship on a wide range of national and international issues. For some authors, this means examining case studies local and global community development. Emily Hoerner and Angela Budzinski directly explore best practices for activism and development in Kenya and Costa Rica, and draw broadly applicable recommendations about how community organizations and missionary groups can effectively advocate for change. Meanwhile, Gina Weires shows how one community movement succeeded by reaching beyond its immediate supporters and casting a global spotlight on injustice. The guidance that these authors' ideas can provide is tempered by Sebastian Beckman, who leads through a cautionary tale about the unintended perils of \"top- down\" development in Greece. Other contributions in this work take a broader view of issues contemporary society, and examine the root causes of social inequity. Andrew Menefee challenges conventional wisdom to show that responses to AIDS must account for community narratives and attitudes as well as sociodemographic factors. In a similar vein, Rosie Romano encourages policymakers to think about spatial barriers to political participation alongside more familiar cultural and socioeconomic barriers. By highlighting the complex causes of pressing issues, these authors' ideas lead the way towards more effective policy interventions, and a world in which disenfranchisement and disease are no longer scourges. Clocks and Clouds is based on the premise that undergraduates have ideas that matter.

Although we do not claim that our work will change the world over night, we are convinced that the ideas we present can make genuine contributions to a broader academic dialog. We believe Clocks and Clouds can help shape and voice the extraordinary ideas of American University undergraduates, and showcase the real power that research can have. It is our sincere hope that this journal will continue to do so for years to come.

CBOs are uniquely positioned to catalyze change by creating local initiatives for common problems. However, most Kibera CBOs routinely lack access to the kind of funding that could make their programs successful on a larger scale (i.e., in more than just one localized neighborhood of Kibera). This study examines how CBOs in Kibera gain access to funding, either through grants or individual donations, and what factors drive the likelihood of sustained funding for those CBOs. 7KLV\u0003VWXG\\\u0003\u00bfQGV\u0003WKDW\u0003PRVW\u0003RUJDQL]DWLRQV\u0003WKDW\u0003KDYH\u0003UHFHLYHG\u0003IRXQGDWLRQ\u0003IXQGLQJ\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003SDVW\u0003KDYH\u0003EHHQ\u0003 trained in resource mobilization, and/or know a grant manager within a funding foundation. Similarly, most CBOs that have received individual donations in the past engage in at least some aspects of donor relationship cultivation. On the whole, however, most Kibera CBOs tend to take an impromptu and rather undisciplined approach to fundraising. This paper concludes with some suggestions for Kibera CBOs, noting that if CBOs are willing to dedicate time and energy to fundraising they are likely to be more successful. Introduction Less than 10 kilometers west of Kenyatta International Conference Center, the premier landmark of the Nairobi city skyline and a symbol of the country's capitalist ambitions, lies Kibera, the most densely packed informal settlement in East Africa. Kibera and its residents exist side-by-side with some of the most advanced communications infrastructure, sophisticated restaurants, and lucrative business deals on the eastern half of the continent. Figuratively, the settlement is worlds apart from the JDWHG\u0003DSDUWPHQWV\u0003DQG\u0003\u00bfYH\u0010VWDU\u0003KRWHOV\u0003RI\u0003FRVPRSROLWDQ\u00031DLUREL\u0011\u0003 Kibera residents are largely ignored by the Kenyan government and the city council of 1DLUREL\u0011\u0003,Q\u0003WKH\u0003IDFH\u0003RI\u0003WKLV\u0003QHJOHFW\u000f\u0003QRQ\u0010JRYHUQPHQWDO\u0003RUJDQL]DWLRQV\u0003 1*2V \u0003VWHS\u0003LQ\u0003WR\u0003\u00bfOO\u0003WKH\u0003JDS\u0003OHIW\u0003 for service provision, health, and education. In 2000, over 200 NGOs were active in Kibera, a number that has most likely grown in the past decade (Barcott 2000, 13). At a more local level and on a smaller scale, community-based organizations (CBOs) form to address the problems NGOs will not, do not, or cannot tackle. CBOs often initiate unsung acts of good in their communities. However, the author has observed through work and study in Kenya majority of CBOs suffer from a crippling lack of funding. HoernerAmerican University's Clocks and Clouds, Volume 1, Spring 2012 2Run almost exclusively by locals who live in the settlements where they work, CBOs generally do not have access to the sorts of fundraising tips and techniques larger NGOs take for granted. Additionally, there is a staggering lack of simple, straightforward advice for CBOs looking to fundraise more effectively. Knowledge about fundraising, grant writing, and private donations exists, but far too often these articles, books, theses, and dissertations languish in university libraries - or are stuck in academic GDWDEDVHV\u0003WR\u0003ZKLFK\u0003&%2V\u0003GR\u0003QRW\u0003KDYH\u0003DFFHVV\u0011\u0003$OO\u0003WRR\u0003RIWHQ\u000f\u0003&%2V\u0003\u00c0RXQGHU\u0003WKURXJK\u0003WKH\u0003IXQGUDLVLQJ\u0003 process with both private donations and grant-making institutions, using an unplanned and somewhat chaotic strategy that tends to waste time without raising substantial amounts of money. Driven by this knowledge, I ask how successful CBOs attempt to gain access to funding - either through individual donations or through grants. I hypothesize that the most common strategy IRU\u0003&%2V\u0003WR\u0003JDLQ\u0003IXQGLQJ\u0003LV\u0003NQRZLQJ\u0003D\u0003JUDQW\u0003RI\u00bfFHU\u0003RU\u0003SURJUDP\u0003PDQDJHU\u0003ZLWKLQ\u0003D\u0003JUDQW\u0010PDNLQJ\u0003 institution. Five variables were studied: Adherence to donor relationship cultivation strategies, networking, relationship with a grant manager, resource mobilization training and capacity building, and fundraising frequency.

Moreover, most Kibera CBOs take an ad hoc, rather improvised approach to fundraising, probably at least in part because of the largely informal nature of the work and environment in which most CBOs engage. I conclude by advocating that CBOs invest as much time and energy as possible in fundraising efforts, either by soliciting private donations or applying for foundation grants. Why Kibera? This study focuses solely on Kibera, one of the largest informal settlements in Africa.

These types of living conditions are not unique to Kibera. However, the fact that so many NGOs - over 200 as of 2000 (Barcott 2000, 13) - are actively operating in Kibera to solve these problems, with only marginal success rates sets Kibera apart from other informal settlements like it, if only because of the fact that other informal settlements are not nearly as populated with NGOs. In his article \"The Kibera Slum,\" Carolina for Kibera founder Rye Barcott states that, \"Although there are over 200 NGOs in Kibera, residents expressed deep-seated resentment and hostility toward NGOs,\" and that \"even though every informant held an opinion about NGOs, 78 of 126 informants could not name a single NGO that operated in Kibera\" (Barcott 2000, 13). Whether real or imagined, Barcott blames the \"general perception of exploitation\" for most residents' negative opinions of NGO services (Barcott 2000, 13). In his indictment of why Kibera-focused NGOs fail - \"poor management and leadership\"; \u00b3VKRUW\u0010WHUP\u0003SODQQLQJ\u00b4 \u0003DQG\u0003\u00b3DGPLQLVWUDWLYH\u0003DQG\u0003VWDII\u0003SRVLWLRQV\u0003>\u00bfOOHG@\u0003ZLWK\u0003RXWVLGHUV\u000f\u00b4\u0003ZKLFK\u0003\u00b3HOLFLWV\u0003 great resentment from Kibera residents who are jobless\" - Barcott also provides strategies for CBO success (Barcott 2000, 13).

Even from this small sample size, it is evident that there is a fairly equal divide between reliance on grants versus donors as a method of fundraising.

Most individual donations are small, although they do have some repeat donors. According to the interview, organization G also relies heavily on informal networks of friends, either for donations or to attract more donors. CBO members also write thank-you notes to donors. They engage in social media (mainly Facebook) to Hoerner9keep donors apprised of their organizational activities and help donors visualize the impact of their donation. Organization B, the second CBO interviewed that relies on private donations, also goes door-to-door asking for donations. In the past year, they have received repeat donations from multiple individual donors. They engage in cultivation strategies, like personal visits to thank donors, as well as ad hoc reports to donors when programs they have donated to with are completed. They are also contemplating starting a newsletter. This admittedly small sample size reveals that 57.1 percent of Kibera CBOs that rely on donations already engage in donor relationship cultivation techniques as they pursue and attempt to keep individual donors. Strategies like showing appreciation (via thank-you notes and personal visits) for donations, as well as keeping donors up-to-date about their programs and the impact of the donations are already being implemented in organizations B and G. Access to CBO leadership does not seem to be a major issue. Because most CBOs operate on a local scale, and because most of their donors are local, it is easy for donors to see where their money is going and how it is making an impact in the community. When donors are not local, CBOs are using social media tools like Facebook to publicize how donor money is being spent. These techniques can help CBOs keep donors once they have initially attracted them. CBOs seem less successful in that initial donor attraction, however. While most CBOs do have some individual donors, they admit that their donor lists are not as strong as they could be. While it is good that CBOs are relying on the informal networks they already have in place, and while it does not seem like CBOs are merely resting on their fundraising laurels, CBOs do not seem to be leveraging their FRQVLGHUDEOH\u0003VWUHQJWKV\u0003 WKHLU\u0003ORFDO\u0003LQ\u00c0XHQFH\u000f\u0003UHODWLYH\u0003ODFN\u0003RI\u0003EXUHDXFUDF\\\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003FORVH\u0003UHODWLRQVKLS\u0003ZLWK\u0003 the communities in which they operate) to their advantage with formal networking. Networking Networking is another key variable for CBOs trying to procure funding, especially from grant-making foundations. None of the CBOs that rely on donations are actively engaged in formal networking. 14.3 percent of CBOs that rely on grants are engaged in networking in the form of local partnerships, while 28.6 percent are considering pursuing formal networking channels. It is possible that networking is less of a contributing factor to private fundraising, but from the surveys it appears that networking is necessary for CBOs pursuing foundation funds (if only to increase their likelihood of hearing about funding opportunities, an idea that will be discussed below in the \"fundraising frequency\" section). Though it would appear many CBOs are already relying on their informal networks of contacts, friends, and colleagues for donations (even if they do not actually call it networking), most foundation funding is quite competitive, and CBOs should seek to increase their networking presence as much as possible. The more their mission, objectives, and programs are known, especially by those in positions to allocate funds, the more successful CBOs will ultimately be at fundraising. It is quite possible that most CBOs simply do not know, or do not think they know, how to go about utilizing formal networking to their advantage.

Of the CBOs that rely on grants, 85.7 percent have received resource training, while 57.1 percent of CBOs that rely on donations had some experience with resource mobilization training.

The other two CBOs who had received grants had also received mobilization training, and theirs took the form of one- or two-day workshops hosted by NGOs, not grant-making foundations. Resource mobilization training can be a valuable tool for CBOs as they attempt to fundraise. Though most mobilization training tends to focus more on foundation grants rather than private donations, the skills (like grant writing) that CBOs can take away from these seminars can serve as an initial knowledge base that can make them more appealing to foundation funders. Knowing the basics of grant writing, monitoring and evaluation, and program management, can help a CBO stand out to grant-making foundations as serious, committed, and responsible organizations. Additionally, higher- level NGOs and INGOs frequently hold seminars or workshops to prove that they are committed to local participation and to helping the local population \"own\" their development projects. Mobilization training is often easily obtained, and it is something CBOs should absolutely take advantage of: The skills they gain can be quite valuable, especially if they continue to build on them with additional knowledge and practice. Fundraising Frequency Fundraising frequency, which I had not hypothesized to be a strategy for fundraising success, was important. 42.8 percent of CBOs that rely on grants fundraise at least 3 times a year, while 14.2 percent of CBOs that rely on donations fundraise at the same frequency. It is worth noting that three CBOs surveyed did not answer this question, either because they had never formally applied for funds or because they were currently relying on private donations. Overall, it appears most CBOs (close to 55 percent of the organizations surveyed) take a largely ad hoc approach to grant submission; that is, rather than applying for grants methodically, they submit applications only when they are made aware of a call for submissions. Interestingly, of the CBOs that applied for grants when made aware of them, 75 percent had received grants; of the CBOS that applied for funding more regularly, all of them had received some sort of foundation funding, even if they were not receiving foundation money at present. Much like networking and a relationships with grant managers, fundraising frequency is common but not ubiquitous to successful CBOs. Certainly, applying for grants and other funds more frequently cannot hurt, although writing and submitting grants does require taking time away from programming. Because frequent fundraising does not lead to astonishing results for CBOs, fundraising frequency is probably something each organization should consider on an individual basis. CBOs should realistically look at how much time they can devote to this one particular aspect of fundraising, especially in relation to other avenues like resource mobilization training or capacity building. Implications & Suggestions for CBOs Of the several factors that may lead CBOs to attain funding, resource mobilization or capacity building training are the most common ways for CBOs to effectively fundraise. While all the necessary fundraising information may be available for CBOs somewhere, it is rarely available all in one place or in a concise format. In the interest of both condensing the existing fundraising \"wisdom\" and making it more readily available to CBOs who seek it, this study will now present a concise list of suggestions HoernerAmerican University's Clocks and Clouds, Volume 1, Spring 2012 12for CBOs who seek to fundraise, either through private donations or grant-making foundations. Ideally, these suggestions would be published through an accessible venue, such as the Internet, and made readily available to Kibera CBOs as they engage in fundraising. To that end, these results will be shared with the organizations surveyed in the hope that they will both take these suggestions to heart and share them with fellow CBO members seeking to fundraise. CBOs should note that these suggestions are not mutually exclusive. In other words, CBOs should not rely \"just\" on private donations or foundation funds, but rather should seek to fundraise whenever and by whatever means possible.

While Kibera is similar in many ways to informal settlements around the world, it is also unique. Some of the strategies offered here may not be applicable to CBOs in other informal settlements, or even elsewhere in Nairobi. Moreover, the Hoerner13suggestions offered here are guidelines. The more of these suggestions CBOs can engage the more likely it is they will procure funding, but each individual CBO must decide their limit on fundraising strategies. The underlying message, then, is \"do what you can when you can.\" CBOs should not become so caught up in fundraising that they neglect their programs or the communities in which they work. At least in part because of the distance at which this research was conducted, some problems did arise during the course of the study. Though the surveys were distributed by a Kenyan research assistant, the fact that the surveys were being conducted for an American researcher meant that some RUJDQL]DWLRQV\u0003YLHZHG\u0003WKH\u0003LQIRUPDWLRQ\u0003JDWKHULQJ\u0003ZLWK\u0003PLVWUXVW\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003VRPH\u0003ZHUH\u0003XQZLOOLQJ\u0003WR\u0003\u00bfOO\u0003RXW\u0003DOO\u0003 RU\u0003SDUWV\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003VXUYH\\\u0003EHFDXVH\u0003WKH\\\u0003YLHZHG\u0003LW\u0003DV\u0003\u00b3VS\\LQJ\u00b4\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003RUJDQL]DWLRQ\u000f\u0003HVSHFLDOO\\\u0003LWV\u0003\u00bfQDQFHV\u0011\u0003 This phenomenon was probably partly due to the overall mistrust Kibera residents tend to have for \"outsiders\" who engage in development work, and party because it was impossible to conduct this research in person in Nairobi. This distance factor, in addition to the lack of direct access to key organization members, meant that the data received was not as comprehensive as was initially hoped. Ultimately, these two problems resulted in a lower rate of survey return and smaller sample size.

Increasingly, informality is becoming a hallmark of life in low-income countries, and more information about every aspect of informality, as well as its effects on the people who live, work, and learn in the informal sector, is needed. Finally, more research is needed about CBOs - about how they operate, the environments in which they operate, what makes them successful, how they can become more successful, and how they can fundraise successfully.

The paper employs a quantitative analysis of social and economic data from four states, Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Ohio, to demonstrate that social and economic data alone cannot explain why the HIV/AIDS epidemic is growing so rapidly in the Deep South but not in other regions of the country. The results from the data analysis conclude that cultural factors, such as conspiracy theories and stigma, may carry greater explanatory power than what is generally assumed. This paper concludes with implications for future research into the impact of stigma and conspiracy theories on public health and the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Deep South. Introduction The HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States started in 1981. After contracting HIV a person can go eight years before symptoms appear. This makes the HIV/AIDS virus particularly hard to track. Throughout the 1980s the HIV/AIDS virus spread mostly in the northeast and western areas of the country. That has since changed. Now HIV/AIDS rates are increasing most rapidly in the six states that make up the Deep South (Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina and South Carolina). From 2000 to 2003, the number of new reported AIDS cases increased 35.6% in the Deep South, and only 4.0% in other Southern states (Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, and Virginia) and 5.2% nationally (Reif, Geonnotti, Whetten 2006, 971). This presents a challenge to public health policymakers. Given the advances in the development of antiretroviral drugs, surveillance methods, and stopping the spread of the disease in other parts of the country since 1981, what is UHVSRQVLEOH\u0003IRU\u0003WKH\u0003LQFUHDVH\u0003LQ\u0003+,9\u0012$,'6\u0003UDWHV\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003'HHS\u00036RXWK\" The Deep South states share several common factors, in addition to their rising HIV/AIDS rates. These states share a common history of an agrarian economy based on plantations and slave THE HIV/AIDS EPIDEMIC IN THE DEEP SOUTH Andrew MenefeeMenefeeAmerican University's Clocks and Clouds, Volume 1, Spring 2012 20Menefee labor. In addition, they have a 30% Black population compared to 12% nationally (McKinnon 2000). Nationally, African-Americans bear a disproportionate burden of 44% of HIV/AIDS cases, and this is especially true in the Deep South where 70% of the reported cases are African-Americans (Reif, Geonnotti, Whetten 2006, 971) Identifying the barriers confronted by marginalized groups is essential for effective public health care. The rapid rate of the spread of HIV/AIDS creates an urgent need for more research into the factors explaining its increase. This paper will examine the role socio-economic and cultural barriers have in the rural Deep South's HIV/AIDS epidemic, and the need for greater research and attention to less visible communal narratives, what one might be tempted to called \"cultural\" factors. Both socio- economic and cultural approaches are important. However, cultural barriers are hard to quantify and consequently are often over looked. It is important to understand what the word culture means. In past social science research cultural relativism has been used to advance the idea that because every culture is unique, the inequalities within that society must be respected as an inherent part of that culture. Poverty, inequality, and structural violence are confused as endemic parts of a different culture. \"Culture difference is used to explain away assaults on dignity and suffering instead of focusing on the national and international PHFKDQLVPV\u0003WKDW\u0003>SHUSHWXDWH\u0003LQHTXDOLW\\@\u00b4\u0003 )DUPHU\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u0018\u000f\u0003\u0017\u001b \u0011\u0003\u0003\u0003&XOWXUH\u0003ZKHQ\u0003XVHG\u0003LQ\u0003WKLV\u0003SDSHU\u0003UHIHUV\u0003 WR\u0003WKH\u0003LQWDQJLEOH\u0003LQ\u00c0XHQFH\u0003RI\u0003FRPPRQO\\\u0003KHOG\u0003LGHDV\u0003ZLWKLQ\u0003D\u0003FHUWDLQ\u0003FRPPXQLW\\\u0011\u0003 6SHFL\u00bfFDOO\\\u000f\u0003WZR\u0003FRPPRQO\\\u0003KHOG\u0003LGHDV\u0003DUH\u0003H[DPLQHG\u0003ZLWKLQ\u0003WKH\u0003$IULFDQ\u0010$PHULFDQ\u0003FRPPXQLW\\ \u0003\u0003 conspiracy theories and stigma. Conspiracy theories refer to beliefs within some parts of the African- American community that government programs, including medical programs, are purposefully designed to harm and repress African-Americans. Stigma refers to the perception of HIV/AIDS as a mark or sign of disgrace, or even a manifestation of sin for sexual misbehavior. These ideas, however, are very much linked to and caused by state and national actions. Conspiracy theories are the legacy of narratives within the Black community that are the result of distrust and fear caused by a history of violent and repressive actions taken by the state against its own people. Stigma persists because of a failure by state health institutions to recognize the need for addressing it through adequate public health education or outreach campaigns.

The Social Determinants of Health Model says that a person's choices affect their health. Their choices are shaped by the socio-economic structures surrounding them (World Health Organization 2008).

As the physician-sociologist Paul Farmer wrote, to understand the dynamics and distribution of suffering \"one must imbed individual biography in the larger matrix of culture, history, and political economy\" (Farmer 2005, 41). An ecological model outlook suggests that to adequately explain some behavior it is necessary to study the environment in which the behavior took place and, especially, the information that connects a person to their environment. A person's environment entails the cultural perceptions and expectations that shape an individual's worldview. The issue of treating HIV/AIDS in the Deep South is compounded by the region's unique SUREOHPV\u0011\u0003'RFWRUV\u0003$QGHUVRQ\u000f\u0003&KDQGUD\u0003DQG\u00030RVKHU\u0003 \u0015\u0013\u0013\u0018 \u0003QRWHG\u0003WKH\u0003GLI\u00bfFXOW\\\u0003RI\u0003WUHDWLQJ\u0003+,9\u0012$,'6\u0003 in rural areas in 2005. 42.2% of the Deep South population lives in rural areas, compared to 24.8% nationally. Males living in rural areas, however, are only 41.6% likely to get tested for HIV/AIDS, compared to 49.3% in urban areas (Anderson et al. 2005, 15). Nationally, males in the Deep South are among the least likely to get tested (46.3%) compared to a high of 48.5% in the West (Anderson et al. 2005, 15). Delayed diagnosis and treatment increases the likelihood of the disease spreading, and an under-counting of HIV/AIDS cases further complicates healthcare providers' allocation of resources and their response. Another factor that must be examined in understanding the disease's spread is the region's high incarceration rate and the possibility of infection of the general population through released prisoners. This was examined by Hammett and Drachman-Jones in 2006. Incarceration rates in the South (790 per 100,000) are the highest in the country (Hammett and Drachman-Jones 2006, 17). Additionally, approximately one fourth of all people in the United States who are living with HIV or AIDS in a given year pass through a correctional facility that same year (Hammett and Drachman- Jones 2006, 17). The South has the highest overall number, though not rate, of HIV infections among correctional releases (Hammett and Drachman-Jones 2006, 19). Patterns of incarceration may mirror the emerging racial pattern of infection. Blacks and Latinos are vastly overrepresented among correctional inmates. Blacks make up approximately 13% of the U.S. population but over 40% of jail and prison inmates (Hammett and Drachman-Jones 2006, 20). In 2006, Reif, Geonnotti, and Whetten wrote the most comprehensive review of statistics explaining the spread of HIV/AIDS in the Deep South. They expanded on the unique problem posed by the Deep South's rural population by describing several interlocking, multifaceted health indicators that leave the region more vulnerable to disease and poor health. They note that the Deep South states are ranked at the bottom of nearly every national health index, including diabetes, stroke, infant mortality, and sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates. A population already in poor health is particularly vulnerable to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Five of the ten states with the highest rates of chlamydia and four of the ten states with the highest syphilis rates were in the Deep South (Reif, Geonnotti, Whetten 2006, 971). They note that STIs have been consistently found to facilitate HIV transmission. Another factor is the endemic poverty of the region. Poverty has been recognized as a barrier to health care that inhibits access to preventive services and treatment. The Deep South states contain the highest rates of poverty in the country. Reif, Geonnotti, and Whetten (2006) extend their argument to explain the health disparities between Whites and Blacks. In the Deep South African-Americans rank far lower, compared to Whites, on measurements of income and poverty rates, and are therefore more MenefeeAmerican University's Clocks and Clouds, Volume 1, Spring 2012 22vulnerable to poor health. Nationally, half of African-Americans rank 200% below the poverty line (Reif, Geonnotti, Whetten 2006, 972). However, if STDs, poverty, and rural population were the only factors responsible for HIV/AIDS, then similar HIV/AIDS rates should be seen across the Midwest, which is not the case. The authors conclude, \"There may be an association of disease with the unique history and culture of the Deep South\" (Reif, Geonnotti, Whetten 2006, 972). The Anderson (2005), Hammett and Drachman-Jones (2006), and Reif, Geonnotti, and Whetten (2006) articles explain the structural barriers that must be overcome to receive care and illustrate social determinants of health that are conducive to the infection's spread. However, a healthcare provider's response based solely on the above articles would only have the intended effect if the healthcare provider could assume that prevention measures and the disease itself were perceived in the same way by everyone. Without taking into account the psychological, cultural, and inherent \"submerged\" barriers to healthcare access, healthcare providers will be hindering their own efforts. How the disease is perceived by different groups of people living in the Deep South when placed in the context of their life experiences, daily interactions, and religious beliefs must also be taken into account. In the Deep South the perceptions of HIV/AIDS is different and how information about it is received, differs depending on race. Across all groups, stigma is associated with HIV/AIDS. However, in the African-American community HIV/AIDS is associated with government conspiracy theories and more strongly tied to stigma. Writing in 1991 before the HIV/AIDS rate skyrocketed in the Deep South, Thomas and Quinn (1991) believed that the HIV/AIDS epidemic's effect on the Black community could QRW\u0003EH\u0003H[SODLQHG\u0003ZLWKRXW\u0003WDNLQJ\u0003LQWR\u0003DFFRXQW\u0003WKH\u0003PLVWUXVW\u0003RI\u0003KHDOWK\u0003RI\u00bfFLDOV\u0003UHVXOWLQJ\u0003IURP\u0003WKH\u00037XVNHJHH\u0003 Syphilis Study. They contended that this mistrust fueled government conspiracy theories about HIV/ AIDS, creating another barrier to care. The Tuskegee Syphilis study was conducted in Tuskegee, Alabama over the course of 40 years, from 1932 to 1972. During the study 399 Black men with syphilis were examined for 40 years and prevented from receiving medication, even after penicillin became available, or being told of their disease. The study was conducted by the Center for Disease Control, the Alabama State Health Department, and the Macon County Board of Health. The authors note that even as late as 1969: The CDC convened a blue-ribbon panel to discuss the Tuskegee study. The group reviewed all aspects of the experiment and decided against treating the men. This decision ended debate on the Tuskegee study's future: It would continue until 'end point' (Tomas and Quinn 1991, 1501). When it was exposed in 1972 the study sent shock waves across the country. Thomas and Quinn (1991) contend the study has had a devastating impact on how the African-American community views healthcare providers by fueling conspiracy theories that HIV/AIDS is a weapon of genocide against the Black community. The authors observed that in presentations at public health professional meetings and in interactions with Black community based-organization staff members, \"the Tuskegee Study is used to undermine trust and justify AIDS conspiracy theories\" (Tomas and Quinn 1991, 1502). Though the fear in the Black community of professional healthcare providers is misplaced, its origin is legitimate. Indeed, \"It must be acknowledged that public health research and practice operate in an Menefee23HQYLURQPHQW\u0003LQ\u00c0XHQFHG\u0003E\\\u0003VRFLHWDO\u0003YDOXHV\u0003DQG\u0003SROLWLFDO\u0003LGHRORJ\\\u00b4\u0003 7RPDV\u0003DQG\u00034XLQQ\u0003\u0014 \u0014\u000f\u0003\u0014\u0018\u0013\u0017 \u0011\u0003$V\u0003 HIV/AIDS disproportionately infects the Black population, understanding the context in which Black Americans perceive the disease will be essential so that an effective response can be given. The Tuskegee Syphilis Study affected not only how African-Americans trusted healthcare providers, but also how African Americans participated in high-risk sexual behavior. In 2006, Ross, Essien, and Torres examined the legacy of the Tuskegee Syphilis among four racial groups using a questionnaire and a random street sample in Houston. Participants were asked if \"AIDS is an agent of genocide created by the United States government to kill off minority populations\" (Ross, Essien, and Torress 2006, 2). The study found that widespread beliefs in HIV conspiracies occur across different racial and ethnic groups, but was most evident in African-Americans (Ross, Essien, and Torress 2006, 3). Also, genocidal conspiracy beliefs among African American men were associated with a reduction in condom use (Ross, Essien, and Torress 2006, 3). A similar study, conducted by Williams and Sallar (2010) in Mississippi, also found a correlation between conspiracy theories and condom use. The researchers examined how myths, misconceptions, and prior knowledge of HIV/AIDS impacted sexual behavior among African American men in both a rural and urban setting. The study \"revealed that the overall respondents' HIV/AIDS knowledge did not translate into positive attitude or behavior\" (Williams and Sallar 2010, 1147). Their knowledge did not translate into the predicted behavior, which led the researchers to conclude that other myths or beliefs were being taken into account. Among participants from the rural Mississippi Delta, who were relatively well informed about HIV/AIDS prevention and causes, more than \"40% of the rural men responded negatively to the use of condoms at any time during sexual intercourse\" :LOOLDPV\u0003DQG\u00036DOODU\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0014\u0013\u000f\u0003\u0014\u0014\u0017\u001a \u0011\u0003\u00030DQ\\\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003SDUWLFLSDQWV\u0003GLG\u0003QRW\u0003H[SUHVV\u0003DQ\\\u0003FRQ\u00bfGHQFH\u0003LQ\u0003FRQGRPV\u00b6\u0003 ability to prevent HIV. In addition to conspiracy theories, various studies have demonstrated that stigma in the Deep South is associated with STIs and HIV/AIDS, which is compounded in rural communities.

Healthcare providers also reported that efforts to heighten HIV awareness, education, and prevention were sometimes hindered by religious and moral objections to HIV education (Sutton et al. 2010). Lichtenstein, Hook III, and Sharma's 2005 survey of households in the Bible Belt state of Alabama explored how stigma is associated with STIs, which we can expect to be similar to stigma associated with HIV/AIDS and different across gender, race, and church attendance. The survey revealed a gap in perceptions between the African-American community and other ethnic groups. This gap does not bode well for HIV/AIDS prevention among the African-American community. African- Americans and church-goers (regardless of race) who attend church regularly were the two groups most likely to see STIs as a sign of immorality (Lichtensetin, Hook III, and Sharma 2005, 48). African Americans were more frequent churchgoers than Whites (81 % versus 60%) (Lichtensetin, Hook III, MenefeeAmerican University's Clocks and Clouds, Volume 1, Spring 2012 24and Sharma 2005, 50).

Greater stigma among African-Americans warrants greater investigation, which means the investigation arrives at the doorstep of the Black Church. In the Deep South, the church is the heart of the Black community. When Foster, Cooper, Parton, and Meeks (2011) interviewed Alabama pastors about the role the Black Church could play in spreading HIV/AIDS awareness, many pastors said that they personally were interested in such a project, but they felt that they were prevented from doing so because stigma continued to be an issue for their congregations. One pastor related; \"People are afraid to address HIV/AIDS because it may put a dark cloud over your ministry...people will gossip and say, what they talking about that for, they must have a member who is infected\" (Foster et al. 2011, 325). These articles explore possible causes for the vulnerability of the African-American population to the spread of HIV/AIDS. They approach the issue from two very different viewpoints. 7KH\u0003\u00bfUVW\u0003VHW\u0003RI\u0003DUWLFOHV\u0003HPSOR\\\u0003D\u0003OLWDQ\\\u0003RI\u0003VWDWLVWLFV\u0003WR\u0003OLVW\u0003WKH\u0003EDUULHUV\u0003SUHYHQWLQJ\u0003DFFHVV\u0003WR\u0003KHDOWK\u0003FDUH\u0003 for the individual, while the second set of articles places the individual within the context of their community's perceptions and cultural worldview. The structural barriers of poverty and poor health infrastructure prevent people from reaching the health care they need, but the intangible presence of misinformation and stigma channels the disease through a person's networks and relations, fueled by silence and distrust. Hypothesis I hypothesize that race will be the most important variable in predicting the spread of HIV/AIDS. The HIV/AIDS virus has devastated minority populations. The U.S. African-American population is concentrated heavily in the Deep South. 54.8 percent of the total U.S. African-American population lives in the Deep South and 18.8 percent lives in the Midwest (The Black Population 2000). The literature suggests the culture and history of the Deep South, including conspiracy theories and VWLJPD\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003$IULFDQ\u0010$PHULFDQ\u0003FRPPXQLW\\\u000f\u0003LQ\u00c0XHQFH\u0003WKH\u0003VSUHDG\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003GLVHDVH\u0011 Methodology In order to discern the effects of various social determinants on the spread of HIV/AIDS in poor rural communities, a quantitative correlative analysis of selected statistics of variables at the county level was conducted.

Menefee25There is a problem with only using counties from the Deep South because rural counties in the Deep South are heavily segregated along racial and economic lines; White counties are far richer compared to Black counties. In the Mississippi Delta and in the Alabama Black Belt, counties are nearly 70 % to 80% African-American and among the poorest in the country. Counties from the Midwest were chosen because it was the only other region in the United States where equally poor, rural counties were found that were not uniformly African-American, thus facilitating the statistical analysis. The quantitative method used is based in part on a paper by Song, Hall, Harrison, Sharpe, Lin, and Dean (2011). Their study developed a system demonstrating how correlation and partial FRUUHODWLRQ\u0003FRHI\u00bfFLHQWV\u0003FDQ\u0003EH\u0003XVHG\u0003WR\u0003PHDVXUH\u0003WKH\u0003LPSDFW\u0003RI\u0003VRFLRHFRQRPLF\u0003IDFWRUV\u0003RQ\u0003$,'6\u0003GLDJQRVLV\u0003 rates in certain geographic areas nation-wide. Out of 12 variables, they found the AIDS diagnosis rate was highly correlated with the distribution of race, population density, and marital status in an area (Song et. al. 2011). The study concluded that area-based measures of socioeconomic variables can be used to identify risk factors associated with AIDS. In the course of their study they noted that while correlation analysis is used to identify risk factors, confounding from other variables must be taken into account. Data Sources The American Community Survey. While the U.S. Census provides demographic information once every ten years, the U.S. Census American Community Survey provides data every year depicting a variety of subjects. The information is down to the census tract level and captures demographic and socio-economic information including variables such as age, education, employment, housing, income, mobility, country of origin, language spoken at home, and poverty (American Fact Finder). Information provided was from the 2005-2009 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates dataset. The 2005- 2009 dataset is more accurate for small population levels. Geographic area. Four states, Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Ohio, were chosen for analysis, two representing the Deep South and two representing the Midwest. Mississippi was chosen because of its particularly high HIV/AIDS rate, and Oklahoma was chosen because its per capita income is comparable to Alabama and Mississippi's (United States and States, Median Household ,QFRPH\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u001a \u0011\u00037KH\u0003RWKHU\u0003VWDWHV\u0003ZHUH\u0003FKRVHQ\u0003EDVHG\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003HDVH\u0003RI\u0003\u00bfQGLQJ\u0003SXEOLFO\\\u0003DYDLODEOH\u0003+,9\u0012$,'6\u0003 data released by their respective state health departments. The county level was chosen to best capture the impact of the socio-economic variables because demographic make-up can vary widely from one part of a state to another. Additionally, cities can distort data and this research focused only on rural populations.

State Health Departments receive funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to compile and report all incidents of HIV/AIDS infection (HIV Surveillance Report). The data for each individual county was compiled by visiting each state's representative state health department website. HIV/AIDS incidences from 2008 and 2009 MenefeeAmerican University's Clocks and Clouds, Volume 1, Spring 2012 26were used for Alabama and Mississippi, and from 2009 for Oklahoma and Ohio, with the discontinuity D\u0003UHVXOW\u0003RI\u0003WURXEOH\u0003\u00bfQGLQJ\u0003SXEOLFO\\\u0003DYDLODEOH\u0003GDWD\u0003 3XEOLF\u0003+HDOWK\u0003$UHDV\u0003-DQXDU\\\u0010\u0003'HFHPEHU\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u001b\u000f\u0003 Mississippi HIV Rates 2006-2010, Harris 2009, 2009 HIV Public Surveillance Data For Ohio). County- level rates per 100,000 were not provided by the Ohio Health Department. These rates were calculated using the 2005-2009 American Community Survey Population data. In sparsely populated areas there may be too few data points causing HIV/AIDS incidence rates to vary widely from one year to the next. To prevent against this for Mississippi and Alabama counties, an average of the 2008 and 2009 HIV/ AIDS incidence rates per 100,000 was compiled. Due to a lack of available data this operation was not repeated for Oklahoma and Ohio. Data Analysis First, data from the 2005-2009 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimate was used to measure relevant social determinant health variables. Except for per capita income, all of the variables were compiled as percentages. For example, the percent of the population 25 years and older with some college education was calculated by dividing the number of people 25 years and older with some college education by the number of people 25 years and older in the county. The following demographic, social, and economic variables were selected: 1. HIV/AIDS rate per 100,000 (HIV/AIDS Rate) 2. Percent of county that is Black (Percent of County that is Black) 3. Percent of county with some college education, 25 years and older (College Education) 4. Per capita income (Per Capita Income) 5. Percent of the population that lives below the poverty rate (Poverty Rate) Additionally, the following variables were collected for descriptive purposes: 1. Total population 2. Black per capita income as a percent of White per capita income 3. HIV/AIDS cases in 2008 This data was combined at the county level. After the data set was constructed, and the urban counties had been removed, a matrix scatter plot was created to visually depict the relationship between the four Social Determinant Health variables and the HIV/AIDS rate. A scatter plot can reveal whether there is a linear correlation between variables. A strong negative correlation was predicted between the demographic variable Percent of County that is Black and the Social Determinant Health variables of per capita income, and percent of the population living below the poverty line. A bivariate correlation was conducted to determine the strength of the relationship between the variables, and whether the relationship is statistically VLJQL\u00bfFDQW\u0011\u0003 A major problem of measuring the correlations between variables is that often demographic variables are strongly correlated with other social determinant health variables. In this research project it is particularly hard to discern the effects of different variables in the Deep South, because African- Americans are disproportionately at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder. As noted earlier in this paper, nationally, half of African-Americans rank 200% below the poverty line (Reif, Geonnotti, Whetten 2006, 972). This statistic demonstrates the reality described by one writer when he says Menefee27\u00b3$PHULFD\u0003LV\u0003D\u0003SODFH\u0003ZKHUH\u0003FODVV\u0003KLVWRULFDOO\\\u0003FRLQFLGHV\u0003ZLWK\u0003UDFH\u0011\u0003>7KLV@\u0003LV\u0003WKH\u0003KHDYLHVW\u0003OHJDF\\\u0003RI\u0003VODYHU\\\u0003 and segregation\" (Bolina 2011). In Mississippi and Alabama, Black per capita income is on average half the per capita income of Whites (Table 1). Accordingly, what appears to be a correlation between two variables could actually be one variable appearing to correlate with the dependent variable because of its close relationship with a third variable. To adjust for this, a partial correlation was conducted.

Results With all four states combined the dataset included 258 counties (Table 1). Of these 258, 111 were from the Deep South, and 147 were from the Midwest (Tables 2, 3). The regional differences in the datasets mirror publicly reported data. Mean per capita income was almost $10,000 higher in the Midwest. In the Deep South HIV/AIDS Rates, as measured per 100,000, were higher at 16.36 compared to 3.35 in the Midwest.

This relationship was examined more closely in a scatter point graph of all four states (Graph 1), which appears to indicate there is a negative correlation between per capita income and HIV/AIDS rates. This correlation also appears when the Southern states are examined (Graph 2). There does not appear to be a negative correlation for the Midwestern States (Graph 3). It should be noted, however, that for all four states the per capita income is very low but there is not a large range of income. The small range in income may not provide an adequate variety of data points.

Instead of various social determinant health variables, the strongest correlation with HIV/AIDS Rate was found between the demographic variable, the percent of the county that is Black. Implications This research shows that within poor, rural counties, race is the variable that explains the rapidity of the disease's spread or the magnitude of its destruction. Inherited cultural and historical factors in the African-American community must be examined. I propose that additional qualitative research is necessary to explore whether lingering conspiracy theories surrounding the Tuskegee MenefeeAmerican University's Clocks and Clouds, Volume 1, Spring 2012 34syphilis experiments, coupled with social stigma, carry explanatory power in understanding the persistent phenomenon of elevated HIV/AIDS rates. The following proposal for qualitative research is grounded in an interpretative paradigm that there are multiple realties of the world according to GLIIHUHQW\u0003SHUFHSWLRQV\u0011\u0003,Q\u0003FRQGXFWLQJ\u0003KLV\u0003\u00bfHOG\u0003UHVHDUFK\u0003WKH\u0003UHVHDUFKHU\u0003ZRXOG\u0003IRFXV\u0003RQ\u0003VRFLDO\u0003UHODWLRQVKLSV\u0003 and the meaning and symbolism attached by people to interactions in their daily lives. Invisible barriers often exist for marginalized groups such as minorities or poor people in a variety of venues, from the doctor's examination room to public health campaigns. In the examination room, White and middle-class patients may experience the interaction differently because they \"seem able to create workable relationships with healthcare providers because of their ability to pay for services or utilize private insurance and because they have cultural support\" (Heller et al. 2004, 32). My proposed research agenda approaches a public health issue from a development perspective. Vulnerable populations are often the most marginalized groups in a society. Implementing development programs to effectively reach vulnerable populations (or a failure to so) depends on the ability of a program to bridge ethnic, religious, gender and class lines and to facilitate cross-cultural communication. This proposed research would build on previous work like Williams and Sallar's 2010 studies in Mississippi, which revealed discrepancies between how African-American men understood HIV/AIDS and their resulting behavior, and Lichtenstein, Hook III, and Sharma's surveys in Alabama, which revealed differences in how HIV/AIDS is perceived among different racial groups. I propose conducting a series of semi-structured interviews and focus groups and applying discourse analysis to test whether conspiracy theories from the Tuskegee Syphilis Study and stigma can further explain the spread of HIV/AIDS. By employing interviews a researcher would better understand different perceptions. Through discourse analysis applied to focus groups, a researcher may be able to understand how behavior is affected and deduce additional factors in the disease's spread that have not been considered previously. Health departments in the Deep South are failing their citizens in enacting measures to control a disease's spread. In the face of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS rates in the country Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi spend $10,413, $16,647, and $13,609 per patient respectively compared to a national average of $24,867 (Medicaid and HIV: A National Analysis 2011 ).

While the VRA's remedial provisions provide for federal oversight in the maintenance of ballot access for all voters, the likelihood for certain demographic groups to participate electorally remains highly unequal. Broadly speaking, studies have indicated a positive relationship between socioeconomic status and voter participation rates (Verba and Nie 1972; Murry and Vedlitz 1977). As measures of socioeconomic status often incorporate data on educational attainment and income levels of population groups, studies investigating these individual components have also demonstrated a VLJQL\u00bfFDQW\u0003UHODWLRQVKLS\u0003WR\u0003YRWHU\u0003WXUQRXW\u0003UDWHV\u0011\u0003\u00036SHFL\u00bfFDOO\\\u000f\u0003UHVHDUFKHUV\u0003KDYH\u0003IRXQG\u0003WKDW\u0003HGXFDWLRQ\u0003KDV\u0003 a positive effect on voter registration rates and level of political awareness, which translate into higher electoral participation rates (Jackson 1995). Citizens that have achieved a higher level of education are better prepared to navigate the registration process and more likely to gain a sense of satisfaction from voting (Morton 2006). In addition, income as a measure of economic well-being has also been shown to impact voter turnout.

Based on statistical analysis, Morton (2006) determines that for most citizens voting is a costly activity, and a rational person would choose not to vote in almost all circumstances. Indeed, according to a registration and election data compiled by the United States Census, citizens expressed a wide variety of reasons for not voting. In the 2008 general election, according to data assembled by the United States Election Project at George Mason University, nationwide turnout among the voting-eligible population (VEP) was over 62 percent. Among the nearly 38 percent of the VEP that did not vote, the most popular reasons for not voting were \"Too busy\" (17.5 percent), \"Illness or disability\" (14.9 percent), and \"Not interested\" (13.4 percent) (U.S. Census 2008). Based on the analysis of literature on this topic, it seems reasonable that these costs can be more easily overcome on an individual basis by citizens that have higher levels of educational attainment and income.

In other words, more educated citizens are more likely to feel a sense of personal pride and receive respect from their peers in casting their ballot. Also, voters who are experienced in interacting with bureaucratic systems as a result of higher educational attainment, such as university or corporate institutions, are more likely to be able to navigate the voter register process and make it to the polls (Jackson 1995). In addition to the participation barriers cited most by citizens, two other reasons for not voting deserve further consideration: \"Inconvenient polling place\" (reported by 2.7 percent of the VEP) and \"Transportation problems\" (2.6 percent) (U.S. Census 2008). Both barriers, while reported by a relatively small percentage of the population, have been studied and found to be relevant concerns in analyzing voter turnout. In a 2005 study on the importance of the location of polling places, Haspel DQG\u0003.QRWWV\u0003 \u0015\u0013\u0013\u0018 \u0003IRXQG\u0003WKDW\u0003\u00b3GLVWDQFH\u0003>WR\u0003D\u0003SROOLQJ\u0003SODFH@\u0003KDV\u0003D\u0003VWDWLVWLFDOO\\\u0003VLJQL\u00bfFDQW\u0003LPSDFW\u0003RQ\u0003 the voting decision\" (567). Similarly, in an analysis of Los Angeles polling places, Brady and McNulty (2011) found that the rate of voting at the polling place decreased as the distance to the polling place increased (124). Again, in a study on the relationship between distance to a polling place and absentee YRWLQJ\u000f\u0003'\\FN\u0003DQG\u0003*LPSHO\u0003 \u0015\u0013\u0013\u0018 \u0003IRXQG\u0003WKDW\u0003DV\u0003GLVWDQFH\u0003LQFUHDVHV\u0003SUHFLQFW\u0003YRWLQJ\u0003GURSV\u0003VLJQL\u00bfFDQWO\\\u000f\u0003 while absentee voting by mail greatly increases. As a result, recent efforts to increase voter turnout have focused on increasing the number of polling places (Morton 2006). Ideally, this practice will decrease the distance to a polling place, thus increasing turnout. Other researchers have argued that distance to a polling place is not the only aspect of location that should be analyzed in seeking to explain voter turnout. In 2009, Barreto, Cohen-Marks, and Woods conducted a study of the physical characteristic of polling places in Los Angeles. The researchers distributed a survey to examine the quality of polling places based on eight key criteria, including visibility of the location, availability of parking, and reliability of voting machines. Upon analysis of their data, they found that \"low-quality precincts are not randomly distributed across the city and instead are more likely to be found in low-income and minority neighborhoods\" (455).

Maintaining high-quality precincts, like creating a polling place near a voter's residence, will reduce Romano39the cost of voting and thereby increase voter turnout. Indeed, Gimpel and Schuknecht (2003) found WKDW\u0003VRPH\u0003SUHFLQFWV\u0003DUH\u0003PRUH\u0003DFFHVVLEOH\u0003WKDQ\u0003RWKHUV\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003DFFHVVLELOLW\\\u0003PDNHV\u0003D\u0003VLJQL\u00bfFDQW\u0003GLIIHUHQFH\u0003LQ\u0003 turnout. However, one feature of the distance to a polling place that researchers have overlooked is the accessibility of the polling place to voters who utilize mass transit services, such as city bus or rail systems. Research shows that there is high demand for mass transit services among low-income and minority residents (Garrett and Taylor 1999). Thus, based on previous research showing an inverted relationship between the distance to a polling place and voter turnout, it is relevant to investigate whether the distance of a polling place from mass transits stations has an impact on voter turnout rates. Furthermore, the ability to access a polling place by way of mass transit, as an additional element of the quality precinct index (Barreto et al. 2009) may reduce the cost of voting to provide more citizens with the opportunity to participate. A Special Case: The District of Columbia In analyzing the relationship between polling place location and voter turnout rates, the District of Columbia provides an interesting case study. The unique political and demographic characteristics of the District of Columbia demand creative solutions to alleviate disparities in electoral participation. Unlike any other local political community in the United States, the District of Columbia was created by the Constitution in order to \"be free from any state control so as not to be obstructed LQ\u0003LWV\u0003DFWLRQV\u0003DQG\u0003QRW\u0003WR\u0003EH\u0003VXEMHFWHG\u0003WR\u0003DQ\\\u0003LQ\u00c0XHQFH\u0003FRQWUDU\\\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003QDWLRQDO\u0003LQWHUHVW\u00b4\u0003 )UDQFKLQR\u0003 1957, 213). As a result of this constitutional provision, residents of the District were not allowed to YRWH\u0003LQ\u0003SUHVLGHQWLDO\u0003HOHFWLRQV\u0003XQWLO\u0003WKH\u0003UDWL\u00bfFDWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003\u0015\u0016rd Amendment in 1961 (Schrag 1989). Moreover, the District of Columbia did not have representation on the national stage until 1971 when its citizens gained the ability to elect a non-voting, participatory delegate to the United States House of Representatives, and in 1990, a three-member shadow congressional delegation traditionally awarded to territories preparing for statehood (Raskin 1999). Locally, residents of the District of Columbia remained under the absolute authority of Congress until the District of Columbia Home Rule Act was passed in 1973. This act allowed for the election of a mayor and a thirteen-member city council, although Congress maintained \"expressly reserved power to stop local legislation from becoming effective\" (Schrag 1989, 313). Following these developments in federal representation and local governance, the District of Columbia has engaged in several attempts to enter the Union as a state (Schrag 1989). Today, according to the District of Columbia City Council website, \"DC residents seek Statehood because it is the most appropriate mechanism to grant the US citizens who reside in the District of Columbia the full privileges of American FLWL]HQVKLS\u00ab>LQFOXGLQJ@\u0003IXOO\u0003YRWLQJ\u0003ULJKWV\u0011\u00b4\u0003\u00037KXV\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003FRQWHQWLRXV\u0003JRYHUQPHQWDO\u0003DQG\u0003SROLWLFDO\u0003VLWXDWLRQ\u0003 in the District of Columbia provides a unique atmosphere in which to investigate the institutional costs of voting related to the locations of polling places. Moreover, considering the voting rights implications surrounding the creation of precinct maps, it is important to understand the historical and demographic characteristics of the area. According to 2010 U.S. Census data, the District of Columbia is a racially diverse, yet highly segregated region home to over 600,000 people. In a special U.S. Census report entitled \"Demographic Trends in the 20th Century,\" Hobbs and Stoops (2002) report that \"the population in the District of Columbia RomanoAmerican University's Clocks and Clouds, Volume 1, Spring 2012 40has been 50 percent or more black since 1960\" (92).

Among the eight wards of local governance, the racial and socioeconomic disparities raise valid questions about how the District of Columbia maintains equitable election administration and access to the ballot. For example, 2010 U.S. Census data assembled by NeighborhoodInfo DC show the extreme variance in the presence of certain racial groups, reporting a 96 percent black population in Ward 7 (located in the southeast corner of the District) compared to only a 5.6 percent black population Ward 3 (located in the northwest corner). In general, the white population is concentrated in the northwestern quadrant, while the black population, along with an increasing number of Hispanic people, makes up a majority of the other three quadrants. Similarly, reported annual family incomes vary from over $257,000 in Ward 3 to just more than $44,000 in Ward 8 (located in the southwest corner). In addition, who votes and how they vote can be telling in an investigation into the fairness of election administration and polling place locations. On the whole, the District of Columbia Board of Elections and Ethics (DCBOEE) 2008 General Election registration statistics reports about 427,000 registered voters. By the 2010 General Election, the number of registered voters had increased to over 453,000 people. Registered voters are distributed fairly evenly among all eight wards with the largest variance between Ward 7 (79 percent registered) and Ward 2 (58 percent registered, located in the northwest quadrant). In reporting these statistics, however, it is important to note that Ward 7 claims the second-to-fewest number of residents, while Ward 2 is home to the largest overall population. The absolute number of registered voters per ward varies from over 59,000 in Ward 4 (located in the northeast corner) to about 46,500 in Ward 8. 0RUHRYHU\u000f\u0003SROLWLFDO\u0003SDUW\\\u0003LGHQWL\u00bfFDWLRQ\u0003GRHV\u0003QRW\u0003GLIIHU\u0003VLJQL\u00bfFDQWO\\\u0003DPRQJ\u0003ZDUGV\u0011\u0003\u0003,Q\u0003WKH\u0003 District of Columbia, 75 percent of all registered voters align themselves with the Democratic Party, and no single ward electorate is composed of fewer than 65 percent of Democratic Party voters.

For example, in the 2008 Presidential Election, the candidacy of Barack Obama spurred an increase in turnout in seven of the eight District of Columbia wards when compared to 2004 voter turnout rates (DCBOEE). In 2008, the highest and lowest voter turnout rates differed by just over seven percentage points. In 2004, that number was 20 percentage points. Research Design Through analysis of past research, it is clear there a strong relationship between distance to polling places and voter turnout. In addition, the creation of quality precincts can reduce the costs of voting and provide more citizens with the ability to vote. The role of mass transit in the struggle to increase voter turnout and maintain quality precincts has yet to be explored. As previously Romano41discussed, the District of Columbia provides a unique case for analysis of electoral questions due to its political status, racial and socioeconomic composition, and electoral system. Moreover, according to a 2009 survey by the U.S. Census, the greater District of Columbia region is home to the third- highest transit ridership among urbanized areas (U.S. Census 2012). This system, which includes Metrorail and Metrobus, is administered by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). By combining these factors, I designed a research question to examine whether the distance to a polling place from the nearest Metrorail station has an effect on the voter turnout within WKDW\u0003VSHFL\u00bfF\u0003SUHFLQFW\u0011\u0003\u0003,\u0003K\\SRWKHVL]H\u0003WKDW\u0003FLWL]HQV\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003'LVWULFW\u0003RI\u0003&ROXPELD\u0003DUH\u0003PRUH\u0003OLNHO\\\u0003WR\u0003YRWH\u0003LI\u0003 their polling place is located near a Metrorail station, especially among low-income areas. Thus, the null hypothesis to be tested is that proximity to a Metrorail station has no effect on the rate at which District of Columbia citizens vote. In seeking to test this hypothesis, I designed a cross-sectional case study to compare rates of voter turnout with the distance between polling places and the nearest Metrorail station. To test the independent variable of distance to a polling place from the nearest Metrorail station, I gathered data on the location of polling places from the DCBOEE website and Metrorail stations from the WMATA website. While previous studies on the relationship between distance from a citizen's residence to his or her polling place have utilized Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to calculate precise distance measurements (Dyck and Gimpel 2005; Gimpel and Schuknecht 2003; Haspel and Knotts 2005), I was not able to utilize this technology in conducting my research. Instead, the mapping capabilities of Google provided a user-friendly and cost-effective alternative to GIS software, which allowed me to approximate the walking distance in miles to the polling place from the nearest Metrorail station. Then, in order to create a visual representation of this variable, I plotted the polling places and the Metrorail stations that serve them on a \"DC Citywide Ward Map with Precincts\" created by the DCBOEE. Based on an initial visual analysis, I decided to aggregate the location data by dividing the data into eight groups to investigate whether different relationships to voter turnout rates exist among the individual wards. Then, considering theories from previous research in conjunction with the U.S. Census demographic data discussed previously, I sought to examine the differing statistical relationships between the two variables among the wards. In order to gain a more representative sample of the recent participation rates in DC elections, I chose to look at data from two elections, including both a general election and a primary election. The 2008 general election, as previously discussed, featured a forty-year high in voter turnout nationwide (United States Election Project). This trend was evident in the District of Columbia election results, as well. With increased participation among statistically unlikely voters, such as blacks and people in lower income brackets, the 2008 general election results potentially exaggerate the overall electoral participation rates of many voters. In other words, characteristics of the political atmosphere in 2008, including the popularity of the candidacy of Barack Obama, likely lowered the cost of voting for many citizens to the extent that mass transit played a less obvious role in turnout rates. 2Q\u0003WKH\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0014\u0013\u0003SULPDU\\\u0003HOHFWLRQ\u0003GD\\\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003'&%2((\u0003DGPLQLVWHUHG\u0003WKUHH\u0003SDUW\\\u0010VSHFL\u00bfF\u0003SULPDU\\\u0003 elections. Overall, the voter turnout rate for the Democratic Party, Republican Party and the DC Statehood Green Party primaries was just over 37 percent. In order to capitalize on a slightly higher voter turnout rate (at about 40 percent), I chose to focus just on the Democratic primary. Moreover, two unique characteristics of the Democratic primary election made it an interesting case to include in this RomanoAmerican University's Clocks and Clouds, Volume 1, Spring 2012 42study. First, the 2010 Democratic primary ballot featured all competitive races, as is often the case for District Democrats, but rarely the case for General Elections and the other parties' primary elections. Second, by considering an election in which only registered Democrats are eligible to participate, the results of the statistical analysis may indicate a partisan divide in mass transit use among District of &ROXPELD\u0003YRWHUV\u0011\u0003\u00037KH\u0003FRQWUDVWLQJ\u0003YRWHU\u0003WXUQRXW\u0003UDWHV\u000f\u0003DV\u0003ZHOO\u0003DV\u0003WKH\u0003VSHFL\u00bfF\u0003FKDUDFWHULVWLFV\u0003RI\u0003HDFK\u0003 election, provided ample data from which to draw conclusions on the role of mass transit in voter participation. In addition, to limit the voter turnout rate to the voters who actually traveled to their assigned polling place, I only considered the election day turnout as provided by the DCBOEE (excluding those voters who participated via absentee or provisional ballots). The Electoral System of the District of Columbia Other factors that must be taken into account in analyzing the relationship between voter turnout rates and the distance from individual polling places to the nearest Metrorail station include the institutional rules and regulations of the District of Columbia electoral system. First, the electoral map is composed of 143 precincts, each with its own polling place. The same polling places were used for both elections considered here. In 2008, the precincts varied in number of registered voters between 581 voters and 5,789 voters. Accounting only for Democratic voters, in 2010, the precincts varied from 443 voters to 4,636 voters. However, the average precinct contains just fewer than 3,000 registered voters for the general election and just over 2,300 voters for the Democratic primary election. The 143 polling places are located in a variety of public buildings throughout the District. Certainly, as Barreto et al. (2009) suggest, the quality of these polling locations varies. Indeed, in measuring the independent variable for this study, I found that the walking distance between the polling place and a Metrorail station varies between 0.09 miles and 2.3 miles. Moreover, the District of Columbia municipal regulations dictate certain rules for participating in an election. Like many states across the nation, the District of Columbia has opened its electoral system to encourage voter turnout and reduce the voting inequities that have historically plagued many jurisdictions. For example, under Rule 3-713, a registered voter is permitted to cast a special ballot at a polling place in a precinct that is not his or her precinct of residence. While a voter FDVWLQJ\u0003D\u0003VSHFLDO\u0003EDOORW\u0003ZLOO\u0003QRW\u0003EH\u0003DEOH\u0003WR\u0003GHFODUH\u0003D\u0003SUHIHUHQFH\u0003IRU\u0003ZDUG\u0010OHYHO\u0003RI\u00bfFLDOV\u0003RU\u0003ORFDO\u0003DGYLVRU\\\u0003 neighborhood commission representatives, their vote will be counted in federal and District-wide races (DCMR Rule 3-714.13). Because the voters who took advantage of this rule in the 2008 General Election submitted a provisional ballot, they were not included in this study. However, the potential voting rights concerns raised by the accessibility of polling places by way of Metrorail may be somewhat alleviated by these relatively new laws that serve to open the electoral system and decrease the cost of voting. In terms of Primary Elections, the DCBOEE enforces a closed primary system, which means voters can only participate if they are registered with a party preference (DCMR Rule 1-1001.09). In addition, voters are not permitted to change their preference RQ\u0003WKH\u0003GD\\\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003HOHFWLRQ\u0011\u0003\u00037KLV\u0003UHJXODWLRQ\u0003LV\u0003SDUWLFXODUO\\\u0003VLJQL\u00bfFDQW\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003FRQWH[W\u0003RI\u0003WKLV\u0003VWXG\\\u0003EHFDXVH\u0003 ideally it eliminates cross-over voters from other parties and gives credence to the argument that a partisan divide may exist in mass transit use by voters accessing polling places.Romano43Metrorail Ridership A second set of characteristics unique to the institutions analyzed by this research are those surrounding Metrorail. According to the WMATA website, the Metrorail system began operating in \u0014 \u001a\u0019\u0011\u0003\u00037RGD\\\u000f\u00030HWURUDLO\u0003IHDWXUHV\u0003\u001b\u0019\u0003VWDWLRQV\u0003RQ\u0003\u00bfYH\u0003OLQHV\u0003ZLWK\u0003D\u0003WRWDO\u0003RI\u0003\u0014\u0013\u0019\u0003PLOHV\u0003RI\u0003WUDFN\u0003 :0$7$ \u0011\u0003\u0003 In discussing the voting rights implications of the proximity of polling places to Metrorail stations, it is relevant to investigate the demographic composition of the passengers. In June of 2010, WMATA released a report to justify the proposed adjustments to routes and fares throughout the District of Columbia mass transit system. The document, entitled \"Title VI Equity Evaluation,\" uses data from Rail Passenger Surveys as well as the U.S. Census to provide introductory demographic information. According to the report, minority passengers account for 45 percent of Metrorail ridership, while low income passengers account for 14 percent of the ridership. The report also shows that minority and low income passengers make up a far greater percentage of Metrobus ridership, although this aspect of WMATA's mass transit services will not be confronted in this research. Rather, I chose to focus on Metrorail's impact on voter turnout because the abundance of Metrobus stops would diminish the possibility for variable distances to polling places among the precincts. In addition, because the role of mass transit use in increasing access to the polls has not been explored in any capacity, this study sets a benchmark for future research on mass transit by focusing on a single mode of transportation. Statistical Analysis After compiling the quantitative data, I conducted linear regression analyses of the variables for both elections in all eight wards. Other variables mentioned previously, including ward-level demographic data, partisan preference, and electoral competitiveness were considered in a more qualitative manner as they applied to the results of the statistical analysis. Findings The two main variables used to conduct this research, the percentage of voter turnout in the 2008 general election and the 2010 Democratic primary election and the distance in miles from polling places to the nearest Metrorail station, produced a wide range of data. In 2008, among the 143 precincts, voter turnout rates varied from a low of 37.3 percent to a high of 64.7 percent. In 2010, turnout rates among Democratic voters varied from 16.9 percent to 64.9 percent. In addition, the highest and lowest distances from polling place to the nearest Metrorail station varied by over 2.1 miles. However, the lower rates of voter turnout did not correlate with the greatest distance from the polling place to a Metrorail station. A bivariate correlation test between the district-wide voter turnout rate and the walking distance from polling places to the nearest Metrorail station produced remains valid, and the proximity of Metrorail stations has no impact on voter turnout rates at the District-level. \u0003%DVHG\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003UHJUHVVLRQ\u0003DQDO\\VLV\u000f\u0003QRQH\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003ZDUGV\u0003SURGXFHG\u0003D\u0003VWDWLVWLFDOO\\\u0003VLJQL\u00bfFDQW\u0003UHVXOW\u0003 LQ\u0003VXSSRUW\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003UHMHFWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003QXOO\u0003K\\SRWKHVLV\u0011\u0003\u00036HYHUDO\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003UHJUHVVLRQ\u0003FRHI\u00bfFLHQWV\u0003KDYH\u0003W\u0010UDWLRV\u0003WKDW\u0003RomanoAmerican University's Clocks and Clouds, Volume 1, Spring 2012 44DSSURDFK\u0003WKH\u0003LQIRUPDO\u0003WKUHVKROG\u0003IRU\u0003VLJQL\u00bfFDQFH\u0003RI\u0003\u0015\u0011\u0003\u0003)RU\u0003H[DPSOH\u000f\u0003LQ\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u001b\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003UHJUHVVLRQ\u0003FRHI\u00bfFLHQWV\u0003 voter turnout rates in Ward 1 and Ward 2 both have t-ratios over 1.4.

For example, rather than relying solely on statistical data, perhaps a survey of actual voters could provide more insight to questions on the relationship between the accessibility of a polling place by way of mass transit and the likelihood a person will vote. The use of statistical data in this study assumes that all voters access the polls by way of mass transit. Realistically speaking, this is not the case, as most precincts are too compact to necessitate use of the Metrorail system for voters travelling from their residences to the polling place. Thus, survey data may provide a better sample for this research question. Moreover, the ease and convenience of using the Metrorail system from the perspective of a college student may not be a universally supported view, and thus, utilizing mass transit would not reduce the cost of voting enough to result in widespread increases in voter turnout rates. In this way, more qualitative data could alleviate bias as a consequence of overarching assumptions.

Based on the background information provided in this paper, minority and low- income communities make up a large portion of both the non-voter and the daily mass transit ridership populations. Therefore, if election administrators make an effort to locate polling places along popularly traveled bus and rail routes, it seems logical that voter turnout among traditionally low-voting groups would increase. Although the results of this study suggest that the availability of rail transit cannot explain voter turnout rates, this does not rule out the importance of other forms of mass transit or the VLJQL\u00bfFDQFH\u0003RI\u0003PDVV\u0003WUDQVLW\u0003LQ\u0003FRQMXQFWLRQ\u0003ZLWK\u0003RWKHU\u0003YDULDEOHV\u0011\u0003\u0003$QDO\\VLV\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003GLVWDQFH\u0003WR\u0003SROOLQJ\u0003 places and voter turnout rates (Dyck and Schuknecht 2003; Haspel and Knotts 2005) suggests that voters, especially members of minority and low-income groups, do not want to take time out of their daily routine to vote. Thus, a polling place positioned at a bus or rail stop near a residential neighborhood should be able to attract voters as they travel to and from work or daily errands. Similarly, voters who are not employed, but use mass transit or live in neighborhoods serviced by mass transit, also should be more likely to vote. Of course, in many cases the characteristics of a high-quality precinct (Barreto et al. 2009), that would further increase participation are severely lacking in minority and low-income neighborhoods. Nonetheless, as voting rights activists attempt to create a more inclusive electoral system, aspects such as creating mass transit-accessible and visible, quality polling places should not be ignored. Much of the current activity surrounding voting rights, especially in the District of Columbia, is centered on increasing both descriptive and substantive minority representation. While this is certainly important in terms of meeting the social and political needs of these communities, increasing minority and low-income groups' participation in the electoral process could arguably be more EHQH\u00bfFLDO\u0011\u0003\u0003,QGHHG\u000f\u0003WKH\u00039RWLQJ\u00035LJKWV\u0003$FW\u0003RI\u0003\u0014 \u0019\u0018\u0003DWWHPSWHG\u0003WR\u0003SURYLGH\u0003XQGHUUHSUHVHQWHG\u0003PLQRULWLHV\u0003 ZLWK\u0003WKH\u0003ULJKW\u0003DQG\u0003WKH\u0003DELOLW\\\u0003WR\u0003HOHFW\u0003RI\u00bfFLDOV\u0003RI\u0003WKHLU\u0003FKRLFH\u0011\u0003\u0003+RZHYHU\u000f\u0003IRFXVLQJ\u0003RQ\u0003FUHDWLQJ\u0003PDMRULW\\\u0010 PLQRULW\\\u0003GLVWULFWV\u0003WKDW\u0003ZLOO\u0003HOHFW\u0003PLQRULW\\\u0003RI\u00bfFLDOV\u0003VNHZV\u0003WKH\u0003LQWHQW\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003\u0014 \u0019\u0018\u0003OHJLVODWLRQ\u000f\u0003DV\u0003WKHUH\u0003LV\u0003QR\u0003Romano47JXDUDQWHH\u0003WKDW\u0003PLQRULW\\\u0003RI\u00bfFLDOV\u0003ZLOO\u0003WUXO\\\u0003UHSUHVHQW\u0003WKH\u0003ULJKWV\u0003DQG\u0003LQWHUHVWV\u0003RI\u0003PLQRULW\\\u0003FLWL]HQV\u0011\u0003\u00037KXV\u000f\u0003 in an ideal world, polling places would be created equal and each voter regardless of the neighborhood he or she lived in would have to incur an equal cost in order to participate in the electoral system.

The Marshall Plan, according to the common consensus, both revitalized European growth and saved Western Europe from Communist domination (Chollet and Goldgeier 2005, 7). As a result, numerous personalities in the aid community have developed an awed nostalgia for the Marshall Plan, which they view as the epitome of a successful foreign aid program (Zachariou 2009, 303). Perceptions of the Marshall Plan, at least in the West, have been generally positive. Americans use the Marshall Plan to highlight the tradition of alliance and friendship between Europe and the United States (Chollet and Goldgeier 2005, 10). In the U.S. and in most recipient countries, most historians view the Plan as an accelerator of European reconstruction; the Marshall Plan did not resurrect Europe singlehandedly, but it did hurry along Europe's resurgence (Wexler 1983, 254). In countries with successful pre-war economies, such as Germany and Britain, this appears to be the case. BechmannAmerican University's Clocks and Clouds, Volume 1, Spring 2012 52Bechmann Yet these nations are hardly examples of the underperforming, chronically struggling economies that make up most modern aid recipients. The Marshall Plan in Germany or Britain may provide a blueprint for the successful reconstruction of economic powerhouses, but it cannot be used as a guideline for economic intervention in languishing countries. Yet the Marshall Plan extended beyond Europe's three strongest pre-war economies. While the Plan should not be described as a development program in Europe's economic core, it could be approached from a development angle in the continent's periphery. Greece makes for a timely example of the Marshall Plan as a development program. Unlike Western Europe, which had a strong economic foundation from before the war, Greece had one of the poorest per-capita economies in Europe (Wittner 1982, 190), a labor force still primarily engaged in the agricultural sector (Candilis 1968, 1), severe economic inequality (Athanase 1959, 23), abysmal electricity and road systems (Warren 1998, 87), and D\u0003OHJDF\\\u0003RI\u0003GHSHQGHQF\\\u0003RQ\u0003(XURSH\u00b6V\u0003JUHDW\u0003SRZHUV\u0003 .RIDV\u0003\u0014 \u001b \u000f\u0003\u0014\u0016 \u0011\u0003,Q\u0003PDQ\\\u0003ZD\\V\u000f\u0003*UHHFH\u0003ZKHQ\u0003WKH\u0003\u00bfUVW\u0003 round of American aid began in 1948 resembles modern aid recipients. In Greece, the legacy of American aid left a very different impression than in Western Europe. Instead of departing with amity and leaving behind booming growth, as American technocrats did in England and Germany, the American Mission of Aid to Greece (AMAG), left Greece in a state of mutual frustration and with mostly stalled or cancelled projects (Munkman 1958, 98). In fact, the Greek case exhibits many of the same problems that plague modern aid projects, from an idealistic mission staff HDJHU\u0003WR\u0003LPSOHPHQW\u0003D\u0003RQH\u0010VL]H\u0010\u00bfWV\u0003DOO\u0003DJHQGD\u0003 :DUUHQ\u0003\u0014 \u001b\u000f\u0003\u001a\u0019 \u000f\u0003FRUUXSWLRQ\u0003DQG\u0003SRRU\u0003JRYHUQDQFH\u0003 IURP\u0003WKH\u0003KRPH\u0003JRYHUQPHQW\u0003 9HWVRSRXORV\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013 \u000f\u0003\u0015\u001a\u0018 \u000f\u0003DQG\u0003D\u0003FRQ\u00c0LFW\u0003RI\u0003SULRULWLHV\u0003WKDW\u0003XOWLPDWHO\\\u0003SODFHG\u0003 politics for both the donor and recipient governments (Wittner 1982, 185).

Methods This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of the Marshall Plan as a development model. In order to do so, Greece was selected as a case study because it was a country that received American aid through the Marshall Plan with a low level of economic productivity before the Second World War (Vetsopoulos 2009, 275). Greece thus presents an example of the Marshall Plan as a true development program seeking to facilitate the creation of new growth, rather than a reconstruction program meant to reinstate pre-war growth patterns. Furthermore, Greece in the postwar era, with its 53history of destruction, imperialistic domination, internal polarization, and economic inequality loosely resembles modern aid recipients, making it a relevant case to examine the effects of aid The Marshall Plan in Greece is closely tied to aid the United States began sending through the Truman Doctrine in 1947. This study does not differentiate between aid received through the European Recovery Program (ERP, as the Marshall Plan is formally known) and this previous funding. The Truman Doctrine and ERP ultimately had similar military objectives and proportions of aid devoted to military aid; furthermore, Truman Doctrine bureaucrats with AMAG remained in their positions for the Marshall Plan, carrying over the same political convictions, methods, and results.

The success of the independent variable, American aid to Greece, was then evaluated based upon results in two dependent variables. First, success in the economic sphere was measured by changes in productivity in the short run from 1947 to 1952, but more importantly in the ability of the Plan to establish the foundations for future growth after the duration of the development mission, and catalyze a widespread increase in the standard of living of Greek citizens. Second, the political effects of aid were measured by the creation of political institutions conducive to further development. These variables can be articulated in the primary hypothesis tested by this study: that the American development program failed to achieve its ambitious economic objectives as a result of its inability to reform the structure of the Greek economy, and it failed in developing political institutions that would support future growth by polarizing the government, thereby prolonging civil war and destroying any potential opposition to the conservatives in power. This hypothesis matches most closely the revisionist view described in the historiography section, though this study was more generous in acknowledging positive effects of the aid mission than most revisionist literature.

In the 1960s, a wave of Greek scholars lamented what they viewed as an American failure to provide lasting reforms to the Greek economy, criticizing the mission for its focus on large, visible aid projects. In hindsight, these criticisms generally appear more a reaction to continued economic weakness in Greece rather than any actual harm caused by the Marshall Plan (Delivanis, 1967, 333).

These scholars reject the claim that the civil war could have been resolved without a violent, American-funded response. Instead, they assert that American aid was crucial to bringing the war to a close and making some progress on infrastructure creation to spur future growth. In some cases, these authors suffer the opposite problem as revisionist scholars: they view the Plan as a clear success, and reassert its success despite any economic failures. \u0003%HWZHHQ\u0003WKHVH\u0003WZR\u0003H[WUHPHV\u000f\u0003D\u0003QXPEHU\u0003RI\u0003VFKRODUV\u0003KDYH\u0003WDNHQ\u0003PRUH\u0003TXDOL\u00bfHG\u0003SRVLWLRQV\u0011\u00036RPH\u0003 emphasize the mission's political success, ensuring Greek partnership with \"the West\" (Zachariou, 2009, 314).

Discussion of the ERP in Greece has thus historically provoked a wide array of responses, varying both in emphasizing the economic or political aspects and in the degree to which the United States achieved success in both. Historical Analysis From its independence through the Second World War, Greece could be described as \"an agrarian, merchant economy with modest resources and immodest aspirations\" (Kakridis 2009, 243) that neglected the development of the former and depended on outside support to attain the latter. In this period, Greece was widely viewed as an inherently poor country that could only achieve economic viability through agrarianism, commerce, and emigration (Kakridis 2009, 243); in other words, Greece was expected to remain permanently poor. Following a coup that instated an authoritarian regime, *UHHFH\u0003TXLFNO\\\u0003VXFFXPEHG\u0003WR\u0003*HUPDQ\u0003LQYDVLRQ\u0003GXULQJ\u0003:RUOG\u0003:DU\u0003,,\u000f\u0003WKRXJK\u0003VLJQL\u00bfFDQW\u0003OHIWLVW\u0003DQG\u0003 rightist forces continued to mount resistance during the occupation. The Second World War provides the immediate prelude to the American aid mission. The war resulted in a massive, widespread, and often systematic dismantling and destruction of the Greek economy and society. By 1945, 6.2 percent of the entire population had perished (Candilis 1968, 19). Furthermore, every sector of the economy had been decimated, with output in industrial production down to 36 percent of the pre-war level and agricultural production at 54 percent (Kofas 1989, 8). The German occupation also exacerbated Greece's monetary problems.

After the war's end, England took control of the Greek rehabilitation mission. Under the London Agreement, the United Kingdom supplied Greece with a 10 million pound loan, forgiveness for the debt accrued from 1940-1941 during Greece's involvement in the war, a package of consumer goods DQG\u0003RWKHU\u0003HTXLSPHQW\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003GHYHORSPHQW\u0003DGYLFH\u0011\u0003,Q\u0003H[FKDQJH\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003(QJOLVK\u0003JDLQHG\u0003VLJQL\u00bfFDQW\u0003FRQWURO\u0003 over Greece's monetary and trade policy, with the 10 million pound loan and an additional 15 million pounds from the Bank of Greece placed under British control (Vetsopoulos 2009, 279).

The humanitarian counterpart to the London Agreement's economic aid came in the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Agency (UNRRA), which sought to alleviate Greece's desperate humanitarian position and construct a base for future development (Vetsopoulos 2009, 280). The UNRRA ran into familiar development problems in Greece. First, the mountainous north of the country had fallen under the control of Communists hostile to the Western aid mission, meaning that the UNRRA could not work effectively in the areas in which its help was most required (Kofas 1989, 14).

Moreover, the farmers preferred to sell their products in the black market, which offered higher prices than the government-regulated market. The black market thrived, therefore, and undermined the legitimate economy,\" (Kofas 1989, 23). UNRRA goods fell victim to corruption, as the agency chose to channel products through the Greek government, which favored elite contacts in Athens for the ultimate distribution of aid materials.

The promulgation of the Truman Doctrine in 1947 marked the transfer of control over the Greek aid mission from Britain to the United States (Kofas 1989, 56). The UK, which was in the process of dealing with the destruction of its own territory, could no longer afford to prop up the just as the British had done in the previous century (Kofas 1989, vii). Under the Truman Doctrine, the United States established AMAG, and delivered a total of $400 million, mostly in the form of military aid, to Greece (Jones 1998, 26). Accompanying this aid, hundreds of advisers arrived in Greece tasked with overseeing the distribution and implementation of aid. This mission would cooperate with the American embassy until the end of the Marshall Plan to ensure that their economic and political objectives could be achieved. \u0003$OWKRXJK\u0003WKH\u00030DUVKDOO\u00033ODQ\u0003VLJQL\u00bfHG\u0003D\u0003UKHWRULFDO\u0003VKLIW\u0003LQ\u0003SULRULWLHV\u0003IURP\u0003PLOLWDU\\\u0003WR\u0003HFRQRPLF\u0003 aid, in actuality the Plan represented a continuation of the same sort of aid policy.

As a result, about a quarter of all Marshall Plan funds were allotted exclusively to the military (Kofas 1989, 102). In addition, ERP money went disproportionately to infrastructure projects with primarily military purposes, including transportation and communication (Kofas 1989, 102).

An early conception of the Domino Theory pervaded the administration's thinking in its approach to Greece; it was crucial to hold Greece not only in order to deter further Soviet aggression in other states, but also because the rest of the \"Northern Tier\" would fall to the Communism if Greece collapsed (Bland 1998, 51). These concerns motivated the deployment of aid and advisors to Greece and dictated the use of aid as a political tool. Aid money to Greece was not intended primarily to instigate development, but to ensure that a pro-American, vehemently anti-Communist government maintained power in Greece. The politicization of aid for anti-Communist purposes began under the English mission immediately after the war. In 1944, the English distributed aid only in areas under control by the central government, excluding regions controlled by the KKE, successfully crippling the Communists for several years (Kofas 1989, 14). In 1945, rightists began a \"White Terror\" against Greek Communists with implicit Anglo-American support (Kofas 1989, 40). This violence undermined the KKE's efforts to act within a legal framework and drove the party away from compromise and legalism. The result: full-scale civil war in 1946. \u0003:KHQ\u0003WKH\u00038\u00116\u0011\u0003LQKHULWHG\u0003WKH\u0003(QJOLVK\u0003PLVVLRQ\u0003LQ\u0003\u0014 \u0017\u0019\u000f\u0003LW\u0003UHDI\u00bfUPHG\u0003LWV\u0003VXSSRUW\u0003IRU\u0003FRQVHUYDWLYH\u0003 and rightist forces as a bastion against Communism (Kofas 1989, 94). The United States went to great lengths to deny the Communists any role in government, at one point, actively debating supporting the 57installation of a government that would be \"more authoritarian\" than the rightists already in power (Wittner 1982, 121). Furthermore, the U.S. persistently used the threat of aid withdrawal to dictate policy to Athens.

At that point, the KKE had come to realize that they would not be able to persist as a political force outside of WKH\u0003V\\VWHP\u0003DV\u0003D\u0003UHVXOW\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u00036RYLHW\u00038QLRQ\u00b6V\u0003UHIXVDO\u0003WR\u0003H[WHQG\u0003DLG\u0003DQG\u0003WKH\u0003LQVXI\u00bfFLHQF\\\u0003RI\u0003IXQGV\u0003FRPLQJ\u0003 from their cross-border allies (Botsiou 2009, 312). Instead, the KKE wanted to end the civil war and transition back into the political mainstream. By rejecting the peace offering, the United States forced the KKE to remain in political exile and continue in their violent efforts to gain control. By refusing to compromise with the Communists even when offered peace and promoting an unequivocally anti- left attitude, the United States unnecessarily prolonged the civil war, brought unconditional support to an ineffective but repressively anti-Communist government in Athens, and prevented any viable opposition to a government badly in need of compromise. The American mission's anti-Communist stance further harmed the Greek economy by dictating a trade policy that deliberately excluded Greece's natural trading partners, its northern, Communist neighbors (Kofas 1989, 111).

The Americans' priority of containing Communism also explains the disproportionate share of aid that the Greek military received through the American development mission. Of the $1,149.8 billion of US aid to Greece from April 1948 to June 1955, $3,740 billion, or 22.7 percent, was formally allocated to military aid (Greece, Statistical Data Book 1956, 45). With the support of this aid, Greece maintained the largest per-capita military budget of the ERP countries, despite having 4 percent of Norway's per-capita electricity consumption and 9 percent of Belgium and France's (Athanase 1959, 25). The Greek government argued that it required its massive military budget to defend against future Communist aggression, thereby using this budget in order to justify continued aid and American support. \u00037KHVH\u0003RI\u00bfFLDO\u0003DOORFDWLRQV\u0003GR\u0003QRW\u0003QHFHVVDULO\\\u0003UH\u00c0HFW\u0003WKH\u0003UHDOLW\\\u0003RI\u0003*UHHN\u0003DLG\u0011\u0003)RU\u0003H[DPSOH\u000f\u0003LQ\u0003 1947, Congress appropriated $300 million for military aid, with a planned breakdown of 50 percent for the military, 48.5 percent for the economy, and 1.5 percent for administration. Because of the diversion of aid, however, the actual allocations of aid to Greece were 57.7 percent for the military and only 41 percent for economic aid. Once this money reached the Greek government, even more of the aid formally allocated for economic purposes went to military and strategic projects (Candilis 1968, 48). The Greek government favored infrastructure projects with a degree of military utility, including roads, railroads, and communications networks. Unfortunately, this prioritization of military objectives over humanitarian or long-term development, in addition to the constant reallocation of aid from economic to military purposes on every level of the process, translated into an enormous diversion of American BechmannAmerican University's Clocks and Clouds, Volume 1, Spring 2012 58Bechmann aid from development to the military (Wittner 1982, 188).

Unfortunately, the outbreak of the Korean War a year later revived American fears of expanding Communism and renewed the prioritization of a strong military against suspected Communist aggression (Botsiou 2009, 225). In reality, Greece had little to fear at that point in time from its Communist neighbors, and the end of the civil war had effectively destroyed the KKE as a viable political force, eliminating the need to focus on military projects (Zachariou 2009, 305). Nevertheless, the overstatement of the military for political purposes led to the persistent neglect of development goals. Economic Effects When aid money was used for development, AMAG ran into many of the same problems encountered by aid agencies today. Corrupt bureaucrats and poor coordination with the government created a nightmare of red tape and confused authority (Munkman 1958, 99). A review of the ERP in Greece led C.A. Munkman, a State Department observer of the implementation of the Plan tasked with explaining the outcome of the program in Greece to American taxpayers, to remark that, of all the aid earmarked for development, only 10 percent achieved its goals (Munkman 1958, 284).

To characterize these complaints in brief, ERP aid suffered from an extreme disconnect between those funding the aid, \"Planners\" in William Easterly's development lingo (Easterly, 2006, 114), and those actually receiving that aid. ERP Planners in Washington, DC pushed through programs that appeared useful to experts studying the Greek economy but had no bearing to the reality on the ground. For example, the United States spent approximately $1 million to buy horses for Greece, to be used for agricultural purposes. While at face value the program may have been useful, most of the horses bought were too old to breed, and thus useless in the long term, and also often bred for racing DQG\u0003WKHUHIRUH\u0003XVHOHVV\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003\u00bfHOG\u0003 0XQNPDQ\u000f\u0003\u0014 \u0018\u001b\u000f\u0003\u0014 \u0016 \u0011\u0003 While aid workers developing infrastructure in Greece experienced frustration with this DQG\u0003RWKHU\u0003ERUGHUOLQH\u0003TXL[RWLF\u0003SURMHFWV\u000f\u0003$PHULFDQ\u0003RI\u00bfFLDOV\u0003LQ\u0003$WKHQV\u0003FRQIURQWHG\u0003D\u0003FRUUXSW\u0003EXUHDXFUDF\\\u0003 and population unwilling to accept reforms.

Many cultural aspects come together to build up communities, religion included. In the past, missionary work was an integral part of community development in Latin America. However, missionaries often have differing ideas of how to carry out evangelization. Traditional mission history emphasized the role of the missionary as the bringer of civilization to Indians (Langer and Jackson 1995, 3). Yet, overtime, missionary work evolved into much more. Nowadays, the role of the missionary is different from that of their sixteenth- century counterparts. Missionaries now seek not only to evangelize but to develop communities as well. This method is known as holistic missiology. Nonetheless, a puzzle exists of whether missionary work actually impacts community development in Latin America today.

Community development involves any activities that improve aspects of local communities and that provide individuals with skills they need to effect change in their own communities (Gruchy 2005, 29). Missionary Methodologies Over time, scholars have discussed various missionary methods that have contributed to community development in Latin America. These approaches can be categorized into three main schools of thought: post-imperial missiology, managerial Missiology Post-imperial missiology, also known as liberation theology, involves a critical interpretation of mission history and re-examination of missiological methods (Neill 1966, 445). Theologian Stephen Neill states that, in this methodology, missionaries must realize the need to alter their methods while still emphasizing the traditional calling of conversion. This is what liberation theologians call inductive PHWKRG \u0003\u00b3EHJLQ\u0003ZLWK\u0003D\u0003GHVFULSWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003ZRUOG\u0003DQG\u0003WKH\u0003FKXUFK\u0003ZLWKLQ\u0003LW\u000f\u0003UH\u00c0HFW\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003VLWXDWLRQ\u0003IURP\u0003 a biblical perspective, and act to bring the world and the church more in harmony with this biblical YHUVLRQ\u00b4\u0003 &OHDU\\\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u0018\u000f\u0003\u0014\u001a \u0011\u00033RVW\u0010LPSHULDO\u0003PLVVLRORJ\\\u0003FRPELQHV\u0003FRQYHUVLRQ\u0003ZLWK\u0003VHUYLFH\u00b2ZRUNLQJ\u0003WR\u0003 better the communities of the people through post-colonialist frameworks (Warren 1967, 77). While post-imperial missiology has several strengths, it is not very relevant to contemporary development. The main reason is because it focuses on conversion as a primary goal.

Nowadays, building up skills and livelihoods in the community are more important than converting the communities to Christianity (Escobar 2002, 17-18). Post-imperial missiology is not important to modern-day community development because it lacks a \"theology of freedom\" (Kater 2001, 739). Managerial Missiology Managerial missiology uses the approach that the Christian mission is a \"manageable enterprise\" that can affect community development using statistical data (Escobar 2002, 19). It uses statistics, marketing techniques, and managerial objectives. The goal is to evaluate missions realistically in order to comprehend how much mission activity certain communities need. It studies social factors that stimulate numerical spiritual growth and develops an effective strategy of community development EDVHG\u0003RQ\u0003WKHVH\u0003IDFWRUV\u0011\u00030DQDJHULDO\u0003PLVVLRORJ\\\u0003XVHV\u0003TXDQWL\u00bfDEOH\u0003PHWKRGV\u0003WR\u0003HYDOXDWH\u0003PLVVLRQDU\\\u0003DFWLRQ\u000f\u0003 and sees potential converts as consumers. However, managerial missiology is also not relevant to development today. It sees societies BudzinskiAmerican University's Clocks and Clouds, Volume 1, Spring 2012 68Budzinski as static and does not take into account the contexts of individual communities (Escobar 2002, 19). Rather, it sees the communities as numbers and as converts who can be \"consumers\" for Christianity. Therefore, scholars sometimes see managerial missiology and its \"management\" view of mission as too dehumanizing. It, like post-imperial missiology, does not work to build up the livelihoods of the communities as much as it focuses on converting them to Christianity.

Holistic Missiology Holistic missiology is a method of dynamic missionary action, meaning it stresses contextual issues, considering the ethnic, social, and ecclesiastical situations of the areas and designing its methods of community development based on these factors (Escobar 2002, 19-20). In this method, missionaries guide the creation of new structures within communities and view this as an opportunity to forge new communal ties. It focuses on how the local communities pull new expressions of faith from their culture in not only biblical but local forms as well (Langer and Jackson 1995, 36-37). Therefore, holistic missiology is the method that is most relevant community development in Latin America today. Escobar states that \"the essential aim of mission is not solely the conversion of individuals, but rather the establishment of the visible church,\" which is done through the building of community structures based on biblical support. Three features characterize Latin American missiology: participation in missionary acts, structure based on biblical models, and acknowledgment of the relationship that exists between the people's faith and their interaction with social structures (Escobar 2002, 37-38). Because holistic missiology focuses on building up community structures, which in turn can build up livelihoods, this method is still important to development today.

It focuses on the effect of missionary action on the community, rather than just on individual human beings. 69Case Selection To examine the impact of holistic missiology on community development, I studied two cases of mission work utilizing this method. One case took place in Aymara-speaking communities in Bolivia in the late 1980s, while the other was in Villa Briceno in rural Costa Rica from 2006-2010. These cases were chosen for several reasons. Missionaries in Bolivia used holistic missiology by accounting for the context of the Aymara communities and by working to establish equivalence between Aymara and Christian identity, while using local features to build community structures (Orta 1998, 165). The missionaries in Costa Rica used holistic missiology by evaluating the context of the area and then building community structures based on context and biblical models. Both have attempted to use holistic missiology to build up communities. Additionally, Christian missionaries from the United States conducted both cases. The differences between the cases also contributed to their selection. First, the cases took place in different countries, which means the identities of the people and the social and economic FRQWH[WV\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003DUHDV\u0003ZHUH\u0003GLIIHUHQW\u0011\u0003$OVR\u000f\u0003WKH\\\u0003WRRN\u0003SODFH\u0003LQ\u0003GLIIHUHQW\u0003WLPH\u0003SHULRGV\u00b2RQH\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003ODWH\u0003 1980s and the other in the 2000s. These differences could contribute to the analysis of how holistic missiology impacts community development. If the hypothesis holds true in both cases, this would show how holistic mission work has impacted community development in two very different places in Latin America. These cases are typical of holistic missiology elsewhere in Latin America. Holistic missiology has been used in many Latin American countries, and many persons involved in development are looking to use this method in the future. These cases were chosen because they are samples of two diverse Latin American communities, which could show that holistic missiology can be utilized in any context and community. Methodology The primary focus of the research will be an analysis of the Costa Rican mission project and its impact on the development of the community of Villa Briceno. The Bolivian case was chosen as a reference point. Holistic missiology did occur here and had a positive impact on community development. In contrast, the Costa Rican case has not been previously studied. The research will analyze the use of holistic missiology in the Costa Rican case using the Bolivian case as a control group to see if what happened in one context (Aymara-speaking communities in Bolivia) holds true in a different context (Villa Briceno, Costa Rica). The study will gather data through secondary sources, such as articles, books, and studies done on the Bolivian case and examine it to explore the use of holistic missiology and its positive impact on the Aymara-speaking communities.

The interview questions for the missionaries consist of questions about their project in Villa Briceno, dynamics between themselves and the community, and their opinion of the impact on the area. The questions used to interview the community members ask about the mission project, their personal IHHOLQJV\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003FKDQJHV\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003FRPPXQLW\\\u0011\u0003\u00032YHUDOO\u000f\u0003VHYHQ\u0003LQWHUYLHZV\u0003ZHUH\u0003FRQGXFWHG\u00b2WKUHH\u0003PLVVLRQDULHV\u0003 and four community members.

Comparing Uses of Holistic Missiology Aymara Communities in Bolivia The Aymara are an indigenous ethnic group found in the Andes in western Bolivia. They lived in the region for centuries before becoming a subject people of the Spanish. Missionaries have long worked with the Aymara communities, and, for decades, these missionaries simply sought to convert the Aymara to Christianity, without caring about the impact on the community. However, in the 1980s, missionaries in rural Aymara-speaking communities began a different approach: inculturation, or holistic missiology. In recent years, Christian missionaries have tried to establish equivalence between the Aymara identity and the Christian identity. The missionaries used the context of the Aymara FRPPXQLWLHV\u0003DQG\u0003FXOWXUH\u0003WR\u0003HPSKDVL]H\u0003WUDLWV\u0003WKDW\u0003UH\u00c0HFWHG\u0003&KULVWLDQ\u0003YDOXHV\u000f\u0003VXFK\u0003DV\u0003WKHLU\u0003ZRUVKLS\u0003RI\u0003 Pachamama, who is seen as the origin of life and divinity (Orta 2004, vii). Missionaries tried to establish equivalence between the concept of Pachamama and the concept of God to increase understanding in the Aymara. The missionaries incorporated aspects of their traditions into religion, such as making offerings to Pachamama to assure a good harvest or cure illness. They also took into account Aymara mythology, including legends about the origins of things, such as the wind, hail, mountains, and lakes. Lastly, the missionaries took the Aymara idea of a god who taught the people their customs, languages, and the rules for a moral life, and tied that into concepts of Christianity. The evangelization done in these communities accounted for Aymara locality, ethnicity, and tradition. The missionaries used $\\PDUD\u0003WUDGLWLRQV\u0003WR\u0003FRQVWUXFW\u0003PHWDFXOWXUDO\u0003PHWKRGV\u0003E\\\u0003DGDSWLQJ\u0003WKHLU\u0003HIIRUWV\u0003WR\u0003D\u0003VSHFL\u00bfF\u0003FXOWXUDO\u0003 context (Orta, 1998, 167). This demonstrates their use of holistic missiology. This use positively impacted community development in several ways. Their method of holistic missiology strived to recuperate indigenous culture. For example, the missionaries embraced the ways of the Aymara ancestors, once considered idolatrous, as Christian, which led to a revival of Aymara traditions. Holistic mission work in these areas also practiced social action and promoted communal solidarity and justice (Orta 1998, 168-169). They emphasized the importance of helping one another and providing services to the community. These services included education, small jobs, and improved health care (Poma 1995, 443). The missionaries taught that communal was better than separate, and this helped to tighten the communities in both religious and social contexts.

The missionaries built up a nature of solidarity between the Aymara people, which strengthened 71communal ties and, consequently, communal structures. The missionaries also sought to increase Aymara involvement in the church through faith JURXSV\u0011\u00039DULRXV\u0003ULWXDOV\u0003RI\u0003FRPPXQLW\\\u000f\u0003DORQJ\u0003ZLWK\u0003HYDQJHOL]DWLRQ\u000f\u0003PDUNHG\u0003WKHVH\u0003JDWKHULQJV\u0011\u0003/RFDOV\u0003\u00bfUVW\u0003 came due to the draw of community rituals but, eventually, began participating in not only the faith groups but also church services (Orta 1998, 171). Entire families would come together to attend these groups, and, consequently, the bonds of family in the communities were reinforced. Additionally, the missionaries increased involvement by having Aymara catechists, those who were trained to instruct others in the Christian faith, lead the faith groups. The community approved and appointed these FDWHFKLVWV\u0003DQG\u0003RIWHQ\u0003VDZ\u0003WKHP\u0003DV\u0003DXWKRULW\\\u0003\u00bfJXUHV\u000f\u0003ZKLFK\u0003OHG\u0003WR\u0003D\u0003PRUH\u0003VWUXFWXUHG\u0003FRPPXQLW\\\u0003 2UWD\u0003 2004, vii). Missionaries also involved themselves in the community by participating in traditional rituals, attending community gatherings, and providing services, such as education and health, to the communities (Poma, 1995, 443). Hence, the Aymara saw them as facilitators of development as well as church representatives. \u0003%HFDXVH\u0003WKLV\u0003VWXG\\\u0003GH\u00bfQHV\u0003FRPPXQLW\\\u0003GHYHORSPHQW\u0003DV\u0003VRFLDO\u000f\u0003FXOWXUDO\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003UHOLJLRXV\u0003DFWLRQV\u0003 WKDW\u0003LPSURYH\u0003WKH\u0003OLYHOLKRRGV\u0003RI\u0003XQGHUSULYLOHJHG\u0003FRPPXQLWLHV\u000f\u0003WKHUH\u0003ZDV\u0003GH\u00bfQLWHO\\\u0003D\u0003VLJQL\u00bfFDQW\u0003SRVLWLYH\u0003 impact on community development in the Aymara communities. Through their work, the missionaries increased community involvement, reinforced family bonds, and brought the community closer together, thereby strengthening the institutions and foundations of the community. They improved education in the communities, provided health services, and sometimes offered the people work, which they did not have many opportunities for, as relatively isolated peoples in a new and competitive world (Poma 1995, 444). The missionaries used social services, culture, and religion to help the community and to increase the people's livelihoods. Consequently, their use of holistic missiology did have a positive impact on community development in the Aymara-speaking communities in Bolivia. Villa Briceno, Costa Rica From 2006-2010, Costa Rica Mission Projects, a Christian mission organization, went into Villa Briceno, Costa Rica to conduct missionary work. The missionaries invited mission groups from the United States as volunteers. Villa Briceno is a small, rural, and very impoverished area in southern Costa Rica. In the past, the United Fruit Company existed in the area but it later pulled out, leaving Villa Briceno in complete poverty. Costa Rica Mission Projects rebuilt a recreational center, or camp, as a gathering place, renovated a church, and built a classroom, all for the entire community to use. The group also employed holistic missiology. Rather than simply trying to convert the people, the missionaries worked to build up the community by building institutions, along with trust (Bailey 2011). The purpose of this analysis is to examine whether the missionaries' impact on the community goes beyond the construction of buildings.

BudzinskiAmerican University's Clocks and Clouds, Volume 1, Spring 2012 72Budzinski WIL BAILEY Wil Bailey is the founder and head missionary of Costa Rica Mission Projects. He is in charge of many of the decisions for the mission projects. He also coordinates the groups of volunteers from the United States that come on short-term trips to help.

However, during the years we spent in Villa Briceno, we were constantly visiting the local store for snacks and doing activities with the children at the local school. We often heard stories and comments about how excited the volunteers were when they felt like they had gotten to know some of the local people, and vice versa.

I hope that our efforts motivate each church to rethink what they are capable of as far as their own vision for reaching out to their neighbors. The buildings are important, but embracing the fact that we are all part of a Universal Body of Christ is much more important (Bailey 2011). This interview was interesting because, even though he is the founder and head of Costa Rica Mission Projects, Wil did not glorify the work done by the project. He seemed very honest in his answers. Based on his responses, it seems as if the project focused more on religious development than community development. Also, it seems like the missionaries had more contact with community members involved in the church than those who were not. His statement that, \"We think it is 73important that the volunteers from the States have the opportunity to interact with the local people, and worships services are a major way we see that happen,\" reinforces this (Bailey 2011). Hence, most of the community involvement they had was with locals involved with the church prior to their arrival. Additionally, Wil admits that he does not know if there was an impact due to their work. He says more people did begin attending the church in Villa Briceno since the completion of their mission project, but there is no evidence that it was a cause of their work. Also, his answer \"Ultimately, only time will tell,\" indicates that no noticeable impact on community development occurred as a direct result of their mission work. They locals and the missionaries formed relationships, and the church itself was improved, but based on Wil's interview, their work had more of an impact on religious development than community development in Villa Briceno. However, Lauren, the next missionary interviewed, was of a somewhat different opinion. LAUREN DUNAGIN DE ALVAREZ Lauren is a missionary with Costa Rica Mission Projects. She began working with them two years before the Villa Briceno project. Her responses were quite different from Wil's in that she believes that their use of holistic missiology did have a positive impact on community development, making it relevant to development today.

It is a religious organization so, for example, we had Bible School for the kids, which helped us form relationships with both the kids in the community and their parents. It was a pretty equal amount because we reached out to the community but we also worked to share the Gospel. Our main goal was to make connections with the community, but also to do construction.

The locals were open and wanted to get to know us. The kids were open and wanted to hang out. They were very welcoming and made me feel like a part of the community. Even now, some still keep in touch with me.

Sometimes it was because they were curious about what was going on and why so many gringos were there. Some would come in their spare time and help build because they felt like the work we were doing affected them.

I also feel like the community was able to form relationships with people from a different country. Overall, I feel like there was a positive impact (Dunagin de Alvarez 2011). Lauren's responses gave the impression that there was a more noticeable impact on community development due to the mission project. She also answered that they placed the same amount of focus on religious development as community development. While they obviously worked to share the Gospel, they also reached out to the community to make connections and to do construction work. She stressed that the relationships formed with the Costa Ricans in the area had a positive impact. According to her, more people became involved with the church; however, the only reason given was that many were curious about the Americans. This does not seem as if the locals joined because of the missionary efforts to spread the Gospel. However, no matter what the locals' reason for joining the church, the fact that they missionaries' work did lead more Costa Ricans to join the church could have led to strengthened ties and structures within the community. So, while Lauren says there was an impact on community development, it was mainly through the creation of new relationships, which could have strengthened community ties and could have brought the locals closer together. It also could have led the Costa Ricans to see outsiders in a more positive light. Hence, while there was a positive impact, it was to a somewhat smaller degree. Karen, the third missionary interviewed, seemed to agree with Lauren in a few ways regarding their work.

When we worked in the community, we wanted to share God's love and message. We also witnessed their religion and the way they worshiped.

Our main goal every day was to work on the construction of the buildings.

It is such a poor area that any work done will help. I think that the people were truly grateful that we were there. However, in the project in the city, it did not seem like the community changed at all and there wasn't really an overall impact (Wintercamp 2011). Karen's responses make for interesting analysis. She says they placed an equal amount of focus on religious and community development, but, like Lauren, the \"community development\" she talks about is construction and building connections with the Costa Ricans. She does not say anything about more people becoming involved in the church, but simply talks about locals coming to the worksite and hanging out with them. This was her view of increased involvement. In addition, while she says there was a positive impact on community development, the reason she gives is because it is a poor area and that any work done would help. Therefore, while there was a positive impact because of the group work, it seems that work done by any group would help because Villa Briceno is so impoverished. Additionally, Karen's comparison between the project in Villa Briceno and the project they did after in Alajuela, a big city, gives the impression that the area matters. According to her responses, in Villa Briceno, the missionaries formed relationships and made an impact in Villa Briceno, but not in Alajuela. Thus, it seems that the impact on community development could depend on the location of the project or the level of poverty and not solely on the work of the missionaries.

There was an impact because of the work of the gringos (Gonzalez 2011). Huguito spoke of works the missionaries performed besides construction. He mentioned that they also evangelized the inhabitants, provided bible school, and distributed food and clothes to the community. The food and clothes distribution could have improved the livelihood of some poor families in the community for a short time. However, this was temporary, as the distribution would have ended after the missionaries left. He too focuses on the friendship of the missionaries and volunteers, describing how they went to church and fellowshipped. He did say that more people joined in church but his reasoning was that the \"gringos\" were there.

Thus, if an impact on community development did occur, there is no evidence that it was solely due to the missionary work. He did express that the missionaries' work helped increase unity in the community but this is one small step towards community development. The next Costa Rican interviewed, Felipe, was of a similar opinion. FELIPE BARBAS Felipe is twenty-four years old and lives in Villa Briceno.

However, he mainly focuses on construction work, saying the community was better off because they constructed buildings and developed infrastructure. In addition, he was good friends with the missionaries and says people generally liked them because they were helping the community. From his interview, it seems that the missionaries' work did have a positive impact on community development due to missionaries' distribution of food and building of infrastructure. While this community development may be to a small degree, it did occur. The next interviewee portrayed a greater picture of the impact of the missionary work on the community of Villa Briceno.

They built structures for us. The missionaries and the groups of volunteers also helped with sales at the store and with nearby hardware stores in the town nearby. They also bought crafts that people in the community made (Gonzalez Araya 2011). Don Hugo is a different subject than the other community members interviewed. He is not only a patriarch within the church, but a community member as well. Nevertheless, his responses were relatively similar. He describes the work of the missionaries as including construction and social work. Social work included evangelism, bible school, and distributing materials to the community. Thus, it seems as if there was a focus on both religion and community, as the missionaries stated in 79their interviews. According to Don Hugo, the work did help because the buildings were for community use for events such as class, meetings, and weddings. He also says that, while there, the missionaries and volunteers helped with sales at the store in town and bought crafts made by locals. However, this income that the missionaries provided would have ended as soon as they left the area. Thus, it was not a lingering impact on the livelihoods of the community members. Nonetheless, a positive impact did exist. Through the construction of buildings for gatherings and the establishment of connections, holistic missiology did develop the community socially. Drawing Conclusions: How Does Holistic Missiology Have An Impact? The study examined the hypothesis, holistic missiology positively impacts community development in Latin America, using two cases: missionaries in Aymara-speaking communities in Bolivia and in Villa Briceno, Costa Rica. Both cases involved holistic missiology, and, in both cases, missiology impacted community development, though it was to varying degrees. The Aymara case had SRUWUD\\HG\u0003D\u0003VLJQL\u00bfFDQW\u0003LPSDFW\u0003RQ\u0003FRPPXQLW\\\u0003GHYHORSPHQW\u0003EHFDXVH\u0003WKH\u0003XVH\u0003RI\u0003KROLVWLF\u0003PLVVLRORJ\\\u0003OHG\u0003 to better education, more jobs, better infrastructure, and stronger family and community ties. The Costa Rican case was different. While holistic missiology did have an positive impact on community development in Villa Briceno, it was to a smaller degree. For the purposes of this study, community development was conceptualized as social, cultural, and religious actions that seek to improve the livelihoods of underprivileged communities. Using this conceptualization, the interviews, along with the Bolivian case as a reference point, it seems that holistic missiology did have a positive impact on community development in Villa Briceno, though perhaps not a lasting impact and perhaps not on the entire community. There were several differences between the Bolivia and Villa Briceno missionary projects. While both emphasized forging ties with the community and spreading Christianity, the missionaries in Bolivia worked to increase community solidarity as well as to help livelihoods through improved education, providing health care and jobs, thereby strengthening the foundations of the community. Meanwhile, the missionaries in Villa Briceno focused on building connections, constructing buildings for the community and, to a small extent, distributing food and clothes. These differences were the reason why the Bolivian missionaries had a stronger impact on community development than the Villa Briceno project. While the missionaries' work in Costa Rica was important, it did not have a large effect on the entire community. The buildings are of a great use but will not improve the people's status or work towards bringing them out of poverty. Additionally, the activities in the buildings (church, school, weddings, and meetings) would most likely still have taken place elsewhere had buildings not been constructed. The buildings simply give the people places to gather so that the community could come together. The distribution of food and clothes and purchases of goods were both temporary. However, despite this, there was still a positive impact on community development.

In their responses, the Costa Ricans largely focused on the fact that they BudzinskiAmerican University's Clocks and Clouds, Volume 1, Spring 2012 80Budzinski liked the missionaries and became friends with them. However, the establishment of camaraderie allowed people from two different countries to meet and learn more about the other. It also could have brought the locals to regard outsiders in a more positive light. Additionally, the majority of the interviews mentioned that the missionaries worked to evangelize, provided bible school, and were involved in church services. Despite the fact that they built structures for the community, the project still focused more on religious development than community development. Also, the missionaries' seemed to be more involved with the community members who were also church members. The missionaries worked with the church and attended church services and functions; hence, they would naturally have more contact with people who were actively involved in the church. Of the many Costa Ricans contacted, the only ones willing to be interviewed were church PHPEHUV\u0003EHIRUH\u0003WKH\u0003DUULYDO\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003PLVVLRQDULHV\u0011\u0003,W\u0003DSSHDUV\u0003WKDW\u0003WKH\u0003PLVVLRQDULHV\u0003GLG\u0003QRW\u0003LQ\u00c0XHQFH\u0003WKH\u0003 community as a whole but rather the portion of the community involved in the church. Accordingly, the use of holistic missiology in Villa Briceno did have a positive effect but not to a large degree. The responses to the interviews reinforced that the work of the missionaries impacted people socially. Each of the responses by both missionaries and community members emphasized that the missionaries and volunteers focused on constructing buildings to establish places for gatherings and on establishing connections with the locals. Despite the smaller impact, holistic missiology did have a positive impact on the development of the communities in Costa Rica. This shows that holistic missiology is still relevant to community development today, though its impact may occur in varying degrees depending on the context and the community. Nonetheless, the use of holistic missiology for community development is still important. It could lead to stronger community ties, increased infrastructure, distribution of food and clothes (though this may be temporary), and relationships between peoples of different countries. So, holistic missiology does have a positive impact on communities in Latin America, though, as a branch of community development, its impact is to a VPDOOHU\u000f\u0003OHVV\u0003VLJQL\u00bfFDQW\u0003GHJUHH\u0011\u0003 Though the Bolivian and Costa Rican cases were examples of holistic missiology, the conclusion cannot be applied to all examples of holistic mission work. There were limitations to the study due to time constraints, resources, and intervening and antecedent variables. Because so few people were willing to be interviewed, this is a small sample size of interviewees. They might not be completely representative of the entire community in which the mission project took place. Also, the interviews of the Costa Ricans took place in Spanish, so there could be errors due to translation. The role of the memory is also a factor. Even though only two years have passed since the completion of the work in Villa Briceno, people's memories could have changed. Things could have occurred since the completion of the project that might have affected the community, but due to memory, those interviewed could have attributed these changes to the missionaries' project. Additionally, the only community members who responded were church members, and all except one were in their twenties. These factors could have skewed their views, as the missionaries could have appealed more to church members and young people. HoHO Intervening and antecedent variables also exist. The intervening variables are the location and the cultural and political contexts of the mission area, and the antecedent variable is the existence of a local church or religious ideology before the arrival of the missionaries. Each of these variables could themselves affect community development and could alter the perceived impact of holistic 81missiology on those areas. This is why, in his interview, Wil stated that he did not know if there was an impact on the community because of the project. Church attendance had increased, but there was no evidence that this was due to the mission work. If this study were to be conducted again, some changes would be made. If further time and resources were possible, interviews conducted in the actual areas would be more informative and helpful than relying on responses through the Internet and phone. Face-to-face interviews might get more community members to participate, as the interviews would seem more personal. Interviews that could not take place over the phone or computer due to access problems could be conducted. Firsthand observation of Villa Briceno would be valuable to supplement the interviews. Comparing these observations and interviews could account for lapses in people's memory and differences in their perspectives. The exploration of more cases could also occur if time and resources would allow for it. To build further upon this research, one could examine several issues.

Introduction On January 1, 1994, a group of 3,000 rebels stormed the Mexican state of Chiapas, taking RYHU\u0003VHYHUDO\u0003FLWLHV\u000f\u0003VHWWLQJ\u0003\u00bfUH\u0003WR\u0003SROLFH\u0003VWDWLRQV\u000f\u0003DQG\u0003IUHHLQJ\u0003SULVRQHUV\u0003IURP\u0003WKH\u0003VWDWH\u0003FDSLWDO\u0011\u00037KH\u0003 group of rebels, who called themselves the Ej\u00e9rcito Zapatista de la Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional (EZLN), or the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, enjoyed brief success before the Mexican army drove them back (Ross 1995, 169-187). The EZLN, a group that had been meeting and slowly gathering supporters for the past few years, chose January 1, 1994 to announce their presence to the international community in protest of the day the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into effect(Ross 1995, 23-35). The Zapatistas are a leftist group of indigenous Maya and non-indigenous sympathizers from the Chiapas region of Mexico who believe that the Mexican government no longer serves the common citizen, so they strive to achieve indigenous autonomy and work so that the extensive natural resource VXSSO\\\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003&KLDSDV\u0003UHJLRQ\u0003DFWXDOO\\\u0003EHQH\u00bfWV\u0003WKH\u0003SHRSOH\u0003ZKR\u0003OLYH\u0003WKHUH\u0003 5RVV\u0003\u0014 \u0018 \u0011\u0003 However, one of the most unique aspects of the Zapatista strife compared to similar liberation movements is the extensive participation of women.

In addition, women constitute over half of the Zapatista support bases throughout Chiapas and have worked to improve a variety of both indigenous and women's rights issues by means of the movement (Speed, Stephen, and Hern \u00e1ndez Castillo 2006). In Chiapas, indigenous women have a long history of abuse and treatment as second-class citizens. Christine Eber and Christine Kovic describe in their extensive study about women in Chiapas, Mexico how both \"mestizas and indigenous women, whether urban or rural, single or married, are united in their struggles to support themselves and their families, to curtail domestic violence and rape, and to be treated fairly in the judicial system\" (Eber and Kovic 2003).

I used content analysis of the organizations' websites along with an interview to trace the Zapatista Movement's progression as it brought awareness to women's rights issues in the region. The goal was to determine if it led to the foundation of the numerous local and internationally based women's rights NGOs in Chiapas. I have found that though the clearly stated pro-women's rights goals of the Zapatista's Women's Revolutionary Law have not yet been realized in terms of the broader population of women in Chiapas, the movement has both helped to bring awareness to the international community and also spur local activism for the improvement RI\u0003ZRPHQ\u00b6V\u0003ULJKWV\u0011\u0003$FWLYLVW\u0003RUJDQL]DWLRQV\u0003KDYH\u0003JUDGXDOO\\\u0003EHQH\u00bfWHG\u0003WKH\u0003EURDGHU\u0003IHPDOH\u0003SRSXODWLRQ\u0003LQ\u0003 Chiapas by making necessary resources accessible for women that the EZLN has not. Literature Review After reviewing a wide variety of scholarly literature about the Zapatista Movement, I found that there are two distinct schools of thought that dominate the study of the affect of the Zapatista Movement on women in Chiapas. The dominating school of thought in most of the reviewed publications emphasized the \"Zapatista woman\" as a woman who is directly involved or enlisted in the Zapatista Army. This type of research typically centers on personal, in-depth interviews with one or a few women in the Zapatista Army and typically compares their personal experiences before and after joining the EZLN. While this type of ethnographic research is very interesting and informative, it is really only 87VLJQL\u00bfFDQW\u0003RQ\u0003D\u0003VPDOOHU\u0003VFDOH\u0003EHFDXVH\u0003LWV\u0003UHVXOWV\u0003DUH\u0003UHDOO\\\u0003RQO\\\u0003DSSOLFDEOH\u0003WR\u0003D\u0003VPDOO\u0003PLQRULW\\\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003 female population in Chiapas - that is, the women who are actively and directly enlisted in the EZLN. )RU\u0003FODULW\\\u0003SXUSRVHV\u000f\u0003,\u0003ZLOO\u0003UHIHU\u0003WR\u0003WKLV\u0003\u00bfUVW\u0003VFKRRO\u0003RI\u0003WKRXJKW\u0003DV\u0003WKH\u0003\u00b3'LUHFW\u0003(QOLVWPHQW\u00b4\u0003JURXS\u0011\u0003 The other major school of thought in the scholarship on this topic focused instead on the LGHD\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003\u00b3=DSDWLVWD\u0003ZRPHQ\u00b4\u0003DV\u0003WKH\u0003ZRPHQ\u0003ZKR\u0003OLYH\u0003LQ\u0003RI\u00bfFLDO\u0003=DSDWLVWD\u0003YLOODJHV\u0003WKURXJKRXW\u0003WKH\u0003HQWLUH\u0003 state of Chiapas.

This school of thought will henceforth be referred to as the \"Indirect Involvement\" group because the women who are in focus in this scholarship are often not directly enlisted in the Zapatista Army. The Direct Enlistment school of thought in the reviewed scholarly literature focuses on the women who are personally involved in the Zapatista Army. These women have typically left their homes and families to live and train at the Zapatista training camps in the secluded jungle regions of Chiapas (Speed, Stephen, and Hern \u00e1ndez Castillo 2006). From this perspective, the women who were focused on have typically enjoyed great individual improvement in their women's rights status as a part and a result of the Zapatista Movement. Also, because one of the foundational goals of the Zapatistas is to educate their members, women directly involved had almost immediate access to substantial education which has allowed them to learn not only to speak, but also to become literate in Spanish (Eber 1999) - an essential skill for any type of advancement in Mexico, yet a skill denied to the majority of indigenous women in the region (Eber 1999). Also, by living at the training camps, women in the EZLN enjoy a steady source of nutrition, which is rare because women \"are often expected to wait until the men DUH\u0003\u00bfQLVKHG\u0003HDWLQJ\u0003EHIRUH\u0003WKH\\\u0003FDQ\u0003EHJLQ\u0003WR\u0003HDW \u0003XQGHU\u0003WKH\u0003FRQGLWLRQV\u0003RI\u0003VFDUFLW\\\u0003WKDW\u0003DUH\u0003SUHYDOHQW\u0003 within those communities, the end result is that women eat much less than men\" (Kampwirth 2002). A combination of steady nutrition and access to legitimate education paired with more readily available medical aid upon direct participation on the EZLN camps, women in the Zapatista army have commonly enjoyed substantial improvement the their individual standards of living. Coupled with the individual empowerment the EZLN offers, the Zapatista Movement has allowed some women access to freedom in several areas of their life, including liberty from the physical and sexual abuse that is rampant in the region (Munoz Ramirez 2003). 7KLV\u0003'LUHFW\u0003(QOLVWPHQW\u0003VFKRRO\u0003RI\u0003WKRXJKW\u0003IRFXVHV\u0003VSHFL\u00bfFDOO\\\u0003RQ\u0003WKH\u0003FKDQJH\u0003LQ\u0003LQGLYLGXDO\u0003 women's lives and the improved lifestyles they enjoy as a result of their own involvement in the Zapatista Movement. By focusing on individual interviews with a limited number of women who have seen a great change in their own lives due to their direct involvement in the Zapatista Army, many of the scholarly sources in this school of thought portray an impressive change in women's rights in Chiapas. Such sources seem to assume that joining the Zapatista Movement is the answer to solving women's rights problems in the region. However, as a young Zapatista woman named Daria described, WeiresAmerican University's Clocks and Clouds, Volume 1, Spring 2012 88Weires MRLQLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003PRYHPHQW\u0003IRU\u0003PDQ\\\u0003ZRPHQ\u0003LQYROYHV\u0003WKH\u0003GLI\u00bfFXOW\u0003FKRLFH\u0003EHWZHHQ\u0003PDUULDJH\u0003DQG\u0003IDPLO\\\u0003OLIH\u0003 or involvement in the Army. \"I'm not going to marry because then I won't be free to attend meetings, to visit other communities, whereas where I am, I can go to my meetings, I can stay and chat, but if I had a husband he wouldn't let me, so I don't marry\"(Speed, Hern \u00e1ndez Castillo, and Stephen 2006). As a result, the idea that the majority of the women in Chiapas will give up marriage and family life to join the movement is highly unlikely and as a result, there remains thousands of sexually and physically abused, monolingual, illiterate, and malnourished women at home in Chiapas who can not directly EHQH\u00bfW\u0003IURP\u0003WKH\u0003LQGLYLGXDO\u0003RSSRUWXQLWLHV\u0003WKH\u0003(=/1\u0003KDYH\u0003WR\u0003RIIHU\u0011\u0003 The Direct Enlistment school of thought is very limited in the context of the overall impact of the Zapatista Movement on women's rights in Chiapas. As stated above, the majority of the research focuses on very few personal experiences of great change, but does not account for the rest of the female population in the region. As a result, this school of thought primarily outlines statically unusual or LQVLJQL\u00bfFDQW\u0003FDVHV\u0003WKDW\u0003ZRXOG\u0003QRW\u0003EH\u0003DSSOLFDEOH\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003UHVW\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003SRSXODWLRQ\u0003LQ\u0003DVVHVVLQJ\u0003WKH\u0003EURDGHU\u0003 impact the Zapatista Movement had on women's rights. The second major school of thought, or the Indirect Involvement group, focuses on this broader majority of the female population in Chiapas. The common argument explains that though there have been substantial changes for the women directly in the EZLN, these women are a distinct minority in the region and there has been relatively little immediate success for the common women of Chiapas in improving their human rights status as a result of the movement. The individual women who abandon their families to join the EZLN often do enjoy much improved living conditions, but they are often looked down upon as deserters of traditional family and tribal values (Speed, Stephen, and Hern \u00e1ndez Castillo 2006). This Indirect Involvement school acknowledges that even though the Zapatistas as a whole encourage forward-thinking, the whole population's mindset will not change as rapidly. Though changing the minds of their fellow indigenous men towards their treatment of their wives clearly poses a challenge, an obstacle within the female population also exists because some of the older generations of women believe that it is the husband's duty to beat his wife to ensure she upholds her own responsibilities (Kampwirth 2002) - as has been traditionally taught. Since this school RI\u0003WKRXJKW\u0003DFNQRZOHGJHV\u0003WKDW\u0003WKH\u0003FRPPRQ\u0003ZRPHQ\u0003RI\u0003&KLDSDV\u0003KDYH\u0003QRW\u0003HQMR\\HG\u0003WKH\u0003VDPH\u0003EHQH\u00bfWV\u0003DV\u0003 those in the EZLN, it argues that one of the most important ways that the Zapatista Movement has helped to indirectly improve the greater female population's rights status in the region is by calling more domestic and international awareness to the substandard living conditions of the indigenous women in the region. The Indirect Involvement school of thought discusses concepts and questions that are much more applicable to the broader population of indigenous women in Chiapas. This particular school more readily supports the concept of increased awareness from the Zapatista Movement that may result in greater successful activism and subsequently improve women's rights in the region. Likewise, the Indirect Involvement school of thought is more realistic in acknowledging that while the EZLN has greatly impacted some women, the vast majority of women in the region remain oppressed and have only experienced marginal improvements as an immediate result of the movement. Within these two distinct twos of thought, I have found that the individual researchers of the reviewed publications have typically employed either qualitative or ethnographical methods, statistical analyses, or, most frequently, some combination of the two methods. Through the utilization of these 89research methods, the literature on this subject collectively discusses several common themes and WRSLFV\u0003RI\u0003GLVSXWH\u000f\u0003RIWHQ\u0003ZLWK\u0003D\u0003SULPDU\\\u0003JRDO\u0003WR\u0003\u00bfUVWO\\\u0003JLYH\u0003DQ\u0003DVVHVVPHQW\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003FRPPRQ\u0003LQGLJHQRXV\u0003 woman's rights and lifestyle prior to and since the beginning of the Zapatista Movement, and thusly providing a level against which one can measure change or improvement. The most pressing human rights violations that most of the researchers and indigenous women alike emphasized are issues involving the indigenous woman's lack of power and ability make decisions for her self, uncontrolled cases of physical and sexual abuse, and the lack of accessibility to basic resources, such as education, healthcare, and substantial nutrition. By utilizing a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods of research, the literature on this topic paints a picture of the pre-Zapatista and current situation for the women in Chiapas - both those directly enlisted in the EZLN and not. \u0003'XULQJ\u0003WKH\u0003\u00bfUVW\u0003'HFODUDWLRQ\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003/DFDQGRQ\u0003-XQJOH\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003=DSDWLVWD\u0003ZRPHQ\u000f\u0003OHG\u0003E\\\u0003(=/1\u0003 military leader Commander Susana, proclaimed a list of ten nonnegotiable demands for justice and respect, both to their own community and to the Mexican government (Anon. 1996). This subsection of the Zapatista Declaration in the Lacandon became known as the Women's Revolutionary Law (see page 25 for the list of demands). As much of the statistically-based research shows, there was good reason for such demands. At the beginning of the Zapatista movement, Chiapas had the highest maternal mortality rate in Mexico: 117 out of every 100,000 women died in child birth because of a lack of adequate female health services (Speed, Hern \u00e1ndez Castillo, and Stephen 2006). With 60% of the population under the age of 20, most adolescent girls were sold into marriage by their parents and gave birth to an average of 7 children (Ross 1995).

Approximately 60% of women in Chiapas in 1995 were illiterate (Eber and Kovic 2003). At least another 40% were monolingual- meaning that they only spoke the native language of the village, and not Spanish (Ross 1995).

The multiple researchers' use of statistical data to demonstrate the women's rights situation in Chiapas prior to and during the beginning of the Zapatista Movement allows the reader to understand that the basis for the Women's Revolutionary Law was a result of the undeniably oppressive gender roles and cultural implications of being a woman in Chiapas. A major part of the debate between the two major schools of thought is a question of how much this declaration actually impacted indigenous women's lives. In order to determine an impact, statistical information involving both the women directly involved in the EZLN and the common indigenous women of the Chiapas is crucial to compare and analyze. The researchers from the perspective of the Indirect Involvement school of thought commonly employed various statistical data and changes (or lack there of) in maternal mortality rates, the availability or usage of birth control, average number of children, literacy rates, among others WR\u0003GHPRQVWUDWH\u0003WKDW\u0003WKH\u0003=DSDWLVWD\u0003PRYHPHQW\u0003KDV\u0003ODUJHO\\\u0003QRW\u0003EHQH\u00bfWHG\u0003WKH\u0003PDMRULW\\\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003IHPDOH\u0003 population (Munoz Ramirez 2003).

By integrating qualitative methods, both schools of thought were able to more completely develop their respective argument, often by integrating personal experiences of indigenous women from the region. By far the most common qualitative method to be used in the literature on this topic was the interview. Not quite as popular, but none-the-less common, were the observational study, another qualitative method. Along with ethnography, such methods are used in both schools of thought about women involved in the movement in order to better understand their experience in the EZLN. All of the researchers traveled to Chiapas and many stayed for an extended period of time, interviewing, observing, and living alongside of women both directly in the EZLN and those who are not. By including personal experiences, both the researcher and the reader are able to understand the motivation that many women experienced to join the revolution when opportunity presented itself. Christine Eber, the author of the article \"Seeking Our Own Food: Indigenous Women's Power and Autonomy in San Pedro, Chiapas,\" chose to live with an indigenous women named Antonia (who spoke Spanish as well her native language) and her husband for multiple extended stays. Throughout her research, she includes anecdotes and commentary Antonia's personal experiences with the Zapatista movement and uses these experiences to demonstrate the individual improvements Antonia has enjoyed as a result of her involvement in the movement. Eber uses these anecdotes to demonstrate that there is not only validity in the numerical statistics, but personal interviews and experiences also add insight into cultural norms and traditions that explain these statistics, rather than just recording them IRU\u0003WKHLU\u0003QXPHULFDO\u0003VLJQL\u00bfFDQFH\u0011 This type of qualitative methodology, such as ethnography, interviews, and observations are similarly employed in the Indirect Involvement school of thought, though in these cases such personal experiences are used to demonstrate the opposite point - how the common woman still suffers despite the goals of the EZLN and the real-life drawbacks that prevent all women from being able to join the EZLN. As a result, the qualitative methods of research demonstrated the inherent differences between the two main schools of thought that statistics alone could not portray. For example, an important theme that many of the interviews and ethnographic research uncovered was the question of traditional LQGLJHQRXV\u0003YDOXHV\u0003DQG\u0003UROHV\u0003RI\u0003ZRPHQ\u0003DQG\u0003KRZ\u0003WKHVH\u0003YDOXHV\u0003FRQ\u00c0LFW\u0003GLUHFWO\\\u0003ZLWK\u0003WKH\u0003QHZ\u0003=DSDWLVWD\u0003 ideology (Millan Moncayo 2006). Most researchers found that according to many of the indigenous women, there was a need for a change from traditional beliefs (Harcourt and Escobar 2005). In other words, the combination of crippling domestic and sexual violence, the lack of education, resources, and adequate nutrition, have long since worked to keep women submissive to men and stuck in a position of slave-like dependence, with no hope of advancement (Ross 2000). With the changes and arising opportunities that the Zapatista army had to offer, more and more women began (and are still beginning) to realize that their right to be respected as a human being is more valuable than traditional, yet personally detrimental customs (Millan Moncayo 2006).91Through a careful combination of both qualitative research methods and intensive statistical collection and analysis, the research about the impact of the Zapatista Movement on women's rights in Chiapas explores the experiences of both women directly in the EZLN and the common indigenous women from Chiapas, Mexico. Within the two dominating schools of thought, several debates center on the women's struggle to remain true to their indigenous roots and traditions, while still demanding respect and seeking better lives for them and their children. Another frequently discussed point in the literature was the concept that the Zapatista movement is multifaceted. It is as much a women's movement as an indigenous one and the women's strife within the group mirrors larger indigenous struggle against Mexico. Another universal theme is that is it up to the individual women work for change rather than waiting for society to transform. The Indirect Involvement school of thought is more effective than the Direct Enlistment school in providing possible answers to the question of how the whole population of women in Chiapas has been affected by the Zapatista Movement.

Research Design For this study, I chose to focus on the Indirect Involvement school of thought that centers on the impact of the Zapatista Movement on the broader female population of Chiapas.

Though there is always a limit to how much an organization can help a large population, there are multiple non- governmental organizations that seem to carry out the pro-equality values that the Zapatistas expressed in their Declaration. I hypothesized that the Zapatista Movement has positively impacted the women's rights status in Chiapas, Mexico. With the Zapatista Movement as the independent variable and the subsequent human rights organizations as the dependent variable, an improvement in women's rights would result if it holds true that the movement caused an increase in local women's rights organizations. In order to study the effect of the Zapatista Movement on the creation of pro-women's rights organizations in Chiapas, I originally intended to primarily use a process tracing methodology LQ\u0003RUGHU\u0003WR\u0003IROORZ\u0003WKH\u0003LPSDFW\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003PRYHPHQW\u0003DV\u0003DQ\u0003LQ\u00c0XHQFH\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003IRXQGLQJ\u0003RI\u0003WKHVH\u0003RUJDQL]DWLRQV\u0003 through a series of personal interviews and website analysis in order to discover the histories of certain organizations. Process tracing is a method social science research which uses historical context to trace the progression of an event over time in order to form a theory (Falleti 2007). However, as will be explained shortly, I had to adjust the methodology to primarily content analysis due to a lack of adequate responses in obtaining interviews.

By investigating the organizations' founding history, I sought to uncover their motivations to starting women's work in Chiapas and thus determine if they had any links to the Zapatistas. Unfortunately, though several of the organizations responded after some prompting, only one followed through with a legitimate interview. Though several asked for questions via email, none actually sent back responses to the questions and others simply referred me to certain sections on their web pages. Fortunately, all of the selected organizations do have extensive websites with in-dept founding history and mission sections. Instead of relying on interviews with the organizers, I collected data that was provided on the organizations' various web pages to see which ones identify with the Zapatista Movement, or if they cite another reason as a cause for their organization, by analyzing the \"History,\" \"About Us,\" and \"Mission\" sections of their websites. The analysis of these organizations and their founding demonstrates how a social movement can be successful for a population, other than the people directly involved, by spreading awareness and subsequently causing more activism. Though some organizations have other motivations for initiating their work, analyzing each organization's background determines to what extent the movement has indirectly aided the larger population of women in Chiapas. Findings Before investigating the 12 human rights organizations, I hypothesized that the Zapatista Movement caused women's rights organizations to open in Chiapas, Mexico and in this way, indirectly improved women's rights in the region.

However, when the nuns working at the orphanage discovered that Nick's parents are a gynecologist (Dr. Leigner) and a dentist (Dr. Dave Brody), they asked if they would come down to Chiapas to give medical assistance to the children (Leigner 2011). Several years later, the family has now set up a medical care center that specializes in women's heath and reproductive services in a small village in Chiapas (Leigner 2011). Dr. Leigner explained that after treating several EZLN members, living among the Zapatistas and witnessing their strife, she and the members of the Chiapas Project (1) absolutely support and sympathize with the group's motives, especially as they pertain to women's rights, even though The Chiapas Project (1) LV\u0003QRW\u0003GLUHFWO\\\u0003DI\u00bfOLDWHG\u0003ZLWK\u0003WKH\u0003(=/1\u0003 /HLJQHU\u0003\u0015\u0013\u0014\u0014 \u0011\u0003,W\u0003LV\u0003LPSRUWDQW\u0003WR\u0003QRWH\u0003WKDW\u0003QR\u0003PHQWLRQ\u0003RI\u0003WKH\u0003 Zapatistas or their goals were present on the Chiapas Project's (1) website.

In order to discover how these organizations might connect the goals and ideologies of the Zapatistas with real-life improvement in women's rights, I hypothesized that the Zapatista Movement caused an increase in women's rights organizations to become active in Chiapas. Through a combination of website content analysis and one successful interview, I used process tracing to determine the historical backgrounds of each organization and look for trends in Zapatista ties. Process tracing applies historical contexts to track an event, or in this case, organization, as it progresses in order to form a broader theory or trend in social science research (Falleti 2007).

This research demonstrates that the impact of a social movement such as the Zapatista Movement has larger implications than the most obvious. Unlike other social movement research, this study demonstrates how a singular movement can spawn other movements that are in fact, very separate from the original.

This study sought to bridge the gap between traditional social movement research and political science. Classical social movement research tends to revolve around two opposite schools of thought which, in short, focus on either resource mobilization, or \"the mechanisms by which movements recruit participation\" and a structural approach which focuses on how \"social problems become social movements\" (Peterson 1999). This study connects traditional social movement research with political or social science by focusing not only on how it was initiated, but how a movement affects institutions, how one movement can spawn other movements, and the implications for the populations that are affected by these changes. The success of a movement such as this can not be measured solely by the immediate and obvious realization of its goals by the members directly involved in the group. 5DWKHU\u000f\u0003WKH\u0003DUJXDEO\\\u0003PRUH\u0003VLJQL\u00bfFDQW\u0003LPSDFW\u0003RI\u0003VXFK\u0003D\u0003PRYHPHQW\u0003PD\\\u0003EH\u0003FDUULHG\u0003RXW\u0003LQGLUHFWO\\\u0003E\\\u0003WKH\u0003 people and groups it impacts nationally and internationally by bringing awareness to certain issues and VXEVHTXHQWO\\\u0003VSXUULQJ\u0003RQ\u0003VHSDUDWH\u0003VRFLDO\u0003DFWLYLVP\u0011\u0003\u0003WeiresAmerican University's Clocks and Clouds, Volume 1, Spring 2012 98Weires Appendix Women's Revolutionary Law: \u0014\u0011\u0003:RPHQ\u000f\u0003UHJDUGOHVV\u0003RI\u0003WKHLU\u0003UDFH\u000f\u0003FUHHG\u000f\u0003FRORU\u0003RU\u0003SROLWLFDO\u0003DI\u00bfOLDWLRQ\u000f\u0003KDYH\u0003WKH\u0003ULJKW\u0003WR\u0003SDUWLFLSDWH\u0003LQ\u0003WKH\u0003 revolutionary struggle in any way that their desire and capacity determine. 2.

ABOUT THE JOURNALAmerican University's Clocks and Clouds, Volume 1, Spring 2012 102 This issue of Clocks and Clouds has been a collaborative project among dozens of vital participants, and the journal owes a great debt to everyone involved. Among these collaborators, several deserve particular recogni - tion for their role in laying the ground for the journal. Professor Kimberly Cowell-Meyers and Professor Dylan Craig deserve singular recognition for their role in envisioning Clocks and Clouds and realizing its potential. Associate Dean Meg Weekes, Associate Dean Maria Cowles, and Professor Elizabeth Cohn have been particularly vital advocates in the administration and faculty. Kevin Ralph, Sean Gisonda, Jenny Sue Ross, and the SPA and SIS Undergraduate Councils have done remarkable work to build support among the student body. We also owe particular gratitude to members of the American University community who have provided valuable advice and support as the journal has launched. We have gained tremendous editorial insight from Taylor Robinson, who led the previous iteration of Clocks and Clouds, and from Kimberly Meyers at The Public Purpose. Sara Ghebremichael, James Helms, Jacqueline Corbett, Matt Bourdon, Sam Ross, and Clement Ho have provided equally crucial advice on managing and marketing the journal. Our logo was designed by JC Tecklenburg, who deserves credit for graciously donating his time and skills to the project. Finally, the nearly thirty students who submitted work to Clocks and Clouds deserve recognition. The articles we are able to publish represent only a small portion of the excellent research conducted by American Uni - versity undergraduates, and we believe the response to the inaugural issue of the journal strongly demonstrates the importance of its "}
