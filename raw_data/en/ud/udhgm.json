Prophylactic antibiotics have been shown toadd some protection against SSIs in clean and normally tissues are exposed and atrisk forcontamination .Upon completion ofthe operation when tissue planes areagain intact, there isnoadded benefit forthepatient toreceive Longer antibiotic courses don't offer protection but do add risk.antibiotics, butthere areadded risks .This has been shown in anincreasing number ofstudies across allsurgical specialties .1-7 Why don't longer courses of prophylactic antibiotics prevent bacterial infection?

When antibiotics are used for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis ,their target isa location, not anovergrowth ofaspecific bacteria .Antibiotics cannot sterilize the skin ormucosal surfaces ofthebody .Their added protection forSSIistransient at thetime ofsurgery bykilling some ofthemain pathogenic bacteria when normally sterile sites areexposed .When thesurgery iscomplete and the surfaces ofthe body are intact again, there isnofurther benefit toongoing antibiotics .Instead, ongoing selective pressure contributes tothe growth and colonization with resistant organisms .Furthermore, every added dose ofsystemic antibiotics further increases the patient's risk forC.difficile infection, and other antibiotic side effects . Instead ofprolonging prophylactic antibiotics after clean and clean -contaminated surgeries, providers should emphasize the myriad other efforts atSSIprevention they routinely perform, including strict hand -washing practices both intheORand inroutine patient care, and post -operative 6.Orlando G, et al. thearea ofthedrain clean, rather than apply theselective pressure ofsystemic antibiotics .How about drains?What role do prophylactic antibiotics play in SSI prevention?

Haste and S. AbelesAND Empiric broad -spectrum antibacterial therapy targeting gram -positive methicillin -resistant (MRSA), ,isconsidered -tazobactam onitsbroad - spectrum ofactivity, there isagrowing body ofliterature that suggests there may beanincreased of nephrotoxicity when vancomycin isused incombination with piperacillin -tazobactam .This review summarizes data from select retrospective, prospective and meta -analyses, also detailed inTable 1. These studies highlight the importance of judicious use of vancomycin and piperacillin - tazobactam therapy.A2014 retrospective study from Duke University found patients receiving combination therapy of vancomycin and piperacillin -tazobactam developed acute kidney injury (AKI) atarate nearly double that of patients receiving vancomycin monotherapy (16.3% (15of92)vs8.1%(8of99),p=0.041,respectively) .1 Several additional retrospective trials showed similar results when comparing piperacillin -tazobactam to cefepime ormeropenem when compared vancomycin plus cefepime .5One possible explanation forthis observed discrepancy isthat each ofthe studies that found higher rates ofAKIwith piperacillin -tazobactam defined AKI based ontheRisk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End Stage Kidney Disease (RIFLE)6criteria,3-5whereas thetrial that did notdetect adifference utilized theAcute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) definition byHammond etal. was conducted exclusively incritically dyes, and theuseofother to contribute tothe development ofAKI inthis patient population and may mask the nephrotoxic effect ofthis antibiotic combination .Itshould benoted that there areadditional studies incritically illpatients with recent cefepime ormeropenem (39.3%vs.24.2%vs.23.5%(p<0.0001 ),respectively) .10 Data from two prospective observational trials showed evidence for an increased risk ofAKI associated with combination therapy of vancomycin plus piperacillin - tazobactam .12,13Inboth trials, patients that received this combination ofantibiotics experienced significantly higher rates ofAKI than patients that received vancomycin with either cefepime ormeropenem .12,13Finally, three large systematic review meta -analyses from, ,142017 ,15and 201816include data from more than thirty -thousand patients showing more than a2.5-3-fold increase inAKI with combination vancomycin and piperacillin -tazobactam another beta - lactam (cefepime orcarbapenem ).

Over the past 10 years, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued numerous warnings on significant risks associated with fluoroquinolone use including tendonitis, tendon rupture,3 worsening symptoms of myasthenia gravis, and irreversible peripheral neuropathy.4More recently, additional warnings were added for central nervous system and psychiatric adverse effects, blood glucose disturbances5and risk for aortic aneurysm/ dissection.6,7 Given these toxicities, fluoroquinolones should be reserved for use only in the absence of other safe antibiotic options.8-10hypoglycemia, including diabetes, renal impairment, and advanced age,5and a large percentage were on sulfonylureas.5However, 20 of 67 events occurred in patients who were not diabetic.5Careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when fluoroquinolones are used, especially in elderly patients on anti-hyperglycemic medications. Central Nervous System Effects: Neurotoxicity, Neuropathy, and Mental Health Side Effects Fluoroquinolones are associated with an increased risk of disabling peripheral neuropathy.4,12 -14There were 539 reports of peripheral neuropathy in 46,257 cases submitted to FAERS between 1997 to 2012.12A large pharmaco - epidemiologic study of non -diabetic men aged 45 -80 identified a 30% increase in risk of peripheral neuropathies.13Symptoms can develop soon after drug exposure and last more than a year, despite medication discontinuation.4,15 Other studies have shown an association between fluoroquinolone use and Guillain - Barre syndrome.12A boxed warning lists the potential for life - threatening myasthenia gravis exacerbations and recommends avoiding fluoroquinolones in these patients.16The FDA currently recommends that patients on fluoroquinolones be monitored for side effects involving nerves, joints, muscles or tendons and if noted, advise to switch to a non - fluoroquinolone agent. As of 2018, fluoroquinolone labels include warnings for \"disturbances in attention, disorientation, agitation, nervousness, memory impairment\"Fluoroquinolones should be reserved for use only in the absence of other safe antibiotic options Hypoglycemia In July 2018, the FDA issued a warning on hypoglycemic coma associated with administration of fluoroquinolones in addition to the preexisting warning that it can cause blood sugar disturbances.5Between 1987 -2017, there were 56 reports of hypoglycemic comas identified by a FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database search.5 A large retrospective cohort study showed the odds ratio for severe hypoglycemia in diabetic patients receiving levofloxacin (n = 457,994) compared with azithromycin (n = 401,566) was 2.1 (95% CI 1.4 to 3.3).11. The majority of patients with hypoglycemic coma events identified in the FAERS search were noted to have risk factors forAortic Rupture In late 2018 the FDA issued a warning that fluoroquinolones increase risk of aortic rupture/dissection and aortic aneurysm.7Risk factors for aortic rupture or aneurysm include history of blockage or aneurysms, high blood pressure, smoking, atherosclerotic vascular disease, elderly age, and genetic disorders such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers - Danlos syndrome.6A FAERs database search from 2015 to 2018 identified 56 cases of aortic dissection during or after fluoroquinolone use, with all cases involving patients with at least one risk factor.6The risk of aortic rupture is thought to be due to collagen -associated adverse effects of fluoroquinolones and potentially damaging to aortic vasculature.18A systematic review and meta - analysis, mostly in elderly patients, found an increased risk of aortic aneurysm (OR 2.25, 95% CI 2.03 to 2.49) dissection (OR 2.79, 95% CI 2.31 to 3.37) in patients who had received fluoroquinolones.19 The FDA warning cited 4 studies20-23 which consistently demonstrated association between aortic aneurysm or dissection and fluoroquinolone use. Alternative treatments should be considered in patients with or with known risk factors for aortic aneurysm.7,24and \"serious disturbances in mental abilities called delirium,\"17noting risk for these effects after just one dose.
