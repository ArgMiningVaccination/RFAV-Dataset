During the early stages of the Coronavirus pandemic of 2020, those sections of the School made individual contributions to the crisis in the form of sixteen essays that offer insights, perspectives, and approaches to tackling the challenges of Coronavirus through spiritual-scientific knowledge and practice. The work of each of the School's sections seeks to develop Anthroposophy (founded by Rudolf Steiner) in a contemporary context through the core disciplines of general Anthroposophy, medicine, agriculture, education, natural science, mathematics, astronomy, literature, the visual arts and humanities, performing arts, and youth work.
