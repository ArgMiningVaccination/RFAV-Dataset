IT WAS INSPIRED BY THE GREAT MASTERS AND SEERS OF ANCIENT INDIA, AND IS ONE OF THE OLDEST SCIENCES OF LIFE \u2014 A SYSTEM OF DIET, HEALING AND HEALTH MAINTENANCE THAT IS ULTIMATELY SPIRITUAL IN ORIGIN. THE INSIGHTS OF AYURVEDA ARE AS RELEVANT TODAY AS THEY WERE WHEN THEY WERE FIRST WRITTEN DOWN THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO. . KITCHARI CLEANSE Kitchari for Cleansing Ayurveda considers the practice of cleansing, or regular purifying, a vital part of a healthy lifestyle. The junctures between the change of seasons in the Spring and Fall are particularly potent times for a cleanse, as our bodies undergo a physiological change to prepare for the new season. Clearing accumulated waste and toxicity from the tissues and the mind, encourages optimal health. These days, a periodic cleansing regimen is more vital to our health than ever before. Our bodies are being asked to process a literally endless barrage of harmful inputs such as environmental toxins, processed foods, unresolved emotions, psychological stress and excessive information, stimulated compromise our health. A periodic cleanse helps to clear these accumulations from the body. A Kitchari Cleanse is based on just eating a mono-diet of Kitchari, drinking plenty of supportive herbal teas, and, if necessary, taking Triphala in the evening, to support digestion, elimination, and the body's natural detoxification processes. A kitchari cleanse can also be a part of a full Ayurvedic cleanse, or Panchakarma, which involves eating Kitchari, oil massages, herbal steam therapy, herbal enemas and nasal clearing. Kitchari, which consists of basmati rice, mung beans, vegetables, oil and spices, was specifically created by Ayurvedic sages to be the most balancing, digestible, nourishing, complete meal possible. Ayurveda believes that one could live well entirely on Kitchari, and apparently many do. It is served in Ayurvedic hospitals, to basically all patients. Because Kitchari is so simple, balancing and easily digested, a Kitchari diet helps slow the flood of harmful inputs and provides the body, mind and soul with an important opportunity to rest, recuperate, and repair themselves. A Kitchari cleanse can be undertaken at any time of year, whenever you feel the need to re-balance. Ayurveda also believes that a Kitchari Cleanse or full Panchakarma is especially potent at the junctions between seasons\u2014when our bodies are ripe with a sense of transition already. Planning For Your Cleanse The more completely you can clear your schedule for your cleanse and allow time for rest, the better. If you are in the habit of taking coffee, caffeine, tobacco products, alcohol, or any recreational drugs on a regular basis, you may find it helpful to gradually reduce or eliminate their use in the days leading up to your cleanse. Similarly, reducing your intake of fast foods, processed foods, meat, refined sugars, and sweets ahead of the start date can be very helpful. Headaches in these first few days are also common, particularly acutely for those that use caffeine and processed sugar. The Cleansing Process During the cleanse, you will be eating a mono-diet of Kitchari. This diet is substantive enough that you can maintain your essential responsibilities while resetting the digestive system, supporting the elimination of toxins, and balancing vata, pitta, and kapha. Freshly prepared foods contain the prana, or life force, of the food and the cooking fire, so it is most effective to eat fresh Kitchari and teas each day. Once cooked food becomes cold, Ayurveda believes that it no longer has the original vitality of the plants or the energy of the fire used to cook it \u2014 it is this very vitality that we are trying to regain. Further, Ayurveda believes that when cooked food is re-heated it becomes \"tamasic.\" It is common to experience constipation during this cleanse, especially in the first five days, as Kitchari is somewhat low in fiber and also as we attempt to hold onto our waste and old emotions, rather than processing and letting them go. You must, however, be very diligent to avoid constipation and to not allow the flow and elimination of waste to be impeded. If you eat more food after you become constipated, you are only filling your body with more waste. You must not be constipated when starting a cleanse and you must maintain proper bowel movements. It is recommended to take triphala each evening of your Kitchari cleanse to help stay regular, to help with sugar cravings and overall balance. If your bowel movements slow in frequency or volume, or if your stools become more difficult to pass, even for a single day, you can take: psyllium husks or seeds or oat bran with warm water, or prune juice until you are regular again. Reestablishing one's balance, through a completely balanced, balancing diet, will look different for everyone. Balance for some, or most, will involve losing weight, and eventually perking up and becoming more clear. Vata balancing may involve maintaining weight and slowing down, which can be scary or seem depressing for some vata types. Kapha balancing may feel light headed or like not wanting to eat another bite of Kitchari. For those with excess pitta, the extra bile may start to come out in the first few days, causing nausea, heart burn and emotions of anger and blame. Occasionally, \"healing reactions\" can also occur in the first few days, where current conditions become worse or latent conditions re-appear. The balancing process may be seen most obviously through the arising of imbalanced emotions, particularly around days 3-5. During these emotional days, it may be best not to indulge your temptations to come up with reasons why eating a simple balanced diet of grains, legumes, vegetables and spices \u2014 a meal which has been eaten for thousands of years by billions of people \u2014 is \"bad for you\" or \"does not work for you.\" The Diet In general, eat as much as is desired at each meal\u2014enough to feel satisfied, but not to over eat. Unlike fasting cleanses, a Kitchari cleanse is not a diet. There is no calorie or quantity restriction and there is no restriction of any of the basic 'macro nutrients' (protein, fats, carbs.) On the other hand, if your body is telling you not to eat, you are encouraged to listen. Eat Kitchari for breakfast, lunch and dinner, allowing at least three to four hours between meals. Feel free to skip breakfast or other meals if you are not hungry. If you eat dairy, garnishing your Kitchari with melted ghee helps digestion, supports gut health, and lubricates your digestive system and all of your tissues. Otherwise, a little EV Olive oil can be good too. Drink at least 8 cups of room temperature, warm, or hot fluids each day to ensure adequate hydration and to help flush toxins from the system. Ideally, most of your fluids should be taken between meals. Recommended fluids include warm water, CCF Tea and dosha- balancing tea. If you get hungry between meals, feel free to eat more Kitchari. Try not to eat anything after 6 p.m. Supportive Daily Routine Rise early enough to give yourself a spacious and relaxed morning. Upon waking, scrape your tongue and brush your teeth. Sip 8-16 ounces of hot water to cleanse the system and to awaken the digestive capacity. Ideally: Do some gentle exercise. Slow, gentle movements and breathing exercises will support cleansing; more than that can be counterproductive. Take a bath or shower twice a day, using soap strategically (not all over the body). Oiling yourself before or after your shower with Ayurvedic medicated oils is especially helpful. Eat breakfast ideally between 7-8 a.m., eat lunch ideally between 11-1 p.m., eat dinner ideally between 4-6 p.m., but no later than 7 p.m. About a half hour before bed, take Triphala in warm water. Retire for the night by 9 p.m. Sleep is the body's best time to detox so be sure to get plenty of rest throughout the cleanse. A Supportive Lifestyle During Your Cleanse Keep your activities as quiet and mindful as possible. Minimize stress and exposure to frantic or disturbing environments. If intense emotions or dreams arise during or after your cleanse (often most intense around days 3-5), greet your emotions with compassion, observe them with detached awareness, and allow them simply to move through\u2014honoring yourself in the process. Rest as much as possible. You can ensure that the bulk of your energy is devoted to cleansing by minimizing the number of resources that your body allocates elsewhere. After Your Cleanse After you complete this simple cleanse, your body may continue to process toxicity for a few days. Your digestive system will have become accustomed to a very clean, balanced diet and you may even be somewhat sensitive to overly stimulating or processed foods. A slow transition back into your normal routine and a more diverse diet will help to preserve the benefits of your cleanse. For a couple of days afterwards, eat primarily simple, whole foods, gradually diversifying your menu. Stewed apples for breakfast are a great first food. Also, pay special attention to how you handle potentially aggravating foods like dairy, wheat, soy, and nightshades after your cleanse. Your body may have some new information to offer you about your relationship with specific foods. A Fresh Start As you wrap up the cleanse, take some time to reflect on your life so that you can move forward with whatever new intentions feel important to you. This is a potent time to cultivate a deeper level of inner awareness, to listen to your body, and to honor every aspect of your being as you transition out of the cleanse. You might also take some time to appreciate your body for all the ways it serves and supports you. Remember too, that you've offered yourself a valuable gift with this cleanse\u2014one that requires a certain level of discipline and commitment. Congratulations on your accomplishment. We hope that it serves you in a multitude of gratifying ways. Nourish Kitchari Cleanse Details Things you need: Thermoses: it is best to get insulated thermoses for all your food and your CCF tea. Many people use three 16oz thermoses for their breakfast, lunch and dinner, plus another thermos for their tea. Keeping your food hot all day makes a big difference in taste, digestibility, and prana. If you do not have a thermos, we will give you our to-go containers. Triphala: taking triphala every day for at least the first five days is recommended for balance and to avoid constipation. Ghee: if you eat dairy, ghee helps digestion, supports gut health, and lubricates your digestive system and all of your tissues. Massage Oil: Taking a shower before bed and putting on dosha-specific oil, before or after the shower, is a very helpful bed time routine. Herbal Tea: Dosha-specific or season-specific tea is great to drink during and after the cleanse. What you get: Each day Nourish will give you your day's worth of Kitchari and CCF tea. You are welcome to pick it up in the morning or any time of day, or eat it at the restaurant. If you need to get multiple days worth of food at one time, that is fine too. We do not generally recommend eating food that is more than two or three days old. Reheating: We recommend you try to keep your kitchari warm all day, in a thermos, crock pot, rice cooker or your oven. If you refrigerate it, steaming is usually the best way to reheat your food. If you do not have a steamer, stove top works well too. It can be nice to water-down kitchari a bit on a re-heat. Microwave is not really recommended for re-heating food. Storing: Kitchari can generally be left out if you will be eating it that day. It can be eaten room temperature, the same day. If you get food for multiple days, though, it should be put in the refrigerator right away. Special Notes: - We will be making your kitchari each day, whether you come and get it or not. We naturally cannot be responsible for missed days.
