In Western countries, DILI accounts for 1.2%-6.6% of the cases of acute liver disease seen at tertiary referral centers and is one of the leading causes of acute liver failure, accounting for 13% of all cases ( [2](#B2)). In Korea, the annual extrapolated incidence of DILI in hospitalized patients at a university hospital was calculated as 12/100,000 persons/year, and DILI is the most common cause of acute hepatitis ( [3](#B3)). DILI can be classified into hepatocellular, cholestatic, and mixed patterns based on the ratio However, most of these studies have been limited to assessing prescribed medications, such as antibiotics and anti-tuberculosis and the central nervous system (CNS) agents. The acceptance in Korea of oriental medicine and other traditional folk remedies as alternatives to modern medicine creates unique circumstances for studying DILI ( [7](#B7)). These remedies, commonly called herbal medicines in Korea, are regarded as safe by many people and are often used to treat various conditions in the absence of regulation or expert advice. The number of individuals exposed to herbal medications is greater in Korea than in Western countries, suggesting that the causative agents that lead to DILI and the types of liver injury with which it is associated may differ from those in Western countries and resemble those in other Asian countries, such as China and Japan. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical features and types of liver injury of affected patients who underwent liver biopsy according to DILI etiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS [8](#B8)). We identified 65 cases of DILI that met the following inclusion criteria: 1) modified Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) score7; 2) >18 yr of age; and 3) DILI confirmed by biopsy. Histopathologic evaluation was performed by a single, experienced pathologist. History taking, radiologic tests including abdominal ultrasonography, and computed tomography (CT), and laboratory tests were performed to exclude etiologies other than DILI. All 65 patients underwent liver biopsy, and their baseline characteristics, etiology, chief complaints, comorbidities, laboratory findings, and histopathologic findings were analyzed. All patients with liver biopsy manifested moderate to severe liver disease. There was no patient who transferred for liver transplantation. Clinical mild hepatitis such as transient elevation of aminotransferase was excluded to do liver biopsy. During the study period, the number of mild hepatitis was a few. Definitions of DILI [9](#B9)). Patient classification Statistical analysis RESULTS [Fig. 1](#F1)). Baseline characteristics [Table 1](#T1)shows baseline characteristics of enrolled patients. The incidence of DILI was higher in females (n=41) than in males (n=24), and the mean age of the patients was 48.2\u00b113.1 yr. The major causes of DILI were the use of herbal medications (43.2%), prescription medications (21.6%), and traditional therapeutic preparations and dietary supplements (35%). At the time of admission, patients presented with various symptoms, such as anorexia and abdominal discomfort (46.2%), jaundice and itching (40%), myalgia and fatigue (32.3%), fever and chills (16.9%), as well as headache and dizziness (6.2%). The mean modified RUCAM score of all enrolled patients was 8.01\u00b10.75 ( [Table 1](#T1)). The causative agents in each presented in [Table 2](#T2). Laboratory findings [Table 1](#T1)). The mean AST each causative agent as follows: 764.64\u00b1560.96 IU/L for IU/L for prescribed medications, and 702.18\u00b1546.59 IU/L for traditional therapeutic preparations and dietary supplements. The mean ALT level was 950.36\u00b1659.53 IU/L for those taking herbal medications, 263.00\u00b1176.36 IU/L for those taking prescription medications, and 1,271.46\u00b1931.84 IU/L for those taking traditional therapeutic preparations and dietary supplements ( [Table 3](#T3)). These results demonstrate that DILI from herbal medications and traditional therapeutic preparations and dietary supplements shows higher AST (P=0.009) and ALT (P=0.001) level than that from prescription medications ( [Fig. 2](#F2)). However, we found no significant differences AST/ALT for 7.7% (1/13) of the group receiving prescribed medications group, 64% (16/25) of the group receiving herbal medications, and 48% (13/27) of the group receiving traditional therapeutic preparations and dietary supplements (P=0.001). Patients with ALT >600 IU/L accounted for 7.7% (1/13) of those taking prescribed medications, 60% (15/25) of those taking herbal medications, and 56% (15/27) of those taking traditional therapeutic preparations and dietary supplements (P=0.005) ( [Table 3](#T3)). Types of liver main pathologic findings were cholestasis (66.2%), zone 3 necrosis and swelling (53.8%), increased eosinophilic infiltration (43.1%), and bridging necrosis (21.5%). A correlation between pathologic findings and etiology was not found in this study ( [Table 4](#T4)). Main pathologic findings of drug induced liver injury are demonstrated in [Fig. 2](#F2). However, higher incidence of hepatocellular type liver injury was observed in herbal medications and health foods or dietary supplements and folk remedies groups than in prescription medication group (P=0.005). All patients were recovered without complication after conservative treatment. DISCUSSION [10](#B10)). In our study, we analyzed the relationship between etiology and type of liver injury. Our results indicated that prescription medications accounted for 27.3% of DILI cases, herbs (including herbal medications) accounted for 40.1% of cases, and folk remedies and dietary supplements accounted for 22.3% of cases. The patterns of liver injury associated with each type of etiology differed somewhat from those found in a previous nationwide Korean study. Suk et al. ( [10](#B10)) reported the most common pattern of liver injury associated with herbs was hepatocellular and that the most common pattern associated with folk remedies and dietary supplements was cholestatic. However, in our study, the most common pattern of liver injury for herbs and folk remedies and dietary supplements was hepatocellular. The etiology of DILI in Western countries differs from that in Asian countries, especially Korea and China. The causative agents of DILI in Western countries are primarily prescription medications, such as antibiotics, analgesics, and CNS agents, and only 0%-9% of cases had etiologies other than prescription medications ( [11](#B11) [12](#B12)). The components of prescription medications are generally well known ( [13](#B13)), whereas the exact ingredients of the herbs and folk remedies used in oriental medicine are more difficult to identify. Thus, the widely-used method of DILI classification that relies on R-values would not be a useful standard in Asian compared with in Western countries, which we believe accounts for differences between our study and the recent nationwide DILI study in Korea ( [10](#B10)). A standard classification will require cooperation among the government, physicians, and doctors of oriental medicine in the service of identifying the specific ingredients of herbs and folk remedies. [14](#B14) [15](#B15)). The incidence of aminotransferase elevation may be greater with herbal medications and traditional therapeutic preparations and dietary supplements than with prescription medications because the R value is defined by ALT. However, data from our study indicate that both ALT and AST can be useful for predicting the pattern of livery injury. "}
