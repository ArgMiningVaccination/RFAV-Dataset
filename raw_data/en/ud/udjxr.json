GoodmanPreface to Latent GOLD 4.0 Since 1995, more significant books have been published on latent class (LC) and finite mixture models than any other class of st atistical models. The recent increase in interest in latent class models is due to the development of extended algorithms which allow today's computers to perform LC analyses on dat a containing more than just a few variables, and the recent realization that the use of such models can yield powerful improvement s over traditional approaches to segment ation, as well as to cluster , factor, regression and other kinds of analysis. The development of Latent GOLD was a collaborative transcontinent al effort that began in March 1998 in the Netherlands where we shared ideas for the first time. The initial version of the program, Latent GOLD 2.0 was released in May 2000. It provided a vehicle for developing modern LC models in a W indows-friendly environment. In February 2003 we released Latent GOLD 3.0 which contained several new features. We believe that Latent GOLD 4.0 t akes the program to a new level. Major interface improvement s such as the ability to p ause a model during estimation process to view preliminary output, should be especially useful when estimating models with many p arameters. In addition, the Advanced version of Latent GOLD 4.0 includes multilevel modeling, accounting for complex sampling designs and the estimation of other kinds of models such as IR T(Item Response Theory) based latent trait models, and random-ef fects regression models.

Cases within the same latent class are homogeneous on cert ain crite- ria, while cases in dif ferent latent classes are dissimilar from each other in certain import ant ways. Formally , latent classes are represented by K distinct categories of a nominal latent variable X. Since the latent variable is categorical, LC modeling dif fers from more traditional latent variable approaches such as factor analysis, structural equation mod - els, and random-ef fects regression models that are based on continu - ous latent variables. Latent class (LC) analysis was originally introduced by Lazarsfeld (1950) as a way of explaining respondent heterogeneity in survey response p atterns involving dichotomous items. During the 1970s, LC methodology was formalized and extended to nominal variables by Goodman (1974a, 1974b) who also developed the maximum likelihood algorithm that serves as the basis for the Latent GOLD program. Over the same period, the related field of finite mixture (FM) models for mul - tivariate normal distributions began to emerge, through the work of Day (1969), W olfe (1965, 1967, 1970) and others. FM models seek to sep - arate out or 'un-mix' dat a that is assumed to arise as a mixture from a finite number of distinctly dif ferent populations. 1CHAPTER1. OVERVIEWIn recent years, the fields of LC and FM modeling have come together and the terms LC model and FM model have become interchangeable with each other . ALC model now refers to any st atistical model in which some of the parameters dif fer across unobserved subgroup s (Vermunt and Magidson, 2003a). It is the dif ference in model parameters that distinguishes cases in one latent class from cases in another . In the most basic forms of LC/FM analysis, these are the p arameters defining the distributions of the response variables that depending on their scale types correspond to a) response probabilities, b) means, or c) means, variances, and covariances. In LC/FM regression analysis, the p arameters that dif fer across latent classes are the coef ficients in the regression model of interest. Today's fast computers and ef ficient algorithms make it possible to estimate LC models with many cases, many observed responses (indicators), and many explanatory variables. Extensions and variant s of the basic model have been developed to include: response variables of mixed scale types, such as nominal, ordinal, (censored/truncated) continuous, and (truncated) count s several ordered categorical latent variables called discrete factors ( DFactors) discrete and continuous covariates predicting class membership predictors of a repeatedly observed response variable provisions to relax the local independence assumption tools for dealing with sp arse tables (boot strap p values), boundary solutions (Bayes constants), local maxima (multiple st art sets), and other problems. The Advanced version of Latent GOLD 4.0 implement s the following additional extensions: the option to t ake into account a complex sampling design the option to specify LC models that cont ain one or more continuous latent variables called continuous factors (CFactors) multilevel extensions of the LC model, which involves inclusion of group-level latent classes (GClasses) and/or group-level continuous factors (GCFactors). The option to include continuous latent variables in a model extends Latent GOLD to a more general latent variable modeling program. It cannot only be used to estimate LC and FM models, but also factor analytic models, item response theory models, and random-ef fects regression models, including mixture and multilevel variants of these. 1.2 Kinds of Latent Class Models Latent GOLD cont ains separate modules for estimating three dif ferent LC Cluster models , DFactor models , and LC Regression models - which are useful in somewhat dif ferent application areas. To better distinguish the output across modules, latent classes are labeled 'clusters' for LC Cluster models, 'classes' for LC Regression models and DFactor or joint DFactor 'levels' in DFactor models. In this manual we also use the term 'segment s'. 2LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEThe LC Cluster Model: Includes latent variable, each category representing a cluster . Each cluster cont ains a homogeneous group of persons (cases) who share common interests, values, characteristics, and/or behavior (i.e., share common model p arameters). Advantages over more traditional ad-hoc types of cluster analysis methods include model selection criteria and probability-based classification. Posterior membership probabilities are estimated directly from the model parameters and used to assign cases to the modal class - the class for which the posterior probability is highest. The DFactor Model: Is a restricted form of the LC Cluster model which is of ten used for variable reduction or to define an ordinal attitudinal scale. Contains one or more DFactors which group together variables sharing a common source of variation. Each DFactor is either dichotomous (the default option) or consist s of 3 or more ordered lev - els (ordered latent classes). Containing L > 1 DFactors may be expressed in terms of cluster model p arameters in the Profile Output. For example, a 3-DFactor model cont aining K1, K2 and K3 levels respectively can optionally be expressed in terms of the joint DFactor consisting of K1 x K2, x K3 'clus - ters'. The LC Regression Model: Is used to predict a dependent variable as a function of predictor variables. Includes a K-category latent variable, each category representing a homogeneous subpopu - lation (segment) having identical regression coefficient s Each case may cont ain multiple records (regression with repeated measurement s). The appropriate model is estimated according to the dependent variable scale type Continuous - Linear regression (with normally distributed residuals) Dichotomous (specified as nominal, ordinal, or a binomial count) - Binary logistic regression Nominal (with more than 2 levels) - Multinomial logistic regression Ordinal (with more than 2 ordered levels) - Adjacent-category ordinal logistic regression Count: Log-linear logistic any of these three model types: Diagnostic st atistics are available to help determine the number of latent classes, clusters, or segment s For models cont aining K > 1 classes, covariates can be included in the model to improve classification of each case into the most likely segment s. Further det ails on each of these model structures including explicit equations defining these models are given in the Technical Guide. 1.3 Regression Models with Random Ef fects and Parameter Restrictions FM regression models provide an elegant approach for estimating models with discrete random ef fects. Acoef- ficient b in a 3-class LC regression model, for example, may be assumed to t ake on the value b1 with probabili - ty p1, b2 with probability p2 and b3 with probability p3. This describes a discrete distribution for the p arameter b, yielding what is also referred to as nonp arametric random-ef fects modeling: In contrast to continuous random- effects models that usually assume normality , no distributional assumption is made about the random ef fects (Vermunt and Magidson, 2003b). The Advanced version of Latent GOLD 4.0 cont ains the ability to include continuous random ef fects in a regression model, an option that can either be used in addition to or in instead of LC-based nonp arametric random ef fects. Aprimary goal of modeling is to achieve a p arsimonious represent ation for the model of interest. That is, one that contains the fewest number of p arameters needed to provide an adequate fit to the dat a. To help you accomplish this goal, Latent GOLD cont ains various ways to constrain the p arameters, including restricting cert ain regres - sion coef ficients to be class independent. That is, selected regression coef ficients may be restricted to be identical across all classes (e.g., in the example above, b1 = b2 = b3). Since these p arameters are fixed at the same value for all cases regardless of their class membership, such estimates are referred to as fixed ef fects. Thus, mixed models cont aining both random and fixed ef fects can also be estimated in Latent GOLD. In addition to the class independent restriction, several other types of restrictions may be applied including zero and other fixed-value restrictions, setting p arameters to be equal in selected segment s, and dif ferent ways of imposing order-restrictions. 4LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDE1.4 Interactive Use To help you obt ain a good p arsimonious model, Latent GOLD is designed to facilit ate interactive use. The appear - ance of various output listings and plot s may be customized in an interactive manner using dif ferent control p anel options. The available options are listed in the V iew Menu and change based on the current output being viewed. Extensive model management allows comp arison of estimated models, viewing of dif ferent sections of output associated with any model, and to estimate models on dif ferent input dat a files in the same session. Aconditional boot strap ('Boot strap -2LL Diff') has been added in Latent GOLD 4.0. Among many possible appli - cations, it may be used to help determine the number of classes (DFactors, DFactor levels) to include in a model by assessing whether a less restrictive form of a model (e.g., one cont aining more classes), provides a signifi - cant improvement over a less restrictive form of the model. To use this option, you simply select the conditional bootstrap for any estimated model, and then choose the restricted form of the model from an eligibility list containing a subset of other models that have been estimated. Acommon use of the program might be to estimate several models with dif ferent numbers of latent classes, examine various output listings, manipulate interactive graphs and then apply some p arameter restrictions and re-estimate the model. You might use various st atistical criteria, including the conditional boot strap to help choose your final model. 1.5 New Features in Latent GOLD 4.0 Latent GOLD 4.0 comes in either a basic or advanced version. Latent GOLD 4.0 Advanced consist s of Latent GOLD 4.0 Basic plus an Advanced Module. For det ails on obt aining the Advanced Module see our website. The primary interface improvement s and new modeling features in Latent GOLD 4.0 are described below . For further technical det ails on the modeling features, see the Technical Guide.L A T E N T G O L D 4 . 0 B A S I C These are the new features included in the basic version of Latent GOLD 4.0. In Cluster , DFactor and Regression models: General interface additions and improvement s: APauseand Resumefeature has been added allowing you to Pause during model estimation anytime prior to convergence, review model output and possibly change the output settings or cert ain 5CHAPTER1. OVERVIEWconvergence options. You may then Resume estimation of the model. (see Chapter 5, S tep 10) Upon viewing model output, you can change the number of decimal places or significant digit s that are displayed. (see Chapter 4) For uniformity across all modules, two new Output Tabs are included: 1)The new Model Tabreplaces the options previously cont ained in the Clusters Tab (LC Cluster Module), the Factors Tab (DFactor Module), and the Restrictions Tab (LC Regression Module). It cont ains various restriction options (new and old) and related specification options. 2)The new ClassPred T ab contains various new and old Output to a file options associated with prediction and classification that were previously included in the Output Tab and also cont ains the new Known Class Indicator . (See Chapters 2, 5) Known Class Indicator - This feature allows more control over the segment definitions by pre-assign - ing selected cases (not) to be in a p articular class or classes. (See Chapter 5, S tep 7: ClassPred Tab.) Model difference boot strapcan be used to formally assess the significance in improvement associated with adding additional classes, additional DFactors and/or an additional DFactor levels to the model, or to relax any other model restriction. (See chapter 5, S tep 10.) Truncated and Censored scale sub-types - for use with any model in which the dependent variable or indicator(s) are truncated or censored response variables. Dummy coding . Parameters associated with Nominal latent, predictor , and response variables can be changed from the default Ef fects coding to be based on Dummy coding, with either the first or last category as reference category . (See Chapter 5, S tep 9: Output Tab.) Additional Output includes: New Dissimilarity Index Classification t able (see Chapter 6: summary output) Covariate classification st atistics Cook's dist ances Further controls over the production of specific output listings: Covariate classification information and st andard classification information are now sep arate output options Specific output file sections such as Parameters output can be specified to not be produced Technical improvement s: Increased speed of estimating models because of more ef ficient dat a handling and slight 6LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEimprovement s in the algorithms. This is especially noticeable in LC regression applications with large data sets Much more ef ficient memory use, making it possible to deal with much larger dat a sets, more predictors and more latent classes, especially in LC regression applications. Improved st arting-values procedure using more disperse random st arting values and including an option to change the convergence criterion Option to obt ain robust st andard errors In LC Cluster models: Order-restricted latent classes - This feature restrict s the resulting clusters to be ordered in a way that is less restrictive than estimating a DFactor model with a single DFactor . (See Chapter 5, Model Tab) Class Independent V ariances andCovariances are now sep arate options on Model Tab in Cluster (and are removed from the Technical Tab) In LC Cluster and DFactor models: Binomial count. This additional indicator scale type has been added. Missing values. The method of dealing with missing values on indicators when direct ef fects are includ - ed in the model has been improved. Equal effect s.The Cluster and DFactor ef fects on the indicators can be restricted to be equal across indicator of the same scale type. This restriction is available for LC cluster models, and also for one or more selected DFactors in DFactor models. Subsections of Parameters Output includes: Loadings - these are (approximate) st andardized linear regression coef ficients for the Cluster-Indicator and DFactor-Indicator relationship s, Correlations (DFactor only) - these are (approximate) DFactor-DFactor and DFactor- Indicator correlations, Error Correlations - when one or more continuous indicator is included in the model error correlations in addition to error covariances are provided. 7CHAPTER1. OVERVIEWIn LC Regression (and Choice) models: Zero-inflated models - when specified, an additional class is automatically added for which the dependent variable t akes on the value 0 with probability 1 (for continuous and count s), or takes on a specific value with probability 1 (for ordinal and nominal). (See Chapter 5, S tep 3, Variables Tab) Offset restrictions - can be used to restrict a regression coef ficient for any numeric predictor equal to one (or to any value) when the dependent variable scale type is other than Nominal. (See Chapter 5, Model Tab) Improved \"Order Restrictions\" for nominal dependent variables - restrictions are imposed on adjacent category logit s now, yielding a \"truly\" ordinal regression model based on monotonicity constraint s Additional output section - Estimated V alues provides the class-specific and overall estimated values for each predictor p attern. (See Chapter 6) Prediction - Marginal mean in addition to posterior mean and HB-like predictionL A T E N T G O L D 4 . 0 A D V A N C E D The following new features are included in the optional Advanced Module (requires the Advanced version) of Latent GOLD 4.0: Continuous latent variables (CFactors) - an option for specifying models cont aining continuous latent variables, called CFactors, in a cluster , DFactor or regression model. CFactors can be used to specify continuous latent variable models, such as factor analysis and item response theory models, and regression models with continuous random ef fects. If included, additional information pert aining to the CFactor ef fects appear in the Parameters output and to CFactor scores in the S tandard Classification, the ProbMeans, and the Classification S tatistics output. Multilevel modeling - an option for defining two-level dat a variants of any model implemented in Latent GOLD. Group-level variation may be accounted for by specifying group-level latent classes (GClasses) and/or group-level CFactors (GCFactors). In addition, when 2 or more GClasses are specified, group- level covariates (GCovariates) can be included in the model to describe/predict them. The multilevel option can also be used for specifying three-level p arametric or nonp arametric random-ef fects regres- sion models. Survey options for dealing with complex sampling dat a. Two import ant survey sampling designs are stratified sampling -- sampling cases within strat a, and two-st age cluster sampling -- sampling within primary sampling unit s (PSUs) and subsequent sampling of cases within the selected PSUs. Moreover , 8LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEsampling weight s may exist. The Survey option t akes the sampling design and the sampling weight s into account when computing st andard errors and related st atistics associated with the p arameter estimates, and estimates the 'design ef fect' (see Chapter 6, Model Summary Output). The parameter estimates are the same as when using the weight variable as a Case W eight when this method is used. An alternative two-step approach ('unweighted') proposed in V ermunt and Magidson (2001) is also available for situations where the weight s may be somewhat unst able. Advanced features described in the manual are highlighted throughout the text using this symbol. 1.6 Optional Add-ons to Latent GOLD 4.0 The following optional add-on programs are available to link to Latent GOLD 4.0 in various ways:L A T E N T G O L D C H O I C E The Choice Module extends Latent GOLD 4.0 to estimate LC conditional logit models, useful in various discrete choice studies (with st ated preference or revealed preference dat a). Dependent variable scale types include: CHOICE for modeling first choice dat a. Replication weight s may be used to allow estimation of weighted choice/ allocation type models. RANKING for modeling full ranking, p artial ranking, and best-worst dat a RATINGfor modeling ratings, such as those collected in rating-based conjoint studies. An import ant application of Latent GOLD Choice is in LC conjoint analysis. It includes the cap ability to output simulated choices from an unlimited number of constructed scenarios of interest but for which no choice dat a has been collected (inactive set s), as well as the more usual kinds of output, and it extends the LC Regression Module output when used with rating-based conjoint dat a. The Choice Module may also be used to define LC variant s of log-linear models for frequency t ables, such as models for network dat a and models for capture-recapture dat a. The full LG Choice 4.0 manual is available at http://www .statisticalinnovations.com/product s/choicemanual.pdf . Latent GOLD Choice requires an annual license fee. 9CHAPTER1. OVERVIEWS I \u0002 C H A I D \u00ae 4 . 0 With this option, a CHAID (CHi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector) analysis may be performed following the estimation of any LC model in Latent GOLD 4.0, to profile the resulting LC segment s based on demographics and/or other exogenous variables (Covariates). By selecting 'CHAID' as one of the output options, a CHAID input file is constructed upon completion of the model estimation, which can then be used as input to SI-CHAID 4.0. This option provides an alternative treatment to the use of active and/or inactive covariates in Latent GOLD 4.0. In addition to st andard Latent GOLD output to examine the relationship between the covariates and classes/DFactors, SI-CHAID provides a tree-structured profile of selected classes/DFactors based on the selected Covariates. In addition, chi-square measures of st atistical significance are provided for all covariates (Latent GOLD does not provide such for inactive covariates). Either the st andard (nominal) algorithm or the ordi - nal CHAID algorithm may be used to profile the classes, the latter useful with order-restricted classes or the lev - els of a DFactor to t ake into account the ordered nature of the classes (DFactor levels). Whenever covariates are available to describe latent classes obt ained from Latent GOLD 4.0, SI-CHAID 4.0 can be an especially valuable add-on tool under any of the following conditions: when many covariates are available and you wish to know which ones are most import ant when you do not wish to specify cert ain covariates as active because you do not wish them to af fect the model p arameters, but you still desire to assess their st atistical significance with respect to the classes (or a specified subset of the classes) when you wish to develop a sep arate profile for each latent class when you wish to explore dif ferences between 2 or more selected latent classes using a tree modeling structure when the relationship between the covariates and classes is nonlinear or includes interaction effects, or when you wish to profile order-restricted latent classes or DFactors For an example of the use of CHAID, see Tutorial #4 in Chapter 7.D B M S / C O P Y I N T E R F A C E Latent GOLD 4.0 reads SPSS and ASCII text files for dat a input. The DBMS/Copy interface allows Latent GOLD 4.0 to directly open over 80 additional file format s, including Excel, SAS and HTML files.

GENERAL PROGRAM STRUCTURE Windows Latent GOLD cont ains a main window called the V iewer. Viewer.When you estimate a model, all st atistical result s, tables and plots are displayed in the V iewer. In this window , you can navigate easily to whichever section of the output you want to view . You can also copy and p aste selected portions of the output into dif ferent pro - grams for reformatting and editing. The Viewer window opens automat - ically when you open the program. Figure 2-1. V iewer Window Outline Pane Contents Pane 13CHAPTER2. GENERALPROGRAMSTRUCTUREThe Viewer window cont ains 2 panes: The left pane, or Outline p ane, provides a hierarchical view of the content s, consisting of the names of dat a files opened (the outermost level of the hierarchy), the models estimated, and output files generated for each model. To expand/contract any level of the hierarchy , click the +/- icons. After a model has been estimated, the Outline pane will also cont ain a summary measure of performance (the L2or LLstatistic) for the model to the right of the model name. The right p ane, or Contents pane, contains text output, t ables, or plot s corresponding to that which is highlighted in the lef t pane. Many of the t ables and plot s may be modified interactively using the options shown on a Control Panel or the V iew Menu. You can use the scroll bars or the up/down arrow keys to browse result s, or you can click an item in the Outline pane to view the corresponding output in the Content s pane. To change the wid th of the Outline p ane, click and drag the right border or select S plit from the W indow menu. The Outline p ane of Latent GOLD cont ains 4 hierarchical levels: 1.The first (outermost) level list s the data files that have been opened. 2.The second level list s model names for 1) models that have been estimated for the associated dat a file, and 2) models that have not yet been estimated. 3.The third level list s output files produced for each model estimated. 4.The fourth level list s plots and other output subcategories associated with that output file. Figure 2-2. Outline Pane levels 14LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEFor example, in Figure 2-2, the dat a file opened is ex1.sav (1st level), for which 4 models were estimated - named Model1, Model2, Model3, and Model4 (2nd level). Model5 is the name assigned to a New Model that has yet to be specified. Names associated with the 3 output files associated with Model3 appear in the Outline Pane - Parameters, Profile, ProbMeans (3rd level). The Tri-Plot, associated with the ProbMeans output, is currently highlighted (4th level). When an entry in the Outline p ane is highlighted, it s content is displayed in the Content s pane (text file or plot). After one or more models are estimated for a dat a file, you may specify a new model by opening the analysis dia - log box associated with 1) the new model default name (created automatically at the bottom of the list of model names), or 2) any model that has been estimated previously . For previously estimated models, you can specify a new model by modifying the settings for this model. For new models, the default settings correspond to the last model estimated.

Status of a current model estimation including number of iterations and warning messages. Basic descriptive information regarding variable labels and values associated with various object s selected on an active plot. Object s that can be selected include plot symbols, and reference lines. Simply lef t click an object to select it. To Show or Hide the Status Bar From the menus choose: View Status Bar Dialog Boxes Most menu selections open dialog boxes which you will use to select variables and set analysis options. To manually move within a dialog box from one item to another , use the t ab key. Alternatively , a shortcut can be used to reach dialog box items which cont ain an underlined letter as p art of their descriptive name. Such items can be reached by typing the letter in conjunction with the Alt key. For example, in the Technical Tab portion of the Analysis Dialog Box, the shortcut to reach the Iteration box is Alt+I (on your keyboard, hold down the Alt key and then press the 'I' key).A N A L Y S I S D I A L O G B O X After you have selected from one of the three types of models, an Analysis dialog box appears that is appropri - ate for that model type. This dialog box has six basic t abs (plus an optional Advanced Tab) for Cluster and DFactor models and five basic t abs (plus an optional Advanced Tab) for Regression models. Some t abs are common to all model types: Variables T ab For each of the 3 modules, the first basic t ab, called the V ariables Tab, has a common structure. The Source variable list provides a listing of all variables in the working dat a file. By default the variables are listed in the order they appear in the dat a file. To list them in alphabetical order , check the Lexical Order box. Target variable list(s) specify how the variables are to be treated in the analysis. For example, a vari - able can be specified to be used as an indicator , dependent, predictor , case weight, replication weight or covariate, by selecting and moving it to the appropriate t arget list box. The target list boxes that are available depend upon the type of model selected. For more specific information about the options related to a type of model, see Chapter 5./b2right /triangleopenrtModel Tab The second basic t ab is the Model Tab. It cont ains options that af fect the number of model p arameters that will be estimated. For an LC Cluster or LC Regression model, this t ab may be used to change the settings for the number of classes and to impose various model restrictions such as restricting cert ain effects to equal 0. For an DFactor model, this t ab may be used to change the settings for the number of DFactors and DFactor levels, restrict to zero the ef fects of certain indicators on selected DFactors and to remove zero restrictions on correlations between selected DFactors. ClassPred T ab The third basic t ab is the ClassPred Tab. It allows you to specify a Known Class Indicator , or to use the results from an estimated model to score a dat a input file by appending selected prediction and/or classification information to it. Residuals T ab (Cluster and DFactor only) The fourth basic t ab is the Residuals Tab. This tab displays bivariate residuals (BVRs) and allows you to specify new models cont aining one or more \"direct ef fect\" parameters, each associated with a large BVR. Abivariate residual subst antially larger than 1 indicates that the estimated model fails to account for all of the p airwise association associated with 2 indicators, or an indicator and an (active) covariate. See section 7.6 in the Technical Guide for further information about BVRs. Output Tab The next basic t ab is the Output Tab. This allows you to generate selected output file listings following the estimation of a model. For example, selection of the optional 'S tandard Classification' generates a file listing cont aining the modal assignment and posterior membership probabilities for each case (or each grouped case if 2 or more cases have the same values on all observed variables). The Output Tab also cont ains options for specifying the methods to be used in the computation of st andard errors (Hessian, outer-product, or robust), in the prediction of the dependent variable (posterior mean, HB-like, or marginal mean), and in the coding of nominal variables. Technical T ab The last basic t ab is the Technical Tab. It allows you to change the settings for various technical options before a model is estimated. These options include algorithmic settings such as convergence limit s, iteration limit s, start values, model settings such as Bayes const ants, and the use of dummy coding as opposed to ef fects coding of p arameters, boot strap settings, treatment of missing values, and a control for the precision of CFactors, an optional Advanced feature. Advanced T ab(Optional) This tab contains several advanced features. It requires the Advanced version of Latent GOLD 4.0. The Advanced Tab provides model options for handling complex survey dat a, multi-level dat a, and inclusions of up to 3 continuous factors (CFactors) in a model. 21CHAPTER2. GENERALPROGRAMSTRUCTURED I A L O G B O X P U S H B U T T O N S These buttons instruct the program to perform an action, such as run a procedure, display Help, or open a sub - dialog box to display additional options. Most dialog boxes cont ain several st andard command pushbuttons: Close. Close the current dialog box. Cancel.Cancels any changes made to the dialog box settings since the last time it was opened, and closes the dialog box. W ithin a session, dialog box settings persist until you cancel or change them. Estimate. Estimates the p arameters of the current model. After you select your variables and set any analysis options, click Estimate to st art the iterative estimation algorithm. This also closes the Analysis dialog box. Pause.Pauses the model estimation procedure and produces output file listings that should be viewed as preliminary output. Resume. Resumes the model estimation procedure for a p aused model. Help.Context sensitive help. This takes you to a st andard Help window that cont ains information about the current dialog box. You can also get help on individual dialog box controls by clicking the control with the right mouse button. OK. Runs the procedure. After you select your variables and set any additional specifications, click OK to run the procedure. This also closes the dialog box. In addition, the V ariables, ClassPred Output, and Advanced Tabs of the Analysis Dialog Box cont ains these additional command pushbuttons: Scan.This option scans the dat a file and identifies each distinct category or value for variables speci - fied as Indicators, Covariates, Dependent or Predictors. If this option is not selected before estimating a model, Latent GOLD will automatically scan the dat a file before estimating a model. Reset.Deselects any variables in the t arget variable list(s). Note that this has no ef fect on specifica - tions, such as Scale Type and number of classes.SU B D I A L O G B O X E S Most procedures provide a great deal of flexibility . For simplicity in specifying models, the main dialog box usually cont ains only the basic options used for typical models. Other specifications are made in subdialog boxes. Right-clicking on a variable also brings up additional menus which allow you to change variable properties. SE L E C T I N G V A R I A B L E S To select a single variable, highlight it on the source variable list and click the right arrow button next to the target variable list. For Cluster or DFactor models, you can also send individual variables to the Indicators box by dou - ble clicking them. For LC Regression models, the first variable you double-click will be sent to the Dependent box if that box is empty . Subsequent double clicks will send variables to the Predictors box. You can select multiple variables simult aneously: 22LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDE To highlight multiple variables that are adjacent to each other on the variable list, click the first one and then Shif t-click the last one in the group.

S P S S F I L E S For information on creating an SPSS system file, see your SPSS manuals (programs such as DBMS Copy may be used to convert SAS and other dat a formats to the SPSS format). Latent GOLD recognizes SPSS variable names and category (value) labels (less than 40 charac - ters), but ignores SPSS variable labels and date variables. Avariable used in SPSS to weight cases is automatically placed in the Frequency box. If an SPSS system file cont ains multiple user missing designations for a numeric variable, Latent GOLD will combine them into one aggregate 'missing' category . Latent GOLD does not recognize user missing specifications for non-numeric variables. String variables with lower and upper case letters, such as 'f' and 'F', are distinguished as sep arate categories.T E X T F I L E S Atext (rectangular) file can be created in any spreadsheet or word processor using the 'Save as..\" command to save the dat a as a text file with either a .dat, .csv or .txt extension. The first line of the file needs to cont ain the variable names sep arated by blank sp aces or a t ab. The remainder of the file cont ains the dat a. For each record, the dat a for each variable should be sep arated by either a sp ace or a tab (no other delimiters, such as \",\" are allowed). 29CHAPTER3. DATAFILESANDFORMATSThe data for any variable may be numeric (quantit ative values only) or may be a string variable, containing some or all alphabetic characters (such as 'Female', 'Male'). For numeric dat a, do not use commas (such as 3,634). S tring variables cont aining lower and upper case letters, such as 'f' and 'F', are distinguished as sep arate categories. Missing dat a for a variable may be specified using '.'. Each data record should cont ain exactly the same number of dat a element s, one for each variable name. Below is a p artial listing of a text formatted dat a file. This file cont ains one record per case. Note that records 6 and 7 are identical (0 30 0 F). For data sets consisting of many observations that cont ain identical values on all variables, the inclusion of an optional integer value frequency count variable will reduce the number of physical records in the file. Below is a partial listing of another text formatted dat a file. For each dat a record, FREQ cont ains the count of observations having the specified values on each of the variables.

You need not follow all 10 step s in order to perform an analysis. For example, if you choose to maint ain the default Technical and Output option settings, then you would skip S teps 8 and 9. These step s are illustrated in Tutorial #1 (Chapter 7) for simple LC Cluster models. 43CHAPTER5. BASICSTEPSFORMODELDEVELOPMENTStep 1: Load Your Data into Latent GOLD From the menus choose: File Open Or select the Open icon from the toolbar. In the Open dialog box, select the type and name of the file you want to open. Figure 5-1. File Open Dialog Box Click Open. For more detailed information on File Open options and on the types of files Latent GOLD can read, see Chapter 3: Data Files and Formats. Step 2: Select the Type of Model If you open a dat a file, the Outline p ane will cont ain the dat a file name plus the default model name ('Model1'). If you open a model definition (lgf) file, the settings for all models previously saved in this definition file will be loaded into the program and the Outline p ane will cont ain a list of model names for each of these models. Assuming that you have opened a dat a file and no models have yet been estimated for the correct dat a file, the next step is to use the Model Menu to choose from one of the three analysis modules:/triangleopenrt /triangleopenrt/b2right /triangleopenrt 44LATENT analysis Regression LC segment ation/regression analysis Choice LC choice analysis (requires Latent GOLD Choice licens e) A quick way to open the Model Menu is to right click on a model name. If no models have yet been estimated for the current dat a file, the default name for the new model to be estimated (Model1) will be the only model name that appears in the Outline Pane. Right click on the model name and the Model Menu appears: Figure 5-2. Model Menu The Model Menu options are organized into 4 sections. Those used in step 2 are listed in the top section. The other options are discussed in step 10. The options for Model T ype: Model Cluster/DFactor/Regression Choose from one of these to select the type of model to be estimated./triangleopenrt /triangleopenrt 45CHAPTER5. BASICSTEPSFORMODELDEVELOPMENTOnce you select a model type, the V ariables Tab of the appropriate Analysis Dialog Box opens. For example, Figure 5-3 shows the V ariables Tab associated with the Cluster model type. As an alternative to beginning your model setup from scratch, you may begin by altering the settings of a previously defined model. If one or more models have already been estimated for a dat a file, or if you opened a previously saved .lgf files you can right click on it s name to display the Model Menu, which will cont ain a check - mark next to the type of model currently associated with that name. You may select that model type again or select one of the other model types. To maintain the model type, instead of a right click, you may simply double click on the name of the model and the V ariables Tab corresponding to the associated model type opens with the current settings for that model. If you right click on the name of a new model created automatically at the bottom of the list of model names, the checkmark appears next to the last model type estimated on the associated dat a file. Figure 5-3: V ariables T ab for an LC Cluster Model The next several step s show how to specify the desired model using the various t abs of the Analysis Dialog Box. Specifically , use of the setup options in the V ariables Tab are described in S teps 3, 4, 5 and 6, the Models, Residuals, and (optional) Advanced Tab in Step 7, the Technical Tab in Step 8 and the Output Tab in Step 9. The appearance of the various t abs differs by Model Type. However , regardless of the type of model, the Title bar (above the main menu in any open Analysis dialog box) list s the model type, dat a file name and model name as identifying information. In addition, the following buttons appear below any Analysis Dialog Box. 46LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEClose. Closes the analysis dialog box but ret ains any changes you have made since opening the dia - log box. Cancel.Closes the analysis dialog box without ret aining any changes you have made since opening the dialog box. Estimate. Initiates estimation of the model based on the current model option settings Help.Provides help associated with the options for the p articular model type. Step 3: Select V ariables for the Analysis (V ariables Tab) The appearance of the V ariables Tab differs depending on the type of model you have selected. The primary differences are: For LC Cluster and DFactor models, one or more variables must be selected from the vari - ables list box to be used as Indicators, also known as Dependent V ariables. For LC Regression models, one and only one Dependent V ariable is used and one or more variables may be selected as Predictors. The Regression Module differs from the Cluster and DFactor Modules in that it can accom - modate multiple records (repeated measures) for one or more cases. Thus, the use of a case ID and a Replication W eight is permissible in Regression. RESET button For any model type, at any time during the model setup process, the Reset button can be used to restore the default settings (maint aining only the specified number of classes). Upon selecting Reset, all selected variables (including the Case W eight variable) are returned to their original position in the variables list box. The Reset Button is located in the lower lef t portion of the V ariables Tab. In addition, for any model type, the V ariables Tab can be used to specify a variable as a Case W eight, and one or more variables as Covariates. The specification of variables as a Case W eight or Covariate(s) is optional. S P E C I F Y I N G A C A S E W E I G H T ( O P T I O N A L ) You may assign one variable to be used as a case weight (usually a frequency variable) in either a Cluster , DFactor or Regression model. See Tutorial #1 in Chapter 7 for an example that describes the use of a case weight. For an SPSS .sav file in which a variable is designated as a weight variable (according to the SPSS dat a dictionary), this variable appears in the Case W eight box automatically upon opening the .sav file. 47CHAPTER5. BASICSTEPSFORMODELDEVELOPMENTTo specify a case weight: In the Variables Box, highlight the variable you want as your case weight. Click \"Case Weight\" to move this variable to the Case Weight Box.C O V A R I A T E S ( O P T I O N A L ) Covariates are variables that may be used to describe or predict (rather than to define or measure) the latent classes and if Active, to reduce classification error . For example, they are of ten used to profile the latent classes in terms of demographic or other exogenous variables. Covariates may be treated as Nominal or Numeric and may be Active or Inactive (see S tep 5: Set Scale Types). Select any variables you want to use as covariates. For a formal distinction between covariates (zcov), predictors (zpred), indicators and dependent variables (y), see section 2.1 of the Technical Guide. Group level covariates (GCovariates) If 2 or more group latent classes (GClasses) have been included in the model, any Active covariates can be specified as group level covariates (GCovariates) for describing these GClasses. For det ails, see the Advanced Modeling Options in S tep 7. I N D I C A T O R S ( C L U S T E R A N D D F A C T O R M O D E L S ) Indicators are dependent variables that are used to define or measure the latent classes in a LC Cluster model, or latent variable(s) in a DFactor model. Indicators may be treated as Nominal, Ordinal, Continuous, Poisson Count, or Binomial Count (see S tep 5: Set Scale Types). Select one or more variables from the variables list box to be used as Indicators (required). Figure 5-4: V ariables T ab for 5-5: V ariables T ab for LC Regression Model D E P E N D E N T ( R E G R E S S I O N M O D E L S ) Assign one variable to be used as the dependent variable. Dependent variables may be specified as Nominal, Ordinal, Continuous, Count or Binomial Count (see S tep 5: Set Scale Types). The Continuous scale type caus - es the normal distribution to be used resulting in a linear LC Regression model. The appropriate model is estimated according to the dependent variable scale type: Continuous. Linear regression (with normally distributed residuals) Dichotomous (specified as nominal, ordinal, or a binomial count). Binary logistic regression Nominal (with more than 2 levels). Multinomial logistic regression Ordinal(with more than 2 ordered levels). Adjacent-category ordinal logistic regression Count.Log-linear Poisson regression Binomial Count. Binomial logistic regression model The subtype censored continuous yields a tobit regression model. The subtypes truncated continuous, truncated count, and truncated binomial of the linear , and binomial logistic regression model, respectively . 49CHAPTER5. BASICSTEPSFORMODELDEVELOPMENTP R E D I C T O R S ( R E G R E S S I O N M O D E L S , O P T I O N A L ) Select any variable(s) to be used as predictors of the dependent variable. Predictors may be treated as Nominal or Numeric (see S tep 5: Set Scale Types) and as Class Independent or Class Dependent. If no predictors are selected, the model will cont ain an intercept only . E X P O S U R E ( R E G R E S S I O N M O D E L S F O R C O U N T S , O P T I O N A L ) The Exposure button is active only if the scale type for the dependent variable has been specified to be Count or Binomial Count. (For other scale types, no exposure variable is used.) For dependent variables specified as Count or Binomial Count, the exposure is specified by designating a vari - able as the exposure variable or , if no such variable is designated, by entering a value in the exposure const ant box which appears to the right of the Exposure variable box. The use of an exposure variable allows the expo - sure to vary over cases. By default, the value in the Exposure const ant box is 1, a value of ten used to represent the Poisson exposure. To change the exposure const ant, highlight the value in the exposure const ant box and type in the desired value. If an exposure variable is selected, this option is not available. When the scale type is specified as Binomial Count, the value of the dependent variable represent s the number of 'successes' in N trials. In this case, the exposure represent s the number of trials (the values for N), and hence should never t ake on a value lower than the value of the dependent variable and hence typically should be high - er than the default const ant of 1. Before the actual model estimation, Latent GOLD checks each case and will provide a warning message if this condition is not met for one or more cases. An exposure variable should be designated if the number of trials is not the same for all cases. Regression Models with Repeated Measurement s For LC Regression models where more than one record is included for at least one case, a Case ID variable must be specified and a Replication W eight may be used. C A S E I D V A R I A B L E ( R E G R E S S I O N M O D E L S , O P T I O N A L ) If the data file cont ains only 1 record per case, no Case ID variable is required. For dat a files in which one or more cases have multiple records (e.g. repeated measures), a variable must be assigned as a Case ID variable to uniquely identify each case. For a regression example with repeated measures is given in Tutorial #3 (see Chapter 7). To assign a variable as a Case ID, select that variable from the V ariable List Box and click the Case ID button. The variable is moved to the Case ID box.. For data files cont aining multiple records per case: Acase weight (if used) should t ake on the same value for each record associated with the same Case ID. Any covariates should t ake on the same value for each record associated with the same Case ID. If these conditions are not met, a warning message is produced during the file Scan (S tep 4). 50LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDER E P L I C A T I O N W E I G H T ( R E P E A T E D M E A S U R E S R E G R E S S I O N M O D E L S , O P T I O N A L ) Once a variable is selected as a Case ID, the Replication W eight button becomes active. To assign a variable as a Replication W eight, select that variable from the V ariable List Box and click the Replication W eight button. The variable is moved to the Replication W eight box. Acommon application of replication weight s is in the estimation of certain kinds of allocation models, where respondent s assign a fixed number of point s to each of J alternatives. For each case, the assigned point s are used as replication weight s to weight each of J responses. Aweighted multinomial logit model is estimated. See Section 5.1 of Technical Guide for further det ails about replication weights. Step 4: Scan the Dat a File (Variables Tab) The next step is to ensure the integrity of the dat a by checking the number of cases, number of records, the observed distribution of each variable, any category labels that may be included on the file, and that cert ain con- sistency checks are satisfied. This is accomplished with the File Scan, which also issues warning messages if certain inconsistencies are found. Once the desired variables are selected, click Scan. This option scans the dat a file and identifies each distinct category or value for all variables included in a model. Prior to a dat a file being scanned, only variable names will be listed in the t arget list box. After scanning, a mes - sage appears in the st atus bar indicating the number of records in the file, and the number of distinct categories (or values) appears to the right of the variable names in the t arget list boxes. If a Scan has not been selected before clicking Estimate, a scan will automatically be performed by Latent GOLD prior to beginning the estima - tion algorithm, and default settings will be used to scale the variables in the model. Following a Scan, a \"Replication Error\" warning message appears if a covariate or case weight is not const ant for all records corresponding to the same Case ID. The option to \"Estimate anyway?\" is given at the end of the error message. If Yes is selected, Latent GOLD uses the value on the first record as the desired const ant.V I E W I N G C A T E G O R Y L A B E L S , F R E Q U E N C Y C O U N T S A N D S C O R E S F O R A V A R I A B L E After scanning, double click on a variable name in any of the t arget list boxes to open the V ariables dialog box where category labels, frequency count s and any scores assigned to the variable are displayed. Any scores assigned to Nominal variables are used for descriptive purposes only . Scores associated with ordinal indicators may be changed. For further information about score options for Ordinal variables, see How to S pecify Category Scores for an Ordinal V ariable./triangleopenrt 51CHAPTER5. BASICSTEPSFORMODELDEVELOPMENTFigure 5-6. Category labels for the variable STIFFM I S S I N G V A L U E S Latent GOLD recognizes observations as missing on a p articular variable if they were assigned a missing value code. In SPSS (for .sav formatted files) missing values may be specified as system missing or user missing. In text formatted files a missing value code is represented by '.' During the Scan process, all records pert aining to such cases will be deleted. That is, by default, missing values are eliminated using list-wise deletion. After the scan, a message in the st atus bar indicates the number of records deleted because of missing values. By default, cases cont aining missing values on any indicator , dependent variable, predictor or active covariate are excluded from the analysis. The treatment of missing values may be changed to allow cases cont aining miss - ing values to be included in the analysis for the various options. To include such missing values in an analysis, see Missing V alues in S tep 8.R E D U C I N G T H E N U M B E R O F C A T E G O R I E S F O R A V A R I A B L E After verifying the integrity of your dat a, you may wish to reduce the size of the dat a file to speed up estimation, especially if you are estimating a model with many p arameters. The Group option can be used to reduce the number of values t aken on by a variable by combining adjacent categories (in most cases, you would not want to group a Nominal variable in this manner). The score assigned to a group of adjacent categories is the average of the original (default) scores assigned to the original categories. The grouping algorithm group s adja- cent categories that have fewer observations before grouping categories having larger number of observations towards the goal of having approximately equal sized group s. The grouping used in Latent GOLD is identical to the RANK command used in SPSS with the number of group s equal to the NTILES subcommand. 52LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEHow To Group V ariable Categories Following a file Scan, double click on a variable name to open the Variables dialog box. Type the number of desired groups into the Groups list box. Click Group. The variables dialog box changes to show the new group s. The actual number of group s will be less than or equal to the number specified. After grouping, the label field cont ains the range for the original categories that have been grouped together , and the scores field cont ains the average of the scores originally assigned to cases in that group. S pecifying 0 or a number equal to the number of original categories restores the variable to it s origi- nal number of categories. Figure 5-7. Grouping the variable AGE The 36-category AGE variable has been merged into 6 group s. New group #1 consist s of the original AGE cat- egories 1-8 (abbreviated as \"1 1-8\"), the 8 youngest ages. The score for this group (displayed in the score field) is 30.87, computed as the average of the original AGE scores assigned to the 15 cases in this group. To accept the category grouping and new scores Click OK The new number of categories will now be listed next to the variable name in the t arget list along with the letter 'G' (signifying the variable has been grouped). Note:For nominal and ordinal variables, the labels for the grouped categories consist of indices of the original categories. For continuous variables and count s, the label corresponds to the range of values./triangleopenrt /triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt 53CHAPTER5. BASICSTEPSFORMODELDEVELOPMENTTo Restore a Grouped Variable to its Default Setting Highlight the grouped variable name in the target list. Double click the variable name to open the Variables dialog box. Type '0' or the number of original categories in the Groups list box. Click OK. WARNING! Use of the Group option will cause any previously set user scores to be ignored. User scores can be assigned to the new categories of a grouped variable to replace the average scores. Step 5: Set Scale Types (Variables Tab) Scale Types determine the distributional assumptions and structural form of the model to be estimated. There are several dif ferent scale types (Nominal, Ordinal, Continuous, Count, Binomial Count, Numeric) and subtypes (Truncated, Censored, S tandard, Zero-Inflated and Overdispersed) that may be assigned to a variable depend - ing upon the type of variable (indicator , covariate, dependent, predictor). The default for indicators and depend - ent variables is Ordinal when the variable cont ains numeric (quantit ative) values, and Nominal when the variable contains character codes (string variables). The default for covariates and predictors is Numeric when the vari - able contains numeric (quantit ative) values, and Nominal when the variable cont ains character codes (string vari - ables). To assign or change a scale type: Highlight the variable name(s) in a target list. Right click to open a menu with the selections for that variable type. Select a scale type./triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt 54LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEFigure 5-8. Selecting Scale T ypes The selected scale type will appear to the right of the variable name. If Ordinal is selected, by default, the scores will be treated as Fixed at the values on the dat a file and the label \"Ord-Fixed\" appears to change one or more of the category scores to dif ferent values, see How to S pecify Category Scores for an Ordinal V ariable. Scale Types Each scale type is listed below along with related det ails.O R D I N A L ( I N D I C A T O R S , D E P E N D E N T ) This setting should be used for categorical variables where the categories are ordered (either from high to low or low to high). If the dependent variable in an LC Regression model is set to Ordinal, the adjacent category logit model, also known as the baseline category logit model (see e.g. Magidson, 1996, 1998), is specified. For an Ordinal variable, the scale type will appear as 'Ord-Fixed', 'Ord-Uniform' or 'Ord-User' depending upon which scores are used (fixed, uniform or user scores): 1)Fixed (default). Either the original values cont ained in the dat a file or array , or, if no scores were specified, uniform scores are assigned to the categories. 2)Uniform. The variable is assigned fixed scores that are equidist ant and have a low score of 0 and a high score of 1. For example, for a 3 category variable, the uniform scores assigned are 0, 0.5, and 1. 3) User Scores. The user specifies category scores. 55CHAPTER5.

When esti - mating an LC Regression model, if the dependent variable is set to Nominal, the multinomial logit model is used./triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt 56LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEN U M E R I C ( C O V A R I A T E S , P R E D I C T O R S ) This setting should be used for an ordinal or continuous covariate or predictor .A C T I V E ( C O V A R I A T E S ) Specifying a covariate as active influences the definition of the latent classes. I N A C T I V E ( C O V A R I A T E S ) Specifying the covariate as inactiveguarantees that it s inclusion in the model has no influence on the model parameter estimates: An inactive covariate is not p art of the specified model.A D V A N C E D : G R O U P ( C O V A R I A T E S ) If a multilevel model is specified, group level covariates (GCovariates) may also be included in the covariate box. To distinguish covariates at the group level from ordinary covariates, select the Group setting. A<G> appears next to the group level covariate. All group level covariates are active.CO N T I N U O U S ( I N D I C A T O R S , D E P E N D E N T ) This setting should be used when the variable is continuous. When estimating an LC Regression model, if the dependent variable is set to Continuous, the normal linear Regression model is used. CO U N T ( I N D I C A T O R S , D E P E N D E N T ) This setting should be used when the variable represent s Poisson count s. When estimating a LC Regression model, if the dependent variable is set to Count, the Poisson model is used and you can also specify an addition - al variable to be used as an exposure (see Exposure) When estimating a LC Cluster or DFactor model, the exposure is set to 1 for all indicators specified as having the Count scale type.B I N O M I A L CO U N T ( I N D I C A T O R S , D E P E N D E N T ) This setting should be used when the variable represent s binomial count s. When estimating a LC Regression Model, if the dependent variable is set to Binomial Count, the binomial model is used and you can also specify a variable to be used as an exposure (see Exposure). During the scan, the program checks to make sure that the exposure, it specified, is larger than any observed count. When estimating a LC Cluster or DFactor model, for any indicator(s) specified as having the Binomial Count scale type, the exposure is computed automatically by the program to be the largest count observed for the indicator(s). 57CHAPTER5. BASICSTEPSFORMODELDEVELOPMENTNote:The exposure can easily be set to a value larger than the largest observed count by means of the following trick: Add one case with xvalues equal to the desired exposure values for all indicators. Include a very small case weight (say 1.0E-50) to the dat a file for this additional case. Scale Subtypes Four scale subtypes are listed below along with related det ails.S T A N D A R D ( I N D I C A T O R S , D E P E N D E N T ) By default, this setting is used for indicators and dependent variables. This setting means that the st andard scale type is used for this variable as opposed to one of the special subtypes described below .T R U N C A T E D ( C O U N T , B I N O M I A L C O U N T , C O N T I N U O U S ) Truncated indicates that only cases with a value larger than 0 are in the sample. It can be applied with an Indicator/Dependent that is a Poisson or Binomial Count, or a Continuous normally distributed variable. The like- lihood function is then constructed using truncated variant s of the Poisson, binomial, and normal distribution.C E N S O R E D ( C O N T I N U O U S ) Censored means that all cases with a \"true\" value smaller than 0 have the same observed value of 0; that is, the variable is assumed to be lef t censored at 0. Censored can be used with a Continuous Indicator/Dependent, in which case we use assume a lef t censored normal distribution for the variable concerned.Z E R O I N F L A T E D ( R E G R E S S I O N O N L Y ) Zero Inflated (ZIN) means that one additional latent class with a mean equal to zero is automatically added to the specified model. For Regression models with the dependent variable being a count, these specifications yield the well known Zero Inflated variant s of the Poisson and binomial count regression models. In the case of a Continuous dependent variable, it yields a Zero Inflated variant for lef t censored normal regression, sometimes referred to as censored-inflated regression. In other words, for continuous dependent variables, Zero Inflated also implies Censored. With Nominal and Ordinal dependent variables, (as well as with Choice, Rating and Ranking specification in Latent GOLD Choice), one ZIN class is added for each category of the Dependent. Each ZIN class responds with probability 1 into a p articular category (and with probability 0 into the other categories). These classes are some - times referred to as st ayer classes (in a mover-st ayer model) or brand-loyal classes (in a brand-switching model). 58LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEO V E R D I S P E R S E D ( C O U N T A N D B I N O M I A L C O U N T I N R E G R E S S I O N ) Overdispersion is a common phenomenon in count dat a. It means that, as a result of unobserved heterogeneity , the variance of the count variable is larger than estimated by the Poisson (binomial) model. The overdispersed option makes it possible to account for unobserved heterogeneity by assuming that the rates (success probabil - ities) follow a gamma (bet a) distribution. This yields a negative-binomial model for overdispersed Poisson count s and a negative-binomial model for overdispersed binomial count s. Note that this option is conceptually similar to including a normally distributed random intercept in a regression model for a count variable. The overdispersion option is useful if one wishes to analyze count dat a using mixture or zero-inflated variant s of (truncated) negative-binomial or bet a-binomial 2003). The nega - tive-binomial model is a Poisson model with an extra error term coming from a gamma distribution. The beta-bino- mial model is a variant of the binomial count model that assumes that the success probabilities come from a bet a distribution. These models are common in fields such as criminology , political sciences, medicine, biology , and marketing. Step 6: Specify the Number of Latent Classes (Variables Tab) Use the V ariables Tab to specify the number of classes for your model. In the Cluster Module, a class is called a Cluster. In the DFactor Module, the ordered latent classes associated with each DFactor are called 'levels'. A model may cont ain several DFactors, each of which may have a dif ferent number of levels. S P E C I F Y I N G T H E N U M B E R O F C L U S T E R S F O R L C C L U S T E R M O D E L S The box labeled Clusters is located beneath the Indicators button in the V ariables Tab. I N D I C A T O R S ( C L U S T E R A N D D F A C T O R M O D E L S ) Indicators are dependent variables that are used to define or measure the latent classes in a LC Cluster model, or latent variable(s) in a DFactor model. Indicators may be treated as Nominal, Ordinal, Continuous, Poisson Count, or Binomial Count (see S tep 5: Set Scale Types). Select one or more variables from the variables list box to be used as Indicators (required). Enter a number greater than 0. You may also specify a range to estimate several models. For example, enter \"1-4\" to estimate four different latent class models containing 1, 2, 3, and 4 clusters respectively./triangleopenrt 59CHAPTER5.

If a range is specified for the number of class - es, such as '1-4', sep arate sets of regression models will be estimated, the first representing a 1-class regres - sion model (the traditional regression which assumes a single homogeneous population). For the other models, separate regressions are estimated for 2, 3 and 4 classes (segment s) respectively . A D V A N C E D .

In addition, a multilevel extension of a model may be estimated which involves specifying a group-level ID variable. In the case of multilevel models, 2 or more group-level latent classes (GClasses) and up to 3 group-level CFactors (GCFactors) may be specified. For further det ails, see S tep 7: Advanced Tab. Step 7: Set Restrictions and Other Model Options Following S tep 6, you may choose to estimate your model (S tep 10), view the result s and then impose (post-hoc) restrictions on the p arameters to achieve a more p arsimonious and interpret able model. Alternatively , you may choose to impose a priori restrictions and/or relax cert ain restrictions that are imposed by default. The most common restrictions are: zero restrictions: restrict to zero any p arameter estimate that is not st atistically significant class independence restrictions: restrict cert ain parameter estimates to be identical for each latent class offset: specify cert ain parameters to be equal to one (Regression) equal effect s:equate parameters across indicators (Cluster and DFactor) The additional ef fects that can be the regression model for the Clusters, Classes, or DFactors (Advanced) These are a few of the kinds of restrictions that may be applied using the Model Tab. Some additional kinds of restrictions and other advanced options are available using other t abs: ClassPred T ab:may be used to assign with cert ainty one or more designated cases to belong to a p ar- ticular latent class or latent classes. This Known Class option amount s to indicating to which classes cases or subset s of cases may not belong. Residuals T ab(Cluster and DFactor models only): may be used to include direct relationship s between indicators (associations/covariances) and direct ef fects of covariates on indicators in a model. Advanced T ab(available in the Advanced version of Latent GOLD): may be used to add group- level continuous latent variables (GCFactors) and/or a group level nominal latent variable (GClasses) in a multilevel extension of a model, as well as indicate which coefficients in the logistic regression model for the Clusters, DFactors, and Classes are ran - dom effects (differ across GClasses or are af fected by GCFactors) add continuous factors (CFactors) to specify factor analytic, item response theory (IR T), or random-ef fects regression models for 2-level dat a set options to incorporate the sampling design if it deviates from simple random sampling. This section det ails the use of each of these options.

In addition, for models with continuous dependent variables, restrictions are available for error variances. The various restrictions include class inde - pendent restrictions, order restrictions, zero restrictions, fixed-value (of fset) restrictions, and equality restrictions. By default, no restrictions are imposed. Restrictions can be placed prior to estimating an initial model to incorporate prior knowledge. For example, , the zero constraint s make it possible to specify a dif ferent regression model -- with dif ferent predictors -- for each latent class based of a priori knowledge about the classes. Aspecific application for this is a model with a ran - dom responders class for which all predictor ef fects are zero. An application of the equality constraint s is the pos - sibility of defining a DFactor-like structure in which, for example, one DFactor influences the intercept and anoth - er the predictor ef fects. Ordering constraint s are import ant if one has a priori knowledge on the direction of an effect. For example, the price ef fect on a product rating is usually assumed to be negative (or non-positive) in each latent class (segment). The estimates obt ained with Regression will be constrained to be in agreement with this assumption if the price ef fect is specified to be Descending. Alternatively , restrictions may be employed post-hoc to estimate a new model af ter viewing the result s from an estimated model. For Regression, when Kclasses have been specified in S tep 6, the Model Tab contains Kindividual columns for each of the Klatent classes (1,2, ...,K). Additional columns are labeled Class Independent and Order Restriction . When the range option is used in S tep 6 to specify the estimation of models with dif ferent numbers of latent classes, class-specific columns are absent from the Model Tab and only the class independent and order restrictions can be applied. Such restrictions are applied to each of the models generated by the range option. 69CHAPTER5. BASICSTEPSFORMODELDEVELOPMENTFigure 5-1 1. Model T ab for LC Regression Model. Selected intercept and predictor ef fects can be set equal to zero for cert ain classes (No Ef fect), equated across two or more classes (Merge Ef fect), or equated across all classes (Class Independent). The effects of a predictor can be restricted to be ordered in each class (Ascending or Descending). Error variances can be equated between selected classes (Merge Ef fect) or between all classes (Class Independent). The effect of a numeric predictor on a dependent variable that has a scale type other than nominal can be fixed to 1 in one or more classes (Of fset). The first row consist s of the label 'Intercept', followed by sep arate row for each predictor . Restrictions can be set separately for each row . By default, no restrictions are imposed. This is indicated by the unique integers (1,2, ...,K) that appear in each row , by the label 'No' indicating that the class independence restriction has not been imposed and the label 'None' indicating that no order restrictions have been selected for any predictors. S P E C I F Y I N G E Q U A L I T Y R E S T R I C T I O N S A C R O S S C L A S S E S The effects for a predictor may be specified as Class Independent (Fixed Ef fects) or Class Dependent (Random Effects, default). When the Class Independent restriction is applied, the regression coef ficient for that predic - tor is restricted to be equal between each of the K latent classes (segment s). When Class Independent is select - ed for a predictor , an '=' appears to the right of the predictor name in the V ariables Tab. For a 1-class regression model (K=1), selection of this option has no ef fect. To select this option Right click on the desired cell(s) in the column labeled 'Class Independent' The 'No' changes to 'Yes' in the selected cells, and the indices in the selected rows all change to '1' to indi - cate that the effects for classes 2, 3, etc. are all restricted to be equal to the corresponding effects for class 1. Alternatively , the restriction of class independence can be imposed as follows: Select all the cells containing the indices for a chosen row Right click to bring up the pop-up menu Select 'Merge Effect'. To undo these restrictions, reselect the cells, right click and select 'Separate Effect'. This alternative way of imposing the class independence restriction can also be used to specify equal ef fects between some but not all the classes. Simply select those class indices for which the across-class equality restric - tion is desired and select 'Merge Ef fect'. The indices selected will change to be equal. 'Merge Ef fect' can be used more than once for a given row , so that it is possible to specify that cert ain effects for classes 1 and 2 be restrict - ed to be equal and that the ef fects for classes 3 and 4 be equal. After imposing these restrictions, the associat - ed indices will appear as '1 1 3 3'. Note:the numbers indicate to which class the ef fect for the class concerned is equated. The regression intercept may also be restricted to be class independent. To set this option, right click on the row labeled 'Intercept' in the column labeled 'Class Independent' to retrieve the popup menu and select 'Y es'. Note:For dependent variables having scale type 'Ordinal', a third option 'No - Simple' is also avail - able. Rather than complete class independence ('Y es'), a 'simple' implement ation of class independence analogous to a class independent intercept specification in the linear regres - sion model (continuous scale type) is used where the (p artial) dependent variable means are taken to be class independent rather than the entire marginal dependent variable distri - bution.

This causes a '-' to appear in the selected cells which indicates that the ef fect(s) associated with these cells is now restricted to zero. These menu options can also be used in combination with each other to produce a desired result. For example, first selecting class independence, followed by selecting 'Sep arate Effect' in one of these cells causes the index for the selected cell to return to it s default setting. However , the remaining cells in that row remain restricted to be equal and 'Y es' automatically changes to 'No' in the Class Independent column.S P E C I F Y I N G O R D E R R E S T R I C T I O N S Order Restriction can be used to indicate that the regression coef ficient is monotonically increasing (Ascending) or decreasing (Descending)./triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt 71CHAPTER5. BASICSTEPSFORMODELDEVELOPMENTTo impose an orderingrestriction, right click on one or more cells cont aining a 'None' label and right click to retrieve the relevant pop-up menu. Select either Ascending orDescending to impose the desired ordering restric - tion on the selected predictor ef fect(s). This restriction is imposed across all classes. W ith a dependent variable of a scale type other than 'nominal', the usage and interpret ation of this restriction is straight forward. In the case of a nominal dependent variable, the dif ference between p arameters of adjacent categories of the dependent variable will be in agreement with the specified order restrictions (see section 5.3 of Technical Guide). S P E C I F Y I N G F I X E D V A L U E R E S T R I C T I O N S With the Offsetoption one can indicate that the ef fect of a numeric predictor should be fixed to 1 in selected class - es. The option is not available for Nominal dependent variables. Note: It is possible to use the of fset restriction to fix the ef fect to non-zero quantities other than 1 as well. For example, to restrict the ef fect of a numeric predictor to equal some desired con - stant c, you would first rescale that predictor by multiplying it by c. You would then use the rescaled version of the predictor in the model. Aspecific application occurs in the case in which one would like to fix the response probability to 0 for cert ain predictor values for cert ain classes. Suppose that the dependent variable is 1='buy', 0='no buy' and that you suspected that one latent class existed that always responded 'no buy' when the predictor variables reflected a certain pattern (e.g., PRICE $50). This option could be used to identify this latent class by creating a dummy predictor variable, say coded [-100, 0] where the value -100 refers to a situation which is suspected to always result in a 'no buy' for some class (fixing a logit coef ficient to -100 amount s to fixing the probability of a 1='buy' response to 0).I N C L U D I N G C F A C T O R , G C L A S S E S , A N D G C F A C T O R E F F E C T S I N T H E M O D E L F O RT H E D E P E N D E N T V A R I A B L E When included, CFactor , GClasses, and GCFactors appear as additional columns in the Model Tab. Check box switches can be added or removed to indicate whether CFactors, GClasses, and/or GCFactors af fect coef ficients, By default: CFactor1: intercept checked and other and ef fects the default is \"Class Independent = Yes\". This can be changed using Restricting Cases Known (Not) to Belong to a Cert ain Class or Classes With this option one can specify that one or more specific cases can belong to a cert ain class or cert ain classes only. To use this feature, select a variable from the list box in the ClassPred Tab to be used as the Known Class Indicator and click Known Class. The variable moves to the Known Class Indicator Box and the Assignment Table becomes active. For each category of the Known Class indicator you then specify to which classes the cases with that category code may belong (or not belong) using the Assignment Table. For example, Figure 5-12 illustrates a 4-Cluster model (4 columns) where the variable 'classind' is used as the Known Class Indicator . Cases for which 'classind=1' are allowed to be in cluster 1 only; those for which 'classind=2' are allowed to be in cluster 2 only; all other cases ('classind=3') may be assigned to any of the 4 clusters. Figure 5-12. ClassPred T ab for Cluster Model with a Known Class Indicator This option is useful if you have a priori class membership information for some cases (pre-assigned or pre-clas - sified cases) or if membership to cert ain classes is very implausible for some combinations of observed scores.K N O W N C L A S S \b C L A S S I N D I C A T O R In applications where a subset of the cases are known with cert ainty not to belong to a p articular class, or particular classes, you can t ake advant age of this information to restrict their posterior membership probability to 0 for one or more classes and hence classify these cases into one of the remaining class(es) with a tot al probability = 1. This feature allows more control over the segment definitions to ensure that the resulting classes 73CHAPTER5. BASICSTEPSFORMODELDEVELOPMENTare most meaningful. Common applications include: 1)using new dat a to refine old segment ation models while maint aining the segment classifications of the original sample 2)archetypal analysis - define class membership a priori based on extreme response p atterns that reflect theoretical \"archetypes\" 3)partial classification -- high cost (or other factors) may preclude all but a small sample of cases from being classified with cert ainty. These cases can be assigned to their respective classes with 100% certainty, and the remaining would be classified by the LC model in the usual way 4)certain cases may be known to be \"type 1 OR type 2\" (e.g., 'clinically depressed' or 'troubled'). By excluding such cases from being in say class 3 = 'healthy', such cases can be pre-assigned to be in class 1 or 2, while additional cases may be freely classified into any class 5)post-hoc refinement of class assignment where modal assignment for cert ain cases is judged to be implausible based on the desired interpret ation of the classes. In addition, this option may also be used to specify multiple group models by including the group variable as both a Known Class Indicator and as an active covariate. For further det ails of this, see section 2.5 of Technical Guide. Note:The Known Class option is not available in cluster and regression if the Range option has been used in the V ariables Tab. For DFactor models, this option applies only to levels of DFactor 1. To select known classes (clusters/classes/DFactor1 levels): Select one variable from those appearing in Variables List Box (located in the upper left-hand portion of the ClassPred Tab). Variables appearing here are those that have not been previously selected as Indicators or Covariates. Click Known Class to move that variable to the Known Class Box and the class assignment window beneath the Known Class Box becomes active. A separate row appears for each category/code/value taken on by the known class indicator A separate column appears for each class. Click on the appropriate boxes to select or deselect the possible assignment of the categories to certain classes. Acheckmark of f means that the posterior membership probability is restricted to zero for that class for cases in that category of the known class indicator . By default, the checks are assigned as follows: For a K-class model, a category with a code of K on the Known Class Indicator is assigned to only class/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt 74LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEK. Categories coded less than 1, greater than K or missing are assigned to all classes (i.e., no restric - tions). Missing values are not shown in the t able. Note:For the example in Figure 5-12 above, all cases are coded either 1, 2 or 3 on the variable 'classind' (i.e., no missing values). Those coded 'classind=1' and 'classind=2' are main - tained at their default specifications on the t able, while the default specification for cases coded 'classind=3' was changed (from 'cluster 3 only' to 'any cluster' -- all 4 cluster columns checked). This specification would be obt ained by default if those coded '3' on the classind variable were instead coded as 'missing'. In this situation, the t able would dif fer from that shown in Figure 5-12, in that the 3rd row of the t able would not appear , since that category would be coded 'missing'. For further information, see section 2.5 of the Technical Guide. Residuals Tab: Including Direct Ef fects in Model ( C L U S T E R A N D D F A C T O R M O D E L S ) From the Residuals Tab you may specify a direct ef fect to include in a model. All pairs of variables eligible for a direct effect parameter appear . To include a direct ef fect, click in the check-box and a check appears. Direct ef fect parameters will be estimated for the p airs of variables that have been so selected (direct ef fect check-box equals on). The inclusion of direct ef fects is one way to relax the assumption of local independence. Figure 5-13. Residuals T ab for DFactor Model Direct effects may be specified prior to estimating a model or post-hoc af ter examining the result s of a model. To assist you in choosing p airs of variables for which direct ef fects may improve the fit of a model, bivariate residu - als (BVR) may be are output. Bivariate residuals are listed in the Bivariate Residuals section of the Outline p ane when this option has been selected in the Output Tab. They are useful for diagnostic purposes. Advanced users may wish to include one or more Direct Ef fects Parameters that are associated with large bivariate residuals in a model. Adirect effect between two indicators and direct ef fects of selected covariates on selected indicators can be 75CHAPTER5. BASICSTEPSFORMODELDEVELOPMENTselected for inclusion in a model using the Residuals Tab on the Analysis dialog box. After estimation, these effects will be listed in the Parameters output in a section labeled 'Direct Ef fect Parameters'. Note:If this is your first model for a dat a file, once you have specified the model in the V ariables Tab, all pairs of indicators and covariates will be listed without any bivariate residuals in the Residuals Tab. After you have estimated a model, the Residuals Tab will also cont ain a bivariate residual associated with each direct effect. Reopen the Analysis dialog box and now the Residuals Tab contains the residuals based on the model sorted from high to low according to the magnitude of the residual. The example in Figure 5-13 shows that the direct ef fect between the variable p air NECK and BACK is associat - ed with the largest residual is. This residual value (chi-square divided by it s degrees of freedom) is 104.4553, which is much larger than 1, the reference value for these residuals. In situations where there is only one large diagnostic value, a new model can be estimated by selecting the variable p air (a pair is selected when a checkmark appears in the box to the lef t), and clicking Estimate, thus adding the associated direct ef fect parameter to the current model. Note:If there are several large residuals (as in Figure 5-13), a common strategy is to include the corresponding direct ef fects one at a time as needed, each time re-estimating the model, and checking the updated residuals af ter each new model is estimated before including additional direct ef fects. This is because once you have included a direct ef fect in a model, all of the residuals in that new model may be small. After estimating, the bivariate residuals will be listed as 0 (or very close to 0) for any variable p air for which a parameter has been included in the model. Also note that if you estimate a new model that included residuals, Latent GOLD will ret ain all of your settings when estimating additional models, including the residuals selected for inclusion in the prior model. Check boxes: Sort by Residual. By default, bivariate residuals are sorted from largest to smallest (sort residual check box equals on). If this option is not checked, the residuals will be listed in default order which is based on the order the variables were entered into the model in the V ariables Tab. Set all.Click this to include direct ef fects for all eligible p airs of variables. Advanced Tab ( R E Q U I R E S T H E A D V A N C E D V E R S I O N O F L A T E N T G O L D ) The Advanced Tab is divided into 3 areas according to the section labels ab for DFactor Model The variables displayed in the variable list (lef t-most box of the Advanced Tab) are those that have not been spec - ified previously for use as an indicator , dependent variable, predictor , covariate, known class indicator , case ID, case weight, or replication weight. These variables are eligible for use with any of these 3 advanced options.S U R V E Y This advanced option can be used to specify information on the sampling design that was used to obt ain your data. The program computes the design ef fect, as well as report s sampling design corrected st andard errors and Wald statistics. Four aspect s of the sampling design can be t aken into account: stratification (S tratum), clustering (PSU), weighting (Sampling Wgt), and finite population size (Population Size). For more det ails, see section 1 1 of Technical Guide. Stratum The Stratum variable specifies the stratum to which a case belongs. When no S tratum variable is specified, it is assumed that all cases belong to the same stratum; that is, that there is only one stratum. PSU The PSU(Primary Sampling Unit) variable is used for two-st age cluster samples. It specifies the (sampling) clus - ter to which a case belongs. PSUs are assumed to be nested within strat a. When no PSU variable is specified, it is assumed that each case from a sep arate PSU. Sampling Wgt The Sampling Wgt variable cont ains a sampling weight. Rescale (default) vs. No Rescale. Upon selecting a variable to be used as a Sampling Wgt, the sym - bol <R> appears in the Sampling Wgt box to the right of the variable name to indicate that the weight s will be rescaled. Rescaling of the original weight s are accomplished by multiplying them by a const ant 77CHAPTER5. BASICSTEPSFORMODELDEVELOPMENTsuch that the sum of the weight s equals the sample size. Right click on the variable name and select 'No Rescale' from the popup menu to maintain the weights without rescaling. Upon selection of 'No Rescale', the <R> symbol is removed. Active (default) vs. Inactive. By default the sampling weight s are used in the estimation to compute pseudo maximum likelihood estimates as indicated in Section 1 1.1 of Technical Guide. If the sampling weight were instead specified as a Case W eight in the V ariables Tab, the resulting p arameter estimates would be the same as when the Active option is used here but the st andard errors are not correct. The inactive option for sampling wgt employs an alternative 2-step estimation algorithm developed by Vermunt and Magidson (2001). . Right click on the variable name and select 'Inactive' from the popup menu to select this option. Upon selection of 'Inactive', the <I> symbol appears in the Sampling Wgt box to the right of the variable name. If the sampling weight variable were instead not used at all in the estimation (not specified as either a Case Weight nor a Sampling Wgt), the p arameter estimates obt ained would be the same as when the Inactive option is used here, but the sizes of the latent classes would be biased. The advant age of this method over the Active option is that the unweighted estimates may be more st able. See Section 1 1.2 of the Technical Guide for further information about these options. Population Size The Population Size variable can be used to specify either the size of the population (# of PSUs in the S tratum concerned) or the population fraction. The variable is assumed to be a population fraction when it is smaller or equal to 1. This option can be use for finite population corrections. Continuous Factors This advanced option can be used to include up to 3 continuous latent variables (CFactors) in an LC Cluster , DFactor or Regression model. In the Cluster and DFactor Modules, the use of CFactors yields (mixture variant s of) factor-analytic models and various types of latent trait or IR Tmodels. In the Regression (and Choice) Modules, it yields models with continuous random ef fects. By default, the CFactors box is set to 'None'. To include CFactors in a model, click to open the drop down menu and select the number of CFactors to include in the model (1, 2, or 3). When 1 or more CFactors are included in the model, they appear on the Model Tab for further model specification. By default, CFactors use 10 nodes to approximate normally distributed variables. To improve precision of the estimates, the number of nodes may be increased to a value as high as 50 (or reduced as low as 2). This change is made in the Continuous Factors section of the Technical Tab (see S tep 8 for det ails). WARNING: Inclusion of CFactors in a model may subst antially increase the amount of time required to estimate the model. For example, inclusion of 2 CFactors, result s in 10x10 = 100 nodes used to approximate the bivariate normal distribution for these CFactors. Increasing the number of nodes to 50 result s in 50x50 = 2500 nodes, which will subst antially increase the/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt 78LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEamount of estimation time. For further det ails, see section 9.1 of Technical Guide. When used with a 1-class cluster or 1-class regression model, the result is not a LC model. For example, a 2-CFactor 1-class model with continuous indicators is identical to a traditional linear factor analysis (F A) model. When one or more indicators is other than continuous, this model becomes an IR Tvariant of the F Amodel. For further det ails regarding the various kinds of applications with CFactors, see Section 9.2 of Technical Guide.M U L T I L E V E L M O D E L This advanced option is used to specify a multilevel extension to an LC Cluster , DFactor or LC Regression model which allows for explanation of the heterogeneity not only at the case level, but also at the group level. Heterogeneity at the group level is explained by the inclusion of group-level classes (GClasses) and/or group- level CFactors (GCFactors) in a model. Group ID The Group ID variable indicates to which higher-level unit or group each case belongs. Upon selecting a variable as the Group ID, the Group S pecification Box in the lower-right portion of the Advanced Tab is activated. GClasses This option assumes that group s belong to one of a set of latent classes of group s, the number of which is spec - ified with GClasses (Group-level Classes). This yields the nonparametric variant of the multilevel LC model. By default, the GClass box is set to 1. To use this option to specify 2 or more GClasses Click the up arrow in the drop-down box to increase the number of GClasses to 2 or more (up to 100). The GCFactors then appear in the Group S pecification Box below . GCFactors This option assumes that group s differ with respect to their scores on one or more group-level continuous factors (GCFactors) or group-level random ef fects. This yields the parametric variant of the multilevel LC model. Click on the drop-down box to select the number of GCFactors. The GCFactors then appear in the Group S pecification Box below . GClasses and GCFactors may both be specified to combine the p arametric and nonp arametric approaches. GClasses and GCFactors may affect the intercept and the covariate ef fects in the regression model for the Clusters, DFactors or Classes have direct ef fects on the indicators (see Model Tab in Cluster/DFactor) affect the intercept and the predictor ef fects in the model for the dependent variable (see Model Tab in Regression) GClasses may themselves be af fected by Group-level covariates (GCovariates). When CGClasses or CGFactors are included in the model, they appear on the Model Tab for further model spec - ification as described earlier; that is, to include ef fects on the indicators and the dependent variable. To include 79CHAPTER5. BASICSTEPSFORMODELDEVELOPMENTGClass and/or GCFactor ef fects in the regression model for the Clusters, DFactors or Classes, use the Group Specification Box. Group specification box The Group specification box at the lower-right of the Advanced Tab contains a column for GClasses and addi - tional columns for each GCFactor specified. Click in the check boxes to allow estimation of desired p arameters. When GClasses and/or GCFactors are included, it is assumed that these af fect the intercept in the regression model for the Clusters, Classes, or DFactors. This yields the st andard multilevel latent class model in which class sizes are assumed to dif fer across group s by using a (p arametric or nonp arametric) random-intercept model for the latent classes. GClasses and GCFactors may also be allowed to af fect the covariate ef fects in the regression model for the Clusters, Classes, or DFactors. This is accomplished by checking the corresponding terms on the Advanced Tab. GClasses play a role similar to the one of the Classes in a LC regression model: ef fects can be GClass inde - (check of f) or GClass dependent (check on). GCFactors play a role similar to CFactors in a random- effects regression model: ef fect can be assumed to be fixed (check of f) or random (check on). See Section 10 of Technical Guide det ails and application types for multilevel models. Step 8: Set Technical Options (T echnical Tab) The Technical Tab of the Analysis dialog box cont ains various technical options that are available to control the estimation process and need to be set before a model is estimated to t ake effect. In addition to the usual kinds of options af fecting the number of iterations and convergence limit s, the other options - S tart Values, Bayes Constants, and treatment of missing dat a can affect the quality of the output result s. For det ailed descriptions of these options, see sections 6.2-6.7 of Technical Guide. Figure 5-15. T echnical T ab for Regression Model 80LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEC O N V E R G E N C E L I M I T S EM Tolerance EM Tolerance is the sum of absolute relative changes of p arameter values in a single iteration. It determines when the program switches from EM to Newton-Raphson (if the NR iteration limit has been set to > 0). Increasing the EM Tolerance will switch faster from EM to NR. To change this option, double click the value to highlight it, then type in a new value. You may enter any non-negative real number . The default is 0.01. V alues between 0.01 and 0.1 (1% and 10%) are reasonable. Tolerance Tolerance is the sum of absolute relative changes of p arameter values in a single iteration. It determines when the program stop s its iteration The default is 1.0x10-8 which specifies a tight convergence criterion. To change this option, double click the value to highlight it, then type in a new value. You may enter any non-negative real number.I T E R A T I O N L I M I T S EM Iterations Maximum number of EM iterations. The default is 250. If the model does not converge af ter 250 iter - ations, this value should be increased. You also may want to increase this value if you set NR itera - tions = 0. To change this option, double click the value to highlight it, then type in a new value. You may enter any non-negative integer . Newton-Raphson Maximum number of NR iterations. The default is 50. If the model does not converge af ter 50 itera - tions, this value should be increased. To change this option, double click the value to highlight it, then type in a new value. You may enter any non-negative integer . Avalue of 0 is entered to direct Latent GOLD to use only EM, which may produce faster convergence in models with many p arameters or in models that cont ain continuous indicators or dependent variables. S T A R T V A L U E S To reduce the likelihood of obt aining a local solution, the following options can be used to either increasing the number of st art sets, the number of iterations per set, or both. Random Set s The default is 10 for the number of random set s of starting values to be used to st art the iterative esti - mation algorithm. Decreasing the number of set s of random st arting values for the model p arameters reduces the likelihood of converging to a local (rather than global) solution. To change this option, double click the value to highlight it, then type in a new value. You may enter any non-negative inte - ger. Using either the value 0 or 1 result s in the use of a single set of st arting values. 81CHAPTER5. BASICSTEPSFORMODELDEVELOPMENTIterations This option allows specification of the number of iterations to be performed per set of st art values. Latent GOLD first performs this number of iterations within each set and subsequently twice this number within the best 10% of the st art sets. For some models, many more than 20 iterations per set may need to be performed to avoid local solutions. Seed The default value of 0 means that the Seed is obt ained during estimation using a p seudo random number generator based on clock time. S pecifying a non-negative integer dif ferent from 0, yields the same result each time. If the current model setup was obt ained by opening an .lgf file associated with a previously estimated model, 1) the Seed will not be 0 but will be the Best S tart Seed for that model as specified in the .lgf file, and 2) the Random Set s parameter will be set equal to 0. This procedure assures that the model estimated is exactly the same model obt ained when originally estimated, as long as the .lgf file was cre - ated using Latent GOLD 4.0 (see W arning below). To specify a p articular numeric seed (such as the Best S tart Seed reported in the Model Summary Output for a previously estimated model), double click the value to highlight it, then type in (or copy and paste) a non-negative integer . When using the Best S tart Seed, be sure to deactivate the Random Set s option (using Random Set s = 0). For further det ails see section 6.6 of Technical Guide. WARNING: Due to improvement s in this option in Latent GOLD 4.0, the random seed obt ained from earlier versions of Latent GOLD will not necessarily reproduce the original model and has an increased chance of resulting in a local solution. Hence, if you open an .lgf file that was created using an earlier version of Latent GOLD, you should make sure to restore the default value of 0 and increase the value for Random Set s to the default value of 10 or some other desired quantity . Tolerance Indicates the convergence criterion to be use when running the model of interest with the various start sets. The definition of this tolerance is the same as the one that use used for the EM and Newton-Raphson Iterations.B A Y E S C O N S T A N T S The Bayes options can be used to eliminate the possibility of obt aining boundary solutions. You may enter any non-negative real value. Sep arate Bayes const ants can be specified for three dif ferent situations: Latent Variables The default is 1. Increase the value to increase the weight allocated to the Dirichlet prior which is used to prevent the occurrence of boundary zeroes in estimating the latent distribution. The number can be interpreted as a tot al number of added cases that is equally distributed among the classes (and the covariate p atterns). To change this option, double click the value to highlight it, then type in a new value. Categorical V ariables The default is 1. Increase the value to increase the weight allocated to the Dirichlet prior which is used in estimating multinomial models with variables specified as Ordinal, Nominal or Binomial Count. The number can be interpreted as a tot al number of added cases to the cells in the models for the indicators (model for dependent) to prevent the occurrence of boundary zeroes. These pseudo cases are divided equally across classes and predictor/covariate p atterns, and in accordance with the observed marginal distribution across categories of the indicator (dependent variable) concerned. To 82LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEchange this option, double click the value to highlight it, then type in a new value. Poisson Count s This prior is equivalent to adding a specified number of event s to the dat a without changing the over - all Poisson rate. In other words, the number of exposures is adjusted accordingly . This prior prevent s boundary solutions in regression models where the Poisson count scale type is used. The default value for this Bayes const ant is 1. To change this option, double click the value to highlight it, then type in a new value. Error Variances The default is 1. Increase the value to increase the weight allocated to the inverse-W ishart prior which is used in estimating the error variance-covariance matrix in models for continuous dependent variables or indicators. The number can be interpreted as the number of p seudo-cases added to the data, each pseudo-case having a squared error equal to the tot al variance of the indicator (dependent variable) concerned. Such a prior prevent s variances of zero from occurring. To change this option, double click the value to highlight it, then type in a new value.M I S S I N G V A L U E S The Missing V alues option allows for the inclusion of records cont aining missing values on covariates and predic - tors as well as records cont aining missing values on the indicators. Including cases with missing values on covariates and predictors causes the mean to be inputed for the scale type numeric and the ef fect of the missing value category to be equated to zero for the scale type nominal. Missing values on indicators and dependent variables are handled directly in the likelihood function. Exclude cases For Regression, selection of this option excludes all replications having missing values on the dependent variable or any of the predictors and all cases having missing values on any of the active covariates. For Cluster/DFactor , selection of this option excludes all cases having missing values on any of the indicators or active covariates. Include indicators/dependent For Regression, selection of this option excludes replications having missing values on any of the predictors and cases having missing values on any of the active covariates. For Cluster/DFactor , selection of this option excludes cases having missing values on any of the active covariates. After exclusion of these cases, the remaining cases with missing values on the dependent variable (Regression) or on any indicator (Cluster and DFactor) are included in the analysis and handled directly in the likelihood function. Include all Selection of this option includes all cases and replications in the analysis regardless of the presence of missing values. Cases or replications with missing values on the dependent variable (Regression) or on any indicator (Cluster and DFactor) are included in the analysis and handled directly in the like - lihood function. Missing values on Predictors (Regression Module), or active covariates (Regression, Cluster and DFactor Modules) are imputed using Latent GOLD's imput ation procedure Inclusion in a model of covariates designated as inactive has no ef fect on which cases are excluded. Therefore, these missing values options have no ef fect with respect to the presence or absence of miss - ing values on covariates specified to be inactive 83CHAPTER5. BASICSTEPSFORMODELDEVELOPMENTB O O T S T R A P O P T I O N S ( B O O T S T R A P L 2 , B O O T S T R A P \u000e 2 L L D I F F ) The Technical Tab contains options for specifying the number of Replications and a Seed for both the Boot strap L2 and the conditional boot strap (Boot strap -2LL Diff) procedures. Either of these boot strap procedures can be requested from the Model Menu for an estimated model as described in S tep 10. Replications The default for the number of replication samples is 500. In most applications this number is large enough. The program also report s the Monte Carlo st andard error of the p-value. By increasing this number, a more precise estimate of the p-value is obt ained since the Monte Carlo error is reduced. With large models, to speed up the estimation you may consider reducing the number of replications. Seed Seed can be used to specify the seed that is used to generate the replication dat a sets (the default value 0 means random seed) for either the Boot strap of L2or the Conditional Boot strap ('Boot strap - 2LLDiff') procedures. Because of Monte Carlo simulation error , these boot strap procedures yields a slightly dif ferent p-value each time that it is repeated, along with an estimate of the st andard error . Specifying a p articular seed guarantees the same result each time. By specifying the seed to be equal to the boot strap seed reported in the Model Summary Output, one can replicate a previous run. In most boot strap applications one will only use the Replications option. If the Save Definition option in the File Menu is used to save a .lgf definition file for a model resulting from the Boot strap, the Boot strap Seed is saved. To reproduce result s obtained from the Boot strap of L2, see the Note in S tep 10 in the section on the Boot strap p-value (L2). To reproduce result s obtained from the Conditional Boot strap, see Note2 in S tep 10 in the section on the Conditional Boot strap (-2LL Diff). For the Conditional Boot strap, only the Boot strap Seed associated with the source model is utilized.A D V A N C E D . C O N T I N U O U S F A C T O R S Number of Nodes If 1 or more (group-level) continuous factors are specified in the Advanced Tab, this option deter - mines the number of nodes used to approximate their normal distribution. By default, 10 nodes are used. Decreasing this number (minimum is 2 nodes) will speed up estimation time but reduce preci - sion of the multivariate normality of the CFactors/GCFactors.

This output file will be listed as 'S tandard Classification' in the Outline p ane. Each row in the S tandard Classification output corresponds to a distinct observed dat a pattern in the data file. For Cluster and Regression models, each of these rows cont ains the estimated probability of being in each class. For DFactor models, each row in the S tandard Classification output cont ains the estimated probability of being in each DFactor level, the factor mean, and st andard errors for these esti - mates. For each CFactor and GCFactors, this file also cont ains the factor means and for GClasses the classification probabilities and the modal assignment. Covariate Classification. Classification is usually performed based on all available information for a case (Standard Classification). However , it is also possible to compute the probability of being in a cer - tain latent class (or a factor mean), given covariate values only . In fact these are model probabilities; that is, P(x|z) (see Technical Guide). These probabilities are useful for classifying new cases for which information on the dependent variable or indicators is not available. Each row in the Covariate Classification output corresponds to a distinct p attern of active covariates that is observed in the dat a file. For Cluster and Regression models, each of these rows cont ains the estimated probability of being in each class. For DFactor models, each row in the Covariate Classification output cont ains the estimated probability of being in each DFactor level, the factor mean, and standard errors for these estimates. In multilevel models, it cont ains the GClass probabilities given group-level covariates. Note:Inactive covariates do not influence the classification probabilities and hence have no af fect on this output. Standard Classification information as well as Covariate Classification can be viewed as Tabular output and/or can also be output to an external file. Selection of these from the Output Tab produces the Tabular output. Selecting Standard Classification and/or Covariate Classification from the 'Output to File' section of the ClassPred Tab produces the external files which cont ain the classification information as new variables append - ed to a copy of the input file used for estimation.

The fourth option suppresses such comput ations Standard (Hessian) The Standard method makes use of the second-order derivatives of the log-likelihood function called the Hessian matrix. This is the default option. Robust (Sandwich) The Robust method \"sandwiches\" the inverse of the outer-product matrix by the Hessian information. Standard errors and W ald statistics obt ained by the Robust method are less af fected by distributional assumptions about the indicators and the dependent variable. Fast (Outer Product) The Fast method approximates the information matrix using the outer-product of the first-order deriva - tives of the log-likelihood function. The Fast method may be used in models in which the other two meth - ods are comput ationally intensive. In such cases, one can also suppress the comput ation of st andard errors and W ald statistics. None This option suppresses the comput ation of st andard errors and W ald statistics (option None). This option may be useful when estimating models cont aining an extremely large number of p arameters, in which case comput ation of the second-order derivatives (used in Newton-Raphson, st andard error com - putations and W ald statistics) may t ake a lot of time. By setting the Newton-Raphson Iteration Limit to 0 and setting Standard Errors and W aldto off, the estimation process for such large models is much quicker. 87CHAPTER5. BASICSTEPSFORMODELDEVELOPMENTP R E D I C T I O N T Y P E ( R E G R E S S I O N O N L Y ) In regression, the program report s Prediction S tatistics. It is also possible to write predicted values to a file. Predicted values can be computed in three dif ferent ways. Posterior Mean Posterior Mean predicted values are defined as weighed averages of the class-specific predicted val - ues using an individual's posterior membership probabilities as weight s. HB-like As in Hierarchical Bayes, the HB-like predicted values are based on the Individual Coef ficients, which are weighted averages of the class-specific regression coef ficients with the posterior membership probabilities as weight s. Marginal Mean Marginal Mean uses the prior membership probabilities are weight s, which means that the observed values on the dependent variable are not used to generate the predictions. Posterior Mean and HB-like prediction yield similar result s. These methods give a good indication of within- sample prediction performance. Marginal Mean prediction yields much lower R-sq values, but gives a better indication of out-of-sample prediction performance.CO D I N G N O M I N A L Effect(default). By default, the Parameter Output cont ains effect coding for nominal indicators, dependent variable, active covariates and the latent classes (clusters). Use this option to change to dummy coding.

Selection of this option causes dummy coding to be used with the first category serving as the reference category .V A R I A N C E / CO V A R I A N C E M A T R I X When the input dat a file is either an ASCII text file or an SPSS .sav file, this option output s the variance-covari - ance matrix of the p arameter estimates to an external file. Output Filename. Upon selection of this option, a default filename appears in the box directly below the check-box. Use the browse button to change the filename and/or it s save location. The format of the output file will be the same as that of the input file (ASCII or .sav). 88LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEThe body of the output file cont ains the variances and covariances of all model p arameters. Each row in this out - put file corresponds to a p arameter. The first variable (column) on this file is a string variable 'Location' which pro - vides a unique name for the p arameter such as 'r0001c01'. The 3 right-most columns in the output file are vari - ables called 'se', 'p aram' and 'Label', serve to define the p arameters. For example, for this p arameter (row), the string variable called Label might cont ain a label such as 'purpose : 1 || Cluster1' which means that this is the parameter estimate for with the 1st category of the indicator PURPOSE, associated with cluster #1. The vari- ables 'param' and 'se' correspond to the estimate and st andard error for this p arameter as reported in the Parameters Output. The remaining variables on the file reproduce the p arameter names provided in Location and cont ain the vari - ance/covariance matrix. For example, the entry in row 1 (Location = 'r0001c01') and column 'r0001c01' is the variance of this p arameter estimate. The entry in row 1 (Location = 'r0001c01') and column 'r0001c02' is the covariance associated with p arameter estimates 'r0001c01' and 'r0001c02'. Note: Most users will not need to use this option. These quantities are useful in computing the standard error of a p articular function of the p arameter estimates.

ClassPred T ab for DFactor Model Standard Classification (optional) When the input dat a file is either an ASCII text file or an SPSS .sav file, this option produces a new dat a file containing the st andard classification information such as the probability of being in each cluster/class, or for DFactor models, in each level of each DFactor , together with any covariates and other variables specified in the Variables Tab and the variable included in the ID box of the ClassPred Tab (if any). The format of the output file will be the same as that of the input file (ASCII or .sav). This option is not available when using the range option in the Variables Tab to specify a range of models. In addition to these probabilities Latent GOLD also appends classification variables cont aining that cluster/ class/level into which the respondent should be classified (the one being the highest membership probability). For each case in the analysis file, the variables on the new dat a file consist of the model variables, the cluster/class/DFactor level probabilities, and class/DFactor classification (i.e., the index of the class/level cont aining the highest estimated probability). As an option, an ID variable can also be appended to the new file. For an example using this option, see Tutorial #3. Output Filename. Adefault filename will appear in this box. Use the browse button to change the file - name and/or it s save location. ID Variable.Asingle additional variable may be selected for inclusion (typically an ID variable or other key variable which provides a unique identification of each case on the file) to allow additional variables on the original dat a file that were not included in the analysis to be merged onto this file. Note: The new file is created af ter the model has been estimated. After selecting this option, click Estimate to estimate the model and create the new file. 90LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEWARNING! This setting is not preserved across models - it must be selected explicitly for each model estimated. For each CFactor and GCFactor , the corresponding factor means are output; for GClasses, the classification probabilities and the modal assignment are output. The order of the variables in the output file (and labels for a .sav formatted file) are as follows: the Known Class Indicator (if specified in the ClassPred Tab) any covariates included in the model other model variables specified in the V ariables Tab the variable included in the ID box of the ClassPred Tab (optional) For LC Cluster models: clu#1 (Cluster1) - membership probability for cluster 1 clu#2 (Cluster2) - posterior membership probability for cluster 2 ......

Selecting Covariate Classification from the 'Output to File' section of the ClassPredT ab produces the external files. The external file corresponding to the Covariate Classification information cont ains the new variables appended to a copy of the input file used for estimation. For multilevel models, this output file also cont ains the GClass probabilities given group-level covariates.P R E D I C T I O N O U T P U T T O A F I L E Predicted V alues (Regression only) Predicted values for the dependent variable can be output to an external file The method used to deter - mine the predicted values (pred_dep in output file) depends on the Predicted V alues setting on the Output Tab (Posterior Mean, HB-like, or Marginal Mean). The predicted value is a mean, except for nominal dependent variables for which it is a mode. For categorical dependent variables, the full esti - mated probability distribution for each replication is reported. 92LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEIndividual Coefficient s (Regression only) It is also possible to output posterior mean estimates for the Individual Coef ficients to an external file These are weighted averages of the class-specific ef fects, where the posterior membership probabili - ties of a case serve as weight s. In the output file, the coef ficients appear in the same order as in the Parameters Output and are labeled as b1, b2, b3, etc. Both the individual estimates (est_b1, est_b2, etc) and the individual st andard deviations (st d_b1, std_b2, etc) are provided. Cook's D The Cook's Dist ance measure may be output to an external file. This measure is used to identify cases that have a large influence on the p arameter estimates. Arecommended cut-of f point for Cook's dis - tance is four times the number of p arameters divided by the number of observations. CHAID (Requires a license to SI-CHAID 4.0) This option creates a CHAID settings file (.chd file) from your model that can be then opened via the SI-CHAID 4.0 program. W ith this option, a CHAID (CHi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector) analy - sis may be performed following the estimation of any LC model in Latent GOLD 4.0. By selecting 'CHAID' as one of the output options, a CHAID input file will be constructed upon completion of the model estimation, which can then be used as input to SI-CHAID 4.0. For more information regarding CHAID, see section 1.6 in Chapter 1, and Tutorial #4 in Chapter 7. For additional information on the output to file options, see Section 7.9 of T echnical Guide. Step 10: Estimate the Model, V iew Output and Continue Once you have specified your model, to estimate the model you may: Click Estimate (located at the bottom of the Analysis dialog box) If your analysis window was originally opened from a new model (as opposed to a previously estimated model) you may estimate the model in other ways as well: From the Model Menu, select Estimate, or Click If you opened a previously saved .lgf file and the Outline Pane cont ains names for 1 or more models that have not yet been estimated, to estimate all models that have not yet been estimated. click on the data file name in the Outline Pane select 'Estimate All' from the Model Menu /triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt 93CHAPTER5. BASICSTEPSFORMODELDEVELOPMENTS T O P P I N G M O D E L E S T I M A T I O N ( M O D E L M E N U ) Upon beginning a model estimation, the stop button on the toolbar becomes red (this may t ake several seconds or longer) which indicates that it is now active. You can stop a model estimation once it has begun to accomplish either 1) canceling the estimation, or 2) p ausing the estimation to view preliminary result s and/or make changes to the requested output options or change the iteration or convergence limit s prior to resuming estimation.

Depending upon how large the model is that is being estimated, it may t ake anywhere from one second to several minutes (or longer) to generate the preliminary out - put listings. The Pause option does not cause a preliminary version of output to a dat a file to be created even if such was requested using the ClassPred Tab. If such has been requested, it will be produced only if the estimation is resumed and allowed to complete. See Resuming Estimation of a Paused Model below . Prior to resuming model estimation, you may modify the Output options that were requested in the Output Tab or change the Iteration or Convergence Limit s in the Technical Tab. After a model is p aused, the model name associated with that model appears in the Outline Pane with the characters 'Paused' appended to it. To change the Output options or the Iteration or Convergence limit s, double click the model name to open the analysis dialog box and make the desired changes in the Output and/or Technical Tab. Note that the label 'Resume' replaces 'Estimate' on the Estimate button. Continue Model Estimation If Stop was selected in error , click Continue to continue estimating the model. Resuming Estimation of a Paused Model (Model Menu) After viewing the preliminary output and making changes to the options as described above, to Resume the estimation of a paused model: select Resume from the Model Menu or Click the Resume button at the bottom of the Analysis Dialog Box associated with the Paused model. To open the analysis dialog box for a Paused model double click the name of the paused model.

Thus, it is not available: For any multilevel model For Cluster and DFactor models, if one or more indicators is specified as continuous. For Regression, if the dependent variable is specified as continuous. With sparse data, the chi-squared based estimation for the p-value associated with L2cannot be trusted because these statistics do not follow a chi-squared distribution. When chi-squared st atistics are available, a good alter - native is to estimate the p-value by boot strapping, or Monte Carlo simulation. The Bootstrap L2 procedure involves generating a cert ain number of replication samples from the maximum likelihood solution and re-esti - mating the model with each replication sample. The bootstrap p-value is the proportion of replication samples with a higher L2than in the original sample. Abootstrap p-value for the L2statistic can be obt ained for a model af ter that model is estimated. Once you have examined the results for an estimated model and wish to obtain a bootstrap p-value for it, right-click on the selected model to retrieve the model selection menu. If chi-squared st atistics are available for this model, the boot strap option will be active on this menu. Select Bootstrap L2 The model will now be re-estimated using only a single st art set and the best st art seed, which guarantees that the bootstrap procedure st arts with the previously estimated solution. Following the re-estimation of the model in the usual way , the estimation procedure for the boot strap p-value begins. The number of Replications and the Seed used will be the ones provided in the Boot strap section of the Technical Tab (see Boot strap Options in Step 8). After each replication of the procedure has completed, the boot strap p-value is updated in the st atus bar dis - played in the lower lef t portion of the screen. Once the boot strap procedure has completed, the name of the associated model together with the appended characters 'Boot' appears at the bottom of the Outline Tab. For example, if the estimated model is named 'Model3', the resulting model cont aining the boot strap p-value will be named 'Model3Boot'. The resulting boot - strap p-value and st andard error appear in the Model Summary Output in the columns to the right of the tradi -/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrttional p-value associated with this model name. All other output associated with the Boot model name is identi - cal to that obt ained earlier for the estimated model. Note: Bootstrap information is provided only in the Model Summary Output listing. This informa - tion may be saved by copying it to the clipboard and p asting it elsewhere, or by using the Save Result s option in the File Menu. If the Save Definition option in the File Menu is used to save a .lgf definition file for this model, the Boot strap Seed is saved. Upon re-estimating the model following a File Open of the saved .lgf file, the model will again be estimated in the usual way but the boot strap will not be performed. To reproduce the boot strap, you will need to select Boot strap L2from the Model Menu for the re-estimated model. Use of the saved Seed guarantees that the same replication dat a sets will be generated and you will be able to reproduce the boot strap result s obtained previously . PROBChi Calculator (V iew Menu) For assist ance in assessing the improvement of a new model that imposes one or more test able restrictions on a previously estimated model, the ProbChi option allows you to obt ain a p-value for a given chi-square (or vice- versa) for a specified number of degrees of freedom, df. For two models, Model2 being a more p arsimonious (restricted) form of Model1, this tool test s whether the simplification is warranted using the dif ference between the L2statistics for the two models, L2(Model2) - L2(Model1), with df = df(Model2) - df(Model1). Enter the L2differ- ence and the corresponding df and then click Chi->p to see if the dif ference between the models is significant. If not, you may use the more p arsimonious model (Model2) without a significant loss of information. To use this tool: From the menus choose View ProbChi Enter a Chi-square value (or p-value) and number of degrees of freedom. Click on Chi->p 5-18: ProbChi dialog box /triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/b2right /triangleopenrt 97CHAPTER5. BASICSTEPSFORMODELDEVELOPMENTGiven that the less restricted model is true, if the dif ference in model fit between the 2 models is not significant, the more restricted model may also be accepted as true and therefore preferred on grounds of being more parsimonious. On the other hand, if the dif ference is significant, the restricted model would be rejected in favor of the unrestricted model. Note:To be valid, the chi-square value entered should only be an L2value or a dif ference between two L2values (as described above). WARNING: The L-square dif ference is not a valid way to test the significance of adding 1 or more classes, DFactors, or levels associated with one or more DFactors to a model. To test these requires the more general conditional boot strap approach. C O N D I T I O N A L B O O T S T R A P ( B O O T S T R A P 2 L L D I F F ) ( M O D E L M E N U ) This option requires that you have already estimated at least 2 models, one of which is selected for the condi - tional boot strap calculation. The second model, selected from a list of eligible models, must be a restricted ver - sion of (i.e., nested within) the selected model. Note:This option is not available for multilevel models. Similar to the use of the PROBChi calculator , the conditional boot strap option (abbreviated as 'Boot strap-2LL Diff') provides assist ance in assessing the improvement of a model that imposes one or more test able restric - tions on another estimated model by estimating a p-value. However , it is much more general than the -2LL difference test, and can be used to formally assess the st atistical significance of imposing any set of model restrictions. Given that the less restricted model is true, if the dif ference in model fit between the 2 models is not significant, the more restricted model may also be accepted as true and therefore preferred on grounds of being more parsimonious. On the other hand, if the dif ference is significant, the more restricted model would be rejected in favor of the less restricted model. Acommon application would be to test whether an additional class, DFactor or DFactor level provides a significant improvement in model fit. For example, since a 3 class model can be obt ained from a 4-class model by restricting the size of the 4th class to be zero, the conditional boot strap option can be used to test whether there is a significant dif ference in model fit between these 2 models. If the dif ference is not significant, the simpler 3-class model may be used in place of the 4-class model. If the dif ference is significant, you could con - clude that the addition of the 4th class provides a significant improvement. Another import ant application is in the testing of order restrictions, such as the ordered-restricted clusters (Cluster) and order-restricted predictor ef fects (Regression) assumptions. The test would then be between a model with and a model without the ordered restrictions of interest. To use this option to test the significance of the difference in fit between 2 model: Estimate 2 or more models, at least one being a simpler, restricted form of another. After completion of the estimation, right click on the less restricted model./triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt 98LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEThe available -2LL Diff' Alist containing a subset of the other estimated models appears, cont aining possibly one or more simpler (nested) models that may be eligible to be used as reference models. Select the desired less restricted model Click OK These step s are illustrated in Tutorial #1 in chapter 7 to test whether the improvement from a 3 to a 4-class model is statistically significant. Once the conditional boot strap procedure has completed, the names of 2 models -- the less restricted model and the reference model together with the appended characters 'Boot' -- appears at the bottom of the Outline Tab. The resulting conditional boot strap p-value and associated st andard error appears in the Model Summary Output in the columns to the right of the traditional p-value associated with the less restricted (selected) model. In addition, if chi-squared st atistics are available, the boot strap L2p-value and st andard error appear in the Model Summary Output in the columns to the right of the traditional p-value associated with the eligible reference model. All other output listings associated with these 2 'Boot' models is identical to that obt ained earlier for the 2 models estimated originally . Note:In order for the result s of the conditional boot strap to be valid, the reference model must be a restricted form of (i.e., nested within) the original model. You should be aware that the list of eligible models may well include some models that do not qualify as nested, and hence should not be selected. For example, you should make sure that both models include the same variables (dependent, exposure, caseid, indicators, covariates, predictors, attributes, case weight s, replication weight s, known class, etc.). Note 2:Bootstrap information is provided only in the Model Summary Output listings. This informa - tion may be saved by copying it to the clipboard and p asting it elsewhere, or by using the Save Result s option in the File Menu. If the Save Definition option in the File Menu is used to save a .lgf definition file for both the source model (say named 'Model2Boot') and the selected reference model (say 'Model1Boot'), the Boot strap Seed is saved (for both models). To reproduce the boot strap result s, upon re-estimating both models following a File Open of the associated saved .lgf file(s), you will need to select 'Boot strap -2LL Diff' from the Model Menu for the re-estimated source model and select the appropriate reference model again as described above. Use of the saved Seed guarantees that the same replication dat a sets will be generated and you will be able to reproduce the boot strap results obtained previously . The 2 additional models estimated will have 'Boot' again appended to the original names, so the reproduced boot strap models will be named for example 'Model1BootBoot' and 'Model2BootBoot'.O U T P U T F I L E S C R E A T E D Once a model has been Estimated or Paused, a number of output file listings are created which may be viewed, copied to the clipboard, or printed.

MODEL AND MODEL SUMMAR YOUTPUT Following estimation of a model, various output file listings and graphi - cal displays are produced. The specific output produced is controlled by the check-boxes on the Output Tab (see S tep 9: Set Output Options in Chapter 5). In addition, case level information such as modal class assignment s, posterior membership probabilities, regression predic - tions, and individual coef ficients can be requested to be output to a dat a file using check-boxes on the ClassPred Tab (described at the end of Step 9 in Chapter 5). This chapter describes each of the various output listings and plot s that may be obt ained using the Output Tab, and how to view this output. W ith the Advanced version of Latent GOLD, the Advanced Tab can be used to request the inclusion of CFactors, GClasses, and or GCFactors in a model. When such advanced features are used, additional information is included in the output. This additional information is also described in this chapter in sections labeled 'Advanced'. For further technical det ails and formulae see Part I (chapters 1-7) of Technical Guide for the various parameters and st atistics associated with Latent GOLD Basic, and Part II (chapters 8-12) of Technical Guide for the various parameters and st atistics associated with Latent GOLD Advanced. 103CHAPTER6. MODELANDMODELSUMMARYOUTPUTIn general, alloutput listings and displays are organized in sections using a hierarchical structure. For each dat a file opened, the Dat a File Summary Output cont ains summary information for all mod - els estimated on these dat a. Within each dat a file, for each model estimated, the Model Summary Output cont ains information such as model specifications and performance st atistics for that model. Within each model, several specific kinds of model output (such as Parameters Output) are listed in separate sections in the Outline p ane beneath the model name. Within certain model output section listings, subsections cont aining specialized t ables or plot s are available as sep arate files. The model output files Parameters, Profile, and ProbMeans are produced by default, regardless of the type of model estimated (Cluster , DFactor or Regression), and the Bivariate Residuals are also produced by default in Cluster and DFactor . The Profile and ProbMeans Output re-express cert ain parameters in the Parameters file in terms of conditional probabilities and/or means, and cont ain subcategories for plot s (e.g., Prf-Plot). Another element common to the output for all three-model types is that output associated with active covariates is always presented in the bottom portion of Parameters Output. For Cluster models, this section is labeled Model for Clusters; for DFactor models, Model for DFactors, and cont ains the result s for each factor sep arately; for Regression models, it is labeled Model for Classes. If no active covariates are included in the model, result s in this section are given for the intercept only which relates to the size of the latent classes. To view a p articular output file, click on a name in the Outline p ane and the associated output will be opened and displayed in the Content s pane (see Figure 6-1). To make visible the names of the specific kinds of output produced for an estimated model you will need to click on the exp and/contract icon (+) to exp and a model name or model output name. For example, to make the Prf-Plot visible you will need to exp and the Profile output. When expanded, the exp and/contract icon changes from (+) to (-). Figure 6-1. Exp and/Contract Icon for 3-class Model changes to (-) which makes 'Prf-Plot' Visible. Exp and/Contract Icon for 'Model4' remains as Not V isible 104LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEClicking on Prf-Plot causes this display to appear in the Content s Pane. For an example of this, see Figure 6-7. The expanded output sub-categories may dif fer by type of model estimated. For example, for DFactor models, Parameters Output cont ains the subcategory listings Loadings, Correlations, and possibly also Error Correlations which re-express the p arameters in a form similar to linear factor analysis, the latter subcategory available only when one or more indicators are continuous. For Cluster models, the Correlations subcategory does not appear and for Regression models, Parameters cont ains no subcategories. The use of the exp and/contract icon is illus - trated below .O R D E R I N G O F L A T E N T C L A S S E S I N O U T P U T Towards the goal of assuring comp arability in the output when a model is re-estimated, Latent GOLD applies rules to establish a unique ordering of the classes. In general, classes are ordered by class size, from largest to smallest. However , if parameter restrictions are applied, this rule is ignored to allow for better correspondence between a model when estimated with and without such restrictions. For example, in an unrestricted model if a parameter associated with the largest class (class #1) is restricted to 0, the restricted model will show a 0 for that parameter for class #1, even if class #1 is no longer largest af ter imposing the restriction.I T E R A T I O N D E T A I L The model output file Iteration Det ail produces similar kinds of information regardless of the type of model esti - mated (Cluster , DFactor or Regression). It is generated only if the Iteration Det ail option is selected in the Output Tab before model estimation or if convergence problems or boundary solutions were encountered during the esti - mation. This file cont ains technical information associated with the performance of the estimation algorithm, such as log- posterior and log-likelihood values at selected iterations: for each Random Set of st arting values, for selected iterations of the EM algorithm, for selected iterations of the Newton algorithm. When applicable, this file also cont ains warning messages concerning nonconvergence, unidentified p arameters and boundary solutions, and additional iterations associated with an 'inactive sampling weight' when specified in the Advanced Tab. Estimation W arnings WARNING: negative number of degrees of freedom This warning indicates that the model cont ains more p arameters than cell count s. Anecessary (but not sufficient) condition for identification of the p arameters of a latent class model is that the number of degrees of freedom is nonnegative. This warning thus indicates that the model is not identified. The remedy is to use a model with fewer latent classes (or DFactors) 105CHAPTER6. MODELANDMODELSUMMARYOUTPUTWARNING: # boundary or non-identified p arameter(s) This warning is derived from the rank of the information matrix (Hessian or it s outer-product approxima - tion). When there are non-identified p arameters, the information matrix will not be full rank. The number reported is the rank deficiency , which gives an indication of the number of non-identified parameters. Note that there aretwo problems associated with this identification check. The first is that boundary estimates also yield rank deficiencies. In other words, when there is a rank deficiency , we do not know whether it is caused by boundaries or non-identified p arameters. The Latent GOLD Bayes Const ants prevent boundaries from occurring, which solves the first problem related to this message. However , a second problem is that this identification check cannot always detect non-identification when Bayes Constants are used; that is, Bayes Const ants can make an otherwise non-identified model appear to be identified. Amore reliable method to check the identification of a LC model (when estimated with a p articular dat a set) is as follows. Set all Bayes Cont ants, Random Set s, and both EM and Newton-Raphson Iteration Limits to 0, and select the S tandard Errors and W ald method Fast (Outer-Product) prior to estimatingthe specified model. If no warning message appears, the model is identified. However , non-identification detected in this manner may be related to \"true\" non-identification (model is non-identified with any dat a set) or to the fact that there is not enough dat a (too few non-zero cells in the observed frequency t able). The latter will lead to boundary estimates. These two explanations can easily be distinguished by adding one or more fictitious cases to the dat a set (with response p atterns that are not already in the data set). With enough dat a, if the warning message still appears, the model is non-identified, irrespec - tive of the dat a set. WARNING: # CFactor effect(s) should be excluded for identification For CFactor models with continuous indicators -- st andard and mixture factor analysis - there is a spe - cial identification check for the factor structure. This may yield a warning indicating how many constraint s should be imposed to get an identified factor structure. Usually , identification will be achieved by excluding one or more CFactor-Indicator ef fects as suggested by the message. Sometimes, one may instead wish to use the \"Equal Ef fects\" option to achieve identification. WARNING: maximum number of iterations reached without convergence This warning is provided if the maximum specified EM and Newton-Raphson iterations are reached without meeting the tolerance criterion. If the (by default very strict) tolerance is almost reached, the solution isprobably be ok. Otherwise, the remedy is to reestimate the model with a sharper EM tolerance and/or more EM iterations, which makes sure that the switch from EM to Newton-Raphson occurs later . The default number of 50 Newton-Raphson iterations will generally be more than suf ficient. WARNING: estimation procedure did not converge (# gradient s larger than 1.0e-3) This message may be related to the previous message, in which case the same remedy may be used. If the previous message is not reported, this indicates that there is a more serious non-convergence problem. The algorithms may have gotten trapped in a very flat region of the p arameters sp ace (a sad - dle point). The best remedy is to reestimate the model with other st arting sets, and possibly with a larg - er number of S tart Sets and more Iterations per set. If the problem repeat s, the likely explanation is that the data is not informative enough about the p arameter values. 106LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEWARNING: # strat a with only one PSU Arequirement for the complex survey estimator of the variance-covariance matrix of the model p aram- eters is that each S tratum cont ains at PSUs. If a p articular S tratum cont ains only one PSU, it is omitted from the comput ations of the variance-covariance matrix, which is clearly not the best solution. Abetter solution is for you to merge this stratum with another stratum, and re-estimate the model. The best remedy is, therefore, to perform the merging yourself. For further technical details regarding the estimation, see sections 6.3 - 6.8 in T echnical Guide. The remainder of this chapter provides a description of each of the other output file listings and each output sub - category. Data File Summary Output and Model Fit If you highlight a dat a file name in the Outline p ane, the Content s pane lists general summary information regarding the dat a file (file name, location, size, date) and also list s names of all models that have been estimated in the current Latent GOLD session for this dat a file. By default, this output file report s the log-likeli - hood (LL), BIC based on LL, number of p arameters (Np ar), and the proportion of classification errors (Class.Err .) for all models. In addition, if chi-squared st atistics are available, the likelihood-ratio st atistic (L2), degrees of freedom (df), and the p-value are also reported. Figure 6-2. Dat a File Summary Output and associated Model Summary Display The Model Fit likelihood ratio chi-squared st atistic (L2) is one of several st atistics that can be used to assess how well the model fit s the data (how similar model-based estimated frequencies are to observed frequencies). In the context of latent class analysis, L2can also be interpreted as indicating the amount of the observed relationship 107CHAPTER6. MODELANDMODELSUMMARYOUTPUTbetween the variables that remains unexplained by a model; the larger the value, the poorer the model fit s the data and the worse the observed relationship s are described by the specified model. The associated p-value is a formal assessment of the extent to which the model fit s the data (the null hypothesis of this test is that the specified model holds true in the population). It is obt ained from a chi-squared t able lookup with the reported number of degrees of freedom. Thus, p<.05 indicates a poor fit. As a general rule of thumb, a good fit is provided by a model when the L2for that model is not subst antially larger than the degrees of freedom which is the expected value for L2under the assumptions that 1) the model is true and 2) L2follows a chi-square distribution. When dealing with a small sample size or sp arse data, chi-square does not provide a good approximation to L2 and hence the p-value reported is not valid. Thus, the program also provides optional alternative st atistics to assess model fit using the boot strap procedure. The Bootstrap estimate of the p-value can be obt ained when chi- square statistics are available and the conditional Boot strap (Boot strap -2LL Diff) can be obt ained for any model to assess the significance of the improvement in fit due to an additional latent class, DFactor or DFactor level (see chapter 7 for examples of the use of these Boot strap procedures). In addition, information criteria such as the BIC may be used when the t able is not sp arse as well as when it is sparse. When chi-squared st atistics are available such information criteria can be based on L2, and when chi-squared st atistics are not available, they can be based upon LL. By selecting 'Summary Control' from the V iew Menu or with a right click from within the Content s Pane (right- hand) pane, the Model Summary Display menu becomes visible. This can be used to display the BIC and other items or to delete items to customize your summary t able by clicking on the associated check-boxes in the Model Summary Display control p anel. Additional items that can be requested are AIC, AIC3, and BIC (based on L2or LL) and BIC based on L2. In addi- tion to model fit, AIC, AIC3, and BIC t ake into account the p arsimony of the model. They differ from one another according to how much weight is applied to penalize for each additional model p arameter. When comparing models, the lower the value of the BIC (or AIC, AIC3), the better the model. See section 7.1.3 of T echnical Guide for specific formulae for each of these statistics. Model Summary Output Once estimation of a model has been completed or you have p aused the estimation prior to completion (by selecting S top from the Model Menu or by clicking the S top button), a Model Summary Output file is generated for that model and a name such as 'Model1', 'Model1Paused' (if the model was Paused), or 'Model1Boot' (if a bootstrap option is used) is assigned by the program and appears in the Outline p ane. In addition, if one or more Output listings were requested prior to model estimation using the Output Tab, these listings are also generated and an exp and/contract icon (+/-) appears to the lef t of the Model name. Opening the exp and icon (+) by click - ing it, changes it s appearance to (-) and causes the names associated with these Output listings to appear beneath the model name. To view the Model Summary Output, click on the model name and the Content s pane lists the content s of this output. Similarly , the content s of any other Model Output file can be viewed by clicking on the desired Output Section name. At the top of the Model Summary Output information appears which describes the type of model estimated (for example, '2-Cluster Model'). The next line cont ains any warning messages, followed by general model summary information. Additional information follows in sections labeled Chi-squared S tatistics, Log-likeli - hood Statistics, Log-likelihood S tatistics, S tatistics, Covariate Classification S tatistics, and V ariable Detail. These are described further below . When the Boot strap L2option is used, the Chi-squared S tatistics sec - tion also cont ains the estimate for the associated boot strap p-value. When the conditional boot strap option is used, the Log-likelihood S tatistics section cont ains the associated result s. More specific information on the st a- tistics including det ailed formulae is provided in section 7 of Technical Guide. Possible warning/alert messages include the following: 108LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEEstimation W arnings! This message appears if either boundary solutions, identification problems or convergence problems have been encountered during the estimation of the model. See Iteration Det ail for more information on estimation warnings. Model Paused. This message occurs whenever you cause the model to Pause prior to completion of the estimation. The output files in this case should be viewed as preliminary in this case. (T o resume a paused model, you may simply right click on the model name of the p aused model and select Resume from the pop-up menu.). See S tep 10 in Chapter 5 for more information on p ausing and resuming model estimation. The specific content s of the Model Summary Output and other Model Output files depend upon the type of model estimated. In the remainder of this chapter we describe the various model output sep arately for each of the three modules - Cluster , DFactor and Regression. Cluster GENERALINFORMA TION The Cluster Module is used to estimate LC Cluster models cont aining 1 or more latent classes (clusters). When 2 or more clusters are included in a model, as a general rule, the clusters are ordered in the output according to their size from the largest to the smallest. Exceptions may occur when p arameter restrictions are applied. For example, when the Order Restricted Clusters option is used, Clusters are ordered according to the p arameter values. In addition to the Model Summary Output, additional specific model output file listings are generated following estimation of the model. The specific output sections that can be generated are those that appear as active in the Output Sections portion of the Output Tab. For Cluster models, these are the first 7 model Output Sections list - ed, plus the last one, Iteration Det ail (see Figure 6-3 below). Figure 6-3. Output T ab for Cluster Models 109CHAPTER6. MODELANDMODELSUMMARYOUTPUTPrior to estimating a Cluster model, click in the active check boxes to the lef t of the Output Sections to include or exclude that Section from being p art of the model output files that are generated following the model estima - tion. Adetailed description of each of the Model Summary Output as well as each specific Model Output Section file that can be output appears below . L C C L U S T E R M O D E L S U M M A R Y O U T P U T If you click in the Outline p ane on the name of any estimated Cluster model (e.g., 'Model1'), the Content s pane lists general summary information associated with this model including the type of model, any warning messages, the value of the Random Seed used in st arting sets that can be used to reproduce exactly the same run, and the value of the best seed that can be used to reproduce the reported model result s. See section 6.6 of Technical Guide for further det ails regarding the random seeds. If order-restricted models have been estimated, following the number of p arameters, the number of activated constraint s is provided. Specifically , the general section of the Model Summary Output cont ains the following items: Type of Model. For example, '3-Cluster Model' indicates that a 3-class Cluster model has been estimated. Warning messages (generally not present). Estimation W arning message(s) appear here to indicate that boundary solutions, identification or convergence problems were encountered during the estima - tion of the model. Model Paused (if you p aused the model). If you Paused the model prior to estimation being completed this message appears to alert you that the output files should be viewed as preliminary . Number of cases. This is the number of cases used in model estimation. This number may be less than the original number of cases on the dat a file if missing cases have been excluded. Advanced: Number of group s.In multilevel latent class models, the program report s the number of groups used in model estimation. Number of p arameters. This is the number of distinct p arameters estimated. Number of Activated Constraint s(appears only if order-restricted clusters were requested). This is the number of p arameters that needed to be restricted in order to obt ain ordered clusters plus the num - ber of error variances that were fixed to the smallest allowed value. This number plus the number of parameters estimated equals the tot al number of model p arameters in a model obt ained without the order-restriction. Random Seed. The seed required to reproduce this model. Best Start Seed. The single best seed that can reproduce this model more quickly using the number of starting sets =0. This is the seed that is automatically inserted in a saved definition (.lgf) file. Advanced: Design Effect. When the Survey option is used, the program report s the generalized design effect. 110LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEFigure 6-4. Model Summary Output for Cluster Model Chi-squared S tatistics This section list s various chi-square based st atistics related to model fit. If the scale type for one or more indicators in a model has been set to 'continuous', no chi-squared st atistics are available and this section is not displayed. The same applies when the multilevel option (Advanced) is used. The information reported: Degrees of freedom (df). The degrees of freedom for the current model. L-squared (L2). The likelihood-ratio goodness-of-fit value for the current model. If the boot strap p-value for the L2statistic has been requested, the result s will be displayed here. X-squared and Cressie-Read. These are alternatives to L2that should yield a similar p-value according to large sample theory if the model specified is valid and the dat a is not sp arse. BIC, AIC and CAIC (based on L2). In addition to model fit, these st atistics take into account the parsimony (df or Np ar) of the model. When comp aring models, the lower the BIC, AIC and CAIC value the better the model. 111CHAPTER6. MODELANDMODELSUMMARYOUTPUTDissimilarity Index. Adescriptive measure indicating how much the observed and estimated cell frequencies dif fer from one another . It indicates the proportion of the sample that needs to be moved to another cell to get a perfect fit. For more detailed information about Chi-squared statistics including the formulae for each, see section 7.1.1 of T echnical Guide. Log-likelihood S tatistics This section cont ains additional st atistics related to the model fit that are especially useful when L2and the other chi-squared st atistics are not available. The statistics reported are: Log-likelihood (LL). If the conditional boot strap (boot strap -2LL Diff) has been requested, the results will be displayed here. Log-prior - this is the term in the function maximized in the p arameter estimation that is associated with the Bayes const ants. This term equals 0 if all Bayes const ants are set to 0. Log-posterior - this is the function that is maximized in the p arameter estimation. The value of the log-posterior function is obt ained as the sum of the log-likelihood and log-prior values. BIC, AIC, AIC3 and CAIC (based on LL) - these st atistics (information criteria) weight fit and p arsi- mony by adjusting the LL to account for the number of p arameters in the model. The lower the value, the better the model. For example, according to the BIC values shown in Figure 6-4, the 3-class model is preferred over the 1-class, 2-class and 4-class models. Note: the same conclusions are obtained from information criteria based on LL or L2. The numbers dif fer only by a const ant that depends on the dat a set at hand. For more detailed information about Log-likelihood statistics including the formulae for each, see section 7.1.2 of T echnical Guide Classification S tatistics This information can be used to assess how well the model classifies cases into clusters. The statistics reported are: Classification Errors. When classification of cases is based on modal assignment (to the class having the highest membership probability), the proportion of cases that are estimated to be mis - classified is reported by this st atistic. The closer this value is to 0 the better . Reduction of Errors (lambda), Entropy R-squared and S tandard R-squared. These pseudo R-squared st atistics indicate how well one can predict class membership s based on the observed variables (indicators and covariates). The closer these values are to 1 the better the predictions. Classification log-likelihood. Log-likelihood value under the assumption that the true class mem - bership is known. AWE. Similar to BIC, but also t akes classification performance into account. Classification T able.The Classification abulates reported for CFactors and GCFactors. For GClasses, as for Clusters, Classification Errors, Reduction of Errors, Entropy R-squared, and S tandard R-squared values are reported. For more detailed information about the classification statistics including the formulae for each, see section 7.1.3 of T echnical Guide. Covariate Classification S tatistics If one or more active covariates are included in the model, additional st atistics are provided as above but these are now based only on the active covariates. The statistics reported are: The same information is obt ained for classification into GClasses based on group-level covariates - Classification errors, Reduction of Errors (lambda), Entropy R-squared and Standard R-squared For more detailed information about the classification statistics including the formulae for each, see section 7.1.3 of T echnical Guide. Variable Det ail This section cont ains details about the variables entered into the model including variable names, scale types, number of categories and category labels and scores (if used).P A R A M E T E R S O U T P U T ( O P T I O N A L ) For any estimated model, a Parameters file listing is generated by default. It cont ains estimates of p arameters in the Model for Indicators (bet as, sigmas), and in the Model for Clusters (gammas), as well as measures of sig - nificance for these estimates and the model R2for each indicator . The R2indicates how well an indicator is explained by the model. For ordinal, continuous , and counts, these are standard R2measures. For nominal variables, these are Goodman-Kruskal t au-b coef ficients, representing a weighted average of sep arate R2measures for each category treated as a sep arate dichotomous response variable. The R2is similar to the explained variance in analysis of variance and to item communalities in factor analysis. If CFactors have been included in the model, estimates and related information for additional p arameters (lambdas) are included in the Models for Indicators output. 113CHAPTER6. MODELANDMODELSUMMARYOUTPUTIf GClasses and/or GCFactors have been included in the model, estimates and related information for additional p arameters are included in the Models for Indicators and/or the Model for Clusters section of the Parameters output, and a sep arate section called Model for GClasses appears at the bottom of this out - put listing. Figure 6-5. Parameters Output for Cluster Models Betas.For Cluster models, the most import ant betas are that ones that indicate the strength of the effects of the clusters on the indicators. Other bet as are the indicator intercept s, the direct associations between categorical (Nominal/Ordinal) indicators, and direct ef fects of covariates on indicators. Gammas. Parameters of the multinomial logit model used to predict the clusters as a function of the covariates. Parameters include the intercept as well as the ef fects of each covariate. Sigmas.Error variances and covariances for continuous indicators. Viewing W ald Statistics and S tandard Errors By default, W ald statistics are provided in the output to assess the st atistical significance of a set of p arameter estimates. For example, for each indicator the W ald statistic test s the restriction that each estimate in the set of beta parameter estimates associated with that indicator equals zero. Anon-significant p-value associated with this Wald statistic means that the indicator does not discriminate between the clusters in a st atistically significant way. For variables specified as Nominal, the set includes p arameters for each category of the variable. To view standard errors or related st atistics associated with the p arameter estimates, simply right click on the Parameters Output in the Content s Pane to retrieve a pop-up menu, and select/deselect the items to appear in various columns of this output listing. Alternatively , you can select the desired items from the V iew Menu. By default, W ald statistics appear in Parameters Output. You can suppress these Wald statistics, or replace them with st andard errors, a Z S tatistic, or both st andard errors and the associated Z S tatistic. Parameters Output Subcategories Clicking on the + to the lef t of Parameters makes visible the Parameters Output Subcategories, which provide additional information regarding Parameters Output. The subcategories are Loadings and Error Correlations. 114LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDELoadings. The Loadings output cont ains the 2 columns labeled 'Clusters' and 'R2'. When only these 2 columns appear , the quantities reported under Clusters are simply correlations, representing the square root of the corresponding 'R2' or communality of the associated indicator . These numbers can be inter - preted as st andardized linear regression coef ficients. The R2is the same as reported in the Parameters Output. Additional columns appear immediately to the right of the 'Clusters' column when CFactors, GClasses and/or GCFactors are included in the model. The quantities reported in the columns to the lef t of the R2 represent the decomposition of the R2into correlation component s associated with each of these column effects. For further det ails, see section 12.2 of Technical Guide. Error Correlations (available only when one or more indicators are continuous)- The Error Correlations output provides the estimates of the within-cluster correlations between contin - uous indicators variables. Of ten, these correlations are easier to interpreted than covariances, which are the actual model p arameters. (Note that the of f diagonal entries are all 0 unless direct ef fects between continuous indicators have been included in the model) For more information, see section 7.2 in the T echnical Guide.P R O F I L E O U T P U T ( O P T I O N A L ) To view the profile t able for a selected model, click Profile in the Outline p ane. The Profile t able cont ains probabilities or means associated with each Indicator or Dependent variable. 115CHAPTER6. MODELANDMODELSUMMARYOUTPUTFigure 6-6. Profile Output for Cluster Model For a Cluster model, the first row of numbers shows how large each cluster is. For example, Figure 6-6 shows that Cluster 1 cont ains about 55% of respondent s ains the remaining 7% . The body of the t able contains (marginal) conditional probabilities that show how the clusters are related to the Nominal, Ordinal or Binomial Count indicator variables. These probabilities sum to 1 within each cluster (column). For example, Figure 6-6 shows that respondent s in Cluster 1 have a 92.94% chance of responding that surveys serve a 'good' purpose. For indicators specified as Continuous or Count, the body of the t able cont ains means (rates) instead of probabilities. For indicators specified as Ordinal, means are displayed in addition to the conditional probabilities. For covariates the Profile output cont ains rescaled ProbMeans output rather than model probabili - ties or means. These are aggregate class membership probabilities which are rescaled to sum to one within clusters. For Covariates specified as Numeric, means are displayed in addition to the conditional probabilities, and if the Covariate cont ains more than 5 distinct values, the probabilities are displayed for 5 grouped ranges. The number of such grouped ranges may be changed (increased or decreased) using Group s option in the Plot Control. The probabilities and means that appear in the Profile Output, are displayed graphically in the Profile Plot (see below for det ails). Viewing Standard Errors To view the associated st andard errors in a Profile t able, from the V iew Menu select S tandard Errors, or simply right click from within the Content s Pane to retrieve the pop-up menu and click S tandard Errors. Acolumn containing the st andard errors appears to the right of each estimate. S tandard Errors are not provided for Covariates. Partial Profile Latent GOLD report s not only marginal but also p artial probabilities/means for indicators in the Profile Table Output. These two dif fer only if direct ef fects between indicators or between a covariate and indicator are includ - ed in a model using the Residuals Tab (See S tep 7, Chapter 5). As explained in section 7.3 of the Technical Guide, partial probabilities/means are obt ained by conditioning on a cert ain value (mean) of the other variables involved in the model for the indicator concerned. Marginalprobabilities/means, on the other hand, are obt ained by collapsing over the categories of these \"other\" variables. Both have their advant ages: the Marginal Profile out- put is somewhat easier to interpret and is displayed by default. Partial Profile reflects somewhat better the strength of the ef fects of the cluster on the indicators. The distinction between Marginal and Partial is not relevant for Covariates. To change from displaying Marginal to Partial probabilities/means, from the V iew Menu select Partial, or right click from within the Content s Pane to retrieve the pop-up menu and click Partial. For more detailed information about the Profile Output, see section 7.3 of T echnical Guide. 116LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEP R O F I L E P L O T ( F O R I N D I C A T O R S A N D C O V A R I A T E S ) To view the Profile Plot, click the '+' icon to exp and the Profile output and highlight Prf-Plot. The Profile Plot is constructed from the conditional probabilities for the nominal variables and means for the other indicators and covariates as displayed in the columns of the Profile t able. Specific clusters (columns) are selected for display using the Plot Control pop-up menu. The quantities associated with the selected clusters are plotted and connect - ed to form a line graph. Figure 6-7. Profile Plot for Cluster Model For the scale types ordinal, continuous ,count, and numeric covariate , prior to plotting the class-specific means, they are re-scaled to always lie within the 0-1 range. Scaling of these \"0-1 Means\" is accomplished by subtracting the lowest observed value from the class-specific means and dividing the result s by the range, which is simply the dif ference between the highest and the lowest observed value. The advant age of such scaling is that these numbers can be depicted on the same scale as the class-specific probabilities for nominalvariables. For nominal variables cont aining more than 2 categories, all categories are displayed simult aneously. For dichotomous variables specified as nominal, by default only the last category is displayed. The Plot Control (see Figure 6-8 below) can be used to display the first or both categories, as well as to specify the columns (Clusters), variables, and selected categories to appear in the display . Aseparate line is displayed for each cluster . Click on any variable symbol in the Profile Plot and the st atus bar describes it (variable name, clus - ter number , value). When 0-1 means are displayed, the st atus bar displays values for both the 0-1 mean and the original mean as shown in the Profile output.

MODELANDMODELSUMMARYOUTPUTWhen the content s of the Profile Table is changed from the default view to display Partial (instead of Marginal) probabilities, the point s plotted change to reflect the current content s of the Profile Table. By default, only the first 8 variables are displayed in the profile plot. Additional variables may be selected from the Plot Control (using a control-click or a shif t click to select more than one at a time) and added or removed from the plot with a single click in the box to the lef t of the variable names. To Change Settings for a Profile Plot To change the settings for a Profile Plot, from the V iew Menu select Plot Control, or right click within the Content s pane when a Profile Plot is displayed to open the Plot Control dialog box. To change the font type/size for a plot, see Chapter 2. Figure 6-8: Plot Control for Profile Plot s The following plot settings are available for Profile Plot s: Legend. When this option is selected, a legend appears at the bottom of the Profile Plot. Clusters. For Cluster models, a line will be drawn for each cluster selected. Those clusters with a checkmark in the checkbox are included in the plot. Variables. Select which variables to include in the plot. Those with a checkmark in the checkbox are included in the plot. Categories. For Nominal Indicators and Nominal Covariates, select which category of a variable to include in the plot. The category currently being plotted is listed in the plot beneath the variable name. To change the category that is plotted, highlight the variable name in the V ariables box (the category currently being plotted will appear in the Category box), click the drop-down list to the right of the Categories box and select the category you wish to have plotted. Groups:Select a variable for which range group s appear in the Profile Output, and the number of such 118LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEgroups appears in the Group s Box. Replace this number with a value less than the tot al number of categories/ values for this variable and click Update. Cert ain adjacent categories will automatically be combined and the range group s for the selected variable change to the new number of group s in the Profile output and Profile Plot. Entering the value '0' causes each level to appear as a distinct value. The group option may be used with nominal/ordinal indicators and nominal/numeric covariates. Note:Avalue of '1' appears in the Group s box for Continuous and Count Indicators when the Plot Control is opened from within the Profile Plot. This indicates that only one value is included in the Profile Output (the mean) and hence entering a dif ferent value in the Group s box will not alter the Output for such variables.G P R O F I L E O U T P U T ( A D V A N C E D , O P T I O N A L ) If GClasses and/or GCFactors are included in a model, this output file listing is generated. Similar to the Profile output, the top of this file cont ains the size of each GClass, followed by the probability of being in each cluster for each GClass. This section is followed by the Indicators section where means and (marginal) probabilities asso - ciated with each indicator are provided.

MODELANDMODELSUMMARYOUTPUT120LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDE The first row of the t able contains the overall probability of being in a cluster (the size of each clus - ter), also reported in the first row of numbers in the Profile t able. The body of the t able contains conditional probabilities associated with each category of Nominal and Ordinal indicator variables (these probabilities sum to 100% across rows). For example, in Figure 6-9, for those respondent s who responded that surveys serve a 'good' purpose, about 67% are classified as belonging in Cluster 1, 27% in Cluster 2, 04% in Cluster 3, and the remaining 2% in Cluster 4. At the bottom of the ProbMeans output, similar information is presented for each covariate. For any Indicator with scale type Continuous or Count, or for any numeric covariate, if more than 5 distinct values exist s, the probabilities are displayed for 5 grouped ranges. The number of such grouped ranges may be changed (increased or decreased) using the Plot Control. When the CFactor option is used, N I \u0003 P L O T For a Cluster model, the membership probabilities in the body of the ProbMeans output are plotted to form a Uni- Plot.

DFactor models cont ain 1 or more discrete factors (DFactors), each of which may cont ain 2 or more ordered levels (ordered latent classes). A1-DFactor model cont aining K>2 levels dif fers from an order-restricted LC Cluster analysis with K ordered clusters in that the levels of a DFactor are assumed to be equally sp aced. For further det ails see sections 3.7 and 4 of Technical Guide. When 2 or more DFactors are included in a model, DFactors are ordered according to the R-squared (indicating how well the model predict s the DFactor score). By default, the DFactor having the highest R-squared is listed first (DFactor 1). The levels of the DFactors are ordered such that the lowest level always cont ains at least as many cases as the highest level. Note: The ordering of DFactors may not be according to the st andard R2(reliability) if any of the user options in the Model Tab are applied to increase the number of DFactor levels or restrict effects within one or more classes to zero. In addition to the Model Summary Output file, additional model output files are generated following estimation of the model. The specific output sections that are available are those that appear as active in the Output Sections portion of the Output Tab. For DFactor models, these are the first 7 model output files listed, plus the last file (Iteration Det ail). Figure 6-17. Output T ab for DFactor Models 127CHAPTER6.

Viewing W ald Statistics and S tandard Errors By default, W ald statistics are provided in the output to assess the st atistical significance of a set of p arameter estimates. For example, for each indicator the W ald statistic test s the restriction that each estimate in the set of beta parameter estimates associated with that indicator equals zero. Anon-significant p-value associated with this Wald statistic means that the indicator does not discriminate between the clusters in a st atistically significant way. For variables specified as Nominal, the set includes p arameters for each category of the variable. To view standard errors or related st atistics associated with the p arameter estimates, simply right click on the parameters output and select/deselect the items that you want to appear . Alternatively , you can click on the appropriate item in the V iew Menu. In Parameters, you can suppress the W ald statistics, or replace the W ald with st andard errors, a Z S tatistic, or both st andard errors and the associated Z Statistic for each p arameter estimate. 132LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEParameters Output Subcategories Clicking on the + to the lef t of Parameters makes visible the Parameters Output Subcategories, which provide additional information regarding Parameters Output. The subcategories are Loadings, Correlations, and Error Correlations. Loadings. DFactor loadings for the indicators are given in sep arate columns for each DFactor , labeled 'DFactor1', DFactor2', ... followed by a column labeled 'R2' representing the communality of the indicator. The quantities reported in the DFactor columns are comp arable to loadings (st andardized regression coef ficients) in traditional linear factor analysis. The R2is the same as reported in the Parameters Output. Additional columns appear immediately to the right of the 'DFactors' columns when CFactors, GClasses and/or GCFactors are included in the model. The quantities reported in the columns to the left of the R2represent the decomposition of the R2 into component s associated with each of these column ef fects. For further det ails, see the Technical Guide. Correlations. These are the correlation between the DFactors and the correlation between DFactors and indicators. Correlations between the DFactors are equal to 0 when neither DFactor associations nor Covariates are included in the model, In this case (and only in this case) DFactor-Indicator Correlations will be identical to the corresponding Loadings. Error Correlations (available only when one or more indicators are continuous) - The Error Correlations output provides the estimates of the within-class correlations between continuous indica - tors variables. Of ten, these correlations are easier to interpreted than covariances, which are the actual model p arameters. (Note that the of f diagonal entries are all 0 unless direct ef fects between continuous indicators have been included in the model) For more detailed information about the Parameters Output, see section 7.2 of T echnical Guide.P R O F I L E O U T P U T ( O P T I O N A L ) To view the profile t able for a selected model, click Profile in the Outline p ane. The Profile t able contains condi - tional response probabilities and/or means associated with each Indicator . Means are computed based on the category scores, using the conditional probabilities as weight s. For Covariates the Profile t able report s aggregated classification probabilities which are rescaled to sum to 1 within DFactor levels. 133CHAPTER6. MODELANDMODELSUMMARYOUTPUTFigure 6-20. Profile Output for DFactor Model By default, columns of the Profile t able display information sep arately for each level of each DFactor At the top of this output t able, the size of each level of each DFactor is indicated (for each DFactor these numbers sum to 100%). For example, regarding DFactor #1, 70% are in level 1, the remain - ing 30% in level 2 of this DFactor . The body of the t able contains (marginal) conditional probabilities that show how the DFactor levels are related to the indicator variables and covariates. W ithin each level, these probabilities sum to 1. For ordinal indicators and numeric covariates, cluster-specific means are also reported beneath the probabilities. For indicators specified as Continuous or Count, the body of the t able contains means instead of probabilities. Optionally , when 2 or more DFactors are included in a model, the columns may be changed to cor - respond to joint levels of the DFactors (see the section on Joint Profile below). The joint view makes clear that the DFactor model is an LC Cluster model. For example, Figure 6-21 below shows the 4 clusters corresponding to the joint Output for DFactor Model The View Menu options (which can be obt ained by a right click on the Profile output), can be used to obt ain the Joint Profile Output, to switch between Marginal and Partial Profile Output, or to obt ain standard errors. Partial Profile Latent GOLD 4.0 report s not only marginal but also p artial probabilities/means for indicators in the Profile Table Output. These two dif fer in models with more than a single DFactor or if local dependencies or ef fects of covari - ates on indicators are included using the Residuals Tab. As explained in section 7.3 of the Technical Guide, p ar- tial probabilities/means are obt ained by conditioning on a cert ain value (mean) of the other variables involved in the model for the indicator concerned. The marginal probabilities/means, on the other hand, are obt ained by collapsing over the categories of these \"other\" variables. Both have their specific advant ages: the Marginal Profile output is somewhat easier to interpret and is displayed by default. Partial Profile reflect s somewhat better the strength of the ef fects of the cluster variable on the indicators. 135CHAPTER6. MODELANDMODELSUMMARYOUTPUTJoint Profile AJoint Profile amounts to treating each DFactor combination as a cluster . For example, with 3 DFactors having 2 levels each, we have 2x2x2 = 8 represented (2,1,2), (2,2,1), and (2,2,2). The Joint Profile corresponds to the actual model probabilities if no direct ef fects are included in the model. Joint Profile probabilities can be Partial of Marginal (the default). As in Cluster , these only dif fer if direct ef fects are included in a model (direct ef fects are added to a model using the Residuals Tab - see Chapter 5 - Residuals Tab).P R O F I L E P L O T ( F O R I N D I C A T O R S A N D C O V A R I A T E S ) To view the Profile Plot, click the '+' icon to exp and the Profile output and highlight Prf-Plot. The Profile Plot is constructed from the conditional probabilities for the nominal variables and from the means for the other indica - tors and covariates as displayed in the columns of the Profile t able. Specific columns (DFactor levels) are selected for display using the Plot Control pop-up menu. The quantities associated with the selected columns are plotted and connected to form a line graph. Figure 6-22. Profile Plot for DFactor Model For the scale types ordinal, continuous , count, and numeric covariate, prior to plotting the class-specific means, they are re-scaled to always lie within the 0-1 range. Scaling of these \"0-1 Means\" is accomplished by subtracting the lowest observed value from the DFactor-level-specific means and dividing the result s by the range, which is simply the dif ference between the highest and the lowest observed value. The advant age of such scaling is that these numbers can be depicted on the same scale as the corresponding probabilities for nominal variables.

For example, in Figure 6-29 above, for cases in the first row , their scores on Dfactor1 and DFactor2 are .0183 and each DFactor (Modal1, Modal2) -- that DFactor level corresponding to the modal probability (the one that is most likely). the posterior membership probabilities corresponding to each level of each DFactor . For example, with a dichotomous DFactors, the posterior probabilities for level 2 (labeled 'DFactor1_2' and 'DFactor2_2' in Figure 6-29) are equal to the (mean) score of the corresponding DFactor . If 1 or more CFactors have been included in the model, the associated CFactor scores ('Cfac1','Cfac2','Cfac3'), appear in the right-most portion of the st andard classification output.

If the boot strap p-value for the L2statistic has been requested, the result s will be displayed here. X-squared and Cressie-Read. These are alternatives to L2that should yield a similar p-value accord - ing to large sample theory if the model specified is valid and the dat a is not sp arse. BIC, AIC and CAIC (based on L2). In addition to model fit, these st atistics take into account the parsimony (df or Np ar) of the model. When comp aring models, the lower the BIC, AIC and CAIC value the better the model. Dissimilarity Index. Adescriptive measure indicating how much the observed and estimated cell frequencies dif fer from one another . It indicates the proportion of the sample that needs to be moved to another cell to get a perfect fit. For more detailed information about Chi-squared statistics including the formulae for each, see section 7.1.1 of T echnical Guide. Log-likelihood S tatistics This section cont ains additional st atistics related to the model fit that are especially useful when L2and the other chi-squared st atistics are not available. The statistics reported are: Log-likelihood (LL). If the conditional boot strap (boot strap -2LL Diff) has been requested, the result s will be dis - played here. Log-prior -- this is the term in the function maximized in the p arameter estimation that is associated with the Bayes constants. This term equals 0 if all Bayes const ants are set to 0. Log-posterior - this is the function that is maximized in the p arameter estimation. The value of the log-posterior function is obt ained as the sum of the log-likelihood and log-prior values. BIC, AIC, AIC3 and CAIC (based on LL) - these st atistics (information criteria) weight fit and p arsimony by adjust - ing the LL to account for the number of p arameters in the model. The lower the value, the better the model. For example, according to the BIC values shown in Figure 6-31, the 3-class model is preferred over the 1-class, 2- class and 4-class models. For more detailed information about Log-likelihood statistics including the formulae for each, see section 7.1.2 of T echnical Guide. 149CHAPTER6. MODELANDMODELSUMMARYOUTPUTClassification S tatistics This information can be used to assess how well the model classifies cases into clusters. The statistics reported are: Classification Errors. When classification of cases is based on modal assignment (to the class having the highest membership probability), the proportion of cases that are expected to be misclassified is reported by this st atistic. The closer this value is to 0 the better . Reduction of Errors (lambda), Entropy R-squared and S tandard R-squared. These statistics indi - cate how well the model predict s class membership s or DFactor scores. The closer these values are to 1 the better the predictions. Classification log-likelihood. Log-likelihood value under the assumption that the true class member - ship is known. AWE.Similar to BIC, but also t akes classification performance into account. Classification T able.The Classification Table cross-t abulates modal and probabilistic class assignment s. Standard R-squared is reported for CFactors and GCFactors. For GClasses, as for Clusters, Classification Errors, Reduction of Errors, Entropy R-squared, and S tandard R-squared values are reported. Covariate Classification S tatistics If one or more active covariates is included in the model, additional st atistics are provided as above but these are now based only on the active covariates. The statistics reported are: Classification errors, Reduction of Errors (lambda), Entropy R-squared and S tandard R- squared Standard R-squared is reported for CFactors and GCFactors. For GClasses, as for Clusters, Classification Errors, Reduction of Errors, Entropy R-squared, and S tandard R-squared values are reported. For more detailed information about the classification statistics including the formulae for each, see section 7.1.3 of T echnical Guide. Prediction S tatistics The prediction st atistics are based on the comp arison between observed and predicted responses. 150LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEFigure 6-32. Prediction S tatistics This information can be used to assess prediction performance of the model. It is also possible to output predict - ed values for the dependent variable to an external file ( For more information on this option, see the section on the ClassPred T ab in Step 9 of Chapter 5. ) Prediction S tatistics, contains the following measures of Prediction error: mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), minus mean log-likelihood (-MLL), and for ordinal/nominal dependent variables, the proportion of predictions errors under modal prediction (PPE). For each error measure, we provide the prediction error of the baseline, or intercept-only model, the prediction error of the estimated model, and a R2value, which is the proportional reduction of errors in the estimated model comp ared to the baseline model. For nominal and ordinal dependent variables, a prediction t able that cross-classifies observed and against estimated values is also provided. For more technical information on Prediction S tatistics, see section 7.1.4 in the T echnical Guide.

In addition, the right-most columns cont ain means and st andard deviations for the regression coefficients. In the case of a 1-class model, the mean is identical to the corresponding coef ficient and the st an- dard deviation is 0 which indicates that this is a fixed ef fect. For K>1 class models and unequal coef ficients across classes, these are the means and the st andard deviations for the (discrete) random ef fects. The size of the standard deviation indicates the extent of the between-class variation in the coef ficient concerned. 151CHAPTER6. MODELANDMODELSUMMARYOUTPUTFigure 6-33. Parameters Output for Regression Model Betas.For Regression models, in addition to the class-specific regression intercept, bet as indicate the class-specific ef fect of each predictor on the dependent variable. Gammas. Parameters of the multinomial logit model used to predict the latent distribution as a function of the covariates. Parameters include the intercept as well as the ef fects of each covariate on the latent variable(s). Sigmas.Error variances for a continuous dependent variable. The Parameters output report s class-specific R2values and the overall R2value. These are reduction of error measures based on mean squared error . The overall R2 indicates how well the dependent variable is overall pre - dicted by the model (same measure as appearing in Prediction S tatistics). For ordinal, continuous, and (binomi - al) counts, these are st andard R2measures. For nominal dependent variables, these can be seen as weighted averages of sep arate R2measures for each category treated as a sep arate dichotomous response variable. For specific formulae for the overall and class-specific R2, see section 7.2 of Technical Guide. If CFactors have been included in the model, estimates and related information for additional p arameters (lambdas) are included in the Model for Dependent output. If GClasses and/or GCFactors have been included in the model, estimates and related information for additional p arameters are included in the Model for Dependent and/or the Model for Classes output, and a separate section called Model for GClasses appears at the bottom of the listing. 152LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEViewing W ald Statistics and S tandard Errors By default, W ald statistics are provided in the output to assess the st atistical significance of the set of p arameter estimates associated with a given variable. S pecifically , for each variable, the W ald statistic test s the restriction that each of the p arameter estimates in that set equals zero (for variables specified as Nominal, the set includes parameters for each category of the variable). For Regression models, by default, two W ald statistics (W ald, Wald(=)) are provided in the t able when more than 1 class has been estimated. For each set of p arameter esti - mates, the W ald(=) statistic considers the subset associated with each class and test s the restriction that each parameter in that subset equals the corresponding p arameter in the subset s associated with each of the other classes. That is, the W ald(=) statistic test s the equality of each set of regression ef fects across classes. To view standard errors or related st atistics associated with p arameter estimates, simply right click on the parameters output and select/deselect the items that you want to appear . Alternatively , you can click on the appropriate item in the V iew Menu. In Parameters, you can alter the output view to obt ain stan- dard errors, a Z S tatistic, and can suppress the W ald statistics.

The Profile t able contains proba - bilities or means associated with the Dependent variable and covariates. 153CHAPTER6. MODELANDMODELSUMMARYOUTPUTFigure 6-34. Profile Output for Regression Model For a Regression model, the first row of numbers shows how large each class is. The body of the table contains the (marginal) conditional probabilities that show how the classes are related to the dependent variable, specified as Nominal, Ordinal or Binomial Count. The probabilities within each class (column) sum to 1. For dependent variables specified as Ordinal and Continuous, the body of the table contains means, and for Count s these are rates. For covariates the Profile output cont ains rescaled ProbMeans output rather than model probabili - ties or means. These are aggregate class membership probabilities which are rescaled to sum to one within clusters. For Covariates specified as Numeric, means are displayed in addition to the conditional probabilities, and if the Covariate cont ains more than 5 distinct values, the probabilities are displayed for 5 grouped ranges. The number of such grouped ranges may be changed (increased or decreased) using Group s option in the Plot Control. Viewing Standard Errors To view the associated st andard errors in a Profile t able, simply right click on the p arameters output to retrieve the pop-up menu and click S tandard Errors. Column cont aining the st andard errors appear to the right of each estimate. Partial Profile Latent GOLD 4.0 report s not only marginal but also p artial probabilities/means for the dependent variable in the Profile Table Output. These two dif fer if predictors have been included in the model. As explained in section 7.3 of the Technical Guide, p artial probabilities/means are obt ained by conditioning on a cert ain value (mean) of the 154LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEpredictors. The marginal probabilities/means, on the other hand, are obt ained by aggregating over the categories of these predictors. Both have their specific advant ages: the Marginal Profile output is somewhat easier to inter - pret and is displayed by default. By a right click on the Profile output, you can retrieve a pop-up menu that can be used to switch between Partial to Marginal and to obt ain standard errors. (The p artial/marginal switch has no ef fect on covariate information).P R O F I L E P L O T ( F O R D E P E N D E N T A N D C O V A R I A T E S ) To view the Profile Plot, click the '+' icon to exp and the Profile output and highlight Prf-Plot. The Profile Plot is constructed from the conditional probabilities for the nominal variables and means for the other indicators and covariates as displayed in the columns of the Profile Table. Specific classes (columns) are selected for display using the Plot Control pop-up menu. The quantities associated with the selected clusters are plotted and connect - ed to form a line graph. For the scale types ordinal, continuous, count, and numeric covariate, prior to plotting the class-specific means, they are re-scaled to always lie within the 0-1 range. Scaling of these \"0-1 Means\" is accomplished by subtract - ing the lowest observed value from the class-specific means and dividing the result s by the range, which is sim - ply the dif ference between the highest and the lowest observed value. The advant age of such scaling is that these numbers can be depicted on the same scale as the class-specific probabilities for nominal variables. For nominal variables cont aining more than 2 categories, all categories are displayed simult aneously. For dichoto - mous variables specified as nominal, by default only the last category is displayed. The Plot Control can be used to display the first or both categories, as well as to specify the columns, variables, and selected categories to appear in the display . When the content s of the Profile Table is changed from the default view to display Partial (instead of Marginal) probabilities, the point s plotted change to reflect the current content s of the Profile Table.

One criteria for determining the number of clusters is to look in the 'p-value' column which provides the p-value /triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt 170LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEfor each model under the assumption that the L\u00b2 st atistic follows a chi-square distribution. Generally , among mod - els for which the p-value is greater than 0.05 (provides an adequate fit), the one that is most p arsimonious (fewest number of p arameters -- Np ar) would be selected. Using this criteria, the best model is given by Model 3, the 3- cluster model (p-value of 0.1 1, and Np ar = 20).

Hence, the earlier estimate of the p-value based on the chi-squared approach (p = .1 1) appears to be somewhat underst ated. Note. Since the boot strap p-value is estimated from the generated random sample of size 500, the results you may get for the estimated p-value will be somewhat dif ferent because your ran - dom sample will be dif ferent (unless you utilize the specific Boot strap Seed reported above as a Technical option prior to requesting the boot strap).

Ef fect coding means that for each indicator the estimates sum to zero over the categories of that indicator (columns). Since ef fect coding is also used for the clusters, the ef fect estimates also sum to zero across the clusters (rows). To utilize dummy coding instead of ef fect coding, the Nominal Coding option would be changed in the Output Tab prior to estimating the models. Figure 7-12. Parameters Output and V iew Menu Customization Options For each indicator , the p-value is shown to be less than .05, indicating that the null hypothesis st ating that all of the effects associated with that indicator are zero would be rejected. Thus, for each indicator , knowledge of the response for that indicator contributes in a significant way towards the ability to discriminate between the clus - ters. The R\u00b2 values are in the right-most column of the t able indicating how much of the variance of each indicator is explained by this 3-cluster model.

Under the column labeled 'modal', they have the value 1 to indicate this classification. The classification information can be appended to your dat a file by selecting S tandard Classification on the ClassPred Tab: Requesting Output of S tandard Classification Information to a Dat a File Notice that when cases are classified into clusters using the modal assignment rule, a cert ain amount of misclas - sification error is present. The expected misclassification error can be computed by cross-classifying the modal classes by the actual probabilistic classes. This is done in the Classification Table, shown in the Content s Pane in Figure 7-10 for the 3-class model. For this model, the modal assignment rule would be expected to classify correctly 704.1204 cases from the true cluster 1, 163.7828 from cluster 2 and 176.2427 from cluster 3 for an expected tot al of 1,044.146 correct classifications of the 1,202 cases. This represent s an expected misclassifica - tion rate of 13.13% (1- 1,044.146/1,202). Notice also that the expected sizes of the clusters are not reproduced by modal assignment classification. The Classification Table in Figure 7-10 shows that 67.0% of the tot al cases (805 of the 1,202) are assigned to cluster 1 compared to 61.7% expected to be in this cluster .B I V A R I A T E R E S I D U A L S In addition to various global measures of model fit, local measures called bivariate residuals (BVR) are also available to assess the extent to which the 2-way association(s) between any p air of indicators are explained by the model. 179CHAPTER7. TUTORIALSFigure 7-21. Bivariate Residuals Output for the 3-cluster Model The BVR corresponds to a Pearson chi-squared divided by the degrees of freedom. The chi-square is comput - ed on the observed count s in a 2-way t able using the estimated expected count s obtained from the estimated model, If the model were true, BVRs should not be subst antially larger than 1. The BVR of 2.4 in Figure 7-21 above suggest s that the 3-cluster model may fall somewhat short in reproducing the association between COOP - ERATE and UNDERST AND. In contrast, the BVRs associated with 4-cluster model (shown below) are all less than 1. This suggest s that the 4-cluster model may provide a significant improvement over the 3-cluster model in model fit. Figure 7-22.

However , this test is not valid when the restriction involves setting the probability of a class membership to zero (e.g., the 3-class model can be formed by restricting the size of the 4th cluster to be zero). However , in such cases, a conditional boot strap must be used to assess the significance of the dif fer- ence in the L2statistics associated with the 3 and 4-class models. The conditional boot strap implemented in Latent GOLD 4.0 is based on the log-likelihood (LL) rather than the L2 statistic and hence can be used much more generally to comp are restricted (i.e., nested) models, even in situa - tions when chi-square st atistics are not available. The reduction in L2can be expressed exactly in terms of twice the increase in LL associated with the increase in number of classes from 3 to 4. L2(3-class) - L2(4-class) = -2LL(3-class) - - 2LL(4-class).

DFactor Analysis vs. Traditional Factor Analysis In traditional factor analysis (F A), continuous observed variables are expressed as a linear function of 1 or more continuous latent factors (CFactors). DFactor analysis dif fer from F Ain several respect s: The observed variables may be of mixed scale types including nominal, ordinal, continuous and count. The latent variables are not continuous but discrete, cont aining 2 or more ordered categories (levels) The model is not linear Solutions need not be rot ated to be interpret able (the indeterminacy issue of 'rot ation' is unique to CFactors in a linear model). In addition, a cross-t abulation of DFactors defines a set of clusters. For example, 2 dichotomous DFactors V and W, yields 4 latent classes (4 clusters). 184LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEFigure 7-26.

To test whether such restrictions are justified, we can test to see whether the increase in L2of 6.3875 (from 7.8978 to 14.2853) is st atistically significant. W e will test this in 2 ways.

Using the modal assignment rule, these cases would be classified into level 1 of DFactor1 ('Modal1 = 1) and level 1 of DFactor2 ('Modal2 = 1). DFactor scores are also provided. Assigning 0 to the first level of the DFactor , and 1 to the last, the mean score can be computed, using the corresponding posterior probabilities as weight s. Thus, for cases in the first row , their scores on DFactor1 and DFactor2 are .0183 and .0763 respectively , which correspond to the posterior probabil - ity of being in level 2 of each DFactor .

You will learn how to: Select the dependent variable and specify it s scale type Distinguish predictors from covariates Impose restrictions on the predictor effect s Specify covariates as active or inactive Determine the number of latent classes (i.e., segment s) Examine R2and various other information related to model prediction In addition, this example illustrates several advanced options in the LC Regression Module. You will learn how to: Use the optional case ID variable to specify repeated observations Explore the Profile and ProbMeans output Use demographic variables as covariates to predict segment membership Obtain predictions based solely on the covariates Classify cases into latent segment s The Data The data for this example are obt ained from a hypothetical conjoint marketing study involving repeated meas - ures where respondent s were asked to provide likelihood of purchase ratings under each of several dif ferent sce - narios. Apartial listing of the dat a is shown in Figure 7-55. Figure 7-55: Partial Listing of Conjoint Dat a 202LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEAs suggested in Figure 7-55, there are 8 records for each case (there are 400 cases in tot al); one record for each cell in this 2x2x2 complete factorial design of dif ferent scenarios for the purchase of a product: \u00b7FASHION (1 = Traditional; 2 = Modern) \u00b7QUALITY (1 = Low; 2 = High) \u00b7PRICE (1 = Lower; 2 = Higher) The dependent variable (RA TING) is a rating of purchase intent on a five-point scale. The three attributes listed above will be used as predictor variables in the model. We will also include the two demographic variables as covariates, in a second model. \u00b7SEX (1 = Male; 2 = Female) \u00b7AGE (1 = 16-24; 2 = 25-39; 3 = 40+). The Goal Use Latent GOLD to identify latent segment s differing with respect to the estimate of import ance attached to each of the three attributes, which influence an individual's purchase decision. The LC regression model allows for the fact that these estimates may dif fer for different segment s. That is, for one segment, price and only price may influence the decision, while a second segment may be influenced by quality and modern appearance, but is price insensitive. W e will treat RA TING as an ordinal dependent variable and comp are several models to determine the number of segment s. We will then show how to describe the demographic dif ferences between these seg - ments and to classify each respondent into that segment which is most likely .

Select RATING in the Variables List and click Dependent to move the variable to the Dependent box. We also need to indicate the dependent variable scale type. For this example, we will use the default scale type (Ordinal-Fixed) which t akes into account the natural ordering between the 5 levels of purchase intent. By default, the fixed scores on the dat a file (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) are used which order the levels and est ablish equal dist ance between adjacent levels. As explained above, the dat a contains repeated observations for each respondent (case). Therefore, we need to indicate which records belong to each case. This is accomplished using a Case ID variable, which cont ains a unique identification number for each case. All records belonging to the same case are assigned the same unique ID. Select ID in the Variables list and click Case ID to move the variable into the Case ID box. Next, we will select the Predictors. Predictors are used as independent variables in the regression model. In the current example, we use the product attributes F ASHION, QUALITY and PRICE as predictors.

A1-class model estimates only a single regression model. It makes the st andard homogeneity assumption that a single regres - sion model holds true for all cases. In the current example, we will st art by estimating a 1-class model and obt ain a log-likelihood st atistic to be used as a base. W e will then estimate additional models, which successively incre - ment the number of classes by 1 and assess the significance of each additional class. One assessment consist s of a check of whether the change in the log-likelihood for each p air of successive mod - els fails to decrease by a significant amount as determined by the BIC st atistic.

Figure 7-60: Summary of Models Estimated /triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt 207CHAPTER7. TUTORIALSThis output report s statistics that will assist you in determining the correct number of classes -- the log-likelihood (LL) values, the BIC values, and the number of p arameters in the estimated models. It is import ant to determine the right number of classes because specifying too few ignores class dif ferences, while specifying too many may cause the model to be unst able. While the log-likelihood increases each time the number of classes is increased, the minimum BIC value occurs for Model3, suggesting that the 3-class solution is the best of the four estimated models. The R2increases from .37 for the 1-class model to .61 for the 3-class regression. Note 1:Occasionally , you might obt ain a local (suboptimal) solution. For these dat a, it is possible to obtain a local solution for the 4-class model, obt aining LL = -4080.318 instead of - 4075.922. If this occurs, click Estimate to re-estimate the 4-class model (see section 6.6 in the Technical Guide for a discussion of preventing local solutions). Note 2:Notice that the p-values based on the model L2and reported degrees of freedom (df) are 1.0 under each model. These are not valid assessment s of fit because we are dealing with sparse data. We will now examine the det ailed output for the 3-class solution.P R O F I L E O U T P U T Rename Model3 to \"3-class\" by clicking on its name. Click the + icon next to '3-class' in the Outline pane to expand the listing of output for this model. Click Profile. The Profile output cont ains information on the class sizes, the class-specific (marginal) probabilities and means of the dependent variable (see Figure 7-61). Figure 7-61: Profile Output for 3-Class Model /triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt/triangleopenrt 208LATENT GOLD\u00ae4.0 USER'SGUIDEThe classes are always ordered from high to low according to their size. It can be seen from the first row of the table that segment 1 cont ains about 50% of the subject s (.4986), segment 2 cont ains about 25% and segment 3 contains the remaining 25%. Examination of class-specific probabilities shows that overall, segment 1 is least likely to buy (only 27.56% are Very Unlikely to buy) and segment 3 is most likely (28.08% are V ery Likely to buy). Later in this tutorial, we will show how to classify each case into the most appropriate segment.P A R A M E T E R S O U T P U T Next, we will view the Parameters output (see Figure 7-62). For the '3-class' model, click Parameters. Figure 7-62: Parameters Output for 3-Class Model The beta parameter for each predictor is a measure of the influence of that predictor on RA TING. The beta effect estimates under the column labeled Class 1 suggest that segment 1 is influenced in a positive way by product s for which F ASHION = Modern (bet a = 1.9348) and PRICE = Higher (bet a = 1.0178), but not by QUALITY (beta is approximately 0). W e also see that segment 2 is influenced by all 3 attributes, having a preference for those product choices that are modern (bet a = 1.1698), high quality (bet a = .9216) and higher priced (bet a = 1.0498). Members of segment 3 prefer high quality (bet a = 2.0628) and the higher priced (bet a = .9224) product choices, but are not influenced by F ASHION. Note that PRICE has more or less the same influence on all three segment s. The Wald (=) statistic indicates that the differences in these bet a effects across classes are not significant (the p-value = .67 which is much higher than .05, the st andard level for assessing st atistical significance). This means that all 3 segment s exhibit price sensitivity to the same degree. This is confirmed when we estimate a model in which this ef fect is specified to be class-independent (see next section). The p-value for the W ald statistic for PRICE is 2.4x10-106 indicating that the amount of price sensitivity is highly significant. With respect to the ef fect of the other two attributes we find large between-segment dif ferences. The predictor FASHION has a strong influence on segment 1, a less strong ef fect on segment 2, and virtually no ef fect on seg - /triangleopenrt 209CHAPTER7. TUTORIALSment 3. QUALITY has a strong ef fect on segment 3, a less strong ef fect on segment 2, and virtually no ef fect on segment 1. The fact that the influence of F ASHION and QUALITY differs significantly between the 3 segment s is confirmed by the significant p-values associated with the W ald(=) statistics for these attributes. For example, for FASHION, the p-value = 6.2x10-36. In summary , segment 1 could be labeled the \"Fashion-Oriented Segment\", segment 3 the \"Quality-Oriented Segment\", and segment 2 is the segment that t akes into account all 3 attributes in their purchase decision. To test each individual class-specific bet a for statistical significance we can append st andard errors, Z-st atistics, or both to the output. Right click on the output in the Content s Pane and choose Z S tatistic: The Wald statistics are replaced by the Z-st atistics for the bet as. Notice that the absolute values of the z-score associated with QUALITY for class 1 and with F ASHION for class 3 fall under 2, and hence are not significant at the .05 level. Figure 7-63: Parameters Output with Z-values Restricting Cert ain Effects to be Zero or Class Independent In the Parameters output above we saw that the bet a estimates associated with PRICE are approximately equal for all 3 classes.

W e also showed that 2 of the bet as were not significantly dif ferent from 0. We will now show how to obt ain a more p arsimonious model by imposing zero restrictions on the 2 bet as and by restricting the bet as associated with PRICE to be equal across segment s.

The gamma p arameters of the model for the latent distribution appear at the bottom of the Parameters output in Figure 7-69 under the heading 'Model for Classes'. The p-values associated with the W ald statistic shows that overall, both ef fects are significant. The betas associated with SEX = Female (0.5423, -0.6943, 0.1520) suggest that females are more likely than males of belonging to the \"Fashion-Oriented Segment (segment 1), and much less likely to belong to segment 2. The AGE effects show that the youngest age group is more likely than other respondent s to be in the \"Fashion-Oriented Segment\" while the oldest age group is more likely to be in the \"Quality-Oriented Segment\".

(For information on how to append classification scores to you original dat a file, see S tep 9 in Chapter 5.) Now, suppose that you wish to classify new dat a into the appropriate classes but you only had covariate infor - mation on these cases. You would use the Covariate Classification output for this purpose. To view this output, click on Covariate Classification. Figure 7-71. Covariate Profiling LC Segment s Using the CHAID Option D E M O D A T A = ' G S S 8 2 . S A V ' After an LC model is estimated, it is of ten desirable to describe (profile) the resulting latent classes in terms of demographic and/or other exogenous variables (covariates). Traditionally , a 2-step approach has been used to do this. In step 1, cases are scored by appending the S tandard Classification output to a dat a file. The ClassPred Tab is used to do this. In step 2, cross-t abulation, regression, discriminant analysis or some other procedure is used to relate the modal classifications to the covariates. The disadvant age of modal classifications is that they cont ain misclassification error which biases the relationship between the covariates and the true (latent) classes. This bias in the cross-t abulations can be eliminated through the use of posterior membership probabilities instead of the modal assignment s to construct the t ables, which take into account the uncert ainty of the classification. In this tutorial, two options for att aining such bias-free profiles are illustrated: 1) Inclusion of Inactive Covariates in a model Since no additional p arameters are estimated when covariates are specified as Inactive, any number of inactive covariates can be included in a model with only a modest increase in the model estimation time. When inactive covariates are included in a model, column and row percent ages showing the relationship of such to the latent classes appear in the Profile and ProbMeans output t ables respectively . In DFactor models, t ables relate the covariates to the levels of each DFactor sep arately, as well as to the levels of the joint DFactor . 2)Use of the CHAID option (requires the SI-CHAID 4.0 program) The CHAID (CHi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector) analysis option can be used to assess the st atistical significance of each Covariate in it s relationship to the latent classes, as well as to develop det ailed profiles of these classes, based on the relationship s in 3- and higher-way t ables. For example, in this tutorial, a CHAID analysis shows that while RACE and EDUCA TION are both significantly related to the levels of DFactor2, once the education ef fect is taken into account, the race ef fect is no longer significant. Thus, the relationship between RACE and DFactor2 may be spurious, explained by the fact that the blacks in the sample had lower education levels than the whites. As such, the dif ferences between levels 1 and 2 of DFactor2 may simply be interpreted as educational dif ferences. The Goal In this tutorial, we obt ain further insight s into the latent class segment s obtained from tutorials #1 and #2 using additional variables (covariates) to profile these segment s in terms of respondent demographics - gender (SEX), education (EDUCR), marit al status (MARIT AL), and age (AGE). 217CHAPTER7.

In this tutorial, we focus on the inactive covariate feature and LC segment s obtained from a DFactor model. We will be using a case level dat a file called gss82.sav which cont ains covariates on N1 = 1,198 of the 1,202 white respondent s used in tutorials #1 and #2 and a supplement al sample of N2 = 446 black respondent s.

TUTORIALSNotice that the levels of DFactor #1 do not appear to dif fer with respect to race, gender or educational att ainment, while DFactor #2 shows strong dif ferences with respect to race and education. For example, cases in level 1 of DFactor #2 have higher levels of education -- 22.2% have some college ('13-15' years of education), and an addi - tional 16.8% have a college degree (completed '16-20' years) -- than cases in level 2 (14.9% and 8.7% respec - tively). We will now show how to use the CHAID option to assess the st atistical significance of these and other Covariate x Latent Class relationship s.U S I N G T H E C H A I D O P T I O N The SI-CHAID program actually consist s of 2 programs, called 'CHAID Define' and 'CHAID Explore' both of which utilize a .chd file as input. Typically, the Define program is used first to set the analysis options and then the Explore command is executed to perform the CHAID analysis. However , if the default settings are adequate, the Explore program may be used immediately to perform the CHAID analysis. The default .chd file generated by Latent GOLD ('ChdModel1.chd') based on DFactor models, defines the dependent variable to be identical to DFactor #1. Thus, the Explore program can be used immediately to profile the levels of DFactor1, or the dependent variable and other default settings may be changed first (using CHAID Define). For the current model, a CHAID analysis based on the default specification finds that none of the demographics are significant. This suggest s that the levels of DFactor1 which reflect either a favorable or unfavorable attitude towards the purpose and accuracy of surveys are not related to any of our demographic variables. Thus, we will show how to use the Define program to change the default settings to re-define the dependent variable (which specifies the latent classes to profile) to DFactor2.

TUTORIALSNote that the demographic variables that were entered into Latent GOLD as Covariates are now included in the SI-CHAID Predictors box, with their current CHAID setting listed to the right of the variable name. By default, Covariates that were specified as 'Nominal' are set to 'free' and those that were specified as 'Numeric' to either 'mono' or 'float' depending upon whether or not missing values are present. 'Free' means that CHAID is free to combine any of it s categories that are not significantly dif ferent with respect to the dependent variable, while 'mono' means that only adjacent categories may be combined. The 'float' scale type setting means that the pre - dictor is treated as 'mono' except for the last ('floating') category (generally cont aining missing values) which is 'free' to combine with any category . Click Scan Figure 7-87. Analysis Dialog Box af ter Scanning Note that the setting for AGE has been changed to 'float' and 'g31' replaces 'g30'. This change is because the scan detected the 31st level for AGE as cont aining missing values.

TUTORIALSThe items displayed in each node are indicated by checkmarks. The bottom four items checked are: Total - the total sample size (displayed in the lower portion of each node) Percents- In the upper portion of each node, (row) percent ages are displayed for the selected categories of the dependent variable (see Individual Categories box) Segment id - a sequential id number appears below each node Variable name - name of the predictor variable(s) whose categories defines the nodes (e.g., 'EDUCR' in Figure 7-92). In the Individual Categories box, a check mark appears next to 'F AC2#1' only . This means that the percent ages that are displayed in the node, correspond to the 1st category of the dependent variable only -- level 1 of DFactor2. In the root node, we see that overall about 71% of the 1,644 cases are in level 1 of the dependent variable. This agrees with the Profile output shown in Figure 7-81. The tree grows by splitting on the grouped categories of EDUCR. W e see that as the education level changes from category 1 ('< 8 years') to category 2 ('8-10 years'), the age in level 1 of DFactor2 increases from 40.6% to 58.7% to 73.9% to 80.2%.

T able for RACE Information regarding the st atistical significance associated with a predictor , provided at the bottom of the t able, shows that RACE is significantly related to DFactor2 overall. However , the terminal nodes in the CHAID tree are defined solely in terms of EDUCR (i.e., these nodes do not split further on RACE), which means that the RACE effect is no longer significant once education is t aken into account. Thus, this relationship can be viewed as spu - rious, being explainable by the fact that the blacks in the sample had lower levels of educational att ainment. In summary , we found that none of the demographics are significantly related to DFactor1 and that EDUCR is the most import ant descriptor for profiling DFactor2. Given the result s from tutorial #2 that showed that DFactor1 is related to the dependent variables PURPOSE and ACCURACY , while DFactor2 is related to the dependent variable UNDERST AND, we might expect the following relationship s to exist between the demographic variables and these indicators: 1)No demographics are significantly related to PURPOSE or ACCURACY . 2)EDUCR is the most import ant variable related to UNDERST AND.
