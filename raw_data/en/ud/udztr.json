PURPOSE: To establish Policies and Procedures to ens ure that LHH provides necessary behavioral health care and services which include [CMS DHHS SOM (\u00a7483.40)]: a. Ensuring that the necessary care and se rvices are person-centered and reflect the resident's goals for care, while maxi mizing the resident's dignity, autonomy, privacy, socialization, indep endence, choice, and safety; b. Ensuring that direct care staff interact and communicate in a manner that promotes mental and psychosoc ial well-being; c. Providing meaningful activities which promote engagement, and positive meaningful relationships between residents and staff, families, other residents and the community. Meaningful activities are those that address the resident's customary routines, intere sts, preferences, etc. and enhance the resident's well- being; d. Providing an environment and atmos phere that is conducive to mental and psychosocial well-being; e. Ensuring that pharmacological in terventions are only used when non- pharmacological interventions are ineffe ctive or when clinic ally indicated. DEFINITIONS: 1. Highest practicable physical, me ntal, and psychosocial well-being This is defined as the highest possible level of functioning and well -being, limited by the individual's recognized pathology and normal aging process. Highest practicable is determined through the comprehensive resident assessment and by recognizing and competently and thoroughly addressing the physi cal, mental or psychosocial needs of the individual. 2. Mental Disorder Mental disorder is a syndrome characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that re flects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying m ental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with si gnificant distress or di sability in social, occupational, or other important activities. 3. Substance Use Disorder (SUD) File: 24-28 BEHAVIORAL H EALTH CARE AND SERVCES December 13, 2022January 20, 2023 Laguna Honda Departmental Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 10 Substance use disorder is defined as recurrent use of alcohol and/o r drugs that causes clinically and functionally sign ificant impairment, such as heal th problems, disability and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home. (Adapted from: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Serv ices Administration (SAMHSA) definition found at http://www.samhsa.gov/dis orders/substance-use ). 4. Trauma Trauma is defined as results fr om an event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an i ndividual as physically or em otionally harmful or life threatening and that has lasting adverse e ffects on the individual's functioning and mental, physical, social, emot ional, or spiritual well-being. 5. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Post-traumatic stress disorder occurs in some individuals who have encountered a shocking, scary, or dangerous situation. Sy mptoms usually begin early, within three months of the traumatic incident, but someti mes they begin years afterward. Symptoms must last more than a month and be severe enough to interfere with relationships or work to be considered PTSD. 6. Depression: Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how an individual feels, the way they think and act. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of in terest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emoti onal and physical problems and ca n decrease a person's ability to function at work and at home. Although people experience losses, it does not necessarily mean that they will become depressed. Depression is not a natural part of aging, however, older adults are at an increased risk. Symptoms may include fatigue, sleep and appetite disturbances, agitation, expressions of guilt, difficulty c oncentrating, apathy, withdrawal, and suicidal ideation. Late life depression may be harder to identify due to a resident's cognitive impairment, loss of functional ability, the co mplexity of multiple chronic medical problems that compound the problem, and the lo ss of significant relationships and roles in their life. Depression presents differently in older adults and it is the responsibility of the facility to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is established. 7. Anxiety and Anxiety Disorders Anxiety is a common reaction to stress that involves occasional worry about circumstantial events. Anxiety disorders, however, include symptoms such as excessive fear and intense anxiety and can cause signi ficant distress. Anxiety disorders are prevalent among older adults and may cause debilitating symptoms. The distinction between general anxiety and an anxiety disorder is subtle and can be difficult to identify. Accurate diagnosis by a qualifi ed professional is essential. Anxiety can be triggered by loss of function, changes in relationships, re location, or medical illness. Importantly, anxiety may also be a symptom of other di sorders, such as dementia, and care must be taken to ensure that other disorders are not inadvertently misd iagnosed as an anxiety disorder (or vice versa). File: 24-28 BEHAVIORAL H EALTH CARE AND SERVCES December 13, 2022January 20, 2023 Laguna Honda Departmental Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 10 6 . Non-pharmacological Intervention: Non-pharmacological intervention refers to approaches to care that do not involve medications, generally directed towards stabilizing and/or impr oving a resident's mental, physical, and psychosocial well-being. BACKGROUND: Providing behavioral health ca re and services is an integral part of the person-centered environment. This involves an interdisciplinar y approach to care, with qualified staff that demonstrate the competencies and skills necessary to provide appropriate services to the resident. Individualized approaches to care (i ncluding direct care and activities) are provided as part of a supporti ve physical, mental, and psyc hosocial environment, and are directed toward understanding, preventing, re lieving, and/or accommodating a resident's distress or loss of abilities. 1. Behavioral health encompasses a resident's whole emotional and mental well-being, which includes, but is not limited to, t he prevention and treatm ent of mental and substance use disorders, psychosocial ad justment difficulty, and trauma or post- traumatic stress disorders. 2. The facility will consider the acuity of the resident population. This includes residents with mental disorders, psyc hosocial disorders, or substance use disorders (SUDs), and those with a history of tr auma and/or post-traumatic st ress disorder (PTSD), as reflected in the facility assessment. 3. The facility will ensure that necessary behavioral health care and services are person- centered and reflect the resident's goals for care, while maximizing the resident's dignity, autonomy, privacy, socializat ion, independence, choice, and safety. 4. Behavioral health care and services sha ll be provided in an env ironment that is conducive to mental and psychosocial well-being. 5. Conditions that are fr equently seen in nursing home residents and may require the facility to provide specialized services and supports based upon residents' individual needs, include, but are not limited to: a. Depression - It is not a natural part of aging, however, older adults in the nursing home setting are more at risk than older adults in the community. b. Anxiety and Anxiety Disorders - There ar e many types of anxiety disorders, each with different symptoms. T he most common types of anxiety disorders include Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social An xiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Phobias and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. c. Schizophrenia - It is a serious mental di sorder that may inte rfere with a person's ability to think clearly, manage emotions, make decisions and relate to others. It is uncommon for schizophrenia to be diagnosed in a person younger than 12 or older than 40. d. Bipolar Disorder - It is a mental disorder that causes dramatic shifts in a person's mood or energy, and may affect t he ability to think clearly. File: 24-28 BEHAVIORAL H EALTH CARE AND SERVCES December 13, 2022January 20, 2023 Laguna Honda Departmental Policies and Procedures Page 4 of 10 6. All LHH staff have the responsibility to help residents meeting their behavioral health care needs. PROCEDURE: 1. Assessment and Reassessment a. LHH utilizes the comprehensive a ssessment and reassessment process for identifying and assessing a resident's mental and psychosocial status and providing person-centered care. This proce ss includes, but is not limited to: i. PASARR screening. ii. Obtaining history and prior level of functioning from medical records, the resident, and as appropriate the resident's family and friends, regarding mental, psychosocial, and emotional health. iii. Ongoing monitoring of mood and behavior , including identifying individual resident responses to stressors iv. Care plan developm ent and implementation. v. Evaluation. b. The resident, and as appropriate the re sident's family, are included in the comprehensive assessment and rea ssessment process along with the interdisciplinary team and outsi de sources, as indicated. 2. Care Planning The care plan shall: a. Have interventions that are person-centered, evidence- based, culturally competent, trauma-informed, and in accordance with professional standards of practice. b. Provide for meaningful activities which promote engagement and positive, meaningful relationships. Residents living with mental health and SUDs may require different activities than other nursing hom e residents. The facility will ensure that activities are provided to meet the needs of these residents . c. Reflect the resident's goals for care. d. Account for the resident's experiences and preferences. e. Maximize the resident's dignity, autonomy, privacy, socializat ion, independence, and safety. f. Use pharmacological interventions only when non-pharmacological interventions are ineffective or when clinically indicated. g. Address any other indivi dualized needs the resident may hav e related to the mental disorder or the SUD. This in cludes incorporating behavioral plan recommendations (if any) from LHH Psychiatry prov iders working with the resident. File: 24-28 BEHAVIORAL H EALTH CARE AND SERVCES December 13, 2022January 20, 2023 Laguna Honda Departmental Policies and Procedures Page 5 of 10 h. Be reviewed and revised as needed, such as when interventions are not effective or when the resident experiences a change in condition. 3. Interventions, Moni toring and Documentation a. LHH Resident Care Teams ( RCT) shall implement person-ce ntered care approaches designed to meet the indivi dual goals and needs of each resident. These may include achieving expected improvements or maintain ing the expected stab le rate of decline based on the progression of the re sident's diagnosed condition. b. Individualized, person-c entered approaches to care should be implemented based upon the comprehensive assessment, in a ccordance with the re sident's customary daily routine, life-long pattern s, interests, preferences, and choices. These shall be implemented to address expressions or indi cations of distress. Feedback from the the resident, resident's fam ily, and/or representative(s) shall be included when possible. c. The RCT shall be aware of potential under lying causes and/or triggers that may lead to expressions or indications of distress. Identifying the frequency, intensity, duration, and impact of a resident's expressions or i ndications of distress, as well as the location, surroundings or situat ion in which they occur, may help the RCT identify individualized interventions or approaches to care to support the resident's needs. d. Individualized, non-pharmacologica l interventions shall be developed and implemented to help meet behavioral healt h needs of all ages. These may include, but are not limited to: i. Ensuring adequate hydration and nutrition (e.g., enhance taste and presentation of food, a ddressing food preferences to improve appetite and reduce the need for medications intended to stimulate appetite); ii. Encouraging exercise; iii. Providing pain relief; iv. Individualizing sl eep and dining routines; v. Considerations for restroom use, in continence and increasing dietary fiber to prevent or reduce constipation; vi. Adjusting the environment to be more individually pr eferred or homelike (e.g., using soft lighting to avoid glare, providin g areas that stimulat e interest or allow safe, unobstructed walking, eliminat ing loud noises thereby reducing unnecessary auditory environment stimulation); vii. Assigning staff to optimize familia rity and consistency with the resident and their needs (e.g., consistent car egiver assignment when possible); viii. Supporting the resident through meaning ful activities that match his/her individual abilities, interests and needs, based upon the comprehensive assessment, and that may be reminiscent of lifelong work or activity patterns; ix. Assisting the resident outdoors in the sunshine and fresh air (e.g .., in a non- smoking area for a non- smoking resident); File: 24-28 BEHAVIORAL H EALTH CARE AND SERVCES December 13, 2022January 20, 2023 Laguna Honda Departmental Policies and Procedures Page 6 of 10 x. Providing access to pets or animals for the resident who enjoys pets (e.g .., a cat for a resident who used to have a cat of their own); xi. Assisting the resident to participate in activities that support their spiritual needs; xii. Assisting with the opportunity for m editation and associated physical activity (e.g.., chair yoga); xiii. Focusing the resident on activities that decrease stress and increase awareness of actual surroundings, such as familiar activities; offering verbal reassurance, especially in terms of keeping the resident safe; and acknowledging that the resident's experience is real to her/him; xiv. Utilizing techniques such as musi c, art, electronics/computer technology systems, massage, essential oils, reminiscing; xv. Assisting residents with SUDs to acce ss counseling (e.g., individual or group counseling services, 12-step programs, and support groups) to the fullest degree possible (see MSPP D08-07 LHH S ubstance Treatment and Recovery Services). xvi. Assisting residents with access to therapies, such as psychotherapy, behavior modification, cognitive behavioral therapy , and problem solving therapy (see MSPP D08-03 Access to LHH Psychiatry services); and xvii. Providing support with skills related to verbal de-escalation, coping skills, and stress management. e. RCT shall monitor the effectivene ss of the interventions, changing those approaches, if needed, in accordance wit h current standards of practice. Additionally, staff shall accurately document these actions in the resident's medical record and provide ongoing assessment as to whether they are improving or stabilizing the resident's status or causing adverse consequences. f. If indicated, referrals for LHH Psychia try services can be made (see MSPP D08-02 LHH Psychiatry Scope of Services and Or ganization; MSPP D08-03 Access to LHH Psychiatry Services). i. Services Psychiatry prov iders related pol icies) D01-05) mental health services (MSPP D08-09) substance treatment and recovery services (STARS, including Non- specialty outreach and engagement of re sident with SUDs and specialty substance treatm ent, and psychologica l testing services (MSPP D08-08) behavioral management services (inc luding behavioral consultation, behavioral planning, and Health and Behavior Services, MSPP D08-10) ii. Recommendations from and interventions by LHH Psychiatry providers shall be incorporated into the resident's ca re plan through collaboration between the RCT and LHH Psychiatry providers. iii. For residents with substance use diso rders (SUD) receiving specialty SUD treatment services, the resident must gi ve written consent using a facility-File: 24-28 BEHAVIORAL H EALTH CARE AND SERVCES December 13, 2022January 20, 2023 Laguna Honda Departmental Policies and Procedures Page 7 of 10 approved authorization form for such tr eatment information to be shared with the RCT (for detailssee MSPP D08-07 Subtance Treatment and Recovery Servicies, Section 7). If the resident gives such consent, LHH Psychiatry providers will document summary information about the resident's specialty SUD treatment in LHH EHR. If the resident does not give such consent, LHH Psychiatry providers may only document in Epic behavioral health treatment information that is NOT about specialty SUD treatment, such as: o Mental Health Assessment and treatment; o Neuropsychological services; o non-specialty level SUD services; o Psychotropic medication treatment; and o Behavioral consultation and planning recommendations. iv. LHH RCT members may ask the resi dent about how they are doing with the referral to SUD treatment, and document in Epic what the resident chooses to disclose, if any. v. Regardless of whether the resident c onsents to disclosing any specialty SUD treatment records, LHH RCT shall care plan for the resident's SUD condition(s) based on available clinical information and observations. g. The Therapeutic Care Team (TCT ) under the Behavioral Response Team Department helps create and maintain a safe, equitable, and therapeutic care environment for LHH residents and assist staff to recognize early signs and symptoms of escalation and other at-risk behaviors. TCT provides culturally appropriate, non-violent crisis intervention training, and individualized de-escalation techniques while collaborating with multidi sciplinary staff to ensure consistent response from resident care team. TCT co llaborates with RCT and LHH Psychiatry team to problem solve around inco rporating behavioral management recommendations from Psychiatry providers in to care plans as well as intervention implementation. h. Residents who exhibit behaviors which could endanger themselv es, other residents, or staff may benefit from a behavioral plan to ensure they are receiving appropriate services and interventions to meet their needs. i. Upon admission of a new resident, the Unit Nurs e Manager or designee will determine if the resident's behaviors may benefit from a behavioral plan. ii. Within twenty-four hours of admissi on, the Unit Nurse Manager or designee should develop an interim behavioral plan, until the comprehensive assessment and care plan are developed. Any behavio ral interventions should also be included in the baseline care plan. iii. The interdisciplinary team, includi ng the resident, and as appropriate the resident's family, should develop a behav ioral plan with identified behaviors through the RAI (Resident Assessment Instrument) process. File: 24-28 BEHAVIORAL H EALTH CARE AND SERVCES December 13, 2022January 20, 2023 Laguna Honda Departmental Policies and Procedures Page 8 of 10 iv. Information regarding the resident's us ual routine may be gathered from the pre- screening application tool, from the resi dent and family members, and/or the comprehensive assessment. v. Behaviors should be documented clear ly and concisely by facility staff. Documentation should include spec ific behaviors, time and frequency of behaviors, observation of what may be tr iggering behaviors, what interventions were utilized, and the outcomes of the interventions. vi. Behaviors should be identified and approac hes for modification or redirection should be included in the comprehensive plan of care. vii. The care plan and behavioral plan s hould be reviewed at least quarterly for continued need of behavior management and appropriate interventions. i. A behavioral plan may include a behavioral cont ract. If a behavioral contract is used, it will only be used with residents who have the capacity to understand it. A contract will only be used as a method of encouraging the resident to follow their plan of care, and not as a system of reward and punishm ent. The contract will not conflict with resident rights or other requi rements of participation. i. Resident refusal to accept, or n on-adherence to the te rms of a behavioral contract, will not be the so le basis for a denial of admission, transfer or discharge. ii. A behavioral contract can include a schedule of daily life events, which addresses the individuality of the resident. The contract should reflect the resident's personal preferences and usual ro utine, to the extent possible. The contract should include the recrea tion schedule, non-pharmacological interventions, and environmental adjus tments needed to help the resident meet the resident's highes t practicable well-being. iii. If a contract is used, it may also address: 1) The resident's right to have a l eave of absence and the health and safety risks of leaving without facility knowle dge or leaving against medical advice (AMA). 2) Facility efforts to hel p residents with mental disorder and/or SUD, such as individual counseling services, access to group counseling, or access to a Medication Assisted Treatment program, if applicable. 3) Steps the facility may take if s ubstance use is suspected, which may include: Increased monitoring and supervision in the facility to maintain the health and safety of the resident suspec ted of substance use, as well as all residents. Restricted or supervised visitation, if the resident's visitor(s) are deemed to be a danger to the resident, other residents, and/or staff. Voluntary drug testing if there are concerns t hat suspected drug use could adversely affect the resident's condition. Voluntary inspections, if there is reasonable suspicion of possession of illegal drugs, weapons or other unauthorized items which could endanger the resident or others.

For other behavioral management related prac tices, refer to relevant hospital policies, such as: of Resident Aggression, HWPP 75- 05 Illicit or Diverted Drugs and/or Paraphernalia Possession/Use By Residents or Visitors. k. In cases where a resident's condition or behavior becomes such that the resident's needs cannot be met in LHH, or the health or safety of indivi duals is endangered due to the clinical or behavio ral status of the resident, the RCT may seek alternative placement for the resident. See HWPP 20- 04 Discharge Planning, Section 7 under Procedure: Involuntary Discharges. k.l. All assessment, care plans, interventio ns, revisions and referrals shall be documented in the electronic health record (EHR). 4. Staff Training All facility staff, including contracted staff and volunteers, shall receive education to ensure appropriate competencies and skill sets for meeting the behavioral health needs of residents. Education s hall be based on the role of the staff member and resident needs identified through the facility assessment.

File: 60-01 Quality Assurance Performance Improvement Revised March 8December 13 , 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 13 of 18 7. USE OF DATA a. Performance monitoring and improvement activities are data driven. Data collection is prioritized by the LHH PIPS Committee based on the organization's mission, care, treatment and services provided, and the population served. Data collection for performance improvement acti vities focuses on processes that have a major impact upon patient outcomes (e.g., high risk, high volume, problem prone). The data is drawn from multiple sources, incl uding input from all staff, residents, families, and others as appropriate . This data is reported to the QAA committee. i. The QAA committee analyzes the data in order to identify or better understand a problem. b. Once a potential problem is identif ied, the committee utilizes a systematic approach (e.g., Five Whys, flowcharting, fishbone diagram, etc.) to help identify the root cause of the problem. c. As corrective actions are taken, the committee continues to collect and analyze data to determine the effectiveness of any changes. d. a.e. Performance monitoring and improvement activities are data driven. Data collection is prioritized by the LHH PIPS Committee based on the organization's mission, care, treatment and services provided, and the population served. Data collection for performance improvement activities focuses on patient flow and processes that have a major impact upon pati ent outcomes (e.g., high risk, high volume, problem prone). All data and in formation containing protected health information (PHI) is secured to protect pat ients' privacy in accordance with Health Insurance Portability and Account ability Act (HIPAA) regulations. b.f. The PIPS Program encompasses data and info rmation collected from the following established processes: i. The facility assessment ii. Grievance logs iii. Minimum Data Set iv. Quality measures v.

The PIPS Committee identifies and ens ures appropriate follow-up of organization-wide trends, patterns, and opportuni ties to improve aspects of patient care and safety through the review and analysis of data. d.h. The PIPS Committee selects at least one process annually for proactive risk assessment. 8. PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT METHODOLOGY A. LHH uses Lean as the framework for our LHH performance improvement work. Once actions are implemented, the facility continues to track performance to ensure that improvements ar e realized and sustained. A combination of process and outcome measures are used to measure success following the implementation of change. Performance improvement and patient safety effortsefforts are conducted and documented by using a Lean improvement strategy A3 Thinking. A3s are a standard language and template for problem solving and improvement plans. A3 File: 60-01 Quality Assurance Performance Improvement Revised March 8December 13 , 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 15 of 18 thinking includes defining a problem, under standing root causes, considering countermeasures and studying and adjusting for results (PDSA: Plan-Do-Study-Act). Using A3 thinking, LHH select s measurable gaps and targets to improve that will impact system-wide goals (True North metrics). We learn by sharing our problem solving and inviting questions. We improve continuously by focusing on performance gaps aligned with True North. In addition to A3 thinking, LHH also utilizes the foll owing tools to improve performance: a. Value Stream Map - A full visual representation of a specified process from start to finish, typically from the patient's per spective. This process map is developed through direct observation of patients and staff. b. Kaizen - a word used to describe the process of taking something apart and making it better, also referred to as a process of continuous improvement. c. Daily Management System - A system comprised of a set of tools designed to empower frontline staff to become pr oblem solvers and use data to drive improvements . d. Leader Standard Work - A standardized approach that allows a leader to create a stable organized plan for their day, w eek and month. Leader standard work also creates focus on the important wo rk of improving and sustaining. B. The Failure Mode, Effects and Crit icality Analysis (FMEA) methodology is utilized to perform proactive risk assessment. 9. RISK ASSESSMENT AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT TO ENSURE File: 60-01 Quality Assurance Performance Improvement Revised March 8December 13 , 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 16 of 18 PATIENT SAFETY A. Annually, a system or process identif ied as having the potential to impact patient safety will be selected for a 'p roactive risk assessment' using the FMEA process. Internal/exter nal data sources and The Joint Commission publications are used to determine which system or process is to be assessed. B. The process is assessed to determine steps where there is or may be undesirable variations (failure modes ). Information from internal or external sources is used to minimize risk to patients affected by the new or redesigned process. C. For each failure mode, possible e ffects on patients, as well as the seriousness of the effect, are identified. D. The process is redesigned to mini mize the risk of failure modes. E. The redesigned process is tested and implemented. F. Measures to determine effectiv eness of the redesigned process will be identified and im plemented. Strategies to maintain success over time are identified. In addition, the following are measured: 1. The perceptions of risk to patient s and suggestions for improving care. 2. The level of staff reluctance to report errors in care. G. The PIPS Program is reassessed by the Medical Executive Committee on an annual basis. Elements to be ev aluated include but are not limited to: 1. Achievement of goals and objectives; 2. Evidence of process improvement; and 3. Evidence of improvem ent in patient care. 10.9. FEEDBACK a. Feedback from staff, residents, resident representatives, and other sources will be used to identify problem s that are high-risk, hi gh-volume, and/or problem prone, as well as opport unities for improvement. b. Feedback is actively sought from staff members. Sources of staff feedback may include, but are not limited to: i. Staff satisfaction surveys File: 60-01 Quality Assurance Performance Improvement Revised March 8December 13 , 2022 Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 17 of 18 ii.

PURPOSE: To reduce the transmission of MRSA to ot hers, to prevent complication of MRSA infections, and to comply with California Heal th and Safety Code Sections 1255.8 (b) (1), (3), (4); (c); and (d) 925-390-2622 DEFINITION: MRSA : Methicillin-resistant Staphyloccoccus aureus is a bacterium commonly found on the skin that has become resistant to many antibiotics, is diffi cult to treat when infections occur and can be transmitted to others. MRSA infections can lead to sepsis which can result from blood stream infect ions, pneumonia, wound/surgical si te infection, and death. MRSA is often transmitted by direct contact and can survive for hours on some surfaces including towels, razors, and other items. In tact skin, proper hand hy giene, proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) includ ing gloves and thorough disinfection of equipment used by infected patients can re duce the spread of MRSA to others. PROCEDURE: 1. The attending physician shall write an or der for MRSA testing upon the patient's admission to an acute care unit. 2. When a patient tests positive for MRSA, the attending physician is to inform the patient or patient's representative of the positive results in a timely manner. 3. A patient who tests positive for MRSA shall, prior to discharge, receive oral and written instruction regarding aftercare and precaut ions to prevent the spread of MRSA to others (refer to Appendix A). 4. A patient, who has been previously te sted on admission and shows evidence of increased risk of invasive MRSA, shall agai n be tested for MRSA immediately prior to discharge from the facility, unless s/he has tested posit ive for MRSA infection or colonization upon entering the facility.

MRSA is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , a potentially dangerous type of st aph bacteria that is resistant to certain antibiotics and may cause skin and other infections. As with all regular staph infections , recognizing the signs and receiving treatment for MRSA skin infections in the early stages reduces the chances of the in fection becoming severe. A positive test result simply means you have been exposed to MR SA and colonized. Unless you are also sick, a colonized test result may not get treated. Your test results were positive . This means you have MRSA pres ent on your body. You may carry on with your daily routine as usual. It is recommended that you take prevention measures to make sure you and your loved ones stay healthy. These include: Know the signs of MRSA skin infections and get treated early Keep cuts and scrapes clean and covered Encourage good hygiene such as cleaning hands regularly Discourage sharing of personal it ems such as towels and razors Wash your hands thoroughly and frequently Do not share bath towels, linens, razors or anything else that touches the skin Avoid skin to skin contact of open wounds or sores. This can happen when playing sports or while having sex or other activiti es that involve skin to skin contact. Clean and disinfect any items that are shared before and after every use Use lotion to keep skin moist. Damaged ski n can provide an opening for infection Most staph skin infections, including MRSA, appear as a bump or infected area on the skin that may be: Red Swollen Painful Warm to the touch Full of pus or other drainage Accompanied by a fever Laguna Honda wishes you a speedy recovery from your illness.

PURPOSE: To minimize the risk of trans mission of pathogens during use of non-critical resident care equipment. DEFINITION: Non-critical is the classification level given to resident care equipment that does not come into contact with any sterile body cavity or mucous membrane. Non-critical resident care equipment requires low level disinfecti on procedures between resident use. Such items may include but are not lim ited to blood pressure cuffs or pulse oximeters in which the intact skin serves as an effective barrier to pathogens. The standard hospital-wide approved disinfectant are hydrogen peroxide-based disinfectant wipes. These shall be used for cleaning and disinfecting non-critical resident care equipment unless otherwise noted in atta chment LHH Non-Crit ical Resident Care Equipment Disinfectant Exceptions. The sodium hypochlorite-based (bleach) disi nfectant wipe must be used for disinfection of equipment used by residents infected wit h pathogens that cannot be killed with hydrogen peroxide, such as Clostridioides difficile (C. diff.) . Dedicated equipment : Any medical equipment that will be used by a single resident and is not shared with other residents for t he duration of the prescribed treatment. Multi-resident use equipment : Shared equipment used for mu ltiple residents for care when intact skin will provide a sufficient ba rrier. Shared equipment is cleaned and/or disinfected after each resident use. Minimum contact time : Time required to effectively render the pathogen inactive and not capable of being transmitted to others. Contact time is determined and listed on the product label.

Intravascular device policies shall be co nsistent with guidelines from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to reduce transmission of pathogens via the bloodstream. 2. Intravascular devices shall be used fo r the minimum amount of time necessary. PURPOSE: To provide general guidelines on intravascula r devices that are c onsistent with current national standards for prevent ion of catheter-associated bloodstream infection. DEFINITIONS: Intravascular Devices : A device that is placed wit hin the blood system via an artery or vein usually for the purpose of administering medications and fluids, frequently monitoring blood lab values, or both. This term is broad in scope and may include any type of device including but not limited to peripheral IVs (venous), PICC lines, arterial lines such as centra l lines, or other vascular access devices. Central Line-Associated Bl oodstream Infection (CLABSI) : Pronounced CLAB- SEE, this is a term used by National Healthca re Safety Network (NHSN) that refers to a primary blood stream infection in a resident/patient with a central line within the 48-hour period before devel opment of the infection and is not a blood stream infection related to an infection at another si te. A CLABSI is a serious infection that occurs when germs enter the bloodstream through a catheter (tube) that healthcare providers place in a large vein in the neck, chest, or groin to give medication or fluids or to co llect blood for medical tests. PROCEDURE: 1. Ongoing prevention and management of CLABSIs is achieved through multidisciplinary activities includi ng education, hand hygiene program and observations, antimicrobial stewardshi p activities, and ongoing surveillance. 2. Performance improvement efforts s hall be ongoing and based upon surveillance findings combined with improvement init iatives and evidence-based recommended practices. 3. The Infection Control Nurse (ICN) reports monthly acute unit surveillance data for CLABSIs to NHSN.

Insertion of central venous catheters (CVC's) (any line ending in a great vessel) includes full barrier precautions and judicious use of devices. 5. Insertion and care of intravascular dev ices is described in Nursing policies and procedures and states the appropriate disc ipline to perform tasks associated with peripherally inserted central catheters (P ICCs), central venous catheters, tunneled devices and peripheral midline catheters. 6. Clinicians shall follow gener al guidelines for preventing catheter-related bloodstream infections that include education and tr aining, demonstrated competency, hand hygiene and aseptic techniq ue, appropriate skin preparation, catheter site dressing regimens, cleansing, use of cath eter securement devices, antimicrobial/ antiseptics and impregnated ca theters/cuffs, and anticoagulants and removal/ replacement procedures. 7. Clinicians shall partici pate in education and training provided initially and annually through required training and orientation with additional training as scheduled. 8. Nursing competency with intravascular devic es is assessed prior to insertion and care. 9. Hand hygiene activities and aseptic tec hnique specific to intravascular device management include the following CDC recommendations: a. Perform hand hygiene procedures, eit her by washing hands with soap and water or with alcohol-bas ed hand rub (ABHR). b. Hand hygiene should be performed before and after palpating catheter insertion sites as well as before and after inserti ng, replacing, accessing, repairing, or dressing an intravascular catheter. c. Palpation of the insert ion site should not be perform ed after the application of antiseptic, unless aseptic technique is maintained. d. Maintain aseptic technique for the insert ion and care of intravascular catheters. e. Wear clean gloves, rather than sterile gloves, for the insertion of peripheral intravascular catheters, if the access site is not touched after the application of skin antiseptics. 10. Clinicians shall follow skin preparati ons as outlined in Nursing policies and procedures, which may include the following CDC recommendations: a. 70% alcohol, tincture of iodine, or alc oholic solution before peripheral venous catheter insertion. Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2020 B6 Intravascular Device Guidelines Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 3 b. >0.5% chlorhexidine with alcohol and ca theter site dressing for central lines dressing changes. c. Antiseptics should be allowed to air dry ( do not blow on or f an the site) according to the manufacturer's recommendation prior to placing the catheter. d. Catheter securement devices are reco mmended to reduce the risk of infection, catheter migration and dislodgement. 11. Prophylactic antimicrobial lock solution is generally not recommended unless there is a history of multiple CLABSIs for residents with long-term catheter. 12. Routine use of anticoagulants to reduce the risk of CLABSI is not recommended. 13. Blood cultures shall be ordered by the physicians when an infection is suspected. Negative cultures suggest that the intrava scular device is an unlikely source of infection. 14. Document and promptly r eport signs of infection. Do cument other interventions according to Nursing policy and procedures. ATTACHMENT: None.

Staff shall follow standard and trans mission based precautions, including hand hygiene and appropriate use of gloves and other personal pr otective equipment (PPE). 3. Respiratory infection su rveillance and antimicrobial st ewardship is ongoing. 4. Legionella is a water-borne bacterial infection that is transmitted via inhalation of aerosolized water containing the bacteria. Less commonly, Legionella can be transmitted via aspiration of drinking water. Legionella is not usually transmitted from person-to-person. a. Construction, the format ion of biofilm and fluctuat ing water temperatures can influence outbreaks of legionella. Constr uction can release the bacterial from water pipes when pipes are interrupted. Bi ofilm is a protective slime layer that lines water pipes that makes the bacteri a very resistant to disinfectants. b. Legionella is transferred most frequently thr ough aerosolized water containing the bacteria through showers, cooling towe rs, contaminated aerosolized devices including CPAPs, eye-wash stations, aerat ors on faucets, ice machines, hot tubs, decorative water fountains, and water main breaks c. Residents/pati ents at risk for a Legionella diagnosis includes but is not limited to those over the age of 50, sm okers, have chronic lung disease such as COPD or emphysema, underlying morbidities or hav e had recent exposure to hot tubs. d. A Legionella Hazard Analysis Critical Control Plan (HACCP) is available to guide water plan-related maintenance and monitori ng. This plan is kept in Facility Services. LHH will have a water managem ent program to reduce the risk of Legionella growth and spread that is review ed annually. This plan will include a risk assessment of the facility that is comp leted by Facility Services and reviewed with the Performance Improv ement Patient Safety (PIPS) committee at least annually. 5. Aspergillosis is a fungal/mold disease caused by the common mold Aspergillus that can be found in soil, decomposing plant mate rial, household dust, building materials food and water . The spores are inhaled and cause lung, skin, and other respiratory infections in those who have se verely weakened immune systems. Aspergillosis is not spread transmitted from person-to person and does not require isolation. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2020 B11 Respiratory Care Guidelines Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 4 PURPOSE: To minimize the potential for acquiring healthcare-associated pneumonia and other respiratory infections in a m anner that is consistent with C enters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. PROCEDURE: 1. Staff shall follow related Laguna Honda Hospit al (LHH) policies that address potential risk factors for healthcare associated respir atory infections. Risk factors generally include: a. Factors that enhance co lonization of the orophar ynx and/or stomach by microorganisms that may incl ude administration of antimi crobial agents, admission to the ICU, or presence of underlying chronic lung disease b. Conditions favoring aspiration into t he respiratory tract or reflux from the gastrointestinal tract that may include in itial or repeat endotra cheal intubation, insertion of a nasogastric t ube, placement in a supine position, coma, surgical procedures involving the head, ne ck, thorax, or upper abdomen, and immobilization due to trauma or illness c. Host factors that may include extr emes of age associated with fragility, malnutrition, and severe underlying cond itions including immunosuppression d. Potential exposure to cont aminated respiratory devices e. Contact with contaminated or colonized hands of staff f. Risk factors also include prolonged use of mechanical ventilatory support 2. LHH policies that address the above risk fact ors include, but are not limited to, policies addressing: a. Oral care b. Prevention of complications of immob ility, including turning, repositioning, ambulation and procedures to maximize ind ependence in activities of daily living c. Use and cleaning of resp iratory equipment and devices d. Pneumococcal and influenza vaccines and respiratory hygiene File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2020 B11 Respiratory Care Guidelines Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 4 e. Facility monitoring and maintenance to prevent and detect contaminated air and water supply equipment (e.g. with pot ential pathogens such as legionella and aspergillus) 3. General guidelines for maintaining re spiratory equipment and devices include: a. Respiratory single use equipm ent and devices are preferred b. Cleaning and disinfection per manufac turer's recommendations occurs between residents or in the absence of manufac turers recommendation, use of an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved disinfectant c. Do not reprocess equipment or devices that are manufactured for a single use only d. Reprocessing may occur for some re spiratory equipment during times of emergency needs such as pandemics. Reproc ess according to the most current CDC guidance at the time of use e. Replace nebulizer tubing and mask accordi ng every 24 hours or in the event of contamination f. Use sterile water for rinsing reusable semi-critical equipment and devices used on the respiratory tract after they have been disinfected chemically g. High touch surfaces including respirat ory equipment in the resident/patient room should be surface cleaned and disinfected daily h. Thoroughly clean all equipm ent and devices before steri lization or disinfection i. Sterilize or use high level disinfecti on for semi-critical equipment or devices j. Tracheostomy care and suctioning sha ll be performed aseptically according to Nursing policy and procedures 4. Facility Services staff and vendors sha ll maintain and monitor water and air delivery systems to prevent contamination by potential pathogens, such as Legionella and Aspergillus . 5. Primary prevention of Legionnaire's disease (legionellosis), when no cases of healthcare-associated legionellosis have been documented, includes maintaining a high index of suspicion for legionellosis and appropriately using diagnostic tests for legionellosis in residents with healthcare -associated pneumonia wh o are at high risk of developing the disease. a. If one or more healthcare-associated legion ellosis occurs, then culturing the facility water may be indicated after consulting wit h the local health department. Culturing File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2020 B11 Respiratory Care Guidelines Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 4 of 4 requires trained outside experts for cult uring and analysis and should not be performed by unskilled, untrained personnel. b. Legionellosis is a serious pneum onia caused by the bacteria Legionella and is a reportable infection to t he local health department. 6. Primary prevention of Aspergillosis includes: a. Provide a private room for residents on neutropenic pr ecautions, providing a well- fitting mask when resident must leave the room, minimizing time outside of the room, and coordinating with En vironmental Services (EVS) for cleaning when the resident is out of the rom as much as possi ble to decrease aerosolization of spores. b. During construction in areas with high risk residents provide barriers, and re-route traffic flow and clean newly construct ed area prior to residents entering. c. In case of an Aspergillosis case among residents or sta ff, report to the Infection Control Nurse (ICN). The I CN will coordinate with Facilit y Services to eliminate the source of infection. 7. Clinicians shall continue to collaborate with the ICN for consultation, required reporting, and to obtain case-specific re commendations from the local health department as needed and as required.

Urinary catheterization includes indwelling cathet ers and non-indwelling (i.e. intermittent catheters). Both are sterile in sertion procedures that require strict adherence to sterile protocols to reduce infection transmission. 2. Clinical and medical staff will evaluate the need for urinar y catheterization on a case- by-case basis and utilizing altern ative methods where possible. 3. Urinary catheterization protocols must include measures to reduce the use and duration of catheter days for this vu lnerable population to reduce catheter- associated urinary tract infections (CAU TI) which can lead to increased illness, increased hospitalization, increase use of antibiotics, sepsis, and death. PURPOSE: The infection prevention and control progr am (IPC) at Laguna H onda Hospital (LHH) has adopted guidelines for th e management of urinary ca theterization that are consistent with Centers for Disease Cont rol and Prevention (CDC) guidelines and minimize the potential for CAUT I and improve resident outcomes. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common type of he althcare-associated infection (HAI) in long-term care facilities. UTIs are not identified by urine odor or color but identified positively by a ur ine culture. UTIs may pres ent with or without symptoms. Care and treatment of sympt omatic UTIs, asymptomatic UTIs, and bacteriuria are different, require careful assessment, and have different reporting requirements. Urinary drainage bags serve as reservoirs fo r multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) that can be transmitted to other staff and re sidents. Indwelling ur inary catheters are uncomfortable and often unnecessary. Urinar y catheters support biofilm growth with colonization rendering them virtually impo ssible to eradicate without removing the device. DEFINITIONS: Symptomatic urinary tract infection (SUTI): Pronounced soot-ee, SUTIs are identified with a positive ur ine culture and with symptoms that may include fever, suprapubic pain, dysuria (painf ul urine cultures shows a m easurable number of bacteria with no symptoms noted. Bacteriuria: Presence of bacteria in the urine, not to be confused with a UTI. After 1 month of indwelling catheter use, the risk of bacteria in urine is almost 100%. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2020 B13: Urinary Catheterization Guidelines Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 2 PROCEDURE: 1. The physician will assess new admissions wit h indwelling urinary catheters upon admission and evaluate the need for continuing the catheter or determine if alternate methods are available. a. Straight (intermittent) catheterizati on may be used to obtain sterile specimens, urine specimens when the resident is unable to void voluntarily, or for intermittent catheterization for urinary re tention or neurogeni c bladder. 2. The physician should consider alternatives to indwelling catheters, such as suprapubic catheters (SPC s), straight/intermittent cathet erization, or male external (condom) catheters. 3. Hand hygiene and proper personal protective equipment (PPE) are used for any catheter insertion or remova l, contact with the catheter, or contact wit h the urinary drainage bag following LHHPP Nursing F5 .0 Nursing of Hygiene NPP F5.0 Nursing Management of Urinary Catheters Association for Professionals in Infection Control & Epidemiology (APIC).

Retrieved August 18, 2020, from Revised October 13, 2020 C19 West Nile Virus Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 1 of 5 WEST NILE VIRUS POLICY: The guidelines provide information in the prevention, evaluation and management of West Nile Virus (WNV) infection in accordance with the most current CDC recommendations. WNV is a mosquito-borne ill ness that is not passed from person-to- person and does not pose a threat to others. Isolation is not required and Standard Precautions with appropriate pers onal protective equipment (PPE) is all that is required for WNV infection precautions. WNV is a reportable disease once diagnosed. West Nile Virus does not caus e symptoms or prolonged illness in most individuals. 1 in 5 people infected with WNV will have a fever and 1 in 150 will suffer severe illness, up to and may include death according to t he CDC. Residents who may have been exposed to mosquitoes and develops symptoms should be considered for testing for WNV. PURPOSE: The Infection Control program at Laguna H onda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center (LHH) has adopted guidelines in accordanc e with the CDC recommendations to reduce the risk of West Nile Virus infection for residents in LHH. Reducing the mosquito population or exposure to mosqui to bites will reduce the likel ihood of exposure to West Nile Virus. There is no known person-to-person transfer of the infection of West Nile Virus. WNV is transmitted by infected mosquito bites. PROCEDURE: The guidelines provide information in the prevention, evaluation and management of West Nile Virus (WNV) infection. 1. Mode of transmission West Nile Virus is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. Not all mosquitos are infected with WNV and further assessment should be performed when mosquitoes, mosquito bites and symptoms are found t ogether. Care should be taken to reduce exposure to mosquitos during the summer m onths when mosquitos are more prevalent. West Nile virus is NOT tr ansmitted from person-to-per son contact and is not a respiratory disease. WNV does not r equire isolation or quarantine. Standard Precautions for PPE are adequate for care of those infected with WNV. Follow needle stick safety precautions as a part of St andard Precautions when caring for those with WNV. West Nile virus, when confirme d, is reportable to local and/or state health departments within one working day of identification. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2020 C19 West Nile Virus Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 5 2. Symptoms of West Nile Virus West Nile disease may present differently to those infected. WNV may be present in persons without any symptoms . 8 out of 10 people infect ed do not show any symptoms of West Nile Virus disease and have no lasting effects of the infection. West Nile fever may present as a mild form of the disease. West Nile Fever occurs in 1 in 5 of those people affected with WNV. West Nile Fever c onsists of mild symptoms, including fever, headache, and body aches, occa sionally with a skin rash on the trunk of the body and swollen lymph glands. Other symptoms may include malaise, fever, anorexia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, eye pain, and mental status changes. Symptoms of mild disease will generally last a few days. West Nile may present as a severe case of infection in some individuals. West Nile Virus may present as encephalitis or meningitis symptoms which may include headache, high fever, neck stiffne ss, stupor, disorientat ion, coma, tremor s, convulsions, muscle weakness, and paralysis. Severe neurological manifestat ions include ataxia (defective muscular coordination), cranial nerve (inf lammation of bone marrow), optic neuritis, polyradiculitis (inflammation of spinal nerve r oots) and seizures and 1 in 10 with severe neurological manifestations may result in d eath. Symptoms of severe disease may last several weeks but neurologica l effects may be permanent. The time between the mosquito bite and the ons et of illness (incubation period) ranges from 5 to 15 days. 3. Diagnosis and Treatment of West Nile Virus The initial diagnosis of WNV infection is based primarily on clinical suspicion and evidence of increased WNV disease activity in animals such as horses and birds in the community. WNV should be strongly considered in adul ts >50 years who develop unexplained encephalitis or meningitis in summer or early fall. Suspicion of viral encephalitis or meningitis should be reported without delay to the local health department to reduce the likelihood of an outbreak. Serum or cer ebrospinal fluid samples (CSF) may be requested for testing to detect WN V-specific IgM antibodies. a. Diagnosis: i. WNV-specific IgM antibodies are det ectable 3-8 days after onset of illness and may persist for 30-90 days or longer. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2020 C19 West Nile Virus Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 5 ii. Cerebrospinal fluid may also detect the presence of IgM antibodies for a recent infection. iii. Viral cultures to detect viral RNA including RT-PCR may also be performed on serum, CSF or other body tissue. b. Treatment: i. There is currently no vaccine to prev ent WNV and no specific medication to treat WNV. Treatment is aimed at clinical management of symptoms. ii. Supportive treatment includes intr avenous fluids, pain relief and fever reducing medications. Addi tional medication may be used to treat specific symptoms. iii. Close monitoring for intracranial pressure (ICP) and seizures for those that develop neurological symptoms. iv. Persons requiring hospital admi ssion may require intensive care and mechanical ventilation support. 4. Prevention and Monitoring of West Nile Virus A mosquito prevention and control progr am has been instituted in Laguna Honda Hospital to reduce the preval ence of mosquitos in the surrounding area to reduce the risk of all mosquito-borne diseases incl uding WNV. (Cross-reference: Laguna Honda Hospital Mosquito Prevention and Control Plan) Some birds are known to be affected by WN V as well and their presence may aid in alerting authorities to a potent ial outbreak. Dead birds, parti cularly a crow, jay, magpie or raven may provide evidence of the WNV in the area. Do not attempt to remove these animals. Contact Pest Control for re moval and possible laboratory testing. 5. Protecting residents from West Nile Virus During summer months when mosquit oes are abundant, residents should remain indoors in the early morning and twilight, when mosquitoes are most active for feeding/biting. Residents should wear long pants and long sleeves and socks when outside during these hours. Repellents should be used cautious ly in the elderly. Contact the provider for guidance if concerns. The most common repellent used is DEET. DEET is absorbed through the skin and should not be used on non-intact skin, wounds are near IV opening. Discontinue use and wash area with soap and wa ter if rash or other symptoms of allergic reaction develops after application. File: 72-01 Infection Control Manual Revised October 13, 2020 C19 West Nile Virus Laguna Honda Hospital-wide Policies and Procedures Page 4 of 5 If WNV is diagnosed in close proximity to a re cent blood transfusion or organ transplant, notification to the health department is necessary to screen for possible blood bank/organ tissue transmission. 6. The following is a summary of the CDC recommendations for repellant use a. Persons using repellents should read and follow the manufacturers insert directions before using any chemical product on skin and persons with open skin lesions or irritated skin. b. Do not apply to eyes or mouth and apply sparingly around ears. When using sprays, do not spray directly on face - spray on hands first and then apply to face. c. Repellents containing DEET should be applied sparingly to exposed skin. d. Do not spray repellents around food. e. Avoid inhaling (breat hing) repellent spray. f. Repellents should not be applied to the hands of residents who commonly put their hands or fingers in their mouth. g. A higher percentage of D EET does not mean that prot ection is stronger; it means that protection will last l onger. Choose a product that pr ovides for the amount of time the person will be outdoors. Reapply t he product if the time outdoors is extended or if mosquitoes begin to bite. h. Wear long pants, long sleeve shirts and socks when outside at dawn and dusk. Spray clothing to prevent mosquitoes from biting through thin clothing. Repellents should not be used under clothing. i. After returning indoors, wash treated skin with soap an d water or bathe. This is particularly important when repellents are used repeatedly in a day or on consecutive days. Also, wash treated cl othing before wearing it again. (This precaution may vary with different repellents - check the product label).

The Laguna Honda Hospital (LHH) Acute Unit are defined as the Acute Medical and Acute Rehab units. The Acute Rehab unit is also known as the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF). 2. The responsible Physician, Nurse Manager (NM), Charge Nurse, and the Nursing Director (ND) will be notified of any new admissions. 3. The Registered Nurse (RN) implements and documents the nursing process in the delivery of care to the patient in the electronic health record (EHR): assessments, nursing diagnoses, outcomes and planning, implementation and evaluation. 4. Each nursing role (e.g., RN, Licensed Vocational Nurse [LVN], Patient Care Assistant [PCA], or Home Health Aide [HHA]) will perform and document care delivered that is within the scope of their practice. 5. If no PCA is available, the RN will perform PCA tasks and documentation. 6. LVNs will be assigned to the Acute Unit only when attempts to staff with an RN or PCA has been exhausted. The LVN will never be assigned alone to the Acute Unit or as the Charge Nurse. 7. Float LVN or RN assigned to the Acute Unit will receive a unitspecific orientation to the environment of care and unit routine from a trained acute staff or Nursing Supervisor prior to providing care. They may perform and document tasks within their scope of practice and consistent with tasks they can perform on a SNF unit (e.g., medication administration, wound dressing changes, etc.). They may not perform Acute specific tasks which require training or competencies, such as blood transfusions. Refer to policy X X.X Nursing Staff Education - Acute Unit. PURPOSE: To outline nursing documentation standards and requirements related to patient in the Acute Units. PROCEDURE : A. Principles of Nursing Documentation 1. Documentation of Nursing Care: a. is recorded in the medical record and is reflective of the care provided. b. will be factual, accurate, complete, sequential, and legible. c. is subject to legal review and must be without ambiguity in interpretation (e.g., only use standardized/approved abbreviations) d. will contain a date, time, and the author's signature and credentials (legibly written or electronic) for each entry. e. is recorded and signed immediately after the care event or the observation has taken place. When this cannot occur, the author changes the time in the EHR to reflect the time that the action and observation occurred. f. will not be recorded in advance of care being provided. g. is entered with any changes in condition and is documented with enough detail to ensure continuity of care and level of care. Documentation of Care - Acute Unit File: C 3.X October 6, 2022, New LHH Nursing Policies and Procedures Page 2 of 8 2. Documentation identifies late entries (when documentation is completed outside the shift performed) with the date and time of the observation and clearly indicates the added documentation is a late entry. The delay reason must also be included. This information is attached to the component of documentation that is being added as a late entry. 3. Incorrect documentation cannot be deleted or erased as the medical record is a legal documentation. Errors in the EHR require a \"correction\" comment to be entered with pertinent details for the reason for the correction if applicable. 4. Paper Documentation: a. will be completed using a blue or black ink pen. b. will be crossed out with a single line and reason written next to it for any errors. This correction must be signed or initialed, dated, and timed. Whiteout is prohibited. 5. Documenting Nursing Care and Assessments a. The LHH Acute Unit uses a combination of documentation methods: i. Charting by exception for assessment only (e.g., Within Defined Limits [WDL]) ii. Documenting changes iii. Set, periodic documentation iv. Documentation specific to the acute admission or comeandgo procedure b. WDLs can be utilized to document assessments when the definition is available in the EHR for the documenting clinician and the clinician has assessed all elements within the definition. c. Fields that do not pertain to the patient's care or condition may be left blank. B. Nursing Documentation 1. Shift documentation: Document as warranted by patient condition with a minimum of once per shift or as ordered. Documentation includes assessment data, newly identified or changes to nursing diagnosis (care plan problems), interventions implemented, and evaluation of patient's response to interventions. a. Headtotoe assessment is completed at least once per shift, at the beginning of the shift or when first admitted. b. Vital Signs are documented at a minimum every shift on Acute Rehab at the beginning of the shift and every 4 hours on Acute Medical. c. Pain should also be assessed prior to administering routine pain medication, before and after as needed pain medication, and when clinically indicated. Refer to 2506 Pain Assessment and Management. d. Intake and output will be documented each shift for all patients. e. Weights are documented at a minimum weekly on Acute Rehab and daily on Acute Medical. f. Complete additional assessments as clinically indicated every shift and as needed (e.g., lines, drains, airways, and wounds [LDA], restraint, coach). g. Initiate, revise, continue or resolve care plans and write a care plan note reflecting the patient's progress toward goals at a minimum every shift. h. Document a progress note every shift to provide a narrative of any supplemental information including, but not limited to: i. shift events ii. physician notification iii. interventions and evaluation of patient's response to interventions Documentation of Care - Acute Unit File: C 3.X October 6, 2022, New LHH Nursing Policies and Procedures Page 3 of 8 iv. injuries, falls, or accidents v. critical labs and abnormal test results (e.g., xray) vi. medication errors vii. any pertinent, relevant information necessary for continuity of care i. Patient acuity will be documented before the end of every shift and reported to the nursing office. 2. Additional pertinent information about the patient will also be collected and documented as deemed appropriate by the RN, such as critical lab values and physician communication. 3. Allergies: observe for allergic reactions and adverse drug reactions during the patient's stay. For any new reactions, notify the physician. The physician adds new allergies and/or adverse drug reactions to the EHR allergy section. 4. Weekly assessments are determined by the patient's clinical condition and can include wound and behavior. Refer to K 1.0 Assessment, Prevention & Management of Pressure Ulcer/Pressure Injury, K 2.0 Wound Assessment and Management, and G 6.0 Behavioral Risk Assessment and Guidelines for Care Planning. 5. Psychotropic drugs require a consent and may use consents from a previous encounter (i.e., SNF admission). Monitor behavior every shift. Refer to policy 2510 Use of Psychotropic Medications and J 2.5 Monitoring Behavior and The Effects of Psychotropic Medications. 6. Document the use of interpreters. Refer to policy 2905 Interpreter Services and Language Assistance. C. PCA or HHA shift documentation : 1. Vital signs, pain, height and weight, consistent with unit frequency and as needed as directed by the RN. 2. Intake and output, except for nephrostomy output and enteral input/output, which is documented by the RN. 3. Activities of daily living 4. Daily Cares 5. Additional documentation as needed per patient condition or assignment (e.g., coach, restraint, etc.) 6. Notes: document any supplement data not noted in other areas as needed (e.g., nurse notifications, changes in condition, etc.) 7. When no PCA or HHA is available, the RN will perform the tasks and documentation. D. RN and LVN: 1. LVNs will be assigned to the Acute Unit only when attempts to staff with an RN or PCA has been exhausted. The LVN will never be assigned alone to the Acute Unit or as the Charge Nurse. 2. If an LVN or RN has not been oriented and is assigned to the Acute Unit, they may perform and document tasks within their scope of practice and consistent with tasks they can perform on a SNF unit (e.g, medication administration, wound dressing changes, etc.). They may not perform Acute specific tasks which require training or competencies, such as blood transfusions. Trained acute staff may provide a brief unit orientation to ensure safe practice. E. Plan of Care 1. Assessment : the RN will use a systematic approach to collecting and analyzing data about the patient. RN assessment and data gathered include sources such as physician notes, orders, nursing notes, allied health notes and information obtained from the patient/family. Documentation of Care - Acute Unit File: C 3.X October 6, 2022, New LHH Nursing Policies and Procedures Page 4 of 8 2. Diagnosis : the RN's clinical judgment about the patient's response to actual or potential health conditions or needs, including for discharge. 3. Outcomes/Planning : based on the assessment and diagnosis, the RN sets measurable and achievable short and longrange goals for the patient. a. The plan of care will include evidencebased care plans that are the most relevant to the patient/family and their clinical condition. b. The anticipated end date for those evidencebased care plans will be appropriate for the patient/family and their clinical scenario. c. Care plans are multidisciplinary (i.e., Social Services input in the Discharge planning care plan) 4. Implementation : nursing care is implemented according to the care plan. 5. Evaluation : the patient's status and effectiveness of the nursing care must be continuously evaluated, and the care plan modified as needed. a. Care plans will be resolved when they are no longer applicable to the patient. b. The progress to the patient's plan of care should be documented every shift in a care plan note and as needed per the patient's condition and status. F. Patient/Family Education Nurses will document patient/family education in the medical record. Documentation will include patient/family response and retention of information provided. G. Leave of Absence 1. When a patient leaves the hospital for a temporary period of time on a physician's written order, the patient's status is assessed and documented. 2. On return, a focused assessment of status, including the patient's reported adherence to medication or other therapeutic plan will be documented. H. Admissions 1. Notifications: a. Notify the physician and patient care team at the time the patient arrives. b. Notify Nursing Operations for off hours admissions. c.

These services include both non-specialty resident outreach and engagement services, as well as specialty substance use treatment services , in alignment with S an Francisco Health Network Behavioral Health Services (S FHN-BHS) and Medicare/MediCal standards. PURPOSE: 1. To establish Policies and Procedures through wh ich LHH Psychiatry clinicians deliver services for LHH residents with substance use disorders (SUDs). 2. To ensure that specialty substance treat ment services are evidence-based, including the use of co-occurring service models, modeled after a Drug Medi-Cal (DMC) Organizational Delivery System (ODS) Ou tpatient Program, and meet SFHN-BHS requirements. (The specialty su bstance treatment portion of STARS shall be referred to as \"DMC program\" below.) 3. To ensure that the results of services to residents with SUDs are meaningful and helpful to the residents and are communicated where appropriate to the at tending physician or the referral party. OVERVIEW: LHH STARS program is part of LHH Psychiat ry, which is a Clinical Service under LHH Medical Staff Services. The STARS program provides outpatient level non-specialty outreach efforts to engage LHH residents with SUDs in services, as well as specialty substance use treatment services (DMC program). The DMC program portion of STARS is modeled after the regulatory gu idelines of Drug-Medi-Cal (DMC), SFHN-BHS of San Francisco Department of Public Health, and T he Department of Health Care Services of California (DHCS). PHILOSOPHY: PHILOSOPHY: All STARS services are provided in alignm ent with the SFHN-BHS philosophy of care; elements include but are not limited to: Person centered Non-judgmental Evidence based StrengthStrengths based File: MSPP D08-07 LHH Services 05, 2022] Laguna Honda Departmental Policies and Proc edures P age 2 of Individually tailored Trauma informed Culturally sensitive Harm Reduction Promoting autonomy, optimism and hope Integrating care for bio-psycho-social-s piritual aspects of the whole person. PROCEDURE: I. Non-specialty outreach and engagement of resident with SUDs All LHH Psychiatry staff shall incorporate low barrier and welcoming approaches with the above philosophical principles in clinical encounters with re sidents with SUDs. This means any door is the right door, i.e. regardless of the types of clinic al services staff are providing (i.e. psychotropic medication management, m ental health services, neuropsychological and psychological services, behavioral consul tation and planning, health and behavioral interventions), screening and che cking in about substance use concerns (if any) are an integral part of the service. Depending on the resident's stages of change, clinicians may discuss with residents about their substance us e concerns under the context of these existing Psychiatry services, providing brief interventions if indicated and appropriate, as well as referring the re sident to specialty DMC program if indicated. Documentation for such non-specialty services for residents with SUDs shall be entered into the electronic health record (EHR) se ction designated for LHH Psychiatry, under non- substance treatment related se rvice areas (i.e., specialty mental health, non-specialty mental health, or primary care behavioral health service ar eas), in the LHH EHR. Such documentation can be accessed by L HH Resident Care Team members. II. Specialty Substance Treatme nt Program (DMC Program) DMC program treatment services (includi ng but not limited to : screening, assessment, treatment planning, in dividual and group coun seling services) and other substance recovery related services (e.g. motivati onal interviewing, harm reduction counseling) are provided by a team of LHH Psychiatry staff who are regi stered, licensed, or certified to provide substance use and/or mental health services in California. These services are provided under the direction of Chief of Psychiatr y, Behavioral Health Program Director , and designated STARS psychiatrist, and coordinated on a day-to-day basis by the STARS Clinical Coordinator.Behavioral Health Program Director or designee. The practice procedures outlined below are the general servic e delivery process. Staff will follow the steps as they are implemented duri ng the program development process. 1. Referral a. Any LHH residents with known, suspected, unresolved or histor y of substance use, or residents who exhibit substance use behav ior, with or without hi story of treatment, that may meet DSM-5 criteria fo r a SUD diagnosis (excluding nicotine- only use) shall be referred by the LHH Primary Physici an for SUD screening and/or treatment services via the E-Consult process for LHH Psychiatry. File: MSPP D08-07 LHH Services 05, 2022] Laguna Honda Departmental Policies and Proc edures P age 3 of b. Any LHH resident and/or family can request a substance use treatment screening/assessment for the re sident.

They File: MSPP D08-07 LHH Psychiatry Recovery Services 05, 2022] Laguna Honda Departmental Policies and Proc edures P age 4 of b. may also notify their currently assigned LH H Psychiatry provider, who can provide the service or make an inter nal referral, as appropriate. c. Residents may decline services by L HH Psychiatry clinicia ns for SUD related services, including screening, assessment or treatment. Resident participation in the DMC specialty SUD treatment program (DMC program) is voluntary. d. Designated LHH Psychiatr y triage staff will review the referral within one business day of the E-consult entry. Any referrals where substance use is a clinical concern will be assigned to a DMC progr am clinician for screening. e. The assigned clinician wil l review the resident's medical record and complete a screening within five (5) business days afte r being assigned, sooner if clinically indicated, unless the residents' specia l medical or other conditions warrants otherwise (the reasons for delayed scr eening and assessments need to be documented in the e-consult response and theLHH electronic health record (EHR ).) section designated for LHH Psychiatry. 2. Information Gathering a. a. The assigned clinician will collect in formation from the resident, medical records, staff, the LHH primary physici an, and other entities authorized by the resident. b. b.

This may include mild use disorders, SUD in remission, and if the resident is at risk for relapse without outpatient treatment. ii. Motivation for Treatment (stages of change model). iii. Physical and cognitive capacity to participate and benefit from receiving substance treatment. c. c. Until the resident is diagnosed with a s ubstance use disorder and agrees to specialty treatment, all initial docum entation will be entered into the EHR section designated for LHH Psychiatry, non- subst ance treatment related service areas (i.e .., specialty mental health, non-s pecialty mental health, or primary care behavioral health service areas ).), in the LHH EHR. d. For residents who are assessed to be appropriate for and who are able/willing and ready to participate in the specialty DM C program, the resident will be internally referred (within LHH Psychiatry) to and enrolled in the DMC program. The enrolling/treating SUD treatment provider may or may not be the same clinician who completes the init ial SUD screening.
