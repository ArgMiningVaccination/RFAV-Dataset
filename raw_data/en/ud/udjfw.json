Question: Intense fear or anxiety? Any solutions? So I was just getting ready for bed, snuggling up in my blankets, when I swore I heard someone walk by my room, down the stairs and into my kitchen. I heard fumbling around so I turned the lights on and woke my mom up (I m 20 and home for the summer). We searched most of the rooms together, but she couldn t help but think I m crazy. Here it is, an hour later, and I m still frustrated about it. I m intensely afraid with my door locked and lights on, I m even considering barricading it. This isn t the worst of it...I tightly clutch my mace walking alone once it starts getting dark, I get afraid to leave my house, I won t park in certain spots and I m too careful about certain areas...in my midwestern suburban area...and I m losing sleep over it.

Question: Hamster Rectally Bleeding? This morning I put my hamster, a syrian panda hamster who's 2 and a half years old, in her ball. When I went to get her back out, I noticed she was bleeding from her rectal area. We called our local vet immediately, who said to give her vitamins, and make sure the bleeding stopped. About half an hour later, it looked like the bleeding had stopped, and I put her back in her cage with fresh bedding, food, water, and the new vitamins. 6 hours passed and I just picked her up again to notice she's bleeding once again. I've got her wrapped up in a warm washcloth trying to get the bleeding to stop as I type. It's 1 AM, so calling our vet is a bad idea, and I'm very worried about my little hamster. What could be causing this, and how can I stop it/help her?Answers are greatly appreciated.Thank you! Question: Kenichi Ebina's outfit?

I have just gotten my first job and it is fast food. I have suffered from depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember.

It was all I could do to keep from breaking down into tears.I do not want to quit. It's only been two days! But I can't keep up with all the orders and I'm having a hard time remembering everything. I am currently working the fountain area so I make the drinks, slushies, and ice cream stuff. Things need to be clocked out fast and I just keep losing track of things or I mess something up or forget to add something to one of the drinks and each time it happens I want to break down. I can't remember all the different combos for the milkshakes, blasts, etc. There are just so many. And when I did try to make a milkshake the ice cream went everywhere. And I've messed up some of the orders and got the servers yelled at by customers, making them unhappy with me. And then I get even more stressed and panicked which makes me mess up more.What should I do? I really need help.

I'm a late teen female..I'm in college and I live at home with my parents.I thought I knew what I wanted to major in, but now I am confused and I feel like my depression is affecting my decisions (I can't figure out what major will make me happy and I now hate everything). Bad idea to work when depressed? I'm having a hard time going out, but I don't want anyone to know I am depressed (been depressed for years and it's getting worse). It's hard for me to socialize and I no longer have friends..The people in my city (kids from high school and families) bullied and talked bad about me (made sick rumors that weren't true). I want to move but I am too depressed to go out and I'm not ready to leave home financially & mentally, and I'm trying to make my way through college even though it's getting so much harder cause my depression is getting worse & I am not sure what to major in. Another problem is that I can't sneak depression meds cause of health problems (ulcers in my stomach/medicine will make me throw up everyday). Should I work while depressed and in a place where I have to face the people that bullied me? What should I do? I have thoughts of how I wish I was dead everyday, but I am still able to laugh & smile every so often so I am not sure if I am depressed but maybe sad deep inside. Anyways,based on all my randomness what do you guys think I should do with my life right now? & no I don't need to talk to a psychologist...

What do you get when you have a new roommate and 3 new male cats to introduce to your 2 girl cats? Hey! So... I ve had two female cats, Dolly and Daisy, going on two years now, they were litter mates and best friends. They cuddle, follow each other around the house, groom each other, and even tended to eachother s spaying scars since they could reach their own due to their cones (much to my dismay.)I recently had a close friend of mine move in and she has three male cats-- Max and Shadow are about 12 years old, and Chance who is about a year old.It s been about 24 hours, Shadow and Max will not leave her room-- but Chance loves to be out and about! Dolly will let him close enough but too close and she ll hiss. Daisy on the other hand... She hid inside the sofa for 14 hours and can t let any cat within 10 feet of her without freaking out! She won t let her sister Dolly near, and she s reluctant to let any human but me near her. She clings to me if I let her though.Anyone have any tips for soothing the atmosphere? And most concerning... Anyone know why Daisy and Dolly now hiss and swat at each other? I miss them being best friends and attached to each other!! :( Question: Where is clipboard?

For the past couple years I've felt weird. Its only starting to worry me now because it's a constant thing for me now and it's getting worse. I have an anxiety problem so It might just be anxiety. It started when I randomly started feeling exhausted. Before, I was an active runner (I ran at least 5 miles a day and also did sports for 11 hours a week in season) and felt great. Then I started feeling all these symptoms. I feel like im not all the way alert and heat makes it way worse. If it's hot outside, my hands and calves tingle like they're asleep. It used to just be my hands and feet. I also feel like my hands swell up but they aren't. It hurts but it doesn't at the same time. I can't walk in a straight line either. My hands and feet always tingle but it's worse when it's hot. I can't take baths for longer than ten minutes even if it's only a tad bit over 100 degrees (f). My whole body falls asleep (tingles) and I collapse. Like my legs physically give out from underneath me and I can't really move at all. The closest thing I can compare it to is the feeling of being smoking alot of weed but I'm completely sober at the time (I smoke occassionally). When I cool off, I'm fine. I am a competetive swimmer and swimming laps makes me go numb and feel like jello. I can barely move but I'm not sore at all. Other than all that I'm just tired a lot and my muscles are sore a lot (when I'm not working out). Is this normal?

When i walk on the street or at school (around people that i dont know and are at my age or around it) im really insecure about the way i look and im shy as well. Im really paranoid when walking past people because they may be talking about the way I look or even laughing at me.

I'd rather have a girl answer this one if you can. Question: I have *extremely* painful period cramps but my mom doesn't believe me so I don't know what to do? Now just so you know, when I say painful, I mean they are INSANE. I can't move, can't walk, can't sleep, can't eat. This includes nausea, headaches, vomiting, fainting spells, and I can't get myself out of the house. When I do, I usually have to come back home because it's just too painful and embarrassing to sit on the floor of a washroom stall and hug my knees. I try home remedies like hot bottles and Advil as well as the dietary tricks but nothing works, every month it's the same story for 2-3 days. I'm afraid this will effect my jobs and relationships since I sometimes skip school as it is or leave early. My mom however, seemed to have it easy when she was younger because she never had cramps apparently. She thinks that I'm over exaggerating with the pain levels and that I need to suck it up and become a part of society. As a result she won't let me go to a doctor or take any prescription stuff, she barely even let's me have Tylenol. I have to call my dad if I need to leave school because my mom doesn't believe me.

Question: My cat is a sweetheart - however he's a very sloppy, greedy eater and I don't know what to do any more!? I adopted non feral bonded sibling felines as a young adults.When the male cat eats, the food gets all over my floor. He would grab his wet or dry food by his mouth, literally tosses it mid-air during feeding which proceeds to fall on the floor and eats it off the ground. I had to buy extra food so that would'nt happen again, I have put a placemat under his bowl.Did not work - he keeps making a mess; he sticks his paw into his bowl, drags it and food falls on and outside of the placemat before and while he's eating, again in mid-air.I tried numerous times to show him how to eat without spillage but to no avail.His sister is grazer: she nibbles her cat food, and then goes to play, then goes back to nibble some more, but is a very neat eater. I've had cats of both genders over the years before -they didn't eat like my current male cat.I elevated his food bowl because unlike normal cats that crouches down to eat , he semi stands up while greedily feeding his face.(Sometimes I'd catch him trying to eat his sister's food after he devours his. His greed has caused me to feed them in different areas of the apartment while monitoring them.That did not work either - he still makes a big mess and drags his bowl. I love him dearly and get that all cats aren't the same but it's very frustrating and I'm at my wits end.Any intellegent suggestions would be of great help. I hope the conditioning he picked up before I adopted him can be somewhat modified. Question: I had trouble breathing? The day before yesterday I was pulling an all nighter and was planning to sleep at night the day after. I drank 3 energy drinks in the 24 hours I was trying to stay awake in. In the afternoon my heart started to feel a bit heavy but I thought it was nothing. Around 30 minutes later my breathing started to become short, like I had to take really deep breaths to catch it which hurt my chest, so I started to panick a bit. I tried to calm myself down and tried to look for one of my mom's inhalers if she had left any. (she had asthma) which I couldn't find any inhalers left ( I'm guessing she used them all) so I panicked even more and my brother noticed me and asked what's wrong, I told him blah blah blah and he called my dad from work and while we were waiting he gave me a steam thing that my mom used to use whenever she couldn't breathe well. After I went to the hospital and they didn't tell me what's wrong and whatnot, I think I was shaking a lot and at one point I couldn't move my hand, like it was paralyzed. I think they drugged me and I went to sleep and after that I was fine, my breathing was 80% better , I still have to take deep breaths every now and then, but they don't hurt right now. A day later (today/now) my body is so tired (even after I slept for 12 hours) and still, the deep breaths. I don't know whether I have asthma like my mom did, or it was a simple panick attack but it I'm worried about my health. (Hospital didn't tell me anything) I'm a 14 year old girl.

Question: How can I get my swollen pinky toe to go down? The other day I was cleaning my room and I put a 10 pound weight on my desk. It rolled off and fell on my pinky toe.

I have a little on one cheek and on the other I have a good bit but not white heads. Mainly just scars or acne without any heads. I have a few places on my jaw but not many. I have a majority of my acne on my forehead. I have like 2-3 white heads and the rest are just scars or acne with no heads. I wash my face everyday 2 times a day. And I have a acne treatment that keeps it from getting bad. So I rarely get big bumps. Just have a decent amount of small ones. And I have oily skin so it dosent help. My nose is the main spot that's oily. And beside my nose and a very lil on my cheeks. My forehead gets oily to but it's not to bad but it's bad enough to make me worry. Do these things matter to girls. I mean I'm a athlete in good shape and very tall but my confidence is basicly dead. I get worried I'm gonna get rejected because of it. When I'm with my friends I'm charismatic and have a great personality but when I get around girls I like I get shy and self conscious and scared to get rejected because of acne. How do I deal with this? How much does this matter to girls? And on a side note if anyone has any ways to help the oily skin Lmk. Thanks! Question: Opinions on a romantic relationship between twins in a story? I've asked this question previously,about boy/girl twins who have only ever had each other throughout their lives entering a romantic relationship.They are 17,so still quite young and naive.While they kiss several times and fall in love with each other,they never engage in a sexual relationship.They know in their hearts that its wrong,but they want so badly to be together.They do eventually decide to move on,they date other people but continue longing for each other for the rest of their lives,never having each other.This is not a main plot for my story,they are not main characters,but because I consider each character important,I'm looking for some opinions on these particular two.Yes,its weird and uncomfortable.I know that.My story is a fantasy story,where things are slightly more acceptable,but obviously there is no happy ending for them.I finished the story about a week ago,and I'm planning to edit the first draft next week(I usually leave 2 weeks between finishing and editing)and while I dont intend to edit their relationship,if it'll bring the book down,i'll consider editing certain parts.Please be completely honest with your thoughts.Incest is a new subject to me.Do you personally think a romantic storyline between TWINS would affect/ruin a book?Its aimed at teens/young adults, and also has a relationship between a 16 year old girl and a 21 year old man (Remember,fantasy story)but as I'm not fond of writing about sex,its mostly chemistry.Opinions?Thanks Question: If I make $11hr n worked only 4 days how much is my pay?

Ok I recently finished building my new PC, there is one problem wich I just can't solve.On my new PC build everything is new, EXCEPT HDD AND DVD/CD ROM, and I'm guessing it's one of those two but don't know which one.A Drive: When ever want to install a game, either it tells me an installer error, either the setup file is corrupted or an CRC error. What's weird its that the CD or DVD is clean no smudges or scratches? Also I've noticed that having the CD/DVD ROM connected, gives me blue screens occasionally or just random PC reboots? Having the CD/DVD rom disconnected, computer seems more stable even though an external CD/DVD rom gave me an error? (External drive usually works way better)B HDD: Another theory is my hard drive, even though I've tested the hard drive and it game me a \"Pass\" and a \"healthy\" status on it, the Isue is sometimes installed programs crash or don't open (just turned the pc on and catalyst control center crashes), once copied a file from a usb to the desktop, gave me an error (recents have been sucessful)Now I've tested the following:RAM - Pass HDD - PassWhat could it be?
