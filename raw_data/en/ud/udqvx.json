BEFORE SYNTHETIC REPELLENTS WERE DEVELOPED IN 1929,PEOPLE routinely used natural compounds to protect against insect bites. During World War II, however, the United States governmentbegan testing more than 20,000 mosquito repellents to protecttroops traveling to tropical areas. As a result, a highly effective syn-thetic repellent (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide or DEET) was devel-oped in 1953 and arrived on the market in 1956. 1Currently, DEET is the most popular commercial insect repellent, with close to 250formulations sold worldwide. Despite its effectiveness, many consumers are reluctant to apply synthetic chemicals to their skin and seek natural alternatives to syn-thetic repellents. This desire has been exacerbated by reports thatDEET is dangerous for children, possibly inducing encephalitis.These cases are extremely rare (17 suspected cases worldwidereported to date) 2and occurred in children that orally ingested DEET or were repeatedly exposed to high concentrations.3Nonethe- less, many would rather err on the side of caution. Commercially available insect repellents fall into one of two classes: synthetic chemicals or plant-derived essential oils.4Current- ly, there are only five active ingredients registered for topical use inthe United States: two are plant-derived alternative that has sparked particular attention of late is oil of lemon eucalyptus. In fact, the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) recently reported that oil of lemoneucalyptus (PMD is the active ingredient) is one of only three prod-ucts (DEET, picaridin, and PMD) recommended to protect againstWest Nile virus, a serious virus spread by mosquitoes that can causeneurological disease or even death. 5The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lists PMD as effective against mosquitoes, bitingflies, and gnats. 6 Volume 8 Number 8 \u007f August 2005 \u007f Pages 85-96INSIDE Use of hawthorn for mild congestive heart failure page 89 Yoga for prevention of cardiovascular diseases page 92 On pains and needles (acupuncture for fibromyalgia) page 96Thomson American Health Consultants Home Page\u2014 www.ahcpub.com CME for Physicians\u2014 www.cmeweb.com Alternative Medicine Alert is available on-line.

Botany and Pharmacology Eucalyptus ssp. is a genus of trees and shrubs in the family Myrtaceae that originated in Australia, but nowcommonly grows in almost all tropical and subtropicalareas. Eucalyptus trees are characterized by verticallyhanging, white, leathery leaves and ragged bark. 7There are close to 600 species of eucalyptus, one of which isEucalyptus citriodora Hook. E. citriodora is also known as citron-scented gum, lemon eucalyptus, lemon-scentedgum, Corymbia citriodora , and spotted E. citri- credited with anti-inflammatory, anti- bacterial, and antifungal activity; and, recently hasgained popularity as an insect repellent. 8 E. citriodora leaves contain many compounds with pesticide activity been identified as the compound that provides the strongestinsect protection in this plant. Of note, E. citriodora also contains citronellol, which is the active ingredientin oil of citronella products. Oil of citronella, however, isnot obtained from E. citriodora , rather from perennial grasses indigenous to tropical Asia C. nardus and C. winterianus ). 9Oil of citronella is reported to haveconsiderably shorter repellent times than DEET and PMD alternatives, with complete protection times averaging only about 20 minutes at concentrations of10%. 4 Research Studies In the late 1980s, a worldwide survey was conducted by the U.S. military to identify repellents not producedin the United States. Of the 65 formulations not pro-duced in the United States, 33 contained DEET and theremainder contained natural oils or undisclosed ingredi-ents. One of the natural formulas identified was quwen-ling. This formula sparked the interest of researchersbecause it had become China's repellent of choice. 10 Quwenling was made from the waste distillate afterextraction of lemon eucalyptus oil; the main ingredientin PMD. 11Quwenling has been a pop- ular insect repellent in China for more than twodecades. 1 As mentioned previously, PMD is the main ingredient in quwenling; however, products containing PMD arerelatively new to the U.S. market. There is a paucity ofinformation on the efficacy of these products in peer-reviewed literature. This will likely change over time asPMD is more widely used and evaluated in the UnitedStates. Results of studies from the current literature arediscussed in the next several paragraphs. Schreck et al studied the effectiveness of quwenling through a series of tests that involved application ofquwenling (30% active ingredients, or AI) on the fore-arm of a volunteer, from the wrist to the elbow. 9After 15 minutes, the volunteer's arm (a protective glove coveredthe hand) was exposed sequentially for three minutes infour cages, each containing 200 blood-hungry were also taken to the Everglades National Park to test the repellent in anauthentic environment. Treated arms were exposed con-tinuously to the natural environment to calculate timeuntil first bite. The same tests were done with a DEETstandard (15% AI) and the two repellents were thencompared. Collectively, the results from these series oftests suggested that quwenling was not as effective asDEET in terms of duration of protection: The meannumber of hours until the first bite by Aedes aegypti was 1.1 hours with quwenling and 4.8 hours with DEET. Fradin et al compared several different insect repel- lents on the national market by using arm-in-cage stud-ies with variable protocols depending on the time at firstbite. 4This study reported that 11 of 12 non-DEET repel- lents had mean protection times from August 2005Alternative Medicine Alert , ISSN 1096-942X, is published monthly by Thomson American Health Consultants, 3525Piedmont Rd., NE, Bldg. 6, Suite 400, Atlanta, GA 30305.

After the study was started, a new botanicalproduct was introduced in the United States under thetrade names of Repel Lemon Eucalyptus Insect Repel-lent (Wilson Pharmaceutical Company) and Fite BitePlant Based Insect Repellent (Travel Medicine). Theauthors evaluated this product using the same methodthat they used for the products originally specified in thestudy using six test subjects. The lemon eucalyptusrepellent had a mean protection time of 120 minutes,which made it the most effective of all non-DEET repel-lents tested in this study and more effective than low-concentration DEET products (6.65% and lower); how-ever, the concentration of lemon eucalyptus or PMD wasnot stated in the study. Another important point from thisstudy was that wristband repellents were not effective,regardless of the formula. 4 In 2002, Barnard et al tested IR3535, Everglades National Park. 12During seven, three-minute observation periods over six hours, bites were surveyed on test subjects. ThePMD repellent had a mean complete protection time of3.7 hours (compared to 5.6 hours with DEET) and anoverall mean percent repellency of 89%. Authors statedthat all three non-DEET repellents were effective insectrepellents for human use. In 2004, Barnard and Xue tested 12 commercially available synthetic and treated forearms to three-minute cage exposures every 30 minutes until thesubject received two or more mosquito bites in the sameobservation period or one bite in two consecutive obser-vation periods. 11When estimated mean time of protec- tion was averaged over the three species, Repel LemonEucalyptus Insect Repellent (26% oil of lemon eucalyp-tus or 65% PMD) provided more than seven hours ofprotection from mosquitoes of these species. Repel'sprotection time was comparable to the 15% DEET for-mula in the study. Similarly, Govere et al reported that 0.574 g of quwenling (Mosiguard was comparable to15% arabiensis mosquitoes in their arm-in-cage study. 13Both formulas protected against this species of mosquitoes for 5-6hours of one-minute, hourly cage exposures. Trigg also found spray, gel, and stick formulations of 50% PMD effective against An. gambiae and An. funes- tusmosquitoes in the field in Tanzania. 14Their results,however, are misleading: They reported six hours and 42 minutes average time until first bite when the first fivehours were spent unexposed to mosquitoes before thetrial began at 10 pm. Once they went into the field wherethe experiment tool place, it took an average of one hourand 42 minutes using PMD spray compared to one hourand 55 minutes using DEET spray until the first bite wasreceived. Hadis et al reported comparable efficacy of DEET and PMD (greater then 90% for both) in terms of meannumber of bites and average percent protection at con-centrations of 40% and 75%, respectively, against Man- sonia mosquitoes. 15They did not compare time until first bite for the different repellents, but rather the overalleffectiveness during the test period (from 7:00 to 7:30pm) in Pugnudo, Ethiopia. Both the time to first bite andthe average number of bites over a time period areimportant in terms of disease protection. Recently, it has also been shown that burning E citri- odora leaves could provide a cost-effective means of household protection in addition to mosquito nets insub-Sahara Africa where 90% of deaths from malariaoccur and much of the exposure time is before individu-als go to bed (where they are protected by mosquitonets) in the evening. 16 Mechanism of Action Curiously, none of the above articles discussed the mechanism by which PMD repels insects. The mode ofaction of many repellents is unclear, but it is believedthat these products do not repel insects, they simplymask or confuse the attractive signals that humans emitso that mosquitoes are unable to locate us. Mosquitoeshave specific sensory receptors that provide them withthe information they need to detect a source, orient to it,and travel to it to sample a blood meal. Host location isdetermined by many factors including lactic acid,ammonia, carbon dioxide, octenol, phenols, tempera-ture, and humidity. 17For example, DEET interferes with the transmission of spikes from a lactic acid-excitedneuron stimulated by lactic acid from a host. 16The pre- cise mechanism for PMD has not been reported. Adverse Effects All pesticides distributed or sold in the United States must be registered by the EPA. To be registered, themanufacturer must present scientific studies showingthat they can be used without posing unreasonable risksto humans or the environment. As part of the registra-tion process, the EPA collects and reviews a completeset of studies from the pesticide producers describing the health and environmental effects of the product. Alternative Medicine Alert 87Accordingly, the EPA imposes regulations to manage any of the risks the pesticide might pose. PMD was reg-istered with the EPA as a product that can be usedagainst public health pests in March of 2000. 18 In animal studies evaluated by the EPA during the registration process of PMD, the only adverse effect thatPMD showed was eye irritation. 6Eye irritation, howev- er, has not been reported in peer-reviewed, epidemiolog-ic literature. However, one peer-reviewed research studyreported that a subject experienced significant skin irri-tation at the site of application. 4 There are special warning labels on products contain- ing PMD advising users not to get the product in theireyes and to avoid spraying directly on or near the face.Users are also advised not to use PMD on the faces orhands of small children. 6PMD is not to be used on chil- dren younger than three years of age (the product hasnot been adequately tested in this population). 19 Dosage and Formulation There are a few oil of lemon eucalyptus repellents on the market in the United States. EPA-registered lemoneucalyptus repellents include: Repel Lemon EucalyptusInsect Repellent Lotion and Lotion, SurvivorLemon Eucalyptus Insect Repellent Lotion, and Off!Botanicals Insect Repellent. Repel Lemon EucalyptusInsect Repellent Lotion and Spray Lotion and SurvivorLemon Eucalyptus Insect Repellent contain 30% note, commer-cial products contain a synthetic PMD molecule, but theactive ingredient was originally isolated from waste dis-tillate of lemon eucalyptus oil extract. 11 In general, it appears that PMD is roughly half as effective as DEET by level of concentration; therefore, a30% PMD product would be about as effective as a 15%DEET product. Keep in mind, however, that the innateattractiveness of human subjects to mosquitoes rangesfrom 30% to 70%; therefore, different concentrationsand intervals of application may be effective dependingon the individual. 20 Important Information on Using Pesticides Patients should be particularly vigilant between dusk and dawn\u2014the prime mosquito-biting hours\u2014andshould follow instructions on the product label carefully.General instructions specified by the EPA are as follows:only apply repellents to exposed skin and/or clothing;never use repellents over cuts, wounds, or irritated skin;do not apply to eyes and mouth; apply sparingly aroundears; when using sprays do not spray directly onto face(spray on hands first and then apply to face); do notallow children to handle the products and do not apply to children's hands; do not spray in enclosed areas; avoidbreathing a repellent spray; do not use repellent nearfood; after returning indoors, bathe or wash treated skinwith soap and water; and finally, always store repellentsand pesticides out of the reach of children (regardless ofwhether they are botanical or synthetic). 21When using an insect repellent, the EPA recommends that usersalways check the container to make sure that the producthas an \"EPA-approved\" label and registration number.Patients should always read the label of any product theyare using, even if they have used the same productbefore, as safety and efficacy information is updated andreflected on product labels. 21 In case of a rash or an adverse reaction from a repel- lent, patients should: stop using the product, wash thearea with soap and water, and call the local poison con-trol center for guidance. If a severe reaction occurs,patients should call 911 and make sure to take the insectrepellent product to the hospital. 21 Conclusion and Recommendation In the United States, where the greatest disease threat from a mosquito bite is West Nile virus, PMD-basedrepellents are a safe and effective alternative to syntheticformulas; however, at concentrations tested, DEET for-mulas usually provided protection for a longer period oftime. When traveling to a tropical or malaria endemic area, it is still advisable to use a DEET repellent because oilof lemon eucalyptus has not been adequately testedagainst mosquitoes that spread malaria. DEET is thesafest, best studied, and longest-lasting repellent againstmalaria-carrying mosquitoes, according to the CDC.Refer to the CDC Travelers' Health web site(www.cdc.gov/travel/bugs.htm) for specific recommen-dations concerning protection from insects when travel-ing outside the United States. 19The CDC (www.cdc.gov) and EPA (www.epa.gov) are the mostreliable resources for updates on safety and efficacy ofall pesticides. associated with use of DEET insect repellents: A case analysis ofits toxicity 2001;20:8-14. 3.

Stuart Dickson Institute for Health Studies, Carolinas HealthCare System, Char-lotte, NC; he reports no consultant, stockholder, speaker's bureau,research, or other financial relationships with companies havingties to this field of study. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE (CHF)IS A CHRONIC ,USU- ally progressive condition that has a major impact on patients' quality of life and life expectancy. Smallexertions\u2014even walking a short distance on a flat sur-face\u2014can be extremely tiring. Edema of the lowerextremities can be painful and require prolonged eleva-tion and the use of compression garments. Most critical-ly, the long-term stress of the body's strategies to com-pensate for reduced cardiac efficiency\u2014hypertensionand accelerated heart rate\u2014creates a vicious cycle thattypically ends in progressive clinical deterioration anddeath. In Europe and the United States, the severity of CHF is classified according to the New York Heart Associa-tion's four-stage system (i.e., NYHA I-IV) (see Table) . The stages are defined practically, by the degree towhich a patient's normal activity is limited by CHF. It isnoteworthy that this system separates the impact of dis-ease from underlying physiologic functioning. As a con-sequence, many studies of CHF interventions focus onpractical outcome measures such as exercise toleranceor dyspnea, rather than more physiologic factors such asejection fraction (EF). Treatments for CHF typically seek either to reduce the burden on the heart, or to shore up the heart's func-tional capacity. Given the changeable nature of the dis-ease, the frequency of comorbid diseases (diabetes, renaldisease, essential hypertension) in CHF patients, and thenecessity of poly-drug therapy to aggressively meet andmaintain clinical targets, CHF patients typically requirerelatively intensive case management. This need is only Alternative Medicine Alert 89heightened by the potential for drug interactions and adverse reactions to agents that should be carefullytitrated (i.e., digoxin, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers). Pharmacology Hawthorn is an herbal remedy frequently used in tra- ditional Chinese medicine and by European naturo-paths and homeopaths to treat a variety of conditions,including the milder stages of CHF. 1Preparations are derived from the fruit, leaves, and flowers of trees andshrubs of the genus Crat\u00e6gus . Consumption by patients may be in the form of pills, tea, extract, or whole driedfruit. Among the key constituents are flavonoids andoligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPC), each of which ispresent in varying amounts in different parts of theplant. 2Hawthorn extracts are often formulated to contain standard amounts of the various constituents. A compound called WS 1442, among the most com-monly used in clinical studies, is standardized to 18.8%OPC. 3 Studies of the effect of hawthorn have focused on whole-plant extract, the flavonoid and OPC fractions,and individual components. Information on the pharma-codynamics of hawthorn compounds is speculative atbest, and animal studies are the source of most of thetheoretical data to date. There is some evidence thathawthorn may act through its effect on cyclic AMP,altering the sodium-calcium balance in cardiac tissue, asdo 4Another byendothelium-dependent arterial 5A third potential means of antioxi-dant and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis-enhancing proper-ties. 6These would have the effect of reducing cardiac ischemia, thus improving myocardial efficiency. (Note: A limitation in assessing the relative merits of these hypotheses, as well as the clinical studies ofhawthorn preparations, is that much of the research todate has been conducted outside the United States, andhas been reported in non-English-language journals[some with English abstracts] that are difficult to obtainin this country.) Clinical Evidence The possibility that hawthorn might be effective in reducing symptoms of mild CHF is especially appeal-ing. Early treatment of the disease is often deferred orused to a suboptimal extent because of the side effects ofmany of the drugs currently in use. If another agent thatcombined similar clinical results with fewer side effectswere available, better preservation of routine function-ing might be possible for a greater number of patientsand for a longer time. The best available evidence of clinical efficacy is a meta-analysis published in 2003 by Pittler et al. 3It included results from eight randomized trials thatenrolled a total of 632 patients. With one exception (see Tauchert below) participants had NYHA Class I or II heart failure. Most studies were of short duration (range,3-16 weeks), and all but one used WS 1442 in dailydoses ranging from 160 mg to 1,800 mg. Common studyendpoints were maximal workload in watts (W) (fourstudies, 310 patients) and pressure-heart rate product(defined as units of systolic blood pressure [mm Hg]multiplied by heart rate per minute, the quantity thendivided by 100) (six studies, 264 patients). In most stud-ies, participants' use of other medications was notrestricted, and typically included a number of otheragents that might influence CHF symptoms. The resultof the meta-analysis showed a significant improvementin maximal workload among patients receivinghawthorn (weighted mean difference 7 W, 95% confi-dence interval [CI] 3-11 W), and in pressure-heart rateproduct (weighted mean difference -20, 95% CI -32 to -8). These findings remained when the analysis was lim-ited to studies in which participants were known to havebeen taking other cardioactive medications. Improve-ments were also noted in exercise tolerance. A widerange of side effects was reported, the most common ofwhich was vertigo (n = 8). A later study not included by Pittler et al was pub- lished by Degenring and colleagues in 2003. 7They ran- domly assigned 143 patients with NYHA Class II CHFto an extract of two species of fresh hawthorn berries orplacebo. The dose was reported as milligrams of OPC,but would standardize to between 200 mg and 650 mg ofwhole hawthorn extract per day. Treatment continued 90 August 2005Table NYHAclassifications for congestive heart failure Class I Patients with no limitation of activities; they suffer no symptoms from ordinary activities. Class II Patients with slight, mild limitation of activity; they are comfortable with rest or with mild exertion. Class III Patients with marked limitation of activity; they are comfortable only at rest. Class IV Patients who should be at complete rest, confined to bed or chair; any physical activity brings on discomfort and symptoms occur at rest. for approximately two months. The primary outcome was exercise tolerance, as determined by bicycle ergo-metry. Concomitant medications were not permittedbeginning four weeks before enrollment in the study. At the end of the treatment period, there was a statisti-cally significant difference in exercise tolerance in favorof the hawthorn group (mean -8.3, 95% CI -16.3 to -0.3). Similar proportions of hawthorn and placebopatients (13% hawthorn, 15% placebo) reported mild-to-moderate side effects, most of which were judged by study physicians as unlikely to be consequences oftreatment. Another report, for which full details were not imme- diately available in English, gave interim analysis resultsfor the WISO cohort trial. 8A total of 952 patients with NYHA Class II CHF were enrolled, of whom 588received hawthorn treatment. Treatment assignment wasnot random, and there were meaningful differences inthe two groups with respect to age, sex, and concomitantmedications. For the interim analysis, 130 matched pairsof patients were identified. At the time of the interimanalysis, treatment had been ongoing for two years onaverage. Comparison of the hawthorn and non-hawthorngroups showed statistically significant improvements infatigue, stress dyspnea, and palpitations, although defi-nitions of these symptoms were not provided. Theauthor also noted that hawthorn patients received fewerconcomitant cardiac medications, but this may havebeen due to factors such as patient preference, which inturn would have influenced patients' self-assignment tohawthorn or conventional therapy. A strength of thesefindings is that they represent \"real-world\" experience\u2014not the carefully controlled conditions of most clinicaltrials. A study included in the Pittler meta-analysis, but worth mentioning individually is that by Tauchert, pub-lished in 2002. 9This study randomized 209 patients with Class III CHF 1,800 mg of WS 1442,900 mg of WS 1442, or placebo. Patients with more orless severe CHF, those treated with digitalis in the previ-ous six months, and those with serious cardiac or othercomorbidities were excluded. Treatment continued for16 weeks, after which maximal workload was assessedby bicycle ergometry. Findings included an increase inmaximal workload in the 1,800 mg group as comparedto the other two, and improvement in a scale score oftypical heart failure symptoms in both hawthorn groupsas compared to placebo. Patients in the placebo groupreported adverse effects twice as often as those in eitherhawthorn group. While it is impressive to see results inClass III CHF similar to those shown in milder stages,this study's findings should be viewed in light of thehomogeneity of the study population and the funding of the study by a manufacturer of hawthorn extract. Conclusion Overall, the available evidence appears to suggest that there is some benefit to patients with mild CHFfrom the use of hawthorn extract. However, this evi-dence must be weighed against its limitations. Given thenature of CHF, it has proven difficult to conduct a studyin patients with no major comorbidities and no signifi-cant concomitant medications. Given the lack of clarityas to hawthorn's exact mechanism of action, it is notpossible to say what other medications may confound,potentiate, or attenuate its apparent effect. It seems rea-sonable to assume that such effects would most likely beseen with coadministration of hawthorn and other car-dioactive drugs. (It should be noted that at least onesmall study has found that coadministration of hawthornand digoxin, with careful attention to dosing, appears tobe safe. 10) The concentration of studies in Germany also brings into question the reproducibility of their findingsin other more diverse populations. Finally, the wide range of dosages leaves open the question of how much is needed to achieve clinical benefit. The studies reviewed by Pittler et al used dosesranging from 160 mg to 1,800 mg per day. Thereappears to be a trend toward higher doses in morerecently published studies, but the current evidence baseoffers little guidance as to appropriate thresholds forefficacy and safety. Recommendation No study published to date has shown significant harm from the use of hawthorn. Used carefully in apatient population that is likely to have fairly regularphysician supervision, it should present no major risksand may offer therapeutic benefit. There is inadequateevidence as yet as to how it works, and many hypothe-sized mechanisms. Because of this, hawthorn should notbe assumed to stand in for all of the potential agents thatmight be used together to manage CHF. Even if the useof hawthorn moderates some physical symptoms, it ismost often still advisable to take other medications (suchas antihypertensives) concomitantly. As has beenemphasized before in this publication, it is critical forthe treating clinician to have a clear picture of what thepatient is taking, both prescription and over-the-counteragents. Given the focus on functional status in gradingCHF, this physician-patient communication will helpestablish response to treatment and have the added bene-fit of making the patient's concerns and preferencesclear.

Yoga for Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases By Yoon-Hang Kim, MD, MPH, DABMA Dr. Kim practices integrative medicine in San Jose, CA; he reports no consultant, stockholder, speaker's bureau, research, or otherfinancial relationships with companies having ties to this field ofstudy. CARDIOV ASCULAR DISEASES (CVD )ARE THE MOST common cause of mortality in the United States.Approximately 70 million people in the United States have some form of CVD, and in 2002 CVD accountedfor 38% of all deaths in the United States. 1Despite advances in therapeutic procedures and medications, themorbidity and mortality from CVD continue to burdensociety. The American College of Cardiology's sponsor-ship of its first course on complementary and alternativemedicine (CAM) in 2003 is an indication of growinginterest among medical professionals in employing vari-ous CAM modalities to aid in the effective treatment ofcardiovascular diseases. 2 Yoga originated in India more than 2,000 years ago. In its original form, yoga was an integrated system ofpractice including spiritual, moral, and physical dimen-sions. The word yoga originates from a Sanskrit wordmeaning to unify or yoke, and implies a connectionbetween body, mind, and spirit. 3The table above lists the major methods of training in yoga described by theancient Vedic texts. 3 In addition to the major methods described in the above table, many specialized styles of yoga exist today.Transcendental meditation can be considered an exam-ple of a specialized form of yoga developed by Mahar-ishi Mahesh Yogi as a mind-body method of self-regula-tion. The protective benefits of transcendental medita-tion for CVD have been covered in a previous articleappearing in this newsletter (see the July 2002 issue of Alternative Medicine Alert ). 4 The practice of yoga has become extremely popular in the United States. Among the many styles, Hathayoga is the most popular. 5The practice of Hatha yoga postures ( asanas ) and breathing techniques (pranayama ), with meditation often practiced in the beginning and at the end of Hatha yoga classes. A tele-phone survey conducted in 1998 by Saper et al revealedthat an estimated 15 million American adults have usedyoga at least once in their lifetime and 7.4 million during 92 August 2005Table Types of yoga described in ancient Vedic texts3 Name Emphasis Bhakti yoga Spirituality and devotionJnana yoga WisdomKarma yoga Services without selfish motiveRaja yoga Mastery of mind through focused concentration Dhyana yoga MeditationMantra yoga Repetition of sacred wordsHatha yoga Balancing of physical and mental energies the previous year. Yoga was used for both wellness and specific health conditions, often with perceived benefit.6 Mechanism of Action Western scientific exploration of yoga was stimulated by extraordinary feats achieved by yoga masters. Thefollowing are two examples of such feats performed byyoga masters where no scientific explanation exists. Thefirst was documented in 1973; a single yogi remained inan underground pit for eight days, with an absence ofelectrical activity in the EKG during the period. 7He was then removed and shown upon examination to be ingood health. In the second case, documented in 1982,practitioners of a Tibetan form of Buddhist meditation,g-Tum-mo yoga, increased the temperature of their dig-its by 5-15\u00b0 C. 8Both examples suggest that yoga train- ing could provide an advanced practitioner voluntarycontrol of the autonomic system. In 2004, Telles et alconducted a clinical trial to investigate the ability to vol-untarily reduce the heart rate after one month of yogapractice. 9In this study, the yoga group was given instruction whereas the control group received noinstruction. At the end of one month, the yoga group wasable to reduce their heart rate by an average of 10.7 beatsper minute compared to the control group (P < 0.05).The significance of this study is that the heart rate, anautonomic function, can be modulated in a novice prac-titioner with one month of yoga training. A common pathway for the effect of regular yoga practice appears to be the autonomic nervous system;specifically, yoga practice decreases sympathetic activi-ty and activity resulting indecreased catecholamine and cortisol secretion. 5It appears that various components of yoga practice, suchas meditation, postures, and breathing exercises, individ-ually can result in the described autonomic changes.Telles et al conducted another study investigating themeditative aspect of yoga, comparing a group mentallychanting \"om\" to a random thinking group. 10The om meditation group had decreased heart rates compared tothe random thinking group. Madanmohan et al conduct-ed a study investigating the postural aspects of yogapractice using the shavasana position and demonstratedboth decreased sympathetic activity and increasedparasympathetic activity. 11Udapa et al conducted a study investigating the effect of yoga breathing vs. nointervention (control group) and also demonstrateddecreased sympathetic activity and increased parasym-pathetic activity. 12Luciano et al conducted a study com- paring the effect of yoga mantra recitation vs. Ave Mariaprayer. 13The results demonstrated that both recitations of the rosary and yoga mantras slowed breathing to sixbreaths per minute resulting in enhanced heart rate vari- ability. Lastly, Raghuraj et al described the ability toincrease or decrease sympathetic activity by utilizingtwo different types of yogic breathing known as kapal-abhati (breathing at high frequency) vs. nadisuddhi(alternate nostril breathing). 14The kapalabhati was found to increase sympathetic activity while nadisuddhiwas found to decrease sympathetic activity. Clinical Evidence An early study documenting the benefits of yoga for hypertension was conducted in 1975 by Patel. 15The trial compared an intervention group and an age- and gender-matched control group where 12 hypertensive patients inthe intervention group were treated by yoga and biofeed-back for 12 months. Results showed a statistically sig-nificant reduction in blood pressure in the group usingyoga and biofeedback compared to the control group. There are a large number of non-randomized, uncon- trolled studies providing foundational support for thebenefits of yoga for cardiovascular risk reduction, par-ticularly in reducing blood pressure. However, manystudies lack the rigor of a randomized controlled trial. In1984, Sundar et al conducted an intervention studydemonstrating that six months of yoga practice results instatistically significant reductions in systolic and dias-tolic blood pressure. 16In 1997, Schmidt et al reported results of an interventional study demonstrating that acomprehensive residential three-month yoga and medi-tation program where participants lived on a low-fatvegetarian diet reduced body mass index, cholesterol,and blood pressure. 17In 2002, Damodaran et al conduct- ed an intervention study involving three months of yogapractice, which resulted in decreased blood pressure,cholesterol, and blood sugar. 18In addition, decreases in vanillylmandelic acid catecholamine and malondialde-hyde levels were documented, suggesting decreasedsympathetic activity and decreased oxidative stress. In2004, Singh et al conducted a yoga intervention study onType 2 diabetic patients, demonstrating reduction ofpulse rate, blood pressure, and fasting glucose level. 19In 2005, Bijlani et al conducted a comprehensive lifestyleeducation program based on yoga lasting 10 days. 20At trial's end, the authors reported a reduction in fastingblood glucose and cholesterol. Overall, the results of thestudies are consistent for improvement of risk profile fordeveloping CVD in as little as 10 days of yoga training.However, the significance of the studies is reduced asthey employ pre-post design rather than more rigorousrandomized, controlled methodology. It is also impor-tant to note that the above trials integrated the physicalpractice of yoga with a more complete yogic lifestyle. Alternative Medicine Alert 93Another non-randomized study that has important implications was conducted by Bharshankar et al com-paring 50 sedentary subjects with 50 yoga practitionersage 40 years and older. 21Blood pressure was positively correlated with age in both groups, but results of thestudy showed that yoga practitioners had a lower pulserate (P < 0.001) and lower systolic and diastolic bloodpressure (P < 0.01). The significance of this study is thatyoga appears to reduce the age-related deterioration incardiovascular functions. However, the groups were notage-matched, which decreases the strength of theauthors' conclusions. In 2000, Murugesan et al conducted a randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of yoga practiceon the management of hypertension. 22Thirty-three sub- jects were randomly assigned to three groups. The firstgroup participated in yoga practice, the second groupreceived antihypertensive medications, and the thirdgroup received no treatment. The results demonstratedthat both the yoga and antihypertensive medicationgroups achieved reduction in blood pressure, heart rate,and body weight compared to the control group receiv-ing no treatment. In 2000, Manchanda et al conducted a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of a yogalifestyle on coronary artery disease. 23The study enrolled 42 men with coronary artery disease who were random-ly assigned to a yoga intervention group or a controlgroup, and followed for one year. The yoga lifestyle pro-gram included a strict control of risk factors such assmoking, diet control, moderate aerobic physical exer-cise, breathing and relaxation exercises, stress manage-ment, and meditation. The control group was managedby conventional methods, such as risk factor control anda diet plan outlined by the American Heart Association.At the end of one year, the yoga group showed signifi-cant improvements including a reduction in the numberof anginal episodes, an improved exercise capacity, anddecreased body weight. The results also showed the sta-tistically significant regression of coronary artery lesionsin the intervention group vs. the control group (20% vs.2%) as determined by coronary angiography. Experiencing a Class A yoga session can vary in content and time depend- ing on the style of yoga, and can be individualized to suitthe needs and limitations of any patient. Classes can beextremely gentle as with restorative yoga. A typical ses-sion lasts 45-90 minutes, and usually includes breathingexercises characterized by long and deep diaphragmaticbreathing. These can be performed either sitting or lyingdown. Asana practice, or the assuming of various pos-tures in association with breathing exercises, is typically performed next. The postures further facilitate the con-nection of body, mind, and spirit and help promoterelaxation. The end of a yoga class usually employsmeditation, visualization, or guided imagery. Safety Yoga is a relatively safe activity; however, injuries can result from improper practice. It is important to seekan experienced teacher and to communicate any physi-cal concerns with the teacher prior to beginning the lesson. Conclusion There is a small amount of evidence suggesting that yoga lowers blood pressure and protects the practitionerfrom cardiovascular diseases. The complete practice ofyoga and a yoga-based lifestyle including vegetariandiet appears to reduce risk profiles in as short as 10 days.That stated, there is a significant need for additionalresearch if yoga, especially as practiced in the UnitedStates, is to be recommended as a therapeutic adjunct toconventional care. Recommendation Yoga offers multiple benefits arising from various components including posture, breathing exercises, andmeditation. Select patients may benefit from a gentlepractice, as data suggest modest improvements in spe-cific cardiovascular parameters, but much of theresearch focuses on a yogic lifestyle, something notoften employed by the majority of yoga practitioners inthe United States. As cardiovascular disease is prevalentin our society and commonly employed interventionalapproaches have associated morbidity and mortality, uti-lizing yoga practice and yogic lifestyle as a complementto the conventional medical approach is likely to con-tribute to a positive outcome in select patients with car-diovascular diseases. Identifying a well-trained yogainstructor/therapist with whom the patient can pursueone-on-one instruction can promote individualized pro-grams and allay misperceptions about the practice.

A randomized clinical trial of acupuncture compared withsham acupuncture in fibromyalgia. Ann Intern Med 2005;143:10-19. Goal: To assess the effectiveness of directed acupuncture for relievingsymptoms associated with fibromyalgia. Study design: Twelve-week random- ized, controlled trial including three dif-ferent sham acupuncture treatments. Subjects: Ninety-six people > age 18 years (mainly Caucasian women) diag-nosed with fibromyalgia and with a painscore > 4 on a visual analog scale whohad never previously experiencedacupuncture. Methods: Subjects were randomly assigned to one of four treatmentgroups: 1) directed acupuncture accord-ing to a practice of traditional Chinesemedicine (TCM); 2) stimulation ofpoints used for a condition unrelated tofibromyalgia (control for acupointspecificity); 3) sham needling usingfalse acupoints (another control for acu-point specificity); and 4) acupuncture using a toothpickin a needle guide-tube. Treatment wasoffered twice weekly for 12 weeks withneedles remaining in place for 30 min-utes at a time (in group four, simulatedneedle withdrawal occurred at 30 min-utes). One investigator instructed eightother U.S.-trained acupuncturists in theprovision of all four treatments and alsomonitored protocol compliance. Sub-jects were assigned to a particularacupuncturist according to schedule andgeography. Outcome measures includedsubjective pain, fatigue, sleep quality,and overall well-being, and data werecollected at baseline and at weeks 1, 4,8, 12, 24, and 36. Results: There were no significant dif-ferences in study outcomes noted between the directed acupuncture andsham acupuncture groups. Some benefitwas noted within all four treatmentgroups immediately after beginning theintervention, but the beneficial effectswaned over the course of the treatmentand subsequent follow-up. Conclusion: True acupuncture is no better than sham acupuncture for thetreatment of fibromyalgia. Study strengths: Use of three separate sham acupuncture treatments; degree ofblinding; follow-up; use of standard out-come measures. Study weaknesses: Acupuncture thera- py was provided in prescriptive form(fixed points stimulated), rather than inan individualized nature as is usually thecase in TCM; small subject pool; someof the eight acupuncturists treated manymore patients than did others (range, 4-33 subjects); missing data; no usual carecomparison group. Of note: Prior to randomization sub- jects were evaluated for tender points toconfirm the diagnosis of fibromyalgiaper the 1990 American College ofRheumatology criteria; subjects werepermitted to use other therapies to helprelieve discomfort during the trial pro-vided use remained consistent; not all ofthe acupuncture treatments were offeredto subjects by their same practitioner;acupoints and sham points were chosenby a single experienced practitioner andapproved by three senior acupuncturists;subjects in the directed acupuncturegroup had slightly higher levels of painand fatigue, slightly lower levels ofsleep quality and overall well-being,than those in the control groups; allthree sham acupuncture groups werecombined for the purpose of analysis;the main side effects noted were dis-comfort at the site of needle insertionand bruising. We knew that: Fibromyalgia affects 2- 4% of the U.S. population, making it(after osteoarthritis) the second most common rheumatologic disorder; use ofcomplementary and alternative medi-cine (CAM) is common among peoplewith fibromyalgia, as most conventionalmedical interventions have not shownsustained benefit; a 1992 controlled trialof electroacupuncture for fibromyalgiasuggested significant benefits duringthree weeks of treatment; the toothpicksham technique was shown to be indis-tinguishable from true acupuncture inone study of acupuncture-na\u00efve patientswith back pain; challenges to the per-formance of acupuncture researchinclude blinding of both practitionersand participants. Comments: A significant number of trials of acupuncture for painful condi-tions has been published, many withpositive outcomes. Clinical experiencewould also strongly suggest thatacupuncture can benefit patients withfibromyalgia, yet this intriguing study(funded by the National Center forComplementary and Alternative Medi-cine) detailed no significant benefitfrom a course of fixed-point acupunc-ture. As the authors readily point out,however, there is no \"gold standard\" forthe selection of acupoints for treatingpeople with fibromyalgia. Many practi-tioners espouse the belief that individu-alized acupuncture for any ailment issignificantly more effective than fixed-point treatments. This perspective hasnever been adequately tested in a clini-cal trial, and that is exactly what is need-ed\u2014a methodologically sound compar-ison of fixed-point acupuncture andindividualized TCM treatment in thesetting of fibromyalgia. Good trials ofCAM therapies for fibromyalgia are stillrelatively hard to find, so this paper isone to hold on to, both to further the dis-cussion of appropriate treatment and forthe creative manner in which controland blinding were accomplished.

Avoid Mosquito Bites to Avoid Infection WHEN DEALING WITH WEST NILE VIRUS , PREVENTION IS YOUR BEST BET . FIGHTING MOSQUI - to bites reduces your risk of getting this disease, along with others that mosquitoes can carry. Take the common sense steps below to reduce your risk. Clothing and repellent can help reduce mosquito bites Insect repellents and protective clothing can help reduce exposure to mosquito bites that may carry viruses such as West Nile virus. When possible, wear long-sleeves, long pants,and socks when outdoors. Mosquitoes may bite through thin clothing, so spraying clotheswith an insect repellent will give extra protection. Research reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that repellents containing DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) or picaridin (KBR 3023) typi-cally provide longer-lasting protection than the other products, and oil of lemon eucalyptus(p-menthane-3,8-diol) provides longer lasting protection than other plant-based repellents. Ingeneral, the more active ingredient (higher concentration) a repellent contains, the longertime it protects against mosquito bites. Use of repellents products may cause skin reactions in rare cases. Most products also note that eye irritation can occur if product gets in the eye. If you suspect a reaction to a product,discontinue use, wash the treated skin, and call a poison control center. If product gets in theeyes, flush with water and consult your health care provider or poison control center. If yougo to a doctor, take the product with you. Follow these guidelines when using a repellent: Always follow the recommendations appearing on the product label.\u007f Use enough repellent to cover exposed skin or clothing. Don't apply repellent to skin that is under clothing. Heavy application is not necessary to achieve protection. \u007f In general you should re-apply repellent if you are being bitten by mosquitoes. Sweating, perspiration, or getting wet may mean that you need to re-apply repellent more frequently. \u007f Do not apply repellent to cuts, wounds, or irritated skin. \u007f After returning indoors, wash treated skin with soap and water. \u007f Do not spray aerosol or pump products in enclosed areas. \u007f Do not spray aerosol or pump products directly to your face. Spray your hands and then rub them carefully over the face, avoiding eyes and mouth. \u007f Do not apply repellents containing permethrin directly to skin. Be aware of peak mosquito hours The hours from dusk to dawn are peak mosquito biting times for many species of mosqui- toes. Take extra care to use repellent and protective clothing during evening and early morn-ing\u2014or consider avoiding outdoor activities during these times. Mosquito-proof your home Drain standing water. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Limit the number of places around your home for mosquitoes to breed by getting rid of items that hold water. InEXECUTIVE EDITOR Russell H.

For example: \u007f At least once or twice a week, empty water from flower pots, pet food and water dishes, birdbaths,swimming pool covers, buckets, barrels, and cans. \u007f Check for clogged rain gutters and clean them out. \u007f Remove discarded tires, and other items that could collect water. \u007f Be sure to check for containers or trash in places that may be hard to see, such as under bushes or underyour home. Install and repair screens. Some mosquitoes like to come indoors. Keep them outside by having well-fittingscreens on both windows and doors. Offer to help neigh-bors whose screens might be in bad shape. Help Your Community Report dead birds to local authorities. Dead birds maybe a sign that West Nile virus is circulating between birds and the mosquitoes in an area. Clean up. Mosquito breeding sites can be anywhere. Neighborhood clean up days can be organized by civicor youth organizations to pick up containers from vacantlots and parks, and to encourage people to keep theiryards free of standing water. Mosquitoes don't careabout fences, so it's important to control breeding sitesthroughout the neighborhood. Find out more about local prevention efforts.

Experts believe WNV is established as a seasonal epidemic in North America that flares up inthe summer and continues into the fall. Approximately 80% of people who are infected with WNV will not show any symptoms at all. Up to 20% ofthe people who become infected will display mildsymptoms, including fever, headache, and body aches,nausea, vomiting, and sometimes swollen lymph glandsor a skin rash on the chest, stomach, and back. Symp-toms typically last a few days. About one in 150 peopleinfected with WNV will develop severe illness. Thesevere symptoms can include high fever, headache,neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors,convulsions, muscle weakness, vision loss, numbness,and paralysis. These symptoms may last several weeks,and neurological effects may be permanent. Generally, WNV is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes are WNV carriers that becomeinfected when they feed on infected birds. Infectedmosquitoes can then spread WNV to humans andother animals when they bite. In a very small number of cases, WNV also has spread through blood transfusions, organ transplants,breastfeeding, and even during pregnancy from motherto baby. WNV is not spread through casual contact such as touching or kissing a person with the virus. People typically develop symptoms 3-14 days after they are bitten by the infected mosquito. There is nospecific treatment for WNV infection. In mild cases,people experience symptoms such as fever and achesthat pass on their own. In more severe cases, peopleusually need to go to the hospital where they canreceive supportive treatment including intravenous flu-ids, help with breathing, and nursing care. Pregnantwomen and nursing mothers are encouraged to talk totheir doctor if they develop symptoms that could beWNV. For most, risk of getting WNV is low. Less than 1% of people who are bitten by mosquitoes develop anysymptoms of the disease and relatively few mosquitoesactually carry WNV. People who spend a lot of time outdoors are more likely to be bitten by an infected mosquito. They shouldtake special care to avoid mosquito bites. People older than age 50 are more likely to develop serious symptoms of WNV if they do get sick andshould take special care to avoid mosquito bites. The risk of getting WNV through blood transfu- sions and organ transplants is very small, and shouldnot prevent people who need surgery from having it. Ifyou have concerns, talk to your doctor before surgery. Pregnancy and nursing do not increase risk of becoming infected "}
