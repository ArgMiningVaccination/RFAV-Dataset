The vaccine is given only to infants and children 4-6 years of age and is given before the child's 7th birthday. Tetanus is a very serious illness that causes convulsions and severe muscle spasms that can be strong enough to cause spine fractures. Tetanus causes death in 30%-40% of cases. The disease continues to occur almost exclusively in people who do not get vaccinated. Pertussis (a whooping cough) is a serious disease that causes severe coughing fits that can limit breathing. Pertussis may also cause pneumonia, long-lasting bronchitis, seizures, brain damage and death. Diphtheria is a serious illness that can cause breathing difficulties, heart problems, nerve damage, pneumonia and possibly death. The risk of serious complications is greater in very young children and the elderly. Polio is a very serious illness that causes muscle paralysis, including the muscles you use to walk and breathe. A polio infection may leave a person unable to breathe without the help of a breathing machine. It may also leave a person unable to walk without leg braces or being confined to a wheelchair.
