The live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) contains live forms of flu virus which have been weakened (attenuated). These stimulate the immune system but do not cause disease in healthy people. It can safely be given at the same time as all other routine childhood vaccines, including other live vaccines. However, the nasal flu vaccine should not be given to people who are clinically immunosuppressed (see below). The brand name of the nasal flu spray used in the UK is Fluenz Tetra (see the It is recommended to get the flu vaccine in the autumn, before outbreaks of flu have started. | | The UK is gradually introducing annual flu vaccination for all children. There are some differences between the programmes in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The programme may be extended to additional secondary school years once there has been an assessment of the full impact of the current school programme. In the 2021-22 season, the programme was extended to all children from year 7 - 11 in secondary school, however for the 2022-23 season, this cohort of children will not be eligible. The programme will however, continue to vaccinate all primary school children and those aged 2 to 4 years In the 2022-23 season the nasal flu spray will be available for free to the following groups: Some cohorts that were eligible in the 2021 to 2022 season are not eligible for the 2022 to 2023 season. This includes: If a child has missed the flu vaccine in school, they can also receive the vaccine from their GP surgery. Children between 6 months and 2 years old with long-term health conditions will be offered an injection flu vaccine instead of the nasal spray (see Your doctor may recommend the flu vaccine in other circumstances as well. | | The flu vaccine works better in some years than others (see 'Why do we need the flu vaccine every year?' below). In children aged 2-17, the flu vaccine prevented 66% of flu cases in 2016-17, 27% of flu cases in 2017-18, 49% of flu cases in 2018-19 and 45% of flu cases in 2019-20 (see research by Public Health England on the effectiveness of flu vaccines in the The aim is to protect children and also people around them, particularly those at risk of complications of flu. If children get flu they can remain infectious for longer than adults (up to two weeks), and they are also more likely to pass on the infection. There is good evidence to show that vaccinating children against flu is a good way to reduce flu-related illness, GP visits, hospital admissions and deaths for the whole community. Overall, since the programme began, the impact of the nasal flu vaccine has been greatest in pilot areas of the UK where children in all primary school years have been offered vaccination. This includes the whole of Scotland and Northern Ireland. In 2015 Public Health England published a As well as offering the nasal flu vaccine to all primary school children, Scotland and Northern Ireland had higher rates of vaccine uptake than England. | | Side effects associated with the vaccine are: Very common (affecting more than 1 in 10 people) Common (affecting up to 1 in 10 people): Uncommon (affecting up to 1 in 100 people): Additional information about vaccine side effects, anaphylaxis and adverse reactions can be found There is no evidence that healthy unvaccinated people can catch flu from the nasal flu spray (either from airborne spray droplets in the room where the vaccine is given, or from vaccinated individuals 'shedding' the virus). It is known that vaccinated children shed the virus for a few days after vaccination (through sneezing or coughing). However, the vaccine virus is weakened, and so it is much less able to spread from person to person than flu viruses that circulate during the flu season, and it cannot grow inside the body. The amount of virus that children shed is normally below the levels needed to pass on infection to others. The virus does not survive for long outside the body. It is therefore not necessary for children to be excluded from school during the period when the vaccine is being given. The only exception is the very small number of children who are extremely immunocompromised (for example, those who have just had a bone marrow transplant). These children are usually advised not to attend school anyway, because of the higher risk of being in contact with infections that circulate in schools. The nasal flu spray should not be given to anyone who is severely immunodeficient (so that their immune system cannot control viral infections in the normal way) due to a medical condition or treatment with an immunosuppressive therapy such as: This is because the weakened viruses in the vaccine could replicate too much and cause infection. Children who have been vaccinated with the nasal spray should avoid close contact with people who have very severely weakened immune systems (for example, bone marrow transplant patients requiring isolation in a protective environment) for about two weeks following vaccination. If it is not possible for a child to avoid contact with someone who is severely immunosuppressed (for example, because they live in the same house), the child should not receive the nasal flu vaccine. It may be possible for them to have the | | Children need one dose of the vaccine every year. The exception is children who are in a clinical risk group, have not had a flu vaccine before and are under 9 years of age. These children need two doses of vaccine at least 4 weeks apart. Bristol Children's Vaccine Centre has a Flu vaccines have an excellent safety record. They are the best protection we have against an unpredictable virus which can cause severe illness and deaths each year among at-risk groups. It is important to have a flu vaccine every year because the flu virus is very variable and changes over time. Each year there are different strains around, and a new vaccine has to be prepared to deal with them. Vaccination from previous years is not likely to protect people against current strains of flu. Each year's flu vaccine is made to give the best protection against the strains of flu that are expected to circulate in the coming season. The inactivated trivalent vaccine protects against three of the flu virus strains and the inactivated quadrivalent vaccine protects against four of the flu strains which are most likely to be around. The nasal flu vaccine is a quadrivalent vaccine, which protects against four flu virus strains. | | The nasal flu spray used in the UK is called Fluenz Tetra (also called FluMist in the US). Apart from the For the 2019/20 flu season, children whose parents refuse the LAIV flu vaccine due to the porcine gelatine content will be offered the The vaccine may also contain traces of these products used during the manufacturing process: Growing the active ingredients for the vaccine: The vaccine may contain very small amounts of egg proteins (ovalbumin) because the flu viruses are grown on hens' eggs. The The only exception is children who have a history of severe anaphylaxis to eggs which has previously needed treatment in intensive care. These children should be referred to specialists for immunisation in hospital. This advice is based on studies called SNIFFLE 4 assessed the use of the nasal flu vaccine in children with severe asthma. A recent update from the | | The nasal flu spray has also been used widely in the US since 2007 in children from the age of 2 upwards. It has a good safety profile. In 2016, research from the US showed that the nasal flu vaccine was no longer working well in children against one of the strains in the vaccine (influenza A(H1N1)). As a result the nasal flu spray was not recommended for use in the US during the 2016-17 and 2017-18 flu seasons (see our However, research in the UK and in Finland showed that in these two countries the nasal flu spray was still working well against influenza A(H1N1). It is not known why there is a difference between the US research and the UK and Finnish research, but the UK is continuing to monitor this. There is a For 2018-19 and 2019-20 seasons the vaccine manufacturers have used a different version of the influenza A(H1N1) strain in the vaccine. This is expected to be more effective against influenza A(H1N1), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US are now once again "}
