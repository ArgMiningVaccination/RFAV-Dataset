Breed M ayor 1 Director's Report for Health Commission Meeting of April 20, 2021 A current overview of issues affecting the state of public health in San Francisco https://www.sfdph.org/dph/comupg/aboutdph/insideDept/dirRpts/default.asp Today, there are over 35, 700 San Francisco residents with confirmed cases of COVID -19. And, sadly, a total of 517 San Franciscans have died. The San Francisco Department of Public Health (DPH) sends our condolences to their loved ones. SF Department of Public Health adopts new publ ic health recommendations for fully vaccinated people On April 16, Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax released the following statement after a decision by the state to adopt the CDC's guidance on allowable behavior for fully vaccinated people. For the purposes of this guidance, people are considered fully vaccinated for COVID -19 two weeks after they have received the second dose in a two- dose series of Pfizer -BioNTech or Moderna, or two weeks after they have received a single- dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Currently, individuals 16 and older are eligible to get vaccinated in San Fra ncisco. \"We welcome the state's decision to adopt the CDC's guidance for gatherings, and we have updated our Health Order accordingly. We are now at a poi nt in this pandemic where fully vaccinated San Franciscans can attend small indoor gatherings with other fully vaccinated friends and loved ones without wearing masks or physical distancing or with unvaccinated people from one household who are at low risk of severe illness from COVID -19. However, even vaccinated people may carry and transmit the disease, so it's still very important that individuals consider the risk that exposure may have on those around them. For that reason, face coverings, physical distancing, handwashing and limiting indoor activities and gatherings with people outside one's household remain as important as ever, especially with the increased prevalence of more contagious variants in San Francisco. Per the state's guidance, when vis iting with unvaccinated individuals at high risk for severe COVID -19 disease, vaccinated people should continue to wear masks and practice physical distancing. We hope this news offers further incentive for people to get vaccinated as soon as possible. W e want to thank everyone for their ongoing cooperation and compliance with the state's guidance. Our City's commitment to following the health guidelines has resulted in the lowest death rate from COVID- 19 of any major city in the country. With more people getting vaccinated every day, the light at the end of the tunnel is getting closer. We just need everyone to hang in there and keep up the good work.\" The San Francisco Department of Public Health's updated Health Order can be found here . San Francisco Department of Public Health Grant Colfax, MD Director of Health City and Coun ty of San Francisco London N. Breed M ayor 2 CDPH Updated Guidance for Gathering Guidance for Gatherings - Applies to private gatherings - social situations that bring together people from different households at the same time in a single space. Notably, attendance for gatherings is based on county tier status for the Blueprint for a Safer Economy, unless local health departments have more restrictive measures. Guidance for the Fully Vaccinated - Provides guidelines for people two weeks after full vaccination. This includes: - Spending time with other fully vaccinated people, including indoors, without wearing masks or physical distancing. - Spending time with unvaccinated people from a single household who are at low risk for severe COVID -19 disease indoors without wearin g masks or physical distancing. SF expands network of neighborhood COVID -19 vaccine sites as part of equity strategy The goal of San Francisco's vaccination strategy is to make receiving the vaccine as convenient, comfortable and low -barrier for as m any people as possible, particularly in those neighborhoods disproportionately affected by the COVID -19 pandemic. New 18th Street and Shotwell neighborhood vaccination site On April 15, Mayor London N. Breed and City officials announced San Francisco's fourth neighborhood COVID -19 vaccine site. Located at the Local 261 Union building at 3271 18th Street in the Mission District and operated in partnership with the Latino Task Force, the new Mission site is one of three neighborhood sites opening in the next several weeks as the City augments efforts to ensure that highly impacted neighborhoods have equitable access to the vaccine. The new Mission vaccine site at 18th Street and Shotwell follows the successful launch of the City's first neighborhood site at 24th and Capp. The site at 24th and Capp was created in February in partnership with UCSF and the Latino Task Force and has vaccinated over 10,000 predominately Latino and Mission residents since opening. The new site is planned to be open Thursdays through Saturdays from 11:00am to 6:00pm. The site will serve people 16 and older who live in priority zip codes and will have an initial capacity of 200 doses per day. Given that supply of the vaccine remains extremely limited, the 18th and Shotwell site is by appointment only with limited drop- in availability. Members of the public can sign up for an appointment in person at the 18th and Shotwell site as well as the Mis sion testing site at 24th and Mission, Wednesday - Sunday, 9am -2pm; at Unidos en Salud at 24th and Capp, Sunday- Wednesday, 9am -2pm; and at the Mission Hub at 701 Alabama Street on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays from 10:00am to 3:00pm. Residents and workers of the 94112, email LatinoTaskForceSF@gmail.com with any questions. San Francisco Department of Public Health Grant Colfax, MD Director of Health City and Coun ty of San Francisco London N. Breed M ayor 3 The 18th and Shotwell site i s located within walking distance from the 16th Street BART station and Muni bus lines, to ensure that it is accessible and convenient for people that it will serve. Muni and Paratransit are free for anyone traveling to and from COVID -19 vaccine appointments. The SFMTA is also providing additional access to taxi service for those using the Essential Trip Card. Information can be found at sfmta.com/COVID and sfmta.com/Paratransit . New Excelsior District neighborhood vaccination site On April 7, Mayor London N. Breed, Supervisor Ahsha Safa\u00ed , DPH, and community partners Excelsior Strong and Latino Task Force, announced the opening of a new neighborhood COVID -19 vaccine site in the Excelsior District, at 20 Norton Street. The new site in the Excelsior is planned to operate Wednesday through Saturday, from 9:30am - 3:30pm on Wedne sdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays and 12pm -6pm on Fridays. The site will have an initial capacity of 150 doses per day. Given that supply of the vaccine remains extremely limited, the Excelsior site is by appointment only with limited drop- in availability. E xcelsior neighborhood residents and workers can call Excelsior Strong/Latino Task Force at (415) 562- 8638 to schedule an appointment. The Excelsior site, located on a San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) parking lot, has the additional benefit of being adjacent to Mission Street, which has numerous Muni bus lines, and walking distance from Balboa Park BART station, ensuring that it is accessible and convenient for people that it will serve. Muni and Paratransit are free for anyone trave ling to and from COVID -19 vaccine appointments. The SFMTA is also providing additional access to taxi service for those using the Essential Trip Card. Information can be found at sfmta.com/COVID and sfmta.com/Paratransit. Neighborhood vaccine access site s established with community partners, such as this new Mission site and the future ones in Visitacion Valley and Lakeview/OMI, are one critical piece of a larger network of vaccine distribution that also includes high- volume vaccination sites, community c linics, pharmacy partnerships, and mobile vaccination teams. In addition to the 18th and Shotwell site and the new Excelsior site the City continues to locate vaccine resources in neighborhoods that have disproportionally carried the burden of COVID -19 and has created neighborhood vaccine access sites in the Mission (24th and Capp), and Bayview (1800 Oakdale). Additionally, the City has expanded mobile vaccine teams to the Tenderloin, Visitacion Valley, Treasure Island, Chinatown and other neighborhoods with the highest infection rates for COVID -19 and limited access to health care services. San Francisco's COVID -19 vaccine dashboard shows that the City's focus on racial equity in vaccine distribution has been successful. A higher proportion of the DPH -administered vaccinations have gone to people of color than the total citywide vaccinations. For example, the Latino population represents 14% percent of the City's vaccine eligible population and has received more San Francisco Department of Public Health Grant Colfax, MD Director of Health City and Coun ty of San Francisco London N. Breed M ayor 4 than 26% of DPH 's vaccinations. The dashboard also shows that the top three neighborhoods receiving the largest amount of DPH -controlled vaccines are the Bayview, Mission and Excelsior. Insufficient vaccine supply remains the single biggest factor limiting the City' s vaccination effort. Newly eligible people age 16 and over should visit SF.gov/getvaccinated to learn about options for receiving the vaccine and to find links to book appointments at different vaccination sites. Because supply remains extremely limited while eligibility is expanding, it may take a number of weeks to find an available appointment. Eligible individuals should continue to be patient, should keep checking the website, and should accept the first vaccine that is offered, with the exception of people 16 and 17 years old, for whom Pfizer is currently the only approved vaccine.

People 16 and older are now eligible to receive the COVID -19 vaccine in San Francisco On April 13, Mayor London N. Breed, Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax, and Director of the Department of Emergency Management Mary Ellen Carroll announced that in accordance with state and federal guidance, all people age 16 and over in San Francisco are now eligible to receive a COVID- 19 vaccine. Those newly eligible people age 16 and over should visit SF.gov/ getvaccinated to learn about options for receiving the vacci ne and to find links to schedule appointments at different vaccination sites. Making a vaccination appointment Anyone who works or lives in San Francisco and is eligible for the COVID -19 vaccine can go to SF.gov/getvaccinated to find vaccination locations and make an appointment. The City will continue to provide regular updates to the public about the vaccine in San Francisco at SF.gov/covidvaccine . In order to assist individuals who are 65 and older and those with disabilities who are unable to easily access the internet or schedule an appointment through their provider, the City has set up a call center to learn about vaccine options and receive assistance in booking an appointment to some locations. The number is (628) 652- 2700. Phones are answered 8:30am - 5:00pm Monday through Friday. Callers can leave a message on weekends. San Francisco' s vaccine supply and Johnson & Johnson vaccine pause Following announcement of the CDC and FDA on April 13th, San Francisco has paused the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine out of an abundance of caution until mor e is learned about the potential side effects. To dateSan Franciscohasadministered more than 33,000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to residents with no known cases of blood clotting. As this adverse event is reported to be extremely rare with ju st over six reported cases nationwide, the City does not believe there is cause for immediate alarm. However, people who have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine should contact their primary healthcare provider if they have concerns or if they develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain or shortness of breath within three weeks after vaccination. COVID -19 vaccine safety is a top priority for the City.DPHwill continue to monitor the situation and will look forward to hearing the outcome from the C DC's meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices tomorrow to better understand the significance of these cases. San Francisco Department of Public Health Grant Colfax, MD Director of Health City and Coun ty of San Francisco London N. Breed M ayor 6 The state informed the City last week to expect a 33 -35% percent decrease in the vaccine supply for the month of April caused by near -term supply challenges at the national level, as well as increasing proportions of California vaccines being delivered through the federal direct allocation programs to Federally Qualified Health Centers and pharmacies. Additionally, the City's supply of Johnson & Johnson would decrease by upwards of 90% percent due to federal manufacturing issues. As the City only received 500 doses of Johnson & Johnson (out of 10,000 doses total) this week, this pause will not have a significant impact on this wee k's vaccination efforts. SF reopen s and expand s additional businesses and activities On April 14, Mayor London N. Breed and Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax announced that, starting April 15, San Francisco will reopen and expand additional activities that are allowed by the State for counties assigned to the orange tier. These activitie s include indoor live -audience events and performances and private events such as conferences and receptions. In alignment with the State's guidelines, San Francisco will also expand the number of individuals allowed to participate in indoor and outdoor social gatherings and will loosen some restrictions on other activities, including dining, outdoor bars, retail, and recreation. Many of the activities that are resuming may reopen because of guidelines recently released by the State. With some exceptions , San Francisco will align with the State's guidelines to reopen and expand newly permitted activities under the orange tier. New and expanded businesses and activities may resume starting Thursday, April 15, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. as long as they comply with r equired capacity limits and other safety protocols. Although San Francisco remains assigned to the orange tier on the State's Blueprint for a Safer Economy , its COVID -19 cases, hospitalizations, and other health equity metrics have remained stable over the past several weeks. With the recent guidance released by the State, San Francisco is taking the opportunity to reopen live events and performances and private events and to expand additional activities within the orange tier. Key criteria for the resu mption and continuation of these expansions will be a stable or declining rate of new COVID -19 cases and hospitalizations. As public health officials continue to monitor San Francisco's health indicators, the City may need to pause or rollback activities i f data suggests that COVID -19 is significantly increasing within the community again. Under the new Health Order, San Francisco will open indoor ticketed and seated events and performances up to 35% capacity with an approved Health and Safety Plan, as long as all participants keep their masks on except when eating or drinking in designated concessions areas away from their seats, distancing requirements can be met, and participants show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID -19 test before they enter t he venue. Venues may create vaccinated -only sections with relaxed distancing requirements, subject to specified criteria and an approved health and San Francisco Department of Public Health Grant Colfax, MD Director of Health City and Coun ty of San Francisco London N. Breed M ayor 7 safety plan. For venues operating at 15% capacity or less, with no more than 200 people, and that do not have any vaccinated -only sections, an approved Health and Safety Plan and proof of vaccination or a negative test will not be required. Private events such as meetings, conventions, and receptions may also resume indoors up to 150 participants with assigne d seating and proof of vaccination or a negative COVID -19 test. Such events may resume outdoors following the same guidelines for up to 300 people, or up to 100 people without proof of vaccination or negative COVID -19 test. Outdoor ticketed venues for live-audience events and performances may expand capacity up to 50% under existing guidelines. Like indoor venues, outdoor venues may create vaccinated -only sections with relaxed distancing restrictions, subject to specified criteria and an approved health and safety plan. An approved health and safety plan is also required for outdoor ticketed events greater than 1,000 audience members, and a health and safety plan must be submitted to the Health Officer (but does not require pre -approval) before the event for outdoor ticketed events of between 500 and 1,000 audience members. Proof of vaccination or a negative COVID -19 test is required by all participants if the outdoor event includes 4,000 or more audience members, or 100 or more audience members and food a nd beverages are served. In all cases, patrons must wear facial coverings for the duration of the event, except for times when they are eating or drinking. San Francisco will also expand capacity for indoor and outdoor social gatherings based on the Sta te's new guidance, as well as a number of activities impacted by those changes, including drive -ins, tour operators, childcare, sports and recreation, and institutes of higher education. Under the amendments to the Health Order, groups of up to 50 may now gather together outdoors with face coverings and distancing, reduced to 25 if food or drink is being consumed. Indoor gatherings may resume at the lesser of 25% capacity or 25 individuals without food or beverages. In addition to the activities above, a number of changes to the Health Order will allow additional expansions for outdoor dining, outdoor bars, film, and indoor family entertainment as well as the easing of some safety protocols for other sectors including retail, hotels, and indoor dining. Commu nity centers serving seniors and adult day care will also be able to reopen to 25% capacity beginning April 15. San Francisco has maintained a stable average between 30 and 40 new COVID -19 cases a day since early March 2021 and is currently averaging 35 new cases per day. Likewise, COVID -19 hospitalizations are also down significantly since February 2021. Although they remain low, those trends have flattened and prevented San Francisco from meeting the State's criteria to move into the yellow tier this we ek. With the growing prevalence of variants in the Bay Area and the surge in cases in Michigan and the northeast, public health officials are closely monitoring any changes to cases that may indicate increasing contagion. Countering these concerns to som e degree are San Francisco's ongoing vaccination efforts. At this time, 63% of San Francisco's population has received the first dose of vaccine, as have 85% of the San Francisco Department of Public Health Grant Colfax, MD Director of Health City and Coun ty of San Francisco London N. Breed M ayor 8 City's residents over 65. Effective April 13, anyone over the age of 16 is eligible for a C OVID -19 vaccine in San Francisco. The City posted the revised Health Order with detailed requirements to its webpage . A list of the activities that reopened or expanded under the new Health Order can be found below. Although San Francisco's vaccination rate is above the state average, it is not yet sufficient to prevent a fourth surge without continued adherence to public health guidelines. Health officials continue to emphasize the need for masking and social distancing by all, including those who have been vaccinated, when outside their homes in order to limit the impact of variants. Likewise, businesses are encouraged to have outdoor options wherever possible. People at risk for severe illness with COVID -19, such as unvaccinated older adults and unvaccinated individuals with healt h risks, and members of their households, should defer participating at this time in activities with other people outside their household where taking protective measures of wearing face masks and social distancing may be difficult, especially indoors or i n crowded spaces. As public health officials continue to monitor San Francisco's health indicators, the City may choose to pause higher -risk activities or implement a lagged approach to reopening subsequent tiers in order to ensure sufficient analysis about how health indicators have responded to the reopening of activities, manage risk, and protect public health. Activities Resuming as of Thursday, April 15, 2021 Indoor Ticketed and Seated Performances, Spectator Sports and other Live Events Indoor ticketed and seated events such as live sports, theater arts and musical performances, and graduation ceremonies may open up to 35% capacity for in -state audience member s with an approved Health and Safety Plan, so long as the State's social distancing guidelines can be maintained. Suites and boxes are limited to 25% capacity and 3 households. All participants must keep their masks on except when eating or drinking in des ignated concession areas with at least 6 feet distance between households. All California residents over the age of 12 must show either proof of vaccination or a negative COVID -19 test, and any out-of-state visitors must show proof of vaccination. Vacci nated -only section. A venue may lift the distancing requirement and operate certain sections at 100% capacity, including suites, if the operator meets the State's minimum requirements and (1) confirms that all patrons 16 and up are fully vaccinated before they enter the venue, (2) requires a negative COVID -19 test for any patrons who are between the ages 2 -15 and accompanying a parent or guardian who is fully vaccinated, (3) requires all patrons in the vaccination- only section to wear face coverings at all times unless otherwise exempted under the face covering order, and (4) receives advance approval of a Health and Safety Plan from the Health Officer.

Breed announced the City is moving forward to open a drug sobering center for people who are experiencing the effects of fentanyl, methamphetamine, and other substances. Mayor Breed introduce d a lease for the building at 1076 Howard Street at the Board of Supervisors. The drug sobering center pilot, a key component of Mental Health SF, is one of several innovative efforts underway to help people experiencing homelessness and behavioral health issues to get off the streets, into housing, and connected with services. The goals of the drug sobering center include saving lives by preventing overdose deaths, reducing the harms of substance use in the surrounding neighborhood, and providing resources that can give people who use drugs an alternative to hospital and jail stays and an opportunity to begin their journey toward wellness and recovery when they are ready. The center will provide an additional resource and a destination for people served by the growing Street Crisis Response Team (SCRT) pilot program and other City outreach teams. This new sobering center will be located in a brick -and-mortar facility at 1076 Howard Street. The City originally planned to pilot the center at 180 Jones Street, but, due to COVID -19, that site has since been converted to a Safe Sleeping Site. If the lease is approved by the Board of Supervisors, the City will gather community input on the program, oversee building renovations, and implement a drug sobering center pilot program in Fall 2021. DPH is proposing to contract with HealthRIGHT 360, which manages many successful healthcare and substance use treatment programs throughout the city and across the state, to operate the drug sobering center. Healthcare and safety workers, many with lived experience of substance use, will staff the program. It will be a 20- bed pilot project where clients may stay an average of eight to ten hours, though some may stay longer. The facility will initially be able to serve up to 20 individuals at a time, but over the course of a 24 -hour period, may serve up to three times that amount. Findings from this effort will inform near -term future investments to save lives and promote safety in SoMa and throughout the city. DPH will evaluate the pilot program and refine the model for replication in other locations in San Francisco. At the center, the City will offer harm reduction services in a safe, welcoming setting with peer counselors and health services. People under the influence of methamphetamine, fentanyl, and other substances can move safely through intoxication, then have an opportunity to engage in conversation about wellness and recovery options ava ilable to them and be connected to housing resources. San Francisco Department of Public Health Grant Colfax, MD Director of Health City and Coun ty of San Francisco London N. Breed M ayor 14 Specifically, services will include one -on-one peer support; access to clothing, showers, and hygiene supplies; on- site security for safety monitoring; access to harm -reduction supplies and education; and health assessments and first aid. Additionally, the center will connect clients to other services including referrals to primary medical care and psychiatric services; social services including housing; and vocational services for job training and futur e employment. Under Mayor Breed's leadership, the City is focused on addressing homelessness, mental health, and substance use disorders, with a focus on three main areas: creating more places for people to go; expanding outreach and coordination among se rvices and placement; and strengthening data and transparency tracking tools. The drug sobering center will make progress on all three areas by offering a new place for people to go and get connected with existing City services. The drug sobering center pi lot will be evaluated and use of the facility with be tracked by DPH, furthering the City's efforts to ensure programs are working and make adjustments to programs as needed.
