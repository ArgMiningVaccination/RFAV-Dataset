Our candles are made with a coconut-soy wax blend that gives each candle a silky-smooth finish. All candles are vegan, non-toxic, paraben, phthalate, and carcinogen- free. Since 2014, I've had a daily practice: Each morning starts with a time of self-reflection. I light my favorite candle, grab my hot coffee, and start journaling. I found that in doing such a simple, daily ritual, these moments of stillness have been a transformative process in my growth and spiritual journey. I believe creating a sacred space is important to your mental, emotional, and spiritual health. The ambiance, fragrance, warmth, and esthetic that each candle brings to your space creates a feeling of peace. Let each candle be your time of stillness. Whether it's a self-care Sunday bath, a love ritual on the new moon, or time to reflect and reset. White Sage Candles are designed to guide you to your daily ritual of self- care. "}
