This can be particularly true with Hashimoto's. Most people will experience multiple triggers that continue to cause both symptoms and ongoing thyroid damage, even when taking prescribed thyroid medications. Through my own trial and error investigations over the years, I have experienced firsthand the profound effect that many supplemental interventions can have on healing the human body. Near the beginning of my own Hashimoto's journey, after experiencing continued symptoms despite taking thyroid hormone medications, two of the complementary approaches that I eventually tried were acupuncture and immune-balancing herbal therapies, as recommended by my acupuncturist. I was surprised and thrilled by the results. My TPO antibodies at the time fell from the 2,000 IU/mL range to the mid-300s. Since then, I've seen the beneficial effects of a wide variety of herbal therapies, with many clients and readers. Today, I want to share some of my favorites with you. These herbs specifically address common triggers for Hashimoto's, and research shows that they can improve thyroid hormone levels and overall thyroid health as well. In this article, you will discover: - Why herbs are used in functional medicine - How herbs can address your Hashimoto's triggers - Top herbs that I like and the research behind them - Important considerations when using herbal therapies Why Herbs are Used in Functional Medicine Most conventional doctors \"treat\" Hashimoto's by focusing on correcting TSH levels in their patients, but do not work to address the root causes of the autoimmune condition itself. Nor do most conventional doctors believe that Hashimoto's is reversible. In contrast, functional medicine practitioners look at the underlying triggers of autoimmunity in order to reverse the condition. My [root cause approach](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/root-cause-approach-and-hashimotos/) is built on these functional medicine principles as well. Today, functional medicine practitioners utilize herbs for a variety of medicinal purposes, as they have been shown to provide both targeted and broad-spectrum benefits to patients and clients. In particular, I, along with many of my peers, have found that specific herbs can be utilized to treat the root causes of many chronic diseases. Most medicinal herbs and plants show anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune-moderating properties. More and more research is substantiating herbal products and the effects that doctors, herbalists and patients have been seeing for thousands of years. What are Herbs? Herbs are plants or plant parts (leaves, roots, seeds, flowers, berries, bark) that have aromatic or savory properties and are often used in cooking. But many herbs are also known for their medicinal properties. Sometimes different parts of the same plant can be used for multiple medicinal purposes, as well as for culinary use (where an herb is usually known as a spice). Though the term \"herb\" used to be applied only to non-woody plants, it is now commonly used interchangeably with the term \"medicinal plant\" to refer to any part of a plant, like the fruit, seed, stem, bark, flower, leaf, root, or stigma. So, while aloe is a medicinal plant, it is also an herb, and I will refer to it as such for the purposes of this article. Herbs used for medicinal purposes are called herbal products, phytomedicines, or botanical products. If intended for internal use, the product is usually referred to as an herbal supplement. Herbal supplements can be purchased in many forms, both raw and dried, including: powdered, in a pill or capsule, dried, chopped, in essential oils, in a cream, or in a form to be brewed as tea (to name a few). Currently, herbal products are not regulated by the FDA, so people need to ensure that they purchase quality herbal supplements from a reputable vendor. There are many variations between different brands, and recommended dosages are not standardized like with a prescribed drug. There can also be drug interaction issues between herbs and some prescription medications, so it is always important to talk with your doctor about the use of herbal supplements. Many ayurvedic herbs sold over the internet have been tested to reveal high levels of [mercury](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/mercury-exposure-hashimotos/), so it is important to do your research and look for herbs that meet safety standards before purchasing. History of Herbs Herbs have been used for medicinal purposes by many cultures, for thousands of years. The oldest actual written evidence of plants being used for medicinal usage was found on a Sumerian clay slab from Nagpur (India), which is thought to be approximately 5000 years old. Herbs were referenced in the Bible, and Egyptian herbalists documented their interest in herbal medicine, as well as the use of herbs in cooking and cosmetics. If you are interested in learning more, here is a [detailed history of the use of herbs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3358962/). Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) utilizes ancient herbal traditions even today, with herbs assigned with qualities such as \"stimulating\" (yang) or \"cooling\" (yin). Ayurvedic Medicine incorporates the use of herbal therapies to reduce stress, balance the body's health, and heal a variety of conditions. More and more, even traditional Western practitioners are starting to recognize the importance of practices belonging to TCM and Ayurvedic disciplines, and are using complementary therapies such as acupuncture, massage, meditation, and herbs, to help their patients and clients. Please note: as I mentioned earlier, I recommend exercising extreme caution with the use of herbal supplements. A study done by JAMA in August of 2008, found that 20 percent of Ayurvedic medicines sold via the internet contained lead, mercury and arsenic! Since 1978, more than 80 cases of lead poisoning have been associated with Ayurvedic medicine. Ayurvedic medicines come in two major types: herbal only and rasa shastra. Rasa shastra is an ancient practice of mixing herbs with metals, minerals and gems - mercury, lead, iron, zinc, mica, and pearl. Rasa shastra formulations are twice as likely to contain heavy metals. Several formulations revealed lead/mercury levels of hundreds of thousands of times the allowable amounts. These preparations can be especially problematic for people with overburdened detox pathways, like those with Hashimoto's and [MTHFR gene mutations](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/mthfr-hashimotos-and-nutrients/). I only trust high quality professional supplement brands, and have gone a step deeper and formulated my own line of supplements, which undergo extensive testing for heavy metals, toxins, and contamination. How Herbs Can Address Your Hashimoto's Triggers As a complementary therapy for Hashimoto's, herbs are most effective when targeting one's own unique root causes or triggers, versus focusing on a particular symptom. An example might be having a digestive issue, a common symptom with Hashimoto's. Certainly there are many herbs known to address digestion symptoms, but if your root cause is really stress (causing your digestive symptoms), there are particular herbs better suited to support your body's stressed out state. If your gut impairment/digestive issue is heavy metal-related, there are herbs that are better suited to address that. That's why I always ask new clients to complete a [health timeline](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/sample-health-timeline/), to identify what was happening in their life when they last felt well. Health events (root cause triggers) that are commonly uncovered on health timelines include: toxic medication use ( [oral contraceptives](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/14-ways-birth-control-pills-rob-us-of-our-health/), [viruses and infections](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/viruses-may-trigger-hashimotos/) (including [dental infections](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/dental-triggers-hashimotos/) or parasites), or even periods of [chronic stress](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/are-your-adrenals-sabotaging-your-health/). Once you complete your own health timeline, you may start to see possible triggers unique to you. If necessary, you can then do lab testing to confirm those triggers. If you identify you have one or more of the common infections seen in Hashimoto's, there are protocols to help eradicate the infections, including the use of specific herbal products. Some herbs have excellent anti-parasitic properties. (We'll talk about two of those in this article: turmeric and aloe vera.) There are also many others such as [Saccharomyces boulardii](https://rootcology.com/collections/supplements/products/s-boulardii), black walnuts, garlic, [oil of oregano](https://thyroidpharmacist.ehealthpro.com/products/oil-of-oregano-150-mg-60-softgels), and wormwood. If your health history shows evidence of a lingering virus, like the [Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV)](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/epstein-barr-virus-and-hashimotos), that may point you to using one of the many antiviral herbs. The EBV virus was one of my triggers due to contracting mononucleosis in college. One great herbal antiviral that I will talk more about is cordyceps, which has been shown to suppress the Epstein-Barr virus, as well as act as a broad-spectrum antiviral and be immune-modulating. Other good antivirals include [oil of oregano](https://thyroidpharmacist.ehealthpro.com/products/oil-of-oregano-150-mg-60-softgels), lomatium and [astragalus](https://www.purerxo.com/thyroidpharmacist/rxo/products/product_details.asp?ProductsID=1795). If your health timeline points to chronic stress, there are many wonderful adaptogenic herbs out there that you may wish to try. [Adaptogenic herbs](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/adaptogenic-herbs-benefit-hashimotos/) help your entire body cope with stress by supporting adrenal health. I'll talk about ashwagandha, one of my favorite adaptogenic herbs, in this article. Others include [tulsi](https://amzn.to/2H4Si4e) (I love [this Tulsi tea](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005P0U9CE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005P0U9CE&linkCode=as2&tag=thyroipharma-20&linkId=227b0ed0b5737a1a4480f37b0c5b779c) in the evenings), [maca](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFLHU2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000FFLHU2&linkCode=as2&tag=thyroipharma-20&linkId=de08af66b921152dc00a310898dc2d34), [schisandra](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000153AIS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thyroipharma-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B000153AIS&linkId=c1f7dc783c657ff880accf431ea7565a), and Siberian ginseng. There are many broad-spectrum herbal products focused on gut health (such as turmeric and aloe vera, which I'll explore further on in this article; and there are many others as well, including [oil of oregano](https://thyroidpharmacist.ehealthpro.com/products/oil-of-oregano-150-mg-60-softgels), [Saccharomyces boulardii](https://rootcology.com/collections/supplements/products/s-boulardii), licorice, slippery elm, and marshmallow root). We know that a [leaky gut](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/importance-gut-health/) is one of the three requirements for someone to have an autoimmune disease like Hashimoto's. If you've noted heavy metal or toxin exposures on your health timeline, there are herbs such as [Nigella sativa](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/black-seed-oil-and-hashimotos/) that show promise in providing protective action against both natural and chemical toxicities (including [mercury](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/mercury-exposure-hashimotos/) and lead). Turmeric is also a helpful heavy metal detoxifier. I hope you see the point I am making relating to focusing on root causes versus simply focusing on a given symptom. So now let's talk about my favorite herbs. Top Herbs That I Like And The Research Behind Them 1. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) - My Favorite Adaptogen An adaptogen is a substance that can raise the body's resilience to various types of physical and emotional stress. We know that stress and resulting [adrenal dysfunction](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/are-your-adrenals-sabotaging-your-health/) are common triggers for Hashimoto's. Adaptogens are thought to relieve adrenal dysfunction by normalizing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis; they tone down overactive systems and boost underactive systems in the body. I love adrenal adaptogens and have used them off and on since 2012, especially during periods of stress. I did stop taking them during my pregnancy, but appreciate that I can take them again now. Many adaptogens, including ashwagandha and tulsi, are known to have galactagogue (lactation-promoting) properties and have been used by nursing moms for centuries to support milk production and to get through the sleep-deprivation that comes with those adorable tiny humans. Many of my clients have noticed in their own health timeline that their thyroid symptoms began after experiencing a particularly stressful period in their life; job changes, graduate school, cross-country moves, and the loss of loved ones are often disease-preceding events that come up on my clients' timelines. Of course, postpartum is one of these stressful (though also joyous) periods, and we know that postpartum thyroiditis is often closely tied to the onset of Hashimoto's. Ashwagandha is a popular adaptogenic herb and is viewed as one of the most important herbs of Ayurveda, with many studies showing it to have adaptogenic and anti-stress properties, along with being neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic, and analgesic. Additional hypothyroid support seen with ashwagandha: The reason ashwagandha is my favorite adaptogenic herb is that research has shown it to be beneficial for normalizing thyroid hormone levels. Remember how adaptogens are supposed to normalize the HPA axis and boost underactive systems in the body? One small study showed that after 8 weeks of treatment, ashwagandha improved serum TSH, T3 and T4 levels, normalizing serum levels. Another study focused on mood disorders found that along with improving mood, ashwagandha could be an effective treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism, as it elevates T4 levels, while providing neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antidepressant properties. Research has also shown ashwagandha to reduce [anxiety](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/autoimmune-thyroid-disease-and-anxiety/) and stress, enhance the quality of [sleep](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/9-ways-to-hack-your-sleep-for-optimal-health-and-rest/), as well as help women with [sexual dysfunction](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/low-libido-and-hashimotos/). I recommend and use the product [Ashwagandha by Pure Encapsulations](https://www.purerxo.com/thyroidpharmacist/rxo/products/product_details.asp?ProductsID=325), but note that if stress or adrenal dysfunction is your trigger, you could also try [maca](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFLHU2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000FFLHU2&linkCode=as2&tag=thyroipharma-20&linkId=de08af66b921152dc00a310898dc2d34) in a favorite smoothie. [Rootcology Adrenal Support](https://rootcology.com/collections/supplements/products/adrenal-support) and [Daily Stress Formula by Pure Encapsulations](http://www.purerxo.com/thyroidpharmacist/rxo/products/product_details.asp?ProductsID=1153) are other good options. Precautions when taking ashwagandha: Ashwagandha is not to be taken by pregnant women. Though it can be used as a galactagogue for lactating women, I always recommend working with a knowledgeable herbalist/lactation consultant to ensure that it is appropriate. It may be contraindicated in the small percentage of individuals with allergic reactions to plants in the nightshade family (tomatoes, white potatoes, eggplant, bell peppers, cayenne pepper, etc.). Though I have not personally seen clients react to the supplemental form that is taken as a capsule, my friend Magdalena Wszelaki, a hormone specialist who is training as an herbalist, mentioned that the powdered form of ashwagandha (used in a latte), caused joint pain in about one third of her clients. From attending herbal conferences, she learned that ashwagandha taken in a tincture form does not cause the same problems. It would seem that the problematic constituents are water-soluble, which is why they are not extracted into a tincture. Ashwagandha is contraindicated for those taking immuno-suppressant medications and may have an additive effect when combined with sedatives or thyroid medications. As it has thyroid-boosting properties, I always recommend testing thyroid function while taking ashwagandha if you have hypothyroidism (which you should do anyway if you take thyroid medications!), and avoiding it with hyperthyroidism, unless it's specifically recommended by your practitioner. Always consult with your physician prior to taking any new prescription medications or herbal supplements. 2. Aloe Vera (Aloe barbadensis miller) - What Doesn't It Do? I often suggest to people that they keep an aloe vera plant in their home, as it can filter out toxins in the air, is loaded with nutrients (including thyroid-supportive [selenium](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/selenium-deficiency-and-hashimotos/), [zinc](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/hashimotos-and-zinc-deficiency/) and [magnesium](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/new-studies-on-magnesium-and-thyroid-health/)), and contains the amino acid (a precursor for thyroxine). Aloe vera is antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory and is used to address a variety of Hashimoto's triggers such as [blood sugar imbalances](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/blood-sugar-imbalances-and-hashimotos/), [gut viruses as well as the [Epstein-Barr virus](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/epstein-barr-virus-and-hashimotos)), and infections. Take a look at your health timeline... do you have any of these triggers? Additional hypothyroid support seen with aloe vera: I was really excited to learn about a new study from Italy, which focused specifically on the benefits of aloe vera in Hashimoto's. Interestingly, one of the researchers who initiated the study saw that her own Hashimoto's markers improved after she began drinking aloe vera on a daily basis, to soothe her digestion and use as a laxative for constipation. The study used 50 mL of Aloe barbadensis miller juice (or ABMJ, which is the botanical name for the aloe vera plant) twice daily, for a period of nine months, in women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and subclinical hypothyroidism. After the nine-month trial, there was a decrease in serum TSH and TPO antibodies (a 54 percent reduction!), as well as an increase in serum free T4, in those who took ABMJ daily. Interestingly, serum free T3 declined by 16 percent after 3 months, with no further decline after another six months. The exciting part of this recent study was also seeing the conclusion that the aloe vera juice used was found to be as effective as selenium, which we know (from research and my own clinical findings) is effective in reducing thyroid antibody levels by as much as 40 percent. I recommend supplementing with [Rootcology Aloe](https://rootcology.com/collections/supplements/products/aloe). You can learn more details about [aloe vera's uses, benefits, and research here](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/aloe-vera-thyroid-digestion-immune-support/), including how it can help with gut issues, such as [acid reflux](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/got-acid-reflux/) and constipation (common issues for many within our community). This same article also includes important precautions when using aloe vera. 3. Black Seed Oil (Nigella sativa) - Liver Support and Immune Health [Black seed oil](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/black-seed-oil-and-hashimotos/) (Nigella sativa), commonly known as black cumin, has been touted as a \"cure for anything but death!\". Black seed oil can be used as a spice or condiment, and has many medicinal properties. Black seed oil has been used throughout history as a liver tonic, antibacterial agent, analgesic; and as an appetite stimulant, antihypertensive, galactagogue, diuretic, and more. It has been studied relating to its many pharmacological actions, including having anti-cancer, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, bronchodilator, the liver), gastro-protective, antioxidant, antidiabetic, and immunomodulatory properties. The many therapeutic properties of black seed oil are due to one primary bioactive component called thymoquinone. Research has shown that thymoquinone has four properties of significant health impact: it has antioxidant, hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer (antimutagenic and antitumor) effects. It is also used as an alternative treatment in a variety of chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. As an immune-modulator, many of my clients use Nigella sativa for joint inflammation; it has been shown to be effective for the management of rheumatoid arthritis patients. Additional hypothyroid support seen with black seed oil: Of particular interest to those with Hashimoto's are the hepatoprotective (liver protective) properties of black seed oil. I have found that most people with Hashimoto's have liver congestion, and in fact, I always start out with my [Liver Support Protocol](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/support-liver-recover-from-thyroid-disease/) when working with new clients. Food sensitivities and toxins are often the culprit here... did you find any food sensitivities on your health timeline? [Gluten](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/gluten-root-cause-thyroid-condition/) is a big one. [Dairy](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/going-dairy-free-to-reverse-hashimotos/) was a huge trigger for me. Did you note a time where you were exposed to toxins, perhaps during [dental work](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/dental-amalgams-silver-fillings-root-cause/)? Heavy metal toxicity, as well as simple environmental toxin exposures, can stress our liver. This is particularly troublesome for people with the [MTHFR gene mutation](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/mthfr-hashimotos-and-nutrients/). Black seed oil has been shown to postpone the progression of chronic liver diseases and to have protective effects. In one review, black seed oil and its primary active compound, thymoquinone, were noted to act as an \"antidote in different intoxications induced by natural toxins including mycotoxins and endotoxins.\" Additionally, other chemical toxicities were shown to be prevented by black seed oil, including: some heavy metals (lead, cadmium, mercury and aluminum), pesticides, solvents, and environmental pollutants found in your kitchen (including BPA and DEP). This review of in vitro and animal studies also concluded that black seed oil could protect certain tissues against drug overdoses of various analgesics, antibiotics, and other medications. Note that this review was based on anecdotal evidence only, and recommended human trials were still necessary to verify the authors' conclusions. Additionally, Nigella sativa has antibacterial properties against [H. pylori](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/hashimotos-and-graves-remission-after-helicobacter-pylori-eradication/), a common Hashimoto's trigger. About four months after the birth of my son, I noticed some digestive symptoms, a hoarse voice, and hair loss. I tested my thyroid antibodies and found that they were elevated (despite being in remission before and during pregnancy). Luckily, I knew a thing or two about reducing thyroid antibodies and getting Hashimoto's into remission. I completed the [GI MAP](https://www.directlabs.com/thyroidrx/OrderTests/tabid/29159/language/en-US/Default.aspx) test and found that I had H. pylori. I wasn't able to take my usual H. pylori protocol, due to nursing, but my friend Dr. Maya Shetreat-Klein shared that Nigella sativa can be safely used to treat H. pylori while nursing (Nigella sativa is also used as a galactagogue, to boost milk supply). Within a few weeks, my sore throat, hair loss, and digestive troubles were gone. I stopped the supplement because I ended up with an oversupply of milk, but further testing showed that the thyroid antibodies were in remission and that the H. pylori was gone. Nigella sativa has also been shown to improve thyroid status in both animal and human studies. In one study, Nigella sativa improved hypothyroid status and decreased serum TSH levels in rats. In one human study, TSH and thyroid antibody levels decreased, while T3 concentrations increased after 8 weeks. Researchers also evaluated the beneficial effects of black cumin seeds alongside levothyroxine in the management of Hashimoto's disease-related metabolic abnormalities. Hashimoto's is a known risk factor for hyperlipidemia (elevated blood cholesterol) and diabetes mellitus. The study found that patients benefited from the lipid-lowering effects of Nigella sativa, and had greater reductions in body weight and BMI. Black seed oil is available in the following forms: Precautions when using black seed oil (Nigella sativa): Talk to your doctor before using black seed oil if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, have a medical condition (low blood pressure, bleeding disorders, diabetes), or are currently taking any medications. If you have surgery scheduled, it is recommended to stop taking black seed oil at least two weeks prior to your surgery date. Black seed may cause an allergic rash when taken by mouth or applied to the skin. Before using black cumin essential oil topically, perform a patch test to ensure you don't have a negative reaction. Always avoid your eyes and mucous membranes when using black seed oil. Store oil away from heat and light. Always consult with your physician prior to taking any new prescription medications or herbal supplements. 4. Cordyceps (Cordyceps sinensis) - Antiviral, Antitumor and Immunomodulating Cordyceps (Cordyceps sinensis) is a fungus that was originally a combination of caterpillar and fungus/mushroom, but is now often synthetically produced. It is an adaptogen that has been used by traditional Chinese herbalists for centuries. Traditional healers recommended it for \"all illnesses\" as a tonic, because they saw that it improved energy, stamina, endurance, appetite, libido, and sleeping patterns. Experiments have shown that cordyceps has several biological attributes, such as antitumor, antiviral, immune-modulatory, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and hypoglycemic benefits; and sexual and reproductive function enhancement. It was also found to have antidepressant and anti-fatigue activities, as well as a protective effect on the kidney and liver. (Different compounds contribute to different bioactivities.) Today, I frequently recommend this herbal therapy when a client's health timeline or testing points to a viral infection such as the Epstein-Barr Virus. Research has shown that cordycepin (isolated from cordyceps) has antiviral activity against a number of viruses including EBV, influenza virus and HIV, among others. This same research also suggests that cordycepin has antitumor actions against gammaherpesvirus. Worldwide, one fifth of cancers are associated with viral infections, including gammaherpesvirus (which includes EBV). There have been other evaluations of cordyceps that relate to it being immunosuppressive, such as when used with kidney transplants. One study found that patients using cordyceps along with the conventional immunosuppressive drug could use less of the conventional drug, and also showed other positive markers (such as improved rates of post-transplant lung infections). In this research, cordyceps also seemed to provide protective effects against the liver and kidney damage that can occur with the use of the conventional immunosuppressive drug alone. Additional hypothyroid support seen with cordyceps: I often recommend this product, [Cordyceps by NOW](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045X9VQC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0045X9VQC&linkCode=as2&tag=thyroipharma-20&linkId=633c1b7927bcde6b6e8070c49aa79ef2), to my clients. In my own clinical practice, I have found cordyceps to be helpful beyond its use as a potent antiviral. It also provides overall liver, gut, and immune support, and is particularly helpful for addressing Hashimoto's suppressive effect on the autoimmune system. Cordyceps may also have the ability to lower levels of thyroid antibodies while reducing Hashimoto's immunoinflammatory process. Studies using a drug derived from cordyceps called Corbrin Capsule, have shown improvements in the autoimmune condition, as well as lowered levels of thyroid antibodies. These positive results applied to both Graves' as well as Hashimoto's patients who used Cobrin Capsule along with conventional thyroid hormone replacement medications. Cordyceps has another interesting connection to Hashimoto's as well. Cordyceps is rich in [selenium](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/selenium-deficiency-and-hashimotos/), and we know that selenium supplementation has been shown to reduce thyroid antibody levels. Precautions when using cordyceps: Cordyceps should not be taken by pregnant or lactating women. People with existing autoimmune diseases (including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and lupus) should consult with their physician, as cordyceps can stimulate the immune system or interfere with medications. Cordyceps can also interfere with blood clotting; discontinue cordyceps at least two weeks prior to any scheduled surgery. Taking cordyceps along with cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan, Neosar) might decrease its effectiveness. Cordyceps might decrease the effectiveness of medications that decrease the immune system response, As always, consult with your physician prior to taking any new prescription medications or herbal supplements. 5. Turmeric (Curcuma longa) - Broad Spectrum Gut Support and Anti-inflammatory Years ago, I suffered from [stomach pain](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/importance-gut-health/), bloating, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and [brain fog](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/hashimotos-affects-brain/). It took a lot of research and guinea pigging activities (what I called my root cause trial and error interventions years ago) before I realized that all of these seemingly unrelated issues had to do with a common root cause, intestinal permeability (\" [leaky gut](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/leaky-gut-and-hashimotos/)\"). Later, I also learned that having intestinal permeability issues is one of three requirements for having an autoimmune condition in the first place (the other two requirements being a genetic predisposition and one or more triggers). Since that \"aha\" moment, in my clinical experience, I have found that about 80 percent of people with Hashimoto's will have one or more gut infections, with close to 100 percent of people having some degree of dysbiosis (an imbalance of the gut bacteria within the gut) or \"leaky gut.\" The good news is that there are many lifestyle interventions that can address gut imbalances, as well as whole body inflammation. Turmeric (Curcuma longa) is one herbal therapy that can be very helpful in both of these areas. Curcumin, the most studied active ingredient in turmeric, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral activity, all of which can provide benefits to those suffering from Hashimoto's-related symptoms. It is great for detoxifying various metals and toxins, too. Years ago, I found out I had arsenic poisoning, and I used curcumin to successfully detoxify my body and prevent long-term damage. A 2014 study showed that curcumin reduced the hepatotoxicity (liver toxicity) induced by arsenic, along with many other metals, including copper, cadmium, lead, mercury and chromium. A lot of my clients find they have heavy metal toxicity issues; the mercury in [dental amalgams](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/dental-amalgams-silver-fillings-root-cause/) can often be the culprit. Research relating to curcumin's anti-inflammatory actions has found it to reduce joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, as just one example. It has also been found to reduce inflammatory effects in several gastrointestinal conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Additional hypothyroid support seen with turmeric: Along with helping to heal the gut and reduce overall inflammation in the body, turmeric has been found to specifically support the thyroid gland against toxic effects. In one study, sodium fluoride was found to negatively affect the function and structure of the thyroid gland, while curcumin was found to be protective against these effects. Clearly, my own experience with arsenic also proved curcumin's effectiveness. Curcumin has also been found to inhibit the growth of thyroid cancer cells in in vitro studies. I recommend the Rootcology product, [Curcumin Absorb](https://rootcology.com/collections/supplements/products/curcumin-absorb), for overall detox support, heavy metal detoxes, and reducing inflammation. You can learn more about [turmeric (curcumin)](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/turmeric-for-your-thyroid-and-hashimotos/) in this article; you'll also find two of my favorite turmeric recipes there. Important Considerations When Using Herbal Therapies I encourage each of you to put on your root cause detective hat and complete your health timeline as a start. It is so helpful and empowering when you identify your own unique root causes. The great thing is, once you do, you can feel better and better as you tackle each one (sometimes fairly quickly, too). Ask your practitioner about my list of favorite herbs to see if one or more might be applicable to you. All of my recommendations for herbal supplements have been made with quality, purity and sustainability in mind. Supplements that you take should always be free of common triggers, such as gluten, dairy and additives that may impair nutrient absorption or worsen your thyroid symptoms. Remember that even though herbs are \"natural\" products, there can be side effects depending on your medical status. Your practitioner can best assess whether underlying medical conditions or potential drug interactions might mean a particular herb isn't right for you. Let me know how my favorite herbs work for you and consider sharing your favorite herbal teas, recipes and results! For future updates, make sure to follow me on P.S. To help you on your journey, you can download a free Thyroid Diet Guide, 10 thyroid-friendly recipes, and the Nutrient Depletions and Digestion chapter of my [Hashimoto's: The Root Cause](https://getbook.at/rootcause) book for free by signing up for my [weekly newsletter](https://thyroidpharmacist.com/gift/).
