It discusses all subjects from both a rule-based and a machine learning approach, and also describes each subject from the perspective of both biological science and clinical medicine. The intended audience is readers who already have a background in natural language processing, but a clear introduction makes it accessible to readers from the fields of bioinformatics and computational biology, as well. The book is suitable as a reference, as well as a text for advanced courses in biomedical natural language processing and text mining.
