Whether on campus or out in the Puget Sound region, UW Tacoma's impressive faculty brings its expertise to students through quality teaching and research and to the community through research, service,and partnership.

At UWT, students have opportunities to learn everything from architectural history to marine ecology, from how to manage and motivate work teams to the best ways of serving the health needs of populations, from social work to urban planning, from managing an elementary classroom to bringing the love of literature into the life of a young child.

FINANCIAL AID RESOURCES The Financial Aid Services coordinator and staff on the UWT campus serve students by administering federal,state and institutional financial aid programs to help students pay for their education. There are four basic types of aid: Grants: Federal, state and institutional grants do not require repayment. Loans: Must be repaid, generally beginning six months after a student graduates or leaves school.Loans require repayment with interest charges of 5 to 10 percent (depending on the program) accruing during the repayment period. Wor k Study: Students can be employed either on or off campus, with the primary focus being that students enhance their field of study by workingpart-time in a career-related position. Scholarships: Awards are based on financial need, academic achievement, or some combination of the two. What is Financial Need? For most aid programs, financial need is defined as the difference between what it costs to attend school and what the student can afford to pay. The amount a studentshould be able to pay is determined by a standard, federally mandated need-analysis method. The method establishes whether a student is financially independent(as many adult students are) or financially dependent on his or her parents and, if so, what they should be able to contribute. It also takes into account past earnings and benefits, a percentage of net assets and all other sources of support. There is no income standard or other simple method of determining whether a student will qualify for need- based financial aid. Any student who thinks he or she needs help should apply. If a student has additional medical, transportation, child-care, or other unusual expenses not covered by the living allowance, the student may, by submitting arevision request with documentation (physician's statement, child-care, or baby-sitter bills, etc.), ask Office of Student Financial Aid to consider the additional costsin his or her budget.14 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2002-2003 CatalogEligibility for Financial Aid To qualify for federal financial aid, a student must: Be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident or other eligible noncitizen; Be admitted to the University in an approved degree program (distance learning, correspondence and most nonmatriculated students are not eligible forfinancial aid) and meet minimum enrollment requirements; Not be in default on a previous student loan or owe a repayment on a grant or loan for which the student was not eligible; Be registered with the Selective Service (if required); Be making satisfactory academic progress. (The definition of satisfactory progress differs with different kinds of aid: for undergraduates, 12credits per quarter are needed to qualify for most forms of aid, but a few forms of aid require six credits. For graduate students, 10 credits perquarter are required for most forms of aid; in a few cases five credits per quarter. Consult the financial aid coordinator for detailed information.) Provide financial information (including parents' information, where required). By law, some students who have drug-related convictions under any federal or state law may be ineligible for federal student aid. Eligible students are considered for funding based on three things: need, class level, and state residency status.Need determines priority for those programs within the class level. Students with the fewest resources are given first priority for all aid funds. Applications and Deadlines The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the basic application for most types of financial aid. The application is available from the Office ofEnrollment Services and Student Affairs for the upcoming year (defined as Summer through Spring quarters) beginning in mid-December or early January.Applications can also be obtained at the Office of Student Financial Aid on the Seattle campus. Students must submit a separate financial aid application or complete a Renewal Application before each academic year. A student who wishes to apply for financial aid to support study during Summer Quarter must submit a separateapplication. T o obtain an application, contact the Office of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs.Renewal Application For students currently receiving financial aid, the federal processor mails renewal applications for the upcomingacademic year directly to the student. The renewal must be received at the federal processor by Feb. 28 for priority consideration. Students can make corrections or updates of their financial information using the renewal application. If students have not received their Renewal FAFSA by Jan. 15, completion of a new FAFSA form, print or online, is advised. FAFSA on the Web FAFSA on the Web is an Internet application developed by the U.S. Department of Education that students may use to complete an electronic FAFSA. Students may complete and submit their FAFSA information directly to the federal processor via personal computer. After transmitting an application over the Internet, students print and promptly mail their signed signature page tothe federal processor. T o access FAFSA on the Web, go to www.fafsa.ed.gov. For priority consideration, the FAFSA, Renewal FAFSA or FAFSA on the Web must be dated as received by the federal application processor by Feb. 28 of each year. Students are encouraged to mail the FAFSA no sooner than Jan. 1 and no later than Feb. 15 before the upcoming academic year. Students who submit their FAFSAs after the deadline, fifth-year students and part- time students may be eligible to borrow funds through the Federal Stafford Loan or the Federal PLUS/Federal Supplemental Loan programs. Undergraduates may qualify for a Federal Pell Grant. Students who apply for financial aid should remember to keep copies of financial documents used in completing the FAFSA, should stay in touch with the financial aid counselor, and should notify the Office of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs of any change in address. Consortium Agreements UW Tacoma students will occasionally need to enroll at a community college in order to complete admissiondeficiencies. The credits at the community college can be counted towards the student's total quarter enrollment credits using a Financial Aid Consortium Agreement.Both UW Tacoma and the community college must approve Consortium Agreements. If approved, Consortium Agreements enable the student to receive financial aid based on the total credits at both institutions. Agreements must be submitted to the Office of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs no later thanthree weeks prior to the start of the quarter.15UNDERGRADUATE UNDERGRADUATE GRADUATE GRADUATE Washington Resident Nonresident Washington Resident Nonresident Federal Pell Grant Federal Supplemental Grant State Need Grant/SSIG University Tuition Exemption University Grant Academic Scholarship Federal Perkins Student Loan Federal Direct Stafford Loan Federal Direct Plus Loan Federal & State Work StudyScholarships Consideration for need-based scholarships is given based on information received on the FAFSA (on-time applicants only).

The amount charged for tuition and fees is set by the state and is indexed to the cost ofinstruction. Because inflation increases costs, tuition rates generally increase each year. Since University costs are supported by state taxes, the rates charged to students who are not residents of Washington state are higher than the rates for residents. Please refer tothe Registration, Academic and University Policies section for information regarding residency classification. Tuition charges are based on the student's classification (undergraduate or graduate) rather than on course level. Rates are subject to changewithout notice. Tuition rates for the 2002-2003 academic year had not been set by the state at the time this catalog was printed. Please consult the quarterly RegistrationGuide or the UW T acoma W eb site for current tuition rates. Estimated Non-Tuition Expenses The following figures are prepared and updated each year by the Office of Student Financial Aid at UW Seattle. They reflect modest, but adequate, probable costs for students attending the University during a nine-month academic year (three quarters). They should be used only as a guide in determining the year's expenses. The expenses reflect anontraditional budget as defined by the Offic e of Student Financial Aid. Nontraditional applies to all graduate students, undergraduates who have children, and married undergraduates whose spouses are not students. For the 2002-2003 school year, other expenses for three quarters as a resident, nontraditional undergraduate student were estimated as follows: Books $ 822 Room and Board 9,384 Personal Expenses 2,253 Transportation 798 Total $13,257 For the 2002-2003 school year, other expenses for three quarters as a resident, nontraditional graduate student were estimated as follows: Books $ 951 Room and Board 9,384 Personal Expenses 2,253 Transportation 798 Total $13,38618 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2002-2003 CatalogTUITION AND FEE PAYMENT Students incur an obligation to pay tuition and fees in United States dollars when they register. A tuition statement is mailed to each student's address on file inthe Registrar's Office during the first week of the quarter. Payment in full of tuition is due by Friday of the third week of the quarter. Nonpayment of tuition and fees bythe due date results in a charge of $50 for balances of $50-$250 and $120 for balances in excess of $250. Students with an overdue balance will not be allowed toregister for the next quarter. Options for tuition payment Plan 1: Tuition in Full This plan is best for students receiving financial aid (suchas loans, grants, scholarships and Chapter 31 V .A. benefits) and those who are able to pay their tuition in full. Payment by check or money order may be made tothe UWT Cashier locaed in GWP 410 or mailed directly to the UW Student Accounts Office, Box 355870 Seattle, WA 98195. Credit card payments may be made online through MyUW. There is a convenience charge assessed when using this option. The amount in full is due by Friday of the third week of the quarter. Tuition may be paid out of the financial aid award or by using emergency loans. Plan 2: Tuition Installment Plan This plan is best for students who are not receiving financial aid and who would like to make payments over several pay periods. Students must enroll for this option each quarter in the Office of the UWT Registrar during the first week of the quarter. One third of the tuitionplus a $10 service charge is due by the first Friday of the quarter. The remaining balance of tuition is due in two equal payments on the third and fifth Fridays of the quarter. In order to qualify for the installment plan all payments must be made on time. Payments must be made to the UWT Cashier. When the payment is not in conformance with the tuition and fee billing, specific instructions on how the payment is to be applied must accompany the payment.In the absence of instructions, the University makes a reasoned interpretation of the student's intent and accounts for the funds accordingly. The student numbermust be specified on all payments. Tuition Forfeiture When students drop or withdraw from courses after the first week of the quarter and the drop results in lowertuition, the University reserves the right to collect one- half the tuition through the 30th calendar day of the quarter for the dropped course or courses and full tuitionafter the 30th calendar day of the quarter. In some circumstances students may petition the registrar to have the tuition forfeiture waived. Details are available in theOffice of the Registrar located in the Office of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs (see below).Request to Waive Tuition Forfeiture or Reg istration Fees If a student feels that he or she has been charged a tuition forfeiture or registration fee in error or wishes to contest a forfeiture or fee, he or she may complete a Request toWaive T uition Forfeiture or Registration Fees form. Failure to receive a tuition bill does not nullify a student's responsibility for payment by the tuition due date and is not an acceptable justification for a waiver. Please refer to the form for appropriate guidelines for granting these requests. Tuition and Fee Refund When a fee payment is made by check, a waiting period is required before a refund can be authorized. An application for refund may be refused unless it is made during thequarter in which the fees apply.

Tuition and fees not paid by the end of the academic quarter are subject to an interest charge of 1 percent per month, or fraction thereof (12 percent APR), beginningthe month following the end of the quarter. An administrative hold also may occur when a student has not complied with other University rules, proceduresor obligations. The hold may be placed on the student's record by the authorized University office responsible for enforcement of the rule, procedure or obligation involved. The student is not permitted to register for any subsequent quarter or to obtain a transcript of his or her record or a certified statement except on the written release of the office that placed the hold. TUITION EXEMPTION Eligible University and State of Washington employees and members of the Washington State National Guard may enroll for and receive a tuition exemption for up tosix credits each quarter, provided they enroll on a space available basis. Eligible students are allowed to enroll for more than six credits and will be charged tuitionaccordingly for the additional credits. All students participating in the tuition-exemption program will be assessed a quarterly $30 registration fee and must payother applicable fees, including the technology fee. A participating student may not register for any course, including the credits beyond six that the student willbe paying for, prior to the student's assigned space- available registration day or the exemption will be canceled. Matriculated students desiring a higher registration priority to facilitate course enrollment may choose to cancel their exemption for the quarter, register early and pay regular tuition rates. Space-availabilityapplies to degree programs as well as courses, and fully enrolled programs may not have space to accommodate students using the tuition-exemption.20 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2002-2003 CatalogEligible students must hold one of the following statuses on the day the exemption form is approved, and must be in that status on the first day of the quarter forwhich the exemption was granted.

Continuation must be in the same classification (undergraduate, postbaccalaureate or graduate) and at the same campus. After a student has earned a baccalaureate degree, he or she must apply for readmission as a postbaccalaureate, nonmatriculated or graduate student. Newly admitted students and students readmitted to the same or a new classification (undergraduate, postbaccalaureate or graduate) or admitted to a different University campus are eligible to register during a specified time period. See \"Registration Periods\" on page 22. Exceptions to the guarantee of registration eligibility include students under disciplinary action, students with a financial hold on their records and students failing to meetconditions of admission or not meeting program or University satisfactory-progress policies. Additionally, continuing students who withdraw during the first week of two consecutive quarters (Summer Quarter not included) will not be eligible to register as continuing students for the third quarter and must reapply as former students returning to the University. If an undergraduate does not enroll for two or more quarters, he or she must file a Returning Student application for readmission with the Office of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs. Quarter-Off Policy Undergraduate students who have completed a quarter at the University of Washington, Tacoma, may take the following quarter off and remain eligible to register during Registration Period I (see page 22) for the subsequent quarter without reapplying as a returning student. Anyquarter from which a student has completely withdrawn, or from which he or she is canceled, does not constitute a completed quarter. Summer Quarter enrollment is not required to maintain continuous registration eligibility. The quarter-off policy is not available for graduate students; please see Graduate Student On-Leave Status (page 28). Graduating Senior Priority Graduating seniors or postbaccalaureate students with a degree application on file in the Graduation Office may register on the first day of Period I (see page 22) for theirfinal two quarters. Students who postpone their graduation may save their priority quarters by not registering before their regular senior or postbaccalaureate priority day.

Students may drop only one course each academic year (Autumn through Summer quarters) from the third through the seventh week of the quarter. To drop a course officially, a student must complete the transaction electronically using MyUW or submit adrop card in the UWT Office of the Registrar. A student who drops a course unofficially (only through the instructor or adviser, for example) is given a grade of0.0. Students receiving or applying for financial aid should check with the financial aid counselor before dropping a class because it may affect financial aideligibility. Students should be aware that dropping a course may affect their student account. Please see the \"Tuition and Fees\" section of this catalog. During Summer Quarter, the timeline for dropping a course is abbreviated due to the shortened session. Please consult the Summer Quarter Registration Guidefor specific dates. Hardship Withdrawal Policy Students may petition the UWT Registrar in writing for a Hardship Withdrawal if they are unable to complete acourse due to physical or mental debilitation or unusual or extenuating circumstances beyond their control that may have arisen and prevented them from dropping thecourse by the seventh week. Petitions must be filed promptly after the occurrence of the event that gave rise to the need for dropping, preferably prior to the end of the quarter. Only in rare circumstances will petitions be accepted after the close of the quarter in which the withdrawal is being petitioned. Students who have completed the requirements for the course are generally not eligible for a hardship withdrawal.The Petition for Hardship Withdrawal should be completed by the student and submitted to the UWT Registrar in the Office of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs. Supporting documentation as detailed on the petition form must accompany the petition. The Registrar reserves the right to verify the authenticity and details of the documentation.

Students who withdraw after the seventh calendarday through the 30th calendar day continue to owe one half of their tuition. Students who withdraw after the 30th calendar day continue to owe full tuition. The following principles apply to complete withdrawal from the University: Courses dropped as part of a complete withdrawal from the University during the first two weeks of a quarter are not recorded on the student's UW transcript; however, the date of the complete withdrawal is recorded. A recipient of veterans benefits should immediately notify the veterans benefits coordinator of withdrawal. A student with a scholarship or loan awarded through the University should notify the financial aid counselor of withdrawal. Withdrawal for Military Service Students who are conscripted into the Armed Forces or called to active military duty may withdraw through the end of the seventh week of instruction and receive a full refund but no academic credit.

A 3.9 - 4.0 3.9 - 4.0 A- 3.5 - 3.8 3.5 - 3.8 B+ 3.2 - 3.4 3.1 - 3.4 B 2.9 - 3.1 2.9 - 3.0 B- 2.5 - 2.8 2.5 - 2.8C+ 2.2 - 2.4 2.1 - 2.4 C 1.9 - 2.1 1.7 - 2.0 Lowest passing grade (graduate) C- 1.5 - 1.8 \u2014 D+ 1.2 - 1.4 \u2014 D 0.9 - 1.1 \u2014 D- 0.7 - 0.8 \u2014 Lowest passing grade (undergraduate) E 0.0 0.0 - 1.6* Failure or Unofficial Withdrawal. No credit earned. The following letter grades may also be used: CR: Credit awarded in a course offered on a credit/no-credit basis only or in courses numbered 600, 601, 700, 750 and 800. The minimum performance level required for a CR grade is determined, and the grade is awarded directlyby the instructor. CR is not computed in GPA calculations. NC: Credit not awarded in a course offered on a credit/no-credit basis only or in courses numbered 600, 601, 700, 750 and 800. The grade is awardeddirectly by the instructor and is not included in GPA calculations. S: Satisfactory grade for courses taken on a satisfactory/not-satisfactory basis. An S grade is automatically converted from a numerical grade of 2.0 or abovefor undergraduate classes and 2.7 or above for graduate classes. The grade S may not be assigned directly by the instructor, but is a grade conversion by the Office of the Registrar. Undergraduate students may elect this optiononly for free electives and cannot be used to satisfy a University, college or department course requirement. With the approval of their program adviser, graduate students may elect to be graded S/NS in any numerically-graded course for which they areeligible. S is not computed in GPA calculations. *Grades below 1.7 in graduate programs are recorded as 0.0 by the Registrar.26 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2002-2003 CatalogNS: Not Satisfactory grade for courses taken on a satisfactory/not-satisfactory basis. A grade less than 2.0 for undergraduate classes and 2.7 for graduate classes is converted to NS. NS is not included in GPA calculations. No credit is awarded for courses in which an NS grade is received. I: Incomplete. An Incomplete is given only when the student has been in attendance and has done satisfactory work until within two weeks of the end of the quarter and has furnished proof satisfactory to the instructor that the work cannot be completed because of illness or other circumstances beyond the student's control. T oobtain credit for the course, an undergraduate student must convert an Incomplete into a passing grade no later than the last day of the next quarter. The student shouldnever re-register for the course as a means of removing the Incomplete. An Incomplete grade not made up by the end of the next quarter is converted to a grade of 0.0 by the Office of the Registrar unless the instructor has indicated when assigning the Incomplete grade, that a grade other than0.0 should be recorded if the incomplete work is not completed. The I (Incomplete) is not removed from the permanent record and appears on the transcript with the completed grade. An instructor may app rove an extension of the Incomplete removal deadline by contacting the UWT Registrar no later than the last day of the quarter following the quarter in which the Incomplete grade was assigned. Extensions, which may be granted for up to three additional quarters, must be received before the Incomplete has been converted into a failing grade. In no case can an Incomplete received byan undergraduate be converted to a passing grade after the lapse of one year. W: Official withdrawal or drop from a course from the third through the seventh week of the quarter for undergraduates. A number designating the week of the quarter is recorded with the W when a course is dropped. It is not computed in GPA calculations. HW: Grade assigned when an undergraduate is allowed a hardship withdrawal from a course after the 14thcalendar day of the quarter (see Hardship Withdrawal Policy on page 20). It is not computed in GPA calculations. N: Indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress and a final grade will be given at the end of the quarter the work is completed. Used only for hyphenated courses (courses not completed in one quarter) and courses numbered 600, 601, 700, 750 or 800. Grade-Point Average (GPA) The cumulative GPA includes both credits granted for courses taken in residence at all campuses of the University of Washington and those with a DL (Distance Learning) suffix taken through UW EducationalOutreach (UWEO). The UW transcript also reflects grades for other UWEO courses that are not residence credit and grades for credit by examination. These lattergrades do not affect the student's UW cumulative GPA.Computation of GPA The grade-point average for graduation is computed by dividing the total cumulative grade points by the totalcredits attempted for courses taken in residence at the University. Grade points are calculated by multiplying the number of credits by the numeric value of the gradefor each course. The sum of the grade points is then divided by the total credits attempted. Courses elected on an S/NS basis are counted as follows: Satisfactorygrades are printed on the permanent record as an S and do not count in the quarterly or cumulative grade-point average, but they do count as credits earned toward graduation. Not-satisfactory grades, NS, do not count in the quarterly and cumulative grade-point averages and do not count as credits earned toward graduation. Example 1: Course Credits Grade Grade Points TIAS 498 3 x 0.0 = 0.0TSMIN 300 5 x 2.9 = 14.5 TCSIUS 445 5 x 3.2 = 16.0 30.5 Total credits earned toward graduation: 10 Total graded credits attempted: 13 Grade-point average = 30.5 \u00f7 13 = 2.35 The total graded credits attempted, not the credits earned toward graduation, are used in computing theGPA. Example 2: Course Credits Grade Grade Points TBUS 300 5 x 2.3 = 11.5 TBUS 310 5 x 2.9 = 14.5 TBUS 320 5 x I = 0.0 26.0 Total credits earned toward graduation: 10 Total graded credits attempted: 15 Grade-point average = 26.0 \u00f7 10 = 2.60 The student attempted 15 credits, but only 10 are graded, because the I is not computed in the grade-point average. If the work in TBUS 320 is not made up by the end of the quarter, the I will convert to a numeric gradeof 0.0 and the grade-point average will be recomputed. When the grade of 0.0 is received, it is computed in the grade-point average, but no credit is awarded toward grad uation. Repeating Courses With the approval of the academic program offering the course, a student may repeat a course once. Both the original grade and the second grade will be computed in the grade-point average, but credit will be allowed only once. V eterans receiving benefits must receive approvalfrom the veteran's coordinator in the Office of Enrollment Services and Stude nt Affairs before a course is repeated.27 Academic and University PoliciesClass Attendance The University of Washington, Tacoma reserves the right to drop students who have not attended class during the first week of the quarter to make space for other studentswaiting to enroll. However, students should not assume that they will automatically be dropped from a course if they do not attend. It is the student's responsibility todrop the course through MyUW. Students who are registered for a course section but do not attend will be assigned a failing grade by the instructor. Students maynot attend a course in which they have not been officially registered after the first two weeks of the quarter. An instructor may allow a student to attend his or her class only if the student's name appears on the official class list from the Office of the Registrar. Other faculty members may attend informally with the approval ofthe instructor. Grading Procedures Change of Grade Except in case of error, an instructor may not change a grade that he or she has submitted to the registrar. A student who finds administrative omissions or errors in a grade report must make application for a review notlater than the last day of the student's next quarter in residence. Grades used to meet graduation requirements cannot be changed after the degree has been granted.Time spent in military service is not counted as part of the two-year limitation. Students are not automatically notified of grade changes posted after the first of the quarter. Grade Appeal Procedure A student who believes he or she has been improperly graded first discusses the matter with the instructor before the end of the following academic quarter. If thestudent is not satisfied with the instructor's explanation, the student may submit a written appeal to the director of the student's academic program with a copy of theappeal also to the instructor. This must be done no later than 10 class days after his or her discussion with the instructor. The director consults with the instructor toensure that the evaluation of the student's performance has not been arbitrary or capricious. Should the director believe the instructor's conduct to be arbitrary orcapricious and the instructor declines to revise the grade, the director, with the approval of the voting members of his or her faculty, shall appoint an appropriate member,or members, of the faculty of that program to evaluate the performance of the student and assign a grade. The UWT Vice Chancellor and the University of WashingtonProvost should be informed of this action. Once a student submits a written appeal, this document and all subsequent actions on this appeal arerecorded in written form for deposit in a program file. Grad e Reports The University of Washington does not mail grade reports. Students access their grades online using MyUW.SCHOLARSHIP Academic Standards Students are expected to meet the traditional standards of honesty and truthfulness in all aspects of their academic work at UW Tacoma. In particular, all worksubmitted to an instructor in fulfillment of course assignments, including papers and projects, written and oral examinations, and oral presentations and reports,must be free of plagiarism. Plagiarism is using the creations, ideas or words of someone else without formally acknowledging the author or source through appropriate use of quotation marks, references and the like. Student work in which plagiarism occurs will not be accepted as satisfactory by the instructor and may leadto disciplinary action against the student submitting it. Any student who is uncertain whether his or her use of the work of others constitutes plagiarism should consultthe course instructor for guidance before formally submitting the work involved. Low Scholarship Academic Warning An undergraduate student whose grade-point average falls below 2.00 in his or her first quarter at the University receives an academic warning. If a cumulative grade- point average of at least 2.00 for courses earned in residence at the University is not achieved by the end of the next quarter, he or she is placed on academicprobation. Academic Probation and Dismissal for Low Scholarship An undergrad uate student is placed on academic probation at the end of any quarter (except for the firstquarter at the University, when an academic warning is issued) in which his or her cumulative grade-point average falls below 2.00. Once on probation, the student must attain at least a 2.50 for each succeeding quarter's work until the cumulative grade-point average is raised to a 2.00, or the student is dropped for low scholarship. Reinstatement An undergraduate student who has been dropped under low-scholarship rules will be readmitted to the Universityonly at the discretion of the UWT Admissions, Academic Standards and Graduation Committee. A student readmitted after being dropped under these rules reenters on academic probation. The student's GPA is the same as when dropped from the University, and the student may not use grades from other colleges or universitiesto raise his or her UW grade-point average. A readmitted student is dropped if he or she fails to attain either a 2.50 grade-point average for the following quarter's workor a cumulative UW grade-point average of 2.00 at the end of that quarter. The student is removed from probation at the end of the quarter in which a cumulativegrade-point average of 2.00 or better is reached. The Petition for Reinstatement form is available from the Office of the UWT Registrar.28 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2002-2003 CatalogSenior in Final Quarter A senior who has completed the required number of credits for graduation, but whose work in what would normallybe his or her final quarter places him or her on probation does not receive a degree until removed from probation. Dean's List Quarterly Dean's List The quarterly high-scholarship list includes the names of matriculated undergraduate students who have attained a quarterly grade-point average of 3.50 in thefinal grades for at least 12 graded credits. Appropriate high-scholarship entries are made on the student's permanent academic record. Annual Dean's List The yearly award for high scholarship is recorded on the academic transcript of undergra duate students enrolled for three quarters of the academic year (summer through spring) and who earned a quarterly GPA of 3.50 in 12 or more numerically graded credits each quarter. It is alsorecorded for students enrolled for four quarters who met the standard just mentioned and also earned a quarterly GPA of 3.5 or better in the fourth quarter if enrolled for10 or more credits. Annual Dean's List Certificate Annual Dean's List Certificates are awarded to studentsin the junior and senior classes who have high scholastic records for their sophomore or junior years, respectively. The Honors Committee on the University of Washington, Seattle campus determines the grade-point average required for the awarding of certificates. Students receive a certificate and a letter of congratulations from the UWT Chancellor. Baccalaureate Honors Baccalaureate honors (summa cum laude, magna cum laude, cum laude) are awarded only to recipients of a first baccalaureate degree. These honors are earned by those students who have completed no fewer than 90residence credits at this institution. At least 60 of the 90 credits must have been acquired on a graded basis. The University's Honors Committee determines annually the grade-point requirement for each baccalaureate honor. In recent years, approximately 10 percent of the students have been awarded baccalaureatehonors. Credits earned by extension courses are not counted toward honors eligibility. August graduates who participated in the preceding June commencement should contact their program adviser regarding recognition of honors at the June ceremony. Faculty Honors At the University of Washington, Tacoma, faculty honors are awarded to those students receiving a baccalaureate degree, whose GPA is in the upper 10 percent of theirprogram and who have earned between 43 and 89 graded credits at the UW.STUDENT RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES It is the responsibility of the student to become familiar with all academic and administrative regulations and procedures relating to his or her course of study at UWT.

GRADUATE STUDENT POLICIES The following section contains detailed information concerning policies and procedures relating to graduate students and graduate studies. Students should verify all information with the program adviser of the individual academic program or appropriate staff. Grad uate Courses Graduate courses are intended for, and ordinarily restricted to, either students enrolled in the Graduate School or graduate nonmatriculated students and aregiven numbers from 500 to 800. Some courses at the 300 and 400 levels are open to both graduates and upper- division undergraduates. Such courses, when acceptableto the supervisory committee and the specific academic program, may be part of the graduate program. The Graduate School accepts credit in approved 300-level courses for the minor or supporting fields only. Courses at the 300 level are not included in the calculation of grade-point average (GPA) and will not apply toward the minimum Graduate School requirement of 18 graded credits for the master's degree. App roved 400-level courses are accepted as part of the major as well as minor or supporting fields. Courses numbered 490 and titled Special T opics and Special Projects normally are notapplicable to a graduate degree program if addressed primarily to introductory content and undergraduate students. Undergraduate research (499) is not acceptedas part of the graduate program. Graduate School Memorandum No. 36 offers additional information on graduate courses. With the exception of summer, students are limited to a maximum 10 credits per quarter of any combination of courses numbered 600, 700, or 800. Graduate Student On-Leave Status Graduate students who do not maintain continuous enrollment (Summer Quarter excepted) must file a petition for On-Leave status with their program office. To be eligible for On-Leave status, the student must have registered for, and completed, at least one quarter. An On-Leave student is permitted to use the University Library but is not eligible for other University privileges.On-Leave status forms are available from your program office. A $35 fee is charged for each petition filed. Students who are registered for any portion of a quartermay not go on leave for that quarter unless they officially withdraw at the UWT Office of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs prior to the first day of the quarter.30 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2002-2003 CatalogOn-leave status can be granted for up to four quarters. On-leave graduate students returning to the University on or before the termination of their authorized periodsof leave must submit a Returning Student Application form, available from the program office. No fee is assessed when returning from on-leave status. Re-admission A student previously registered in the Graduate School who has failed to maintain graduate student status but who wishes later to resume graduate studies must obtain from the UWT program office an application for re-admission to the Graduate School and then file the application by the published closing dates. If the student is re-admitted,registration will occur during the usual registration period. If the student has attended any other institution during the period when not registered at the University of Washington,official transcripts in duplicate of the student's work must be submitted. An application for re-admission carries no preference and is treated in the same manner as anapplication for initial admission, including the requirement for payment of the application fee. The Graduate School normally allows six years to complete requirements for a master's degree. Periods spent on-leave or out of status are included. 31Undergraduate and Postbaccalaureate OVERVIEW 37 Business Administration 59 Environmental Science 65 Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences 101 Nursing 109 Social Welfare 115 Teacher Certification (K-8) 119 Urban Studies CONTINUED Undergraduate and PostbaccalaureateUNDERGRADUATE ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS The University of Washington, Tacoma offers upper-division (300- and 400-level) courses.

Any student who desires transcripts of work elsewhere must order official copies from the institution at whichthe work was undertaken. UWT does not issue or certify copies of transcripts from other institutions. Change of Application Quarter The application that a student submits is valid only for the quarter specified. If a student wants to change the quarter of the application, the student must submitanother application and fee. Certain circumstances warrant completion of the Petition to Update Application Quarter for the undergraduate (not T eacher Certification) programs. If the petition is granted, then the student will not need to complete another applicationor submit another application fee. Please check with the Office of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs for the petition and its guidelines. Priority Dates for Applications Early application is strongly advised. In order to be assured consideration, the completed application, along with any other required documents, should be submitted by thepriority date listed. Although not all UWT programs admit students into their majors every quarter, alternative admission categories may be available foreligible students. Please contact the individual program offices for details. All programs, except T eacher Certification, will continue to accept applications after the priority deadline. Admission will be offered to qualified students as long as there is space available in the program. Pleasecontact the individual program offices for details. Notification of Admission Decision When all required documents have been received, an evaluation is made and the applicant is notified of his or her admission status. An offer of admission is generally valid only for the quarter indicated. Applicants who wish to be considered for a different quarter may be required to file a new application and pay the associated fee. (See Change of Application Quarter above.) Admissions credentials ofapplicants who do not register for the quarter to which they have been admitted are normally retained for a period of one year from the quarter of application. Atthe end of this period credentials on file are destroyed unless the applicant has notified theUniversity of Washington, Tacoma of a continued interest in attending UWT. Admission Categories The Office of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs can assist applicants who are uncertainabout the proper admission category. Matriculated students New students at UW Tacoma seeking their first undergraduate degree are normally admitted to aspecific academic program as matriculated students. Postbaccalaureate students Postbaccalaureate is a matriculated status at the Univer sity of Washington, Tacoma. Postbaccalaureate students are those who have completed one or morebachelor's degrees and are either enrolled in the T eacher Certification program or working toward another bachelor's degree. The application of their previouscoursework toward graduation requirements will be determined by program faculty and advisers.PRIORITY APPLICATION DATES FOR UNDERGRADUATES33Nonmatriculated students Although a student enrolled at the University of Washington, Tacoma in a nonmatriculated status cannot earn a degree in that status, a grade is earned and full credit is awarded and recorded on a UW transcript. The credits earned as a nonmatriculated student usuallytransfer to other institutions. If a student is later accepted into a matriculated status at the Tacoma campus, courses earned as a nonmatriculated student may be applied toundergraduate degree requirements, with some restrictions. Students admitted as nonmatriculated may be limited in the number of credits they will be allowedto accrue in this status. The number may vary by program. Students considering switching to matriculated (degree-seeking) status are encouraged to do so as soon as possible as 45 of the last 60 credits of a baccalaureate degree must beearned as a matriculated student in residence at the Tacoma campus. Students who wish to change their status from nonmatriculated to matriculated must apply to do so by the end of the first week of the quarter.Change-of-status applications received after the first week will be processed the following quarter. Applicants seeking matriculated status may have admission and registration priority over nonmatriculated applicants. Returning former students A returning former UWT undergraduatestudent who has not been enrolled for more than one quarter (not including summer) is required to complete and file a Returning Student Application and pay a $35 application fee by the application priority date. Because academic programsdetermine admission based upon prior academic record and space av ailability, admission is not guaranteed to returning students. Returning nonmatriculated students are re-admitted as space permits. Contact the specific academic program office to discuss the re-admission process. Pre-major students Students wishing to register for UWT courses in a quarter other than the quarter in which their desired programregularly admits (e.g. Business or Nursing) may request approval from that program to enroll as a pre-major student on a space-available basis. Pre-major is amatriculated status. International students Admission of international students on F-1 visas to UWT is limited and available for Autumn Quarter only. International students must adhere to the application deadlines specified above.

Entering students are expected to have completed their first twoyears (90 quarter credits) of college study before entry. The University of Washington, Tacoma requires a minimum transfer GPA of 2.0 for admission, however, many academic programs have higher minimum requirements. UWT has certain other general requirements (called General University Requirements, or GURs) that are incorporated into the specific admission requirements for undergraduate programs (see table on page 33). Ninety transferable credits may be accumulated from a variety of accredited colleges or universities and possibly satisfy admission requirements. Because eachUWT program has a specific set of prerequisites, it is best to meet with an adviser early to plan a course of study. Undergraduate Transfer Credit To students pursuing a first bachelor's degree, UWT awards transfer credit according to the guidelines listed below. It reserves the right to accept or reject creditsearned at other institutions of higher education. In general, it is University policy to accept credits earned at institutions fully accredited by the regional accreditingassociation, provided that such credits have been earned through university-level courses (see exceptions on page 34) appropriate to the student's degree program. For courses taken at a Washington state community college, UWT follows the list of transferable courses publishedin the UW Transfer Guide. Notable Restrictions on Transfer Credit Community college credit A maximum of 90 credits from community collegecoursework may be applied toward the credits required for the bachelor's degree. All of the credits transferred from two-year colleges may be used toward graduationrequirements, with the proviso that a student must accumulate at least 90 upper-division credits at UWT or at another baccalaureate institution (see seniorresidency requirement, under Requirements for the Baccalaureate Degree). All transferable courses earned outside UWT are available to be applied toward specificdegree requirements, but 90 additional upper-division credits must be earned. UW Extension distance learning If permitted by the specific academic program, up to 90 credits earned in correspondence courses offered by the Distance Learning division of UW Extension may beapplied toward a UW degree. However, 45 of the student's final 60 credits must be taken in residence at UWT to meet the Final-Y ear Residence Requirement.Extension credit from other schools No more than 45 credits earned as extension credit from other schools may be applied toward a UW degree.Military credit, discussed below, is included in the 45 extension credit limit. Guidance/Personal development A maximum of three (3) credits is awarded for courses in this area as part of the 15 credits allowed for vocational/technical courses. Limitation on ROTC credits Credits earned in first- and second-year military training courses may not be counted in the 180 credits that are required for graduation. Some third- and fourth-year courses may count, depending on the student's degree prog ram. Military credit Credits earned in Armed Forces Training Schools (AFTS) and through USAFI and DANTES may not exceed 30credits and are included in the 45 extension credit limit. Official transcripts or DD-214 or DD-295 forms must be submitted, and credit will not be awarded until after the student has enrolled. Scores received in such coursework are not included in the transfer GPA. Out-of-sequence courses Credit is not awarded for prerequisite courses completed after a more advanced-level course has been completed. For example, students will not be awarded credit for Spanish 102 if it was taken after Spanish 103. Physical education No more than three (3) quarter credits will be allowed for physical education activity courses. Vocational-technical courses A maximum of 15 transfer credits will be awarded for a wide range of college-level courses that are vocational- technical, rather than academic, in content (i.e., bookkeeping, electronics, physical therapy technician). These credits may apply only to the elective component of a baccalaureate degree and only with programapproval. Courses Receiving No Credit Courses receiving no transfer credit include (but are not limited to): Courses below college level (usually numbered below 100) Repeated or duplicate courses Coursework taken at an institution that is not accredited by the regional association Courses that provide instruction in a particular religious doctrine Mathematics courses considered below college level, including basic math, business math,beginning and intermediate algebra Courses offered for non-credit continuing education units35Remedial English (e.g., reading, vocabulary development, grammar, speed reading, or any courses that are preparatory to an institution's first English composition course) Courses providing instruction in English as a Second Language (100-level or above) Remedial courses in any academic discipline Any course in the following categories: aeronautics/aviation/pilot training air conditioning/heating-refrigeration allied health (optics) auto mechanicsbeginning typing carpentry/construction methods cooking/baking cosmetology custodial training/maintenance diesel mechanicsfire science graphics reproduction horse-shoeingmilitary science (lower division) replacement parts stationary steam engineeringstudy skills water science technology Colleg e-Level Examination Program (CLEP): The University does not accept or award credit for CLEP general or subject examinations. Any such credit awarded by other institutions, or through independent testing, will not be transferred to the Univer sity. Applicability of Transfer Credit to Degree Req uirements The Office of Enrollment Services and Student Affairs has the authority to make decisions approving transfer credit to the University and application of transfer creditsto fulfill general education and proficiency requirements. The individual academic program offices have the authority to determine application of transfer credits tofulfill major requirements. By the first quarter of enro llment, a student should meet with a program adviser to plan a program of study.The program adviser will determine how the transfer credits may be used in meeting degree requirements. Quarter vs. Semester Credits Colleges and universities that operate on a semester system award semester credit . The University of Washington, Taco ma awards quarter credit . One semester credit is equivalent to 1.5 quarter credits; one three-semester-creditcourse is equivalent to 4.5 quarter credits. Sixty (60) semester credits are equivalent to 90 quarter credits.Class Standing A student's initial class standing is determined by thetotal number of transfer credits awarded by the University of Washington, Tacoma, not by the number of years of college study or completion of an associate's degree. The following table lists the required credits for each class: Sophomore ........ 45-89 credits Junior ................. 90-134 credits Senior ................. 135 credits or more Students should note that satisfying Tacoma campus graduation requirements depends not only on the number of credits completed (a minimum of 180) butalso on completion of all program requirements. Transfer GPA In calculating the transfer GPA, the following guidelines apply: Grades from all transferable academic courses attempted, from all colleges the student has attended, in which the student has received gradesbetween 0.0 and 4.0 on a 4.0 grading scale are included in the calculation. Repeated courses. At UW Tacoma, the most recent grade for a repeated course is used in the transfer GPA. ( Note: This method is different from that used in calculating the UWT GPA for UWT courses that have been repeated.) All transferable academic credit from two-year colleges is included in the calculation, even if it exceeds 90 credits. The following are not included in the transfer GPA: Courses considered by UWT to be below college level Math courses equivalent to MATH 098 (formerly MATH 101, Intermediate Algebra) Certain religion courses that teach from a particular doctrinal perspective or that teachpreparation for the ministry Developmental or remedial courses Courses in study skills Lower-division military science courses English as a Second Language courses Vocational/technical courses Courses recorded with a grade of \"Incomplete\" Courses recorded with a grade of \"Pass\" or \"Satisfactory\" P.E. activity credits in excess of three quarter credits Undergraduate and Postbaccalaureate36 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2002-2003 CatalogCompletion of Admissions Deficiencies and Requirements General University and Quantitative/Symbolic Reasoning (QSR) courses Coursework to fulfill the general university and quantitative/symbolic reasoning requirements can be completed through enrollment at a community college, at a four-year institution or through UW DistanceLearning.

TheInstitute builds on UW T acoma's strong tradition of providing opportunities for people to enhance their careers and enrich theirlives through challenging, rewarding educational programs. As part of the Institute of T echnology, the Computing and Software Systems (CSS) program focuses on preparing students toenter the broad field of computer software design, development and maintenance. It develops the theoretical base and cultureto promote lifelong evolution within the rapidly-changing field while preparing students to quickly become effectivecompetitors, innovators and entrepreneurs in the field. The program also provides opportunities for thepracticing professional to keep abreast of emerging theory and application. The program actively seeks partnerships withlocal leading professionals and companies to advance the field throug h collaborative ventures, forums, research and internships. MISSION The mission of the Computing and Software Systems program is to offer high-quality, upper-division under- graduate and graduate education to meet the needs of a diverse range of citizens and employers in the state of Washington, especially in the South Puget Soundregion. The Computing and Software Systems program is one of the newer programs atthe University of Washington, Tacoma. Undergraduate courses began during thefall of 1999. A new master of science degree in Computing and Software Systems will begin offering classes in fall of 2002. Overthe next several years the full breadth and depth of the program will emerge. Descriptions of the core courses for theprogram are included in this catalog. Specific details about the concentrations, the Computing and Software Systemselectives and further development of the program are available from the program office. The program is being designed toaccommodate students with previous degrees and students with work experience in the computing field. CURRICULUM The curriculum, which leads to a Bachelor of Science degree in Computing and Software Systems, emphasizes the theoretical foundation and practical experience necessary for a career in the challenging and rewarding profession of software specification, development, design, implementation, maintenance, andre-engineering. The curriculum emphasizes the latest paradigms, languages and techniques of today's practitionerswhile building a strong base to support life-long learning in the field. It also prepares students for graduate as well ascontinuing education. Industrial partnerships provide opportunities for aBACHELOR OF SCIENCE COMPUTING AND SOFTWARE SYSTEMS54 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2002-2003 Catalogwide spe ctrum of experiences complementing on- campus research and practical experience. The curriculum has been built on the following principles: Computer software professionals must be capable of effectively employing the appropriate computinglanguage to best meet the needs of a specific application. They must be prepared to learn and proficiently use new languages as they becomeavailable, as well as to maintain and re-engineer existing applications in their original languages. The field of computer software continues to evolve rapidly. This can be expected to continue through the career span of today's students. Students must, therefore, possess the foundations, tools and lifelonglearning skills to keep current in the field. Mathematical maturity and an understanding of the underlying theories of computing, computers, information andcomm-unications provide a critical foundation. Important software applications tend to be large and complex. It takes teams to prod uce them. Software must be error- free, robust, efficient andmodifiable. The quality of its user interfaces and the interfaces to otherapplications is critical to its effectiveness. The adherence to accepted standards and procedures for softwaredevelopment is essential to the development process. Software development involves a community of participants. Effectivemanagement of the participants and the processes is critical to itssuccess and ultimate value. All participants need to understand theexpected principles and norms to be utilized in making the processeffective and efficient. Practitioners of software design need to be able to join colleagues and competitors immediately in exploiting the latestconcepts and tech- nologies. Preparation for professional-levelcontributions in the fieldmust include an intro-duction to and relevant experience with these emerging concepts and technologies. Software professionals must have excellent communication skills. Software development and maintenance requires that all participants\u2014from conceptualizers to specification writers, designers, modelers, coders, testers, manual writers, and customer supporters\u2014be precise and clear incommunicating ideas, concepts, designs and processes for a software project to succeed and meet its potential. Software professionals must take responsibility for their products and applications. They must practice the highest standards of ethics and must design theirsoftware to meet the most stringent social norms and societal expectations. The working lives of users, the value of the products and the future of the industryitself depend upon practitioners being proactive in exercising their best judgment, effort and constraint. *Students are encouraged to select courses from the Associate in Arts and Sciences distribution list at the community college level. ** Students are expected to have a working knowledge of the design and implementation of medium- sized object-oriented programs (typically 1000 lines).

The focus of the curriculum is the comparative study of peoples, groups, societies, cultures and environ- ments within the United States and selected regions of the world. T o provide an interdisciplinary and comparative basisfor the study of different groups, societies and cultures, the Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences curriculum is organized aroundthree general dimensions of social life: Culture and Ideas (Fine Arts and Humanities), Society and the Individual (Social Sciences) and The Natural World (Natural Sciences).INTERDISCIPLINARY ARTS AND SCIENCES70 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2002-2003 CatalogThe goals of the Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences curriculum are to help students: Develop proficiency in skills such as writing andcritical thinking that are needed for productive careers, and gain mastery of a broad curriculum inthe humanities, social sciences and environmental science; Achieve knowledge of the theories, concepts and methods of cross-cultural analysis; Understand the complexity of relations between groups, societies, cultures and natural environments; the history of these relations and the forces of socialchange; Gain a knowledge and appreciation of cultures other than their own while exploring the expression of cultural identity, thought and beliefs through literature and the other arts; and Build experience in the analysis of environmentalissues and their scientific basis. ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS All students who have completed UWT's General UniversityRequirements with a cumulative GPA of 2.0 and 90 credits will be considered for admission to all concentr ations except Environ- mental Studies, which has additional prerequisites. General University Requirements for the Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences Program at UWT are shown in the table at right. Entering students are expected to have completed 90 quarter credits before entry. Substitutions may be allowed for certainrequirements. When ad equate space is available in the program, students who have not completed all of the admissions requirements may be admitted. However, all therequirements listed must be completed prior to graduation, normally within the first year ofenrollment at UW Tacoma. Since not all these requirements can be completed through coursework at the Tacoma campus, students mayneed to enroll at a community college in order to make up some deficiencies. When the Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences Program is fully enrolled and there are more qualified applicants than can be accommodated, admission will be competitive and applicants will be evaluated on three principal criteria: Appropriateness of academic preparation for the degree program Likelihood of success in the degree program Relationship between the degree program and academic or career plans and opportunities ADVISING Students are strongly encouraged to meet with a program adviser early in their careers at UWT.

Program Administrator Nan West Adviser Dannah Madden Bachelor of Science in NursingThe Nursing program focuses on the discovery and dissemination of knowledge that promotes health. The curriculum emphasizes and fosters the integration of teaching, inquiry and service withina community of learners. Partnerships with the community assistthe program in providing learning environments in which learnersbuild upon their skills and knowledge to strengthen their under- standing of local, national and global health issues. The Nursingprogram at the University of Washington, Tacoma, provides two degree opportunities for registered nurses: a Bachelor of Science inNursing (B.S.N.) and a Master of Nursing (see page 168). Affiliated with the University of Washington School of Nursing at the Seattle campus, UWT's Nursing program is accredited by the Commissionon Collegiate Nursing Education. PHILOSOPHY OF UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION The members of the Nursing faculty believe that the purp ose of university- based undergraduate nur sing education is to prepare professional nurses whose practice is informed by theory and research. The philosophy of the undergraduate curriculum is rooted invalues of excellence, diversity, community, social justice, integrity and creativity. Preparation for the various roles in practice requires knowledge of the arts and sciences, together with content and processes foundational to the discipline.The Nursing program is a community of learners and scholars\u2014a community that is created in collaboration with students.The members of the faculty believe that their teaching styles need to take into account the diverse nature of howstudents learn. Ultimately, nursing education requires a commitment to community service, scholarly inquiry, interdisciplinarity and lifelong learning.PROGRAM OVERVIEW Students in the B.S.N. program are registered nurses who have completed the initial phase of their education through an associate degree or diploma nursingprogram. As most students in the UWT Nursing program are employed in health- care settings, courses are scheduled toenable students to continue employment while enrolled in the program of study. A B.S.N. from UWT enhances the graduate's ability to contribute to his or her community's institutions and to the health of citizens of Washington state, particularly during this period of rapid change in health care. The B.S.N. curriculum focuses on critical thinking, responses to health and human functioning, nursing intervention and person-environment interactionwithin a context of cultural diversity. An interdisciplinary emphasis encourages an understanding of a broad range of ideas,knowledge and methods of study.BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN NURSING104 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2002-2003 CatalogPROGRAM GOALS Opportunities are provided to enable the learner to develop professionally and to meet the Nursing program goals, which are for students to: Communicate clearly and succinctly in speech and in writing.

The program is a full-time,fifth-year course of study and practice designed for people who holda bachelor's degree. Students are admitted to the program eachsummer and progress as a cohort through four quarters of full-time study and extensive field experiences in public schools. The Teacher Certification Program at UWT is designed to prepare educators to implement the Washington State Student Learning Goals andEssential Academic Learning Requirements. In support of Washington's ongoing public school reform, our program employs sound educational research and theory, which provide structure andcontent to our curriculum and instruction. We want to ensure that our graduates have a positive impact on student learning. This program is intended to prepare teachers for urban school teaching. UWT has established partnerships with school districts in the South Puget Sound region. Cooperating teachers and university faculty members work together to provide interns with a program that ensures integration of course content with hands-on experience. Site placements in partnership schools begin in late summer and continue through the remainder ofthe program. The curriculum features an introduction to teaching in all areas ofthe elementary and middle school curriculum, preparation for non- curricular aspects of the teacher's role,reflection on contemporary issues in education and frequent supervision. As teaching interns, students will become a part of instructional teams and will experience the daily life of schools and students for the entire public schoolyear. Within this collaborative model ofschool-university cooperation, interns will gradually take on increasingly responsible roles in classrooms. Their experience will culminate with a quarter of full-timeteaching in the spring quarter.

The transcripts and other student records from the prior records can be forwarded to supplement the new application, and the new application fee may be waived. GNM students pay fees and tuition at the regular graduate-student rate based on residency of the student including the Student Services and Activity Fee and the Technology Fee. GNM students are not eligible for financial aid because most financial aid is governed byfederal regulations that require students to be enrolled in degree programs. Students will be assigned a UWT student number and receive a student identification cardthat entitles them to all privileges and access to facilities that are extended to matriculated students. VISITING GRADUATE STUDENTS A student who wishes to enroll in a graduate program at the University of Washington, Tacoma and who intends thereafter to return to another graduate school in whichhe or she is working toward an advanced degree may be admitted as a visiting graduate student. This admission is contingent on available space and facilities. Such astudent must have been officially admitted to another recognized graduate school and be in good standing and currently pursuing a graduate degree. Admission to theUniversity of Washington, Tacoma, as a visiting graduate student does not guarantee admission to any particular course of study. A visiting graduate student is permitted to register only in those courses for which he or she is judged to be eligible by a faculty adviser or the instructor of the course and if space is available to accommodateregistration. Further details regarding application and other relevant policies may be obtained from the appropriate program office at UWT or on the Web atwww.grad.washington.edu. TRANSFER CREDIT A student working toward a master's degree may petition the Dean of the Graduate School for permission to transfer to the University of Washington the equivalent of a maximum of six quarter credits of graduate levelcoursework taken at another recognized academic institution. These credits may not have been used to satisfy requirements for another degree. The petitionmust include a written recommendation from the graduate program coordinator and an official transcript indicating completion of the coursework. Transfer creditsare not entered on the UW transcript. University of Washington students who are within six credits of completing their undergraduate degree and whohave met the requirements for admission to the Graduate School may register the quarter immediately preceding admission to Graduate School for up to six credits in 500-level courses in addition to the last six credits they require of undergraduate work. The graduate program that has admitted the student must app rove registration for the courses. The student, after admission to the Graduate School, must file a petition with the Dean of the GraduateSchool to transfer the six credits. The student must also provide a letter from the Office of Graduation and Academic Records stating that these credits have not been applied toward the undergraduate degree. Contact your specific program for details. GRADUATE STUDENT POLICIES The following section contains detailed information concerning policies and procedures relating to graduate students and graduate studies. Students should verify allinformation with the program adviser of the individual academic program or appropriate staff. Grad uate Courses Graduate courses are intended for, and ordinarily restricted to, either students enrolled in the Graduate School or graduate nonmatriculated students, and are given numbers from 500 to 800. Some courses at the 300 and 400 levels are open to both graduates and upper- division undergraduates. Such courses, when acceptable to the supervisory committee and the specific academic program, may be part of the graduate program. The Graduate School accepts credit in approved 300-level courses for the minor or supporting fields only. Courses at the 300 level are not included in the calculation of grade-point average (GPA) and will not apply toward Graduate Programs138 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2002-2003 Catalogthe minimum Graduate School requirement of 18 graded credits for the master's degree. Approved 400-level courses are accepted as part of the major as well as minor or supporting fields. Courses numbered 490 and titled Special T opics and Special Projects normally are not applicable to a graduate degree program if addressedprimarily to introductory content and undergraduate students. Undergraduate research (499) is not accepted as part of the graduate program. Graduate SchoolMemorandum No. 36 offers additional information on graduate courses. With the exception of summer, students are limited to a maximum 10 credits per quarter of anycombination of courses numbered 600, 700, or 800. Graduate Student On-Leave Status Graduate students who do not maintain continuous enrollment (Summer Quarter excepted) must file a petition for On-Leave status with their program office. To be eligible for On-Leave status, the student must have registered for, and completed, at least one quarter and be in good academic standing. An On-Leave student is permitted to use the University Library but is not eligible for other University privileges. On-Leave status forms are available from your program office. A $35 fee is charged for each petition filed. Students who are registered for any portion of a quarter may not go on leave for that quarter unless they officially withdraw atthe UWT Office of Enrollment Service and Student Affairs prior to the first day of the quarter. On-leave status can be granted for up to four quarters. On-leave graduate students returning to the University on or before the termination of their authorized periods of leave must reapply for admission by completing aReturning Student Application form, available from the program office. Re-admission A student previously registered in the Graduate School who has failed to maintain graduate student status but who wishes later to resume graduate studies must obtain from the UWT program office an application for re-admissionto the Graduate School and then file the application by the published closing dates. If the student is re-admitted, registration will occur during the usual registration period. If the student has attended any other institution during the period when not registered at the University of Washington, official transcripts in duplicate of the student's work mustbe submitted. An application for re-admission carries no preference and is treated in the same manner as an application for initial admission, including the requirementof payment of the application fee. The Graduate School normally allows six years to complete requirements for a master's degree. Periods spent on-leave or out of status are included. GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MASTER'S DEGREE It is the responsibility of each graduate degree candidate to meet the following Graduate School minimum requirements (plus any additional requirements that may be specified by the program in which the master's degree is being earned; see item 7): 1.Under a thesis program, a minimum of 36 quarter credits (27 course credits and a minimum of nine credits of thesis) must be presented. Under a non- thesis program, a minimum of 36 quarter creditsof coursework is required. 2. At least 18 of the minimum 36 quarter credits for the master's degree must be for work numbered500 and above. (In a thesis program, nine of the 18 must be course cr edits and nine may be for Master's Thesis [700].) 3. Numerical grades must be received in at least 18 quarter credits of coursework taken at the University of Washington, Tacoma. The Graduate School accepts numerical grades in approved 400- level courses accepted as part of the major, and in all 500-level courses. The student must earn aminimum grade of 2.7 in each class in order for it to be counted. A minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 is required for a graduate degree at the University. 139 Graduate Programs4. The residence requirement for the master's degree is one year (three full-time quarters). Students registered for fewer than 10 credits per quarter may add part-time quarters together to achieve the equivalent of one full-time quarter (10 or more credits) to be applied toward fulfilling residencerequirements. However, excess credits beyond 10 may not be subtracted from one quarter and added to another. Once a student is admitted to a grad uate degree program, a full quarter of residence is granted for any quarter in which at least 10 credits in approved courses, research,thesis, or internship are satisfactorily completed. 5.In a thesis degree program, a thesis, approved by the supervisory committee, must be submitted tothe Graduate School. A student must register for a minimum of nine credits of thesis (700). With the exception of summer, students are limited to a maximum of nine credits per quarter of thesis (700). 6.A final master's examination, either oral or written, as determined by the student's supervisorycommittee, must be passed if it is a program requirement. 7.Any additional requirements imposed by the graduate program adviser in the student's major department or by the student's supervisory committee must be satisfied. A master's degree student usually takes some work outside the major department. The graduate program coordinator in the major department or the student's supervisory committee determines the requirements for the minor or supporting courses. 8. The graduate student must apply for the master's degree within the first two weeks of the quarter in which he or she expects the degree to be conferred. See Graduate Degree Application Process below. 9. The graduate student must maintain registration as a full- or part-time student at the University forthe quarter in which the degree is conferred. A student who does not complete all degree requirements by the last day of the quarter must be registered for the following quarter. 10. All work for the master's degree must be completed within six years. This includes quarters spent on leave or out of status and applicable work transferred from other institutions. 11. A student must satisfy the requirements for the degree that are in force at the time the degree is to be awarded.Graduate Degree Application Process When you are within one quarter of completing the degree requirements, you must apply for the master's degree on the Web. You will be required to have a UWNetID before completing the master's degree application. The degree application is found at: www.grad. washington.edu/stsv/mastapp.htm . If you cannot complete the master's request online or need to make changes, please contact Graduate School Student Services at studentservices@grad.washington.edu . You must complete the entire request, including the Exit Questionnaire. Y ou will not be able to return to the Request page to make changes or complete information at a later time. Status updates on your degree request will be sent via e-mail; therefore, an e-mail address is required before completing the application. The request period commences Monday, the third week of each quarter and closes the Friday of the second week of the subsequent quarter (the quarter you intend to graduate). For example, if you will complete your graduation requirements in Winter Quarter, the earliest you can submit a request is the third week of Autumn Quarter and the latest is the Friday of the second week of Winter Quarter. If you do not receive your degree in the requested quarter, you must complete another degree request for the quarter in which you expect to complete requirements. Y ou must determine that you will have met the minimum Graduate School requirements by the end of the quarter in which you plan to graduate. Please consult your graduate program adviser regarding additional program requirements. You must be registered as a graduate student and complete a minimum of two credits during the quarter in which degree requirements are met and the degree is conferred. Commencement Formal commencement exercises are conducted at the close of Spring Quarter. In April of each year, commencement information is sent to each student entitled to participate (i.e., those who graduated the previous August, December, or March and those who anticipate graduating in the current June and August). Diploma distribution Diplomas are produced approximately 12 weeks after the end of the quarter in which they are earned and aremailed to the student.140 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2002-2003 CatalogBusiness Administration 141OVERVIEW Phone (253) 692-5630 Fax (253) 692-4523 Locat ed in Dougan 401 Campus mailbox 358420 Web site www.tacoma. washington.edu/ business Director Patricia M.

TheInstitute builds on UW T acoma's strong tradition of providing opportunities for people to enhance their careers and enrich theirlives through challenging, rewarding educational programs. As part of the Institute of T echnology, the Computing and Software Systems (CSS) program focuses on preparing students toenter the broad field of computer software design, development and maintenance. It develops the theoretical base and cultureto promote lifelong evolution within the rapidly-changing field while preparing students to quickly become effectivecompetitors, innovators and entrepreneurs in the field. The program also provides opportunities for thepracticing professional to keep abreast of emerging theory and application. The program actively seeks partnerships withlocal leading professionals and companies to advance the field throug h collaborative ventures, forums, research and internships. MISSION The mission of the Computing and Software Systems (CSS) program is to offer high-quality, upper-division under- graduate education to meet the needs of a diverse range of citizens and employers in the state of Washington, especially in the South Puget Sound region. The Computing and Software Systems program is one of the newer programs at the University of Washington, Tacoma.Courses began during the fall of 1999. Over the next several years the full breadthand depth of the program will emerge. Descriptions of the core courses for the program are included in this catalog.Specific details about the concentrations, the Computing and Software Systems electives and further development of theprogram are available from the program office. The program is being designed to accommodate students with previousdegrees and students with work experience in the computing field. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN COMPUTING AND SOFTWARE SYSTEMS The Master of Science degree in Computing and Software Systems will prepare graduates for high-tech careers assystem analysts, support specialists, computer engineers, database administrators, software developers andproject managers, as well as for many positions with related titles. The Bureau of Labor Statistics within the U.S.Department of Labor reports that starting salaries for graduates with a master's degree in CSS are approximately 25 to 30percent greater than starting salaries for graduates with a bachelor's degree in CSS. The M.S. program accommodates both students who have a baccalaureate degree in a computing field (such as computer science, computing and software systemsor computer engineering) as well as thoseMASTER OF SCIENCE COMPUTING AND SOFTWARE SYSTEMS148 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2002-2003 Catalogwhose baccalaureate degree was awarded in non- computing-related disciplines. To accommodate such a diverse population of students, as well as those studentswho may not have the necessary background to immediately matriculate into a master's program, multiple paths of entry, transition, progression and completion will be available within the degree program. ENTRY TRACKS The M.S. offers two tracks for entry to the program: Entry Track 1 is for those whose baccalaureate degree was awarded in non-computing-related disciplines, Entry Track 2 is for students who have a baccalaureate degree in computing (such as computer science, computing and software systems and computer engineering). T o accommodate such a diverse population of students, aswell as those students who may not have the necessary background to immediately matriculate into a master's program, multiple paths of entry, transition, progression,and completion are available within the degree program. Entry Track 1 The M.S. Entry Track 1 for persons whose bachelor's degree is from a non-computer science-related disciplineis a 60-credit hour program. The M.S. degree differs from the bachelor's degree in the degree of exposure to theoretical concepts, and in the requirement that thestudent demonstrates his/her ability to synthesize and apply these concepts outside of the classroom through a thesis, significant capstone design project or internship. Students would be expected to come to the program with a working knowledge of object-oriented programming. The Entry Track 1 consists of the following courses: TCSS 443 Mathematical Principles of Computing II (5 credits) TCSS 560 Software Development and Quality Assurance T echniques (5) TCSS 422 Computer Operating Systems (5) TCSS 445 Database System Design (5) TCSS 558 Distributed Applied Programming (5) TCSS 540 Theory of Computing (5) TCSS 4** 697/699/700 Internship/Project/Thesis (10)Entry Track 2 The M.S. Entry Track 2 is for persons whose bachelor's degree is from a CSS/CS/CEG program at an accredited university. It is a 40-credit hour program. The M.S. Entry Track 2 consists of the following courses: TCSS 558 Distributed Applied Programming (5) TCSS 540 Theory of Computing (5) TCSS 4** CSS1 (5) TCSS 697/699/700 Internship/Project/Thesis (10) THE MASTER OF SCIENCE CURRICULUM The Master of Science in the CSS program will provide a broad overview of the technologies and theoriessupporting computing and software systems, with a focus on distributed and networked (for example, Internet- based) computing. The master's program will differ fromthe bachelor's program in the degree of exposure to theoretical concepts and the requirement that students demonstrate their ability to synthesize and apply theseconcepts outside of the classroom. This goal is achieved in three stages: Foundational courses to emphasize theoretical (conceptual) as well as practical (embodied) knowledge; Theory courses refine critical thinking skills andbreadth of knowledge; A thesis, significant capstone design project orinternship to strengthen confidence, leadershipability and communication skills. Students completing an M.S. in CSS from the Institute of T echnology should have the following competencies: An understanding of the business and team communication models as they apply to software design and development; Familiarity with the software development cycle, both in application and theory; Skill in developing distributed, or Web-based, applications using the C++ and Java programming languages, along with the knowledge and skill to rapidly learn new languages as they enter the workplace; Field experience through participation in a cooperative software development project, industrial internship or directed research; A foundation for self-directed learning to stay at theleading edge of this fast-changing field.149ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS Applicants must provide evidence of the successful completion of a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution with at least a 3.0 GPA. For those who have abachelor's degree in a computing-related discipline, there are no further prerequisites. Those with a bachelor's degree in another field must demonstrate successfulcompletion of coursework in: Calculus Science (physics preferred) Proficiency in object-oriented design and programming (Java preferred) Discrete Structures Data Structures APPLICATION PROCESS Those interested in enrolling in the Master of Science in Computing and Software Systems should make an appointment with an adviser by calling (253) 692-5860.

The graduate courses offer opportunities to pursue questions of interest across a wide range of fields, spanning the humanities, social sciences and environmental sciences, with special e mphasis on the relation of knowledge to public action. WHAT ARE INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES? Our concept of interdisciplinary studies is founded on a recognition that our experience of phenomena\u2014such as the public problems of poverty, violence, social justice or environmental degradation\u2014do not come in neatlybounded, disciplinary or professional packages. While disciplinary divisions of labor are convenient and necessary to theefficient pursuit of in-depth knowledge, the application of that knowledge in the sphere of public action requires itsbroader re-integration with the rich, multidisciplinary dimensions and complexities of actual, live situations. The structure of the Master of Arts program is highly flexible, building on the wealth of interdisciplinary expertise among members of the faculty. A requiredseries of four core courses and a capstone course addresses issues of models, problem formation, evidence, and values.The core courses examine the basic foundations of knowing and acting, making them relevant to diverse areas ofspecific inquiry. Through electives and a thesis (or masters project), students are encouraged to apply the lessons of the core courses to their own chosen areas of interdisciplinary interest. A broad range of student interests can be accommodateddue to the interdisciplinary nature of the prog ram.The program integrates the sociology of knowledge, philosophy, social and political theory, history, cultural studies, anthropology and systems theory to shedlight on domains of public action. Examples of possible areas of interest, broadly de fined, might include the environment, education, ethnicity, gender, families, arts policy andadministration, children and the media, human rights, labor, immigration, trade, development, urban studies, the role ofstate and local government, nonprofit organizations, or international non- governmental organizations. Students will learn: How alternative paradigms or models condition our knowledge of the world and how our choice of potential responses connects to howwe perceive things to be organized. How to gain insight into the impact of culture and history on the way certain phenomena come to be defined in the public arena asproblems, and how they are variously imagined to be caused or solved in relation to diverseprofessional and disciplinary claims of ownership over them. How evidence can be justified, generated, evaluated and used with varying degrees of validity withindiverse frames of application.MASTER OF ARTS INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES164 University of Washington, Tacoma | 2002-2003 CatalogHow to gain insight into the ways in which values are implicitly or explicitly present in every arena socially deemed to be problematic, and how it maybe possible to facilitate communication, negotiations, or trade-offs among and across diverse value frames. WHAT IS PUBLIC ACTION? Public action entails a series of determinations that are reached as a result of the following considerations: What is the nature of the problem to be addressed? What mode of analysis is to be employed? What will count as evidence? What values are considered relevant or irrelevant? What options are included or excluded? What outcomes of the action are anticipated or unanticipated? By exploring these questions the master's program becomes a sustained investigation of factors that critically shape actions, procedures and outcomes. The factors to be inv estigated include: Conceptual models, or paradigms Social, professional and institutional cultures Various types of data used to support alternative perspectives and decisions How various value frameworks shape perspectives, decisions and actions These factors provide a foundation for knowledge and action in the public sphere. The core course of study inthis program may therefore apply to virtually any profession or endeavor in our shared public life; whether one works in a large organization or a one-person shop,whether one seeks knowledge for utilitarian ends or to achieve a richer understanding of the world in which we all must live and act.PROGRAM DESIGN The Master of Arts program emphasizes foundations of public action and is a 55-credit master's degree. The curriculum includes: Four core courses ................................ 24 credits Electives ............................................... 15 creditsFinal project or thesis ......................... 10 creditsCapstone course .................................... 6 credits Core Courses The four core courses are closely integrated, constituting a single, extended investigation of how issues and problems are evaluated in the process of taking action.The courses examine analytical tools and how social and organizational cultures influence the work required in moving toward taking action. Models and Critical Inquiry Evidence and Action Culture and Public Problems Values and Action Capstone Course Students enroll in the capstone course after the completion of the core course series. The capstone provides a forum for re-integrating the separate themes of the four core courses and considering how they can be applied to the students' areas of interest. Area of Emphasis Students will work with a faculty adviser to develop a focus within the student's chosen area of interest. The required 15 credits of electives are to be chosen carefully in consultation with the academic adviser, as stepping stones toward the substance of the thesis or project. Inaddition to elective courses developed specifically for the Master of Arts degree, students can select from a wide range of courses offered at UWT, including some of those offered in other UWT graduate programs. Undergraduate courses appropriate to the student's thesis topic can be taken as graduate courses by enrolling in them as TIBCG 590, Independent Study courses. This option requires completion of all the undergraduate requirements, as well as additional work to be negotiated with the instructor that will raise the course demands to grad uate level. Thesis or Project The final product of the graduate program must be a thesis or a scholarly project that demonstrates a level of competence equivalent to a thesis. Students negotiate specific thesis questions and plans in consultation withfaculty, focused on their own chosen goals and areas of interest. It is the student's responsibility to recruit a thesis chair and at least one other reader to constitute a thesis committee. The chair may be the academic adviser or may be someone else whose area of expertise most overlaps with the focus of the thesis or project.165ENROLLMENT & CURRICULUM SEQUENCING Admission is competitive and is based on space availability in the core courses.
