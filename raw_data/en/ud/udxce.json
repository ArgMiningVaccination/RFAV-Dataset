Although our research involves all disciplines, there is particular strength in diabetes, kidney disease, cancer, aging, infectious disease and health services research. UTHSA is the proud home of an NIH-CTSA, Claude Pepper Center Older Americans Independence Center, Nathan Shock Center and a VA Geriatrics Education Research and Clinical Center and Department of Medicine faculty have leadership roles in each. The Department is embarking on a major expansion of its research programs with increased infrastructure, laboratory renovations and targeted recruitments. San Antonio is a wonderful place to live and to work. The 7th largest city in the US, it offers the many attractions and opportunities expected of a metropolis but without the usual congestion and high cost of living. San Antonio has been ranked as one of the most livable cities in the US and is a very popular destination for visitors and retirees. There are many recreational activities in San Antonio and the surrounding Texas Hill Country, including the scenic downtown Riverwalk, the historic Alamo, the newly revitalized Pearl Brewery district, Six Flags and Sea World, rafting on the Guadalupe River, great shopping and great food. Thank you for your interest in the Department. Whether you are a prospective student, resident or faculty member, I invite you to learn more about our programs.
