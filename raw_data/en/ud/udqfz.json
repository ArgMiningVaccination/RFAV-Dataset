Learn about BHG's Gardening Review Board While houseplants can add lushness and color to a room, many species can be toxic to pets that may decide to munch on a leaf or two. Luckily, several non-toxic plants for dogs and cats can add beauty to your home without posing a threat to Fido. These 15 species are technically safe for cats and dogs, but it's still best to eliminate temptation and place all houseplants out of reach. If your pet ever does nibble on a plant, even one unlikely to cause health issues, watch closely for any signs of an adverse reaction. Just because a plant isn't toxic doesn't mean it won't cause a tummy ache if your pet decides to snack on it. If you have concerns about your pet, contact the ASPCA Pet Poison Control Hotline. 9 Common Houseplants You Might Not Know Are Poisonous 01 of 15 African Violet purple african violet saintpaulia ionantha. Kritsada Panichgul Want greenery that offers non-toxic plants for dogs and cats and produces gorgeous blooms? Look for African violets. They come in a range of purple and pink hues, are low-maintenance, and thrive without bright light. Keep the soil moderately moist, and water African violets by letting them soak up moisture through the pot's drainage hole to avoid damaging the leaves and petals. This flowering houseplant can brighten up even the smallest spaces because it stays less than 12 inches tall. 02 of 15 Air Plant Peter Krumhardt Tillandsia varieties make excellent pet-friendly, low-maintenance houseplants because they don't need soil to grow. Most air plants will stay smaller than 12 inches and thrive in bright, indirect light with a quick soak in water about once a week. However, cats and dogs alike will find their spindly, grass-like leaves tempting to chew on, so keep them out of reach. 03 of 15 Aluminum Plant or Watermelon Plant aluminum plant pilea cadierei. Denny Schrock The variegated gray-and-green leaves of aluminum plant (part of the genus Pilea) make it an attractive, non-toxic plant for dogs and cats. It stays shorter than 12 inches, grows well in medium to low light, and only needs water when the top inch of soil is dry. Since it tolerates low light, you can grow it almost anywhere that's out of reach of your furry friends. 04 of 15 Christmas Cactus lavender christmas cactus plant detail. Kritsada Panichgul Unlike its dangerous holiday counterpart, amaryllis, Christmas cacti are non-toxic plants to have around curious cats and dogs. Of course, you still shouldn't let your pets chew on it (Christmas cacti can cause intestinal discomfort if eaten), but overall it's a safer choice than many other festive plants. Christmas cacti can easily be confused with Thanksgiving cacti, but both are safe for pets and have similar care requirements. Both cacti stay relatively short (under 12 inches) but can spread up to 2 feet and grow best with regular waterings and bright, indirect light. Succulents vs. Cacti: What's the Difference? 05 of 15 Some Varieties of Ferns maiden hair fern fritz luth detail. Jay Wilde Identifying ferns can be tricky, as several plants with the word \"fern\" in their name aren't actually part of the fern family. True ferns such as Boston and maidenhair are fair game as indoor plants that are safe for pets. Just beware of toxic misnomers like asparagus fern, which is actually part of the lily family. Though their size can vary, most ferns have similar needs: They like indirect light, evenly moist soil, and high humidity. 06 of 15 Friendship Plant friendship plant moon valley cats tongue. Michael Partenio The friendship plant (closely related to aluminum plant) is named for the ease with which it can be divided and shared. If you get one as a gift, rest assured it's a non-toxic plant for dogs and cats, even if they take a bite of this plant's fuzzy, crinkly leaves. Friendship plants tolerate medium and low light, love humidity (it grows well in terrariums), and usually don't grow taller than 12 inches. 07 of 15 Some Herbs Adam Albright Indoor herb gardens are an easy way to add fresh flavor to home-cooked meals. But not all herbs are created equal when it comes to pet safety. Standards like lavender and oregano are off-limits, but basil, sage, and thyme are all pet-friendly houseplants. Place herbs in a sunny window that gets at least four or five hours of direct sunlight daily and water when the top inch of soil is dry. 5 Herbs That Home Cooks Should Grow to Save Money 08 of 15 Lace Flower Vine or Chocolate Soldier episcia dianthiflora lace flower hanging basket. Marty Baldwin Pretty lace flower vine is an easy, pet-friendly houseplant that grows best in hanging baskets, well out of reach of your cat or dog. But no harm will be done if an extra-persistent pet makes its way into the pot. Hang this pretty plant in a spot with bright, indirect light and water whenever the soil starts to feel dry, and its trailing stems will grow to about three feet long. Everything You Need to Know About Hanging Plant Hooks 09 of 15 Lipstick Plant Lipstick plant. Dean Schoeppner This quirky plant has blooms that look like lipstick tubes and is safe for cats and dogs alike (other members of the Peperomia family are, too). A native of the tropics, lipstick plant thrives in bright light and loves being outside in the warmer months. It can grow up to 20 inches tall and likes to have consistently moist soil, so don't forget to water! 10 of 15 Parlor Palm Jason Donnelly Pet owners looking to add a small tree indoors may want to pick up a parlor palm. This non-toxic plant for dogs and cats is low-maintenance and a good starting point for beginners. It grows best in bright, indirect light but also tolerates low light. Water when the top inch of soil is dry, and your parlor palm could reach up to eight feet (though four feet is more common). 11 of 15 Moth Orchid Peter Krumhardt The common moth orchid (the one you're most likely to see in the floral shop) isn't harmful to pets. But one thing to watch for: Dogs and cats who love to chew may get into trouble in the potting mix, which is often made of bark chips. The chips aren't toxic but may cause tummy troubles if swallowed. Usually between 1 and 3 feet tall, this pet-friendly houseplant can tolerate low, medium, or bright light and generally needs water once a week or every other week. 12 of 15 Polka Dot Plant polka dot plant hypoestes phyllostachya pink. Jason Donnelly Use polka dot plant to add a splash of pattern and color to miniature gardens, terrariums, mixed containers, and more. You can find this pet-friendly plant in colors like pink or white, and though it can grow up to 3 feet tall, it usually stays on the small side (under 12 inches) in containers. Place it in a spot that gets bright, indirect light, and keep the soil consistently moist. 13 of 15 Prayer Plant or Calathea Denny Schrock Topping out at 6 to 8 inches, the prayer plant is ideal for small spaces like bookshelves and end tables. Its red, cream, and green leaves curl up at night, giving it its name. Moreover, it's one of the easiest houseplants you can grow that's also safe for pets. It grows best in medium or low light; you can let its soil dry out a bit between waterings. 14 of 15 Spider Plant Robert Cardillo This non-toxic plant for dogs and cats is one of the easiest you can grow. Growing more spider plants from the babies the mother plant produces is also simple. Spider plant grows best in bright, indirect light, but it can tolerate low light, too. Let the soil dry between waterings, and your plant can grow up to 12 inches tall and 24 inches wide and produce multiple baby plants. 15 of 15 Some Succulents Kritsada Panichgul Many of the most popular succulents, including hens and chicks and echeverias, aren't problematic, but with so many varieties on the market, it's best to research each plant. Jade, for example, while similar to other succulents, is dangerous to pets. Most succulents stay just a few inches tall when grown indoors. They'll do their best in bright light and only need watering every few weeks. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why! Other Submit "}
