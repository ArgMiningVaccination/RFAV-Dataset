A systematic review, Deborah M Caldwell2 1Centre for Women 's Health Research, University of Liverpool and Liverpool Women 's Hospital, Liverpool, UK 2School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK *Corresponding author Zarko@liverpool.ac.uk Background: More than 150,000 pregnant women in England and Wales have their labour induced each year. Multiple pharmacological, mechanical and complementary methods are available to induce labour. Objective: To assess the relative effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of labour induction methods and, data permitting, effects in different clinical subgroups. Methods: We carried out a systematic review using Cochrane methods. The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group 's Trials Register was searched (March 2014). This contains over 22,000 reports of controlled trials (published from 1923 onwards) retrieved from weekly searches of OVID MEDLINE (1966 to current); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library); EMBASE (1982 to current); Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (1984 to current); ClinicalTrials.gov; the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Portal; and hand-searching of relevant conference proceedings and journals. We included randomised controlled trials examining interventions to induce labour compared with placebo, no treatment or other interventions in women eligible for third-trimester induction. We included outcomes relating to efficacy, safety and acceptability to women. In addition, for the economic analysis we searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Economic Evaluations Databases, NHS Economic Evaluation Database and the Health Technology Assessment database. We carried out a network meta-analysis (NMA) using all of the available evidence, both direct and indirect, to produce estimates of the relative effects of each treatment compared with others in a network. We developed a de novo decision tree model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of various methods. The costs included were the intervention and other hospital costs incurred (price year 2012 -13). We reviewed the literature to identify preference-based utilities for the health-related outcomes in the model. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, expected costs, utilities and net benefit. We represent uncertainty in the optimal intervention using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Results: We identified 1190 studies; 611 were eligible for inclusion. The interventions most likely to achieve vaginal delivery (VD) within 24 hours were intravenous oxytocin with amniotomy \u00b5g) vaginal misoprostol (rank 3; 95% CrI 1 to 6). Compared with placebo, several treatments reduced the odds of caesarean section, but we observed considerable uncertainty in treatment rankings. For uterine hyperstimulation, double-balloon catheter had the highest probability of being among the best three treatments, whereas vaginal misoprostol ( 50 \u00b5g) was most likely to increase the odds of excessive uterine activity. For other safety outcomes there wereDOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Few studies collected information on women 's views. Owing to incomplete reporting of the VD within 24 hours outcome, the cost-effectiveness analysis could compare only 20 interventions. The analysis suggested that most interventions have similar utility and differ mainly in cost. With a caveat of considerable uncertainty, titrated (low-dose) misoprostol solution and buccal/sublingual misoprostol had the highest likelihood of being cost-effective. Limitations: There was considerable uncertainty in findings and there were insufficient data for some planned subgroup analyses. Conclusions: Overall, misoprostol and oxytocin with amniotomy (for women with favourable cervix) is more successful than other agents in achieving VD within 24 hours. The ranking according to safety of different methods was less clear. The cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol solution resulted in the highest utility, whereas buccal/sublingual misoprostol had the lowest cost. There was a high degree of uncertainty as to the most cost-effective intervention. Future work: Future trials should be powered to detect a method that is more cost-effective than misoprostol solution and report outcomes included in this NMA.

Apgar score A scoring system (0 -10) to describe the condition of the newborn. A score >7a t 5 minutes after the birth suggests that the infant is in a good condition. Bishop score A scoring system to measure changes in the cervix (cervical length and dilatation); a Bishop score<6 is often referred to as an unripe cervix (unfavourable), whereas 6 is referred to as a ripe cervix (favourable). Catheter A length of rubberised tubing with an inflatable balloon to anchor the tubing in place. Urinary catheters are used to drain urine from the bladder (a Foley catheter is a type of urinary catheter). A catheter can be passed through the cervical canal and small balloon(s) is (are) inflated with sterile solution to hold the catheter in place. Catheters used for the induction of labour may have a single balloon (e.g. Foley catheter) or specially designed catheters with two balloons can be used. Cluster randomised trial A type of randomised trial in which groups rather than individual participants are randomised to intervention or control. Cochrane Collaboration International not-for-profit organisation preparing, maintaining and promoting the accessibility of systematic reviews of the effects of health-care interventions. Consistency The fundamental assumption underpinning a network meta-analysis. The assumption is also known as transitivity and states that (the benefit of A over B) is equal to (the benefit of A over C) minus (the benefit of B over C). Consistency suggests that the sets of studies used to obtain the indirect comparison are sufficiently similar in characteristics that potentially moderate the intervention effect. Direct comparison A comparison of two or more interventions made within a study. Direct evidence Evidence on the relative effects of interventions derived entirely from direct comparisons. Expectant management Care that involves a period of observation rather than immediate intervention. In the context of planned induction of labour, this would give time to allow for the spontaneous onset of labour. Gestational age The length of the pregnancy from the date of the last menstrual period; gestational age is usually recorded in weeks plus days. Indirect comparison A comparison of two interventions via one or more common comparator.

Multiple pharmacological, non-pharmacological, mechanical and complementary methods are available to induce labour. As the number of women facing induction increases, and as new evidence from trials emerges, it has become urgent to address questions about which methods of inducing labour are most effective, cost-effective, safe and acceptable to women. We carried out a systematic review, network meta-analysis (NMA) and cost-effectiveness analysis to look at all the evidence on different methods for inducing labour. NMA produces estimates for each treatment compared with every other in a network, even though some pairs may not have been directly compared. We included 611 trials in the review. Results suggest that oxytocin with amniotomy and misoprostol are more successful than other methods in achieving vaginal delivery within 24 hours. The safety profile of different methods in terms of risk of caesarean section, instrumental delivery, too-strong uterine contractions, admission to neonatal care unit and Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes was less clear. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol solution had the best outcomes for mothers and babies, whereas buccal/sublingual misoprostol had the lowest cost to the UK NHS. Uncertainty in our findings suggests further research is warranted to find better, safer and cheaper methods. We urge researchers to explore women 's views of the process as part of any future trial, report outcomes completely, and measure the impact from the perspective of the mother and baby.DOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

There are multiple pharmacological, non-pharmacological, mechanical and complementary methods available to induce labour. Different induction methods have advantages and disadvantages; they vary in effectiveness, safety and cost. We carried out a systematic review, network meta-analysis (NMA) and cost-effectiveness analysis to identify the best method for induction of labour. Findings have implications for women, clinicians and the UK NHS. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of a range of induction methods to determine which method (or methods) achieves the best outcomes by providing a quantitative summary of the evidence on the relative effects of different methods; to develop a decision model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the different methods for induction; and if evidence is available, to explore effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in different clinical subgroups [with intact or ruptured membranes, at different gestational ages, in women following a previous caesarean section (CS) and with low ( <6) or higher Bishop scores]. Methods We carried out a systematic review using Cochrane methods. The search was carried out by an information specialist using a predefined strategy. The final search date was March 2014. Two reviewers independently assessed all reports identified by the search for eligibility for inclusion. Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining interventions to induce labour compared with placebo, no treatment or other interventions. Participants were women who were eligible for third-trimester induction of labour. We focused on key outcomes relating to efficacy, safety and acceptability of the method to women: vaginal delivery (VD) not achieved within 24 hours; uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes; CS; serious neonatal morbidity or death; serious maternal morbidity or death; instrumental delivery; maternal satisfaction with the method used; neonatal intensive care unit admission; Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes. We extracted data on the type of intervention and, when appropriate, dose and route of administration. We assessed risk of bias as high, low or unclear, based on the method used to conceal allocation. We noted whether or not the method was used in hospital (inpatient) or outpatient settings. We recorded information on characteristics of participants, including gestational age, parity, previous CS, state of amniotic membranes and Bishop score. For key outcomes we carried out a NMA. The method uses all of the available evidence, both direct and indirect, to produce estimates of the relative effects of each treatment compared with every other in a network, even though some pairs may not have been directly compared. This method allows the relative effects of a range of treatments to be compared for the outcome of interest.DOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

We adapted the NMA to account for multiple outcomes to inform probabilities for all of the outcomes and interventions in the model. This was done using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, so that all correlations and uncertainties were fully reflected in the estimates. The costs included in the economic analysis were the intervention costs, costs of method of delivery, and length of neonatal stay in level I, II or III units. The price year was 2012 -13. We attributed a utility score to each of the outcomes in our model, which represents the strength of preferences for a set of health-related outcomes, where utility scores take values of between 0 and 1, with '1'representing perfect health. We reviewed the literature to identify preference-based utilities for the health-related outcomes in the model. We performed a probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis, conceptualised as a hypothetical cohort of patients who vary in their probabilities, utilities and costs, and who experience the consequences of each induction strategy. Total utilities and costs are then averaged over this cohort to obtain the expected total utility and expected total cost for each induction strategy. We conducted a fully incremental analysis, reporting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, interpreted as the additional expected cost per additional unit gain in utility for an intervention compared with the previous non-dominated intervention, and cost-efficiency frontiers, which plot expected cost against expected utility for each intervention. We report expected costs, expected utilities and expected net benefit (the difference between expected utilities and costs, for which utilities are monetaried by multiplying by the willingness-to-pay per unit increase in utility). We prefer the intervention that maximises expected net benefit. We represent uncertainty in the optimal intervention using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and the cost-effectiveness plane. Results A total of 1508 reports corresponding to 1190 separate studies were identified. Thirty-four active treatment types/regimens were included in our review, including different dose regimes and routes of administration. Overall, the search identified >1000 studies and, after eligibility assessment using our PICO criteria (population, intervention and relevant comparators, outcomes), 579 studies were excluded and 611 trials were included in the review. Together, the included trials reported findings for >100,000 women who were randomised to different methods for third-trimester induction of labour. The active interventions most likely to achieve VD within 24 hours were intravenous (i.v.) oxytocin with amniotomy (mainly tested in trials recruiting women with favourable cervix), higher-dose 50 \u00b5g of vaginal misoprostol and vaginal prostaglandin E 2(PGE 2; a type of prostaglandin used in the induction of labour) pessary (normal release). Titrated (low-dose) oral and sustained-release misoprostol vaginal pessary also performed well; however, there was greater uncertainty around the effect of these interventions for this outcome. Compared with placebo, several treatments showed statistically significant reduction in the odds of CS: titrated low-dose misoprostol, catheter, membrane sweeping and buccal/ sublingual misoprostol. In this group, titrated oral misoprostol achieved the lowest odds of an eventual CS but there was still considerable uncertainty in this finding, as observed by the posterior mean rank order of sixth (out of 33) and 95% credible interval from second to thirteenth (out of 33). There was little to distinguish between the other interventions and, again, we observed considerable uncertainty in treatment rankings. Uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes was one of the key safety outcomes. Here, double-balloon catheter had the highest probability of being among the best three treatments, whereas vaginal misoprostol ( 50 \u00b5g), which was among the best treatments for efficacy, was most likely to increase the odds of excessive uterine activity.SCIENTIFIC SUMMARY NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.ukxxviiiFor other safety outcomes there were insufficient data or there was too much uncertainty around estimates to identify which treatments performed 'best '. Very few studies collected information on women 's views. On the whole, women tended to have positive views, or at least accepted the induction process, but there was insufficient information to determine whether or not some methods were preferred over others. There was considerable uncertainty of our cost-effectiveness estimates, with the majority of the interventions having very similar utility values, and mainly differing in total costs. The cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that all of the methods of induction were cost-saving compared with no treatment, and titrated (low-dose) misoprostol solution and buccal/sublingual misoprostol had the highest probability of being cost-effective, although this was very uncertain. Only two subgroup analyses were possible with the data available, and these were based on a small number of studies and so should be interpreted as hypothesis generating. In the subgroup of women with intact membranes, and limiting to interventions feasible on the NHS, i.v. oxytocin with amniotomy was identified as the intervention most likely to be most cost-effective. In the subgroup of women with an unfavourable cervix, titrated low-dose oral misoprostol solution and buccal/sublingual misoprostol were found to be the interventions that were most likely to be most cost-effective. Conclusions Our NMA suggested that oxytocin with amniotomy and higher-dose ( 50 \u00b5g) vaginal misoprostol were more successful than other agents in achieving VD within 24 hours, although the former was tested in trials predominantly recruiting women with favourable cervix. The safety profile of different methods was less clear. The cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol solution is the intervention with the highest utility for mothers and babies, whereas buccal/sublingual misoprostol has the lowest cost to the NHS. Both of these interventions had the highest chance of being most cost-effective. However, the considerable uncertainty in our findings points the way for further research. When induction of labour is clinically indicated, placebo or no-intervention arms may not be feasible or even ethical. Therefore, rather than restrict RCTs to low-risk women, we suggest that titrated oral misoprostol solution should be used as a comparator, particularly in the NHS setting. Future RCTs should be powered to detect a method that is more cost-effective that misoprostol solution. We urge all triallists to report 11 outcomes included in this NMA in all future RCTs. There is also an urgent need to explore women 's views of the process as part of any future trial, and measure utilities from the perspective of the mother and baby, preferably using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions instrument.

There is evidence that the number of labour inductions has been steadily increasing over the past two decades. NHS England maternity statistics for 2010 noted that 21.3% of births followed induction of labour, and by 2012 -13 this figure had increased to 23.3%.4 Induction of labour is carried out for a number of clinical indications.5,6The most common reasons include post-term pregnancy (defined as 41+0weeks 'gestation), prelabour rupture of the amniotic membranes (PROM) or when the well-being of the woman or baby may be compromised by prolonging the pregnancy (e.g. in cases of fetal growth restriction or pre-eclampsia). There is a broad range of methods available for induction of labour. The choice of method may depend on national guidelines and local protocol, as well as individual clinical factors. The advantages and disadvantages of different methods vary, and the choice of method has implications for women and the UK NHS. From a clinical perspective, the decision about which method to use for induction of labour can be influenced by the woman 's readiness for labour, for example whether or not membranes have ruptured spontaneously or whether or not the cervix remains undilated at the start of the induction process. Different methods used for inducing labour have different mechanisms of action, and vary in terms of how quickly birth is achieved and the likelihood of causing complications in women with different clinical characteristics. Thus, the choice of method will take into account the reason for induction and its urgency. The woman 's obstetric and medical history is also considered. For example, there is evidence that women may be more sensitive to drugs that stimulate the uterus if they have had a previous birth, and women who have a scar from a previous caesarean birth are at increased risk of uterine rupture, which can result in hysterectomy and fetal death.7 Different methods also have different direct costs, and some methods require continuous monitoring of the woman throughout labour. Consequently, the choice of induction method may have significant implications for NHS resources, especially if the method is known to increase the risk of complications requiring a caesarean section (CS). Women may wish to experience a natural onset of labour, and there is evidence that an induced labour can have a negative impact on their overall experience of childbirth.8Some methods of induction are painful or unpleasant, and some are associated with distressing side effects, such as headache or nausea. Women may also have preferences about which method is used and may prefer non-pharmacological approaches. On the other hand, women will want their baby to be born safely, and timely induction may improve outcomes for women and babies.5Women facing decisions about induction of labour require up-to-date information about the range of options available, including alternative and complementary methods.DOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

UK clinical guidelines published in 20089identified vaginal prostaglandin E 2(PGE 2)a s 'the preferred method of induction '. We note that this recommendation was not based on a quantitative overview of the evidence of the effects and safety of all available methods, or from the synthesis and analysis of data from a range of comparisons. Furthermore, this guideline9did not recommend any particular type (gel, tablet or pessary) or dose of PGE 2because trial evidence has rarely compared different PGE 2preparations. Potential updating of the current guidance is awaiting the publication of this report.10 Despite its importance, the question of resource use for the NHS has been relatively under-studied, and uncertainty remains about the costs that are associated with induction of labour. There is evidence that inducing labour in women with complications is associated with lower health-service costs than costs associated with expectant management.11-13However, there is little evidence on the costs associated with specific methods of induction compared with others. Randomised trials in which one method of induction has been compared with another have only rarely included economic analyses.14 A broad range of pharmacological, mechanical, complementary and alternative methods have been used to induce labour. In the remaining sections of this chapter, we describe all of the pharmacological and mechanical methods for third-trimester induction of labour or cervical ripening which have been used in clinical practice and that have been examined in randomised trials. Complementary or alternative methods have been less commonly used in NHS settings but have been used in comparable settings in other countries. Complementary and alternative methods are included here, as information on the effects and safety of such methods may be important for women who prefer a less medicalised birth. Pharmacological methods for the induction of labour Prostaglandins: prostaglandin E 2and prostaglandin F 2alpha Prostaglandins are hormones produced naturally by the body that are important in the onset of labour. Synthetically manufactured prostaglandins have been used in clinical practice since the 1960s to ripen the cervix and induce uterine contractions. They are more frequently used in women when the cervix is unripe (i.e. with a Bishop score <6). Prostaglandins promote cervical ripening and encourage the onset of labour by acting on cervical collagen so as to encourage the cervix to soften and stretch in preparation for childbirth. Prostaglandins may also stimulate uterine contractions. Despite the widespread use of prostaglandins as part of labour induction, they can cause a number of side effects, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and fever. In addition, because of their effect on the uterus, prostaglandins can cause contractions that last too long, or are too frequent or are too strong. Excessive uterine activity, or hyperstimulation, may be associated with fetal distress, and in a small number of cases can lead to uterine rupture, especially in those women who have uterine scarring from surgery or a previous caesarean birth. A large number of prostaglandin preparations have been available for labour induction, including prostaglandin F 2alpha (PGF 2, dinoprost), prostaglandin E 2(PGE 2), prostaglandin E (PGE 1) and misoprostol (a synthetic analogue of PGE 1, which is described separately: see Misoprostol ). In the past, PGF 2was frequently used in clinical practice but, more recently, PGE 2(dinoprostone) has become the most commonly used formulation. Commercially produced PGE 2analogues are expensive and require refrigeration. These factors have limited use in low-resource settings. Prostaglandins are available in a variety of formulations and doses, and may be given via various routes of administration, including vaginally, intracervically, orally and, less frequently, intravenously.INTRODUCTION NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk2Vaginal and intracervical administration Prostaglandin preparations for vaginal and intracervical administration include gels, lactose-based vaginal tablets, suppositories, pessaries or inserts.15,16Dosages of prostaglandins (mainly PGE 2) vary, depending on route and local protocol (frequently 0.5 mg for intracervical use, 2 -3 mg for intravaginal use and 10 mg for sustained-release pessaries). There is also variation in terms of the number of applications and time intervals between repeated doses. Sustained-release vaginal pessaries have been developed to reduce the number of applications and vaginal examinations that are needed during induction of labour. Vaginal and intracervical administration are the most common forms of administration in current practice. In the meta-analysis we have treated different types of vaginal and intracervical PGE 2as different interventions as different preparations may vary in terms of rate of absorption, safety and cost. We have therefore included as separate interventions: lPGE 2vaginal tablets (lactose based). lPGE 2vaginal pessaries normal release (also sometimes referred to as suppositories), manufactured using various base materials, including wax and glycerine. [Note that this intervention includes a heterogeneous group of vaginal PGE 2preparations of varying composition. The base material used was not always clear, and pessaries were frequently produced in local pharmacies (i.e. not commercially available). We included this group of interventions in the network meta-analysis (NMA) and the cost analysis for completeness, even though they are not generally reproducible or available in the UK NHS.] lPGE 2vaginal pessaries release (10- to intracervical administration. Extra-amniotic administration The administration of extra-amniotic prostaglandin gel was first carried out in the early 1970s. The gel is administered via a Foley catheter inserted through the cervix into the extra-amniotic space. The catheter is frequently left in place with the balloon inflated, and light traction may also be applied by taping the catheter to the woman 's leg. Extra-amniotic administration is no longer common in current practice.17 Intravenous administration Intravenous (i.v.) prostaglandins are associated with increased rates of maternal vomiting and diarrhoea and are rarely used in current practice.18 Oral administration Oral PGE 2and PGF 2have been available since the early 1970s. Oral administration is associated with gastrointestinal side effects and is seldom used nowadays.19 Misoprostol Misoprostol is a PGE 1analogue that is known to be effective in stimulating uterine contractions. Misoprostol is inexpensive and requires no special storage facilities. Several routes of administration and regimens of misoprostol have been studied, including oral (swallowed as a tablet or dissolved in a titrated solution), vaginal (inserted into the vagina as a tablet or gel), rectal (inserted into the rectum as a tablet) and buccal or sublingual (the tablet is dissolved in the cheek or under the tongue, respectively).20-22 Different routes of administration have advantages and disadvantages. Oral misoprostol achieves rapid onset of action, whereas vaginal administration is associated with slower absorption but more prolonged action. Over the past decade, slow-release misoprostol vaginal pessaries have also been tested in trials. Although misoprostol is widely used in obstetric practice for other indications (e.g. abortion), there have been concerns about its use due to the increased risk of serious adverse effects, such as uterine rupture. Several small studies have reported excessive uterine activity that is associated with the use of misoprostol, such as uterine tachysystole (more than five contractions per 10 minutes for at least 20 minutes), uterineDOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

A meta-analysis examining the use of vaginal misoprostol suggested that despite excess uterine activity, misoprostol was not associated with adverse fetal outcomes especially at a lower dose ( <25 \u00b5g).23 Oxytocin Oxytocin is a hormone that is produced naturally by the body, and which has a range of functions, including the stimulation of uterine contractions in the second and third stages of labour. Oxytocin analogues, administered intravenously, are the commonest induction agents used worldwide. Oxytocin is frequently administered when the cervix is dilated (or favourable) and may be combined with artificial rupture of the amniotic membranes (amniotomy). Oxytocin may cause excess uterine activity, especially in settings where equipment is not available to titrate doses accurately and monitor contractions. Current i.v. oxytocin regimens usually involve incremental increases in dosage. Lower-dose regimens typically involve 0.5 -2.0 milliunits (mU)/minute starting doses, with incremental increases of 1.0 -2.0 mU/ minute every 15 -60 minutes. Higher-dose regimens have starting doses up to 6.0 mU/minute, with incremental increases of 2.0 -6.0 mU/minute every 15 -40 minutes. There are advantages and disadvantages of high- or low-dose regimens; higher doses may lead to a shorter period to delivery, but may increase the risk of hyperstimulation, whereas lower doses may increase risk of infection if labour is prolonged.24-27 Nitric oxide donors Nitric oxide (NO) is thought to be involved in cervical ripening, and in recent years NO donors [isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN), isosorbide dinitrate, nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside] have been used to promote cervical ripening. NO is administered as a vaginal tablet.28 Mifepristone Mifepristone is a progesterone antagonist that has been used in the past in combination with prostaglandins in first trimester and early second trimester pregnancy terminations. Mifepristone has been proposed as a method to induce labour because it acts to increase uterine contractions. Mifepristone is administered as an oral tablet.29 Oestrogens, corticosteroids, relaxin and hyaluronidase Oestrogens have a role in promoting cervical ripening and, historically, have been administered intravenously or into the extra-amniotic space. There are no commercially available preparations for use in cervical ripening or induction of labour, and the two included trials of this agent date back to 196730and 1981.31 The role of corticosteroids in the process of labour is not well understood, and they are currently not used in clinical practice for the induction of labour.32 Relaxin is a hormone that is thought to encourage cervical ripening, which has been tested in a very small number of trials.33Similarly, hyaluronidase is also thought to be implicated in cervical ripening.34Both agents have been administered in vaginal or intracervical gel, but neither is common in current practice. Mechanical and physical methods for induction of labour Mechanical methods to induce labour have been available for many years. Mechanical devices include various types of catheters and laminaria tents, introduced into or through the cervix and into the extra- amniotic space. The introduction of devices into the cervix may cause the cervix to dilate. Their presence may also increase prostaglandin or oxytocin secretion, which, in turn, may increase cervical dilatation and stimulate uterine contractions.35Here we also include descriptions of membrane sweep and amniotomy since they may be considered a physical method of inducing labour.INTRODUCTION NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk4Catheters Foley urinary catheters have been used for the induction of labour, as have double-balloon and other catheters that are specifically designed for use in induction of labour (e.g. Cook catheter). The catheter is introduced into the extra-amniotic space, and then the balloon(s) is (are) inflated to keep the catheter in place. Traction may be applied by taping the catheter to the woman 's leg. Catheters are usually left in situ until they are expelled. In some cases a saline infusion is introduced into the extra-amniotic space via the catheter. Laminaria tents Laminaria tents are made from sterile seaweed or synthetic materials. These devices are introduced into the cervical canal and expand to gradually stretch the cervix. Membrane sweep Stripping or sweeping of the membranes has been used for many years to induce labour, and continues to be carried out in many clinical settings. Membrane sweeping involves the clinician detaching the membranes from the lower uterine segment by a circular movement of the examining finger. Membrane sweeping is thought to lead to an increased production of prostaglandins. When the cervix is closed, a cervical massage may be carried out instead of a membrane sweep to stimulate the production of prostaglandins.36 Amniotomy During labour the amniotic membranes usually rupture spontaneously as the cervix dilates and stretches in preparation for the descent of the fetus. Amniotomy refers to rupture of the membranes using a plastic hooked instrument or, occasionally, surgical forceps. Amniotomy may be carried out alone or in combination with oxytocin or prostaglandins to induce labour. It can be carried out only if the amniotic membranes are accessible to the midwife or doctor, and this may not happen until the cervix has started to dilate. Amniotomy may cause some potentially serious adverse effects, including cord prolapse. The procedure may introduce infection. For women known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive the procedure is avoided because it may increase the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.25 Breast stimulation Manual breast stimulation has been used in the past to stimulate uterine contractions.37It is thought that it may trigger the release of oxytocin. Sexual intercourse Sexual intercourse at term has been thought to lead to the onset of labour.38The hypothesised mechanism of action here is the prostaglandin contained within semen. Complementary and alternative methods for induction of labour Castor oil Castor oil is derived from the bean of the castor plant, and has been used in oral form as a method of stimulating labour.39Castor oil has laxative properties, stimulating the intestines and bowel. It is this stimulation that is hypothesised to initiate uterine contractions and labour as a secondary effect. Acupuncture Acupuncture involves the insertion of fine needles by trained staff into the skin at specified points on the body. Stimulation of particular acupuncture points is intended to initiate uterine contractions and labour.40DOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Homeopathic preparations are popular and are available over the counter in pharmacies and health food shops. Some homeopathic preparations have been recommended to promote the onset of labour.41 Overall aims and objectives of assessment Given the broad range of methods used to induce labour, the main research question addressed by this review is 'what is the best method for induction of labour? '. The specific objectives were to: 1. assess the effectiveness and safety of a range of induction methods to determine which method or methods achieves the best outcomes 2. provide a quantitative summary of the evidence on the relative effects of a broad range of induction methods to identify which method works best 3. develop a decision model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the different methods for induction 4. explore, if sufficient evidence is available, the effect of different clinical subgroups [with intact or ruptured membranes, at different gestational ages, in women following a previous CS and with low (<6) or higher Bishop scores] on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Specification of the PICO research question Population Pregnant women carrying a viable fetus and who are eligible for any method of third-trimester cervical ripening or labour induction. Intervention and relevant comparators No treatment, placebo, all pharmacological (all routes and doses), mechanical and complementary methods used for the induction of labour. Outcomes Our primary effectiveness outcome was (1) vaginal delivery (VD) not achieved within 24 hours, and our primary measures of safety were (2) uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes and (3) CS. Our secondary outcomes for serious adverse events were (4) serious neonatal morbidity or perinatal death and (5) serious maternal morbidity or death. Other outcomes included were (6) maternal satisfaction with the induction method used, and, for use in the economic model, (7) cost, resource use and utilities. Definition of the decision problem for the economic evaluation Our aim was to answer the following question: what is the most cost-effective method (from the interventions described above), for third-trimester cervical ripening or labour induction? Outputs from the economic evaluation include expected costs, expected benefits, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), expected net benefit and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). Stakeholder involvement in project The steering group (listed in Appendix 1 ) and project team included a consumer representative, a health economist, a midwife and an obstetrician engaged in clinical practice. A consumer representative was included as a collaborator on the project, and she contributed to the early discussions on this project and drafting the application. Induction of labour is known to be of great interest to pregnant women. In particular, women are interested in self-administered ways of initiating labour and for this reason these methods were examined in the proposed work. The consumerINTRODUCTION NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk6representative co-ordinated the involvement of members of the CPCG (Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group) consumer panel, National Childbirth Trust and the Association for Improvements in Maternity Services (AIMS) who expressed an interest in participating. Members of these groups were asked for comments to inform steering group meetings, to determine the final outcomes, to aid in the interpretation of the findings and to shape the papers to be published. The authors of this report include a consumer representative (GG). The steering group commented on the study design, selection of outcomes, methods for the cost-effectiveness analysis and dissemination strategies. Overview of report InChapter 2 we describe the methods used for the assessment of clinical effectiveness, including the methods for the systematic review to identify relevant evidence on clinical effectiveness, and the methods for the NMA. In Chapter 3 we present the results from the systematic review and NMA, including the relative effectiveness of interventions that have been used to induce labour in women at or near term. InChapter 4 we describe methods and present results of the cost-effectiveness analysis, taking a UK NHS perspective. In Chapter 5 we summarise findings, set out the strengths and limitations of our approach, consider the implications of our results on recommended practice, and indicate areas for which future research would be beneficial.DOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

We searched the CPCG 's Specialist Register [which incorporates pregnancy and postpartum searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), relevant journals and conference proceedings]. The search strategy was finalised as part of the early consultative stages of the project, and the final search on which this report is based was carried out at the end of March 2014. The search strategy is set out in Appendix 2 . A full-text copy of every relevant trial report was obtained and assigned to a topic, depending on the intervention before adding to the database. We then screened all reports that were assigned to the induction of labour topic. Many of the trials identified by the search have already been included in published Cochrane reviews, but further searches identified more recent trials which, when eligible, have been included in the analysis. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Interventions All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of induction interventions as identified in Chapter 1 of this report were evaluated. Eligible trials compared any method of third-trimester cervical ripening or labour induction with an alternative intervention, placebo or no treatment. For prespecified treatments we also included trials that compared different means of administration (e.g. vaginal misoprostol vs. oral misoprostol) or We included studies recruiting women with a viable fetus, but had no other restrictions relating to the indication for labour induction, language or date of publication. Trials in which women were randomised to receive a combination of interventions were not eligible, except for a small number of prespecified combinations in common use (e.g. amniotomy with oxytocin). We made the decision to exclude lesser-used combinations as the network was already large, and such combinations are rarely used clinically and mainly reported in single trials. We included all interventions for the induction of labour examined in trials even if such treatments are not used in the NHS. Treatments no longer used may not have been abandoned for evidence-based reasons, and their inclusion adds statistical power to the entire network. We planned to include multiarm trials and cluster randomised trials with any necessary adjustments to account for cluster design effect (if triallists had not already carried out appropriate adjustment). Participants We included trials that recruited pregnant women for third-trimester induction of labour, carrying a viable fetus, with a range of obstetric characteristics, undergoing labour induction for varied reasons. Outcomes In consultation with the patient representative from the CPCG we defined seven key outcomes for the clinical evaluation of induction interventions. The first five outcomes are common to all CPCG reviews on induction of labour and have been set out in a generic protocol.42Outcomes 6 and 7 were proposed by the consumer representative as of importance to women. Outcomes 8 and 9 were not prespecified;DOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Exclusions We excluded trials that did not report anyof our key outcomes or evaluated combined interventions. The full list of references for excluded studies and the reasons for exclusion are documented in Appendices 3 and4,Table 37 . Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment We obtained full-text copies of all reports identified by the search. A minimum of two investigators independently assessed all reports to determine whether or not trials used random allocation to groups, included one or more of the selected interventions and comparisons, recruited women undergoing third-trimester induction of labour, and included data on at least one of our primary outcomes. Trials meeting all of the eligibility criteria were included in the systematic review. Data extraction was carried out by one investigator and checked by a second. Preliminary statistical analyses also highlighted some discrepancies in the extracted data, which were then doubled checked by the reviewers, and corrected if appropriate. For all included trials, we extracted data on trial and patient characteristics, and this is summarised in tables of included studies (see Appendix 5 ,Reference list for included studies , and Appendix 6 ,Table of included studies characteristics ,Table 38 ).11,14,30,31,43-936 Study quality was assessed using the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook.937For use in a prespecified sensitivity analysis, we assigned a judgement relating to risk of bias (low, high, unclear), based on the allocation concealment domain. We based this decision on meta-epidemiological evidence indicating the importance of this domain as a source of bias938and on the design of obstetric trials, which often precludes blinding of participants and personnel (although not, of course, of outcome assessors). Information on study setting (country and whether or not the study was carried out in an inpatient or outpatient setting), method and the type of intervention(s) (dose, mode of administration, type of preparation, e.g. slow-release pessary vs. gel, regimen and any cointerventions) was extracted. We extracted details on comparison arms (e.g. another active treatment, placebo or 'usual care/no treatment '). Treatment arms were categorised according to the initial randomised allocation, although subsequent BOX 1 List of outcomes Prespecified outcomes 1.

For participants, we recorded important obstetric characteristics, including parity, previous CS, state of cervix and whether or not amniotic membranes were intact. These factors were a priori expected to be possible intervention effect modifiers. There was an additional concern that patient characteristics may be linked to the interventions that have been included in the studies. For example, if it were the case that all of the studies comparing NO with placebo predominantly included women with a previous CS, whereas the studies comparing misoprostol with placebo predominantly excluded women with a previous CS, then the indirect comparison of NO with misoprostol may not be a fair reflection of the true underlying effect in either subgroup of women. For NMA to be valid the different study populations are required to be 'similar 'in any effect modifying covariate (see Network meta-analysis for a description of the key assumption of transitivity/consistency in NMA). It is therefore important to inspect tables of patient characteristics according to intervention comparison to assess whether or not there is an a priori reason to suspect that the transitivity/consistency assumption may not hold. In summary, for each trial, information was extracted on: lThe interventions compared in trials (with details of dosage and regimen for pharmacological interventions). lNumber of participants in trials. lParity of women recruited to trials (all nulliparous, all multiparous or mixed parity). lWhether women had ruptured or intact membranes at recruitment (all ruptured, all intact or the sample included women with both intact or ruptured membranes). lWhether or not women had favourable or unfavourable cervical scores at recruitment (Bishop score all <6,6 or included women with either favourable or unfavourable scores). lWhether or not trials included women with multiple pregnancies. lGestational age at recruitment (all post dates, all >37 weeks, or the sample included women at <37 weeks 'gestation). lTreatment setting (women treated as inpatients or outpatients). lRisk of bias (high, low or unclear risk of bias, based on allocation concealment). lWe also recorded whether or not the study had been funded or partly funded by pharmaceutical sponsors. We compared the distribution of these characteristics in tabular form before we conducted the NMA (see Appendix 7 ,Table 39 ). Sensitivity analyses were planned to exclude studies that were assessed as being of unclear or high risk of bias. Methods of evidence synthesis Network meta-analysis A NMA was conducted to simultaneously compare the induction interventions, placebo or no treatment for each outcome. In its simplest form, a NMA is the combination of direct and indirect estimates of relative intervention effect in a single analysis. An indirect estimate of the relative intervention effect B compared with C ( dI BC) can be formed by comparing direct trials of A compared with C with trials of A compared with B, such that dI BC=dD ACdD AB. A simple approach to combining the indirect and direct estimates of B compared with C would be to take a weighted average, for example using an inverse variance weighting.939NMA extends the idea of an indirect comparison to simultaneously combine all evidence in a connected network of intervention comparisons.940For random-effects (REs) models, we assume that the between studies variance is the same across all of the pairs of intervention comparisons (known as the homogeneous variance assumption). In a NMA we assume that intervention A is similar (in dose, administration, etc.) when it appears in the A versus B and A versus C studies, and also that every patient included in the network has an equal probability of being assigned to any of the interventions:940 a concept called 'joint randomisability '.941A first step to assess this assumption is by comparing theDOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

A second step is to use statistical measures of model fit to see if the direct estimate for a particular intervention comparison is discrepant with the NMA estimate944(see below). When direct data were available, pairwise meta-analyses were also performed for all comparisons, and compared with the NMA treatment effect estimates to informally assess agreement. All of the analyses were conducted within a Bayesian framework utilising OpenBUGS version 3.2.3 (www.openbugs.net; Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge), using the NMA code given by Dias et al.945 -948for binomial data. We provide example code in Appendix 8 . A key feature of a Bayesian analysis is that a joint distribution (called the 'posterior 'distribution) of all model parameters (intervention effect estimates and heterogeneity) is estimated, and results are reported as summaries from this posterior distribution. For example, it is common to report the posterior median and 95% credible intervals (CrIs, which are interpreted upon there being a 95% probability that the parameter lies within this range of values, where 95% of the marginal distribution lies). Studies with 0% or 100% events in all arms were excluded from the analysis because these studies provide no evidence on relative effects.946For studies with 0% or 100% events in one arm only, we planned to analyse the data without continuity corrections when computationally possible. Where this was not possible, we used a continuity correction where we added 0.5 to both the number of events and the number of non-events, which has shown to perform well when there is an approximate 1 : 1 randomisation ratio across intervention arms.949InChapter 3 , we report any adjustments made. Both fixed-effects and REs (when sufficient data were available) models were considered on the basis of model fit. Goodness of fit was measured using the posterior mean of the residual deviance, which is a measure of the magnitude of the difference between the observed data and the model predictions for those data.950Smaller values are preferred, and in a well-fitting model the posterior mean residual deviance should be close to the number of data points.950Of course, improvements in model fit can always be achieved by making the model more and more complex, but at the risk of losing generalisability and interpretability. To account for this we report the deviance information criterion (DIC), which penalises model fit with model complexity.950Finally, we report the between-studies standard deviation (SD) (heterogeneity parameter) to assess the degree of statistical heterogeneity. Model selection was based on all of these statistics: posterior mean residual deviance, posterior median between-study heterogeneity, and DIC. In comparing models, differences of 5 points for posterior mean residual deviance and DIC were considered meaningful,950with lower values being favoured. Heterogeneity was reported as the posterior median between trial SD ( ) with its 95% CrI. We planned to conduct sensitivity analyses excluding studies at high risk of bias for allocation concealment, for all analyses. Consistency between the different sources of indirect and direct evidence was explored statistically by comparing the fit of a model assuming consistency with a model that allowed for inconsistency (also known as an unrelated treatment-effect model). If the inconsistency model had the smallest posterior mean residual deviance, heterogeneity, or DIC value then this indicates potential inconsistency in the data. When model fit was suggestive of inconsistency our first step was to restrict trials to those at low risk of bias. If model fit was not improved, we planned further subgroup analyses using the potential treatment effect modifiers identified above (see Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment ). A Bayesian analysis requires prior distributions to be specified on all model parameters that are being estimated. A prior distribution reflects our belief about the values that a parameter can take in advance of observing the data. Vague (flat) prior distributions were specified for treatment effect and heterogeneity parameters, so that our results are driven by the observed data (see Appendix 9 for full details of the prior distributions assumed). Convergence was assessed using the Brooks -Gelman -Rubin diagnostic951and was satisfactory by 68,000 simulations for all outcomes.952A further simulation sample of at least 58,000 iterations post convergence was obtained, on which all reported results were based.METHODS FOR ASSESSMENT OF CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk12Relative intervention effects are reported as posterior median odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CrI. All reported outcomes are negative events and so an OR <1 is interpreted as the active intervention reducing the odds of the event. We calculated the probability of each treatment being first, second, third, etc. most effective for each outcome and report the results using 'rankograms '. Peaks in the rankogram graph indicate the most likely rank for each intervention type. Flat lines indicate a high degree of uncertainty for the ranking of that intervention type. As this metric can be unstable and difficult to interpret (e.g. when there is a high probability of being both 'best 'and 'worst 'on an outcome), we also report posterior mean rank of each treatment (and 95% CrI), with the convention that the lower the rank the better the treatment. We also report the absolute probability of an event for each intervention. To estimate the absolute probability, we selected vaginal PGE 2(tablet) as the baseline intervention and conducted a fixed-effects meta-analysis on vaginal PGE 2arms to produce only an 'average 'intervention effect to which the relative treatment effects (as estimated from the NMA) were added. Note that this is modelled externally to the NMA. We note that this may not generalise to any one setting, as it is based on all of the trials in the NMA, and refer the reader to Chapter 4 ,Assessment of cost-effectiveness for UK-specific absolute estimates. Pairwise meta-analyses For completeness, and to informally assess the consistency assumption of NMA, we conducted pairwise meta-analyses for all intervention comparisons for which direct head-to-head evidence was available. The method of estimation was identical to that described above for the NMA, except that we did not apply the consistency assumption, so that we obtained separate intervention effect estimates for each pairwise comparison. For the REs models, we assumed that the heterogeneity parameter was common across intervention comparisons, to reflect the assumption made in the NMA and allow a fair comparison of the intervention effect estimates.DOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

We identified 1508 reports corresponding to 1190 separate studies. A total of 611 trials that fulfilled our prespecified inclusion criteria were included in the review. Details of the 579 excluded studies (references and reasons for exclusion) are set out in Appendices 3 and4,Table 37 . There were a total of 103,041 women studied in the 611 trials included in this review. Several multiarm trials were identified: one five-arm trial, four four-arm trials and 42 three-arm trials (see Appendix 6 , Table 38 ). The total number of arms in trials relating to different interventions for the induction of labour is set out in Appendix 10 . It is important to bear in mind that trials may not have reported findings for all of the seven presp ecified outcomes. We have indicated, in Table 1 , the number of studies reporting each of our prespecified outcomes. Trials that did not report anyprespecified outcomes were not included in the review, as they did not contribute data to the pairwise analysis or the NMA (see Appendix 4 ,Table 37, for reasons for exclusion from the review). More than 95% of trials reported CS, and data were available for almost 100,000 women for this outcome. However, the proportions of trials reporting our other key outcomes were considerably lower: instrumental delivery was reported in approximately half of trials (49%) and infant Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes was reported in a similar number of studies (47%). Mean Apgar score at 5 minutes was occasionally reported, but there were insufficient studies reporting this outcome for us to be able to use these data. Uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes was reported in 41% of trials. A larger number of trials reported outcomes relating to abnormal uterine activity (tachysystole or hypertonus), but we have included data only for those that were clearly associated with changes in FHR and, therefore, matched our outcome definition for inclusion.

Neonatal death was reported in 21% of trials (with data for 32,248 babies) and a composite outcome of maternal death or serious morbidity in 12.6%. As expected, event rates were very low for both of these outcomes and most trials reported no events for either outcome. Infant admission to NICU was reported for trials that, together, included >50,000 babies, but findings related to this outcome need to be interpreted with some caution. Results demonstrate that there was considerable variation between trials in terms of rates of admission, and it is possible that this variation may relate to definitions of neonatal intensive care and other types of special care units, rather than being a true reflection of variation in serious infant morbidity in different trial settings. There was very rarely clear information on the level of care provided in facilities described as NICU or special care baby unit or on criteria for admission. Only 29 trials reported any outcomes relating to satisfaction, and the way satisfaction outcomes were defined and operationalised in questionnaires meant that we were unable to carry out any quantitative analysis. We have, therefore, set out findings in tabular and narrative form. Although Box 2 sets out the number of trials reporting specific outcomes, we were not able to use all of the reported outcome data in the NMA. Studies that reported no events in either arm were excluded from the NMA. In a small number of cases outcome data were excluded from the analysis for other reasons (see Box 2 ).TABLE 1 Outcome data reported OutcomeNumber of trials reporting this outcome% included trials (613)aNumber of women/infants Number of eventsEvents as % Serious maternal morbidity or deathb77 12 19,112 5 deaths 14 uterine rupture 1 ICU admission0.1 Neonatal death 131 21 32,248 94 0.3 VD not within 24 CS 587 99,821 19.3 Instrumental delivery 302 49 54,511 8020 14.7 NICU admission 226 37 52,931 4224 8.0 Apgar score <7a t 5 minutes289 47 58,367 1244 2.1 Maternal satisfactionc29 5 11,901 NA NA ICU, intensive care unit; NA, not applicable. a Of our trials, 2 out of 611 were split and data were entered separately for all outcomes because they reported data separately for two different clinical subgroups.

Trials varied considerably in terms of inclusion/exclusion criteria. For those trials that reported parity as an inclusion criterion, most (83%) recruited both women expecting their first baby and those who had given birth before. More than two-thirds of trials explicitly excluded women who had experienced a previous CS (64.6%). However, 175 trials did not specifically mention excluding these women but may have reported excluding women at 'high risk ', which may have included women with complications during a previous birth. Women with multiple pregnancies were generally excluded. The majority of trials (73%) that specified inclusion criteria relating to gestational age specifically excluded women at <37 completed weeks 'gestation. Of these 405 trials, 72 recruited women with post-term pregnancies only, usually defined as gestational age of >41 weeks. Other trials included a small number of women with preterm pregnancies, although we specifically excluded trials including women with extremely preterm pregnancies as our focus was on third-trimester induction of labour.Neonatal intensive care unit admission (204 studies included) Removed because no data were reported (387). Removed because of zero cells in both arms (21).

Finally, the induction process was mainly commenced in those women with a Bishop score <6( u n f a v o u r a b l e cervix); 28 trials (4.6%) recruited only women with a favourable cervix, although approximately 20% of tria ls that described membrane status at recruitment included women with a range of Bishop scores. Other trial characteristics The vast majority of trials were carried out in hospital settings and women remained inpatients throughout the induction process. For many pharmacological agents constant maternal and fetal monitoring was considered mandatory, and facilities for CS and newborn specialist care were close by in case of complications. Trials looking at non-pharmacological methods of inducing labour (e.g. membrane sweeping) were more likely to take place in outpatient settings. Trials were assessed for risk of bias relating to the method used to conceal allocation. There was a fairly even balance between those trials assessed as being at low risk of bias and those assessed as being at high or unclear risk of bias (both of these categories were treated as high risk of bias in the sensitivity analysis). There were 300 trials that were judged to be at high risk of bias for allocation concealment compared with 313 trials that were judged to be at low risk of bias. Finally, we also extracted information from trial reports regarding whether or not the trial was funded by a pharmaceutical company. Unfortunately, the source of funding for most trials was not reported. Of the 164 trials that did report source of funding, one-third were funded by a drug company, although this funding may have been partial (provision of study medication and placebo preparations only). Results: network and pairwise meta-analysis The outcome-specific network diagrams are presented in Figure 2 for failure to achieve VD in 24 hours, Figure 3 for CS, Figure 4 for instrumental delivery, Figure 5 for uterine hyperstimulation, Figure 6 for NICU admission and Figure 7 for Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes. Studies were excluded when there were 0% or 100% events in every arm, for that outcome only. Network diagrams are presented within each relevant section and by outcome. The edges (lines) connecting each pair of interventions represent a direct comparison and are drawn proportional to the number of trials making each direct comparison.953However, this weighting is relative within each graph, and edge thickness should not be compared across graphs. For information on the number of trials in each analysis please see Appendix 14 . As noted above (see Results of the systematic review ), there were insufficient data on serious maternal morbidity or death (20 events) to be used in a NMA. Therefore, these data are summarised narratively below (see Neonatal and maternal mortality and severe morbidity ). In addition, only a small proportion of trials reported outcomes relating to women 's perceptions of their care during childbirth and their satisfaction with the induction of labour process. Furthermore, when these outcomes were reported they were defined and measured in different ways across trials. For these reasons we were not able to analyse maternal satisfaction outcomes in a NMA, but we have included a narrative description in the text (see Maternal satisfaction with care and induction of labour method ).DOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Placebo and no intervention comparisons were also included. No trials comparing PGF 2, amniotomy, oestrogens, corticosteroids, relaxin, hyaluronidase, laminaria, membrane sweeping, i.v. prostaglandin, sexual intercourse, acupuncture, breast stimulation, homeopathy, castor oil or oral prostaglandins reported this outcome. No meaningful differences were observed in posterior mean residual deviance or DIC values, suggesting that there was no evidence of inconsistency (see Appendix 11 ,Table 44 ). Reported results are therefore based on the REs NMA model assuming consistency ( Table 3 andFigure 8 ).

We note that there was some indication that the direct and NMA results were inconsistent for NO, as the point estimate from the NMA (OR 0.21) lies outside the CrI from the direct evidence (95% CrI 0.30 to 2.78). However, the CrIs for both the NMA and direct evidence were overlapping. The full results of each intervention compared with every other have been reported in Appendix 12 (see Table 50 ) and compared with the direct evidence when it is available. Figure 8 shows the distribution of the ranks for each of the 20 interventions. The x-axis reports each of the possible ranks, for which position 1 means that the intervention is ranked the highest and position 21 the lowest. Note the number of interventions varies across outcomes because of trial design and reporting. They-axis shows the probability with which each intervention has been ranked at each of the 21 possible positions and therefore fully encapsulates the uncertainty in the intervention rankings. The peaks in the rankogram plots show the most likely rank for a given intervention. Flat lines indicate a high degree of uncertainty for the ranking of that intervention type. The highest ranked intervention was i.v. oxytocin with amniotomy, with a probability of being best of 75%, a posterior mean rank of '2'(95% CrI 1 to 10) and an OR of 0.05 (95% CrI 0.01 to 0.14). Intravenous oxytocin with amniotomy had the lowest absolute probability of not achieving VD within 24 hours at 17% (95% CrI 3% to 44%) ( Table 4 ). The probability of being ranked in the top three interventions was 88% for i.v. oxytocin (posterior mean rank 4 (95% CrI 2 to 7), and 50% for vaginal PGE 2pessary (normal release) (posterior mean rank 4 (95% CrI 1 to 11). The probability of being ranked in the bottom three interventions (i.e. poorest in terms of achieving a vaginal birth within 24 hours) was 80% for mifepristone with a posterior mean rank of 19 (95% CrI 17 to 21). We note from Table 3 that for mifepristone the OR is 0.72 and the 95% CrIs are consistent with both harm and benefit (0.20 to 1.85). Results were largely robust to a preplanned sensitivity analysis excluding studies at high risk of bias for allocation concealment. The posterior mean ranks were altered for two interventions. A posterior mean rank for vaginal PGE 2pessary (normal release) changed from 4 to 10, although the 95% CrIs were still overlapping. Sustained-release misoprostol insert changed from 5 to 10. Again 95% CrIs were consistent between the two analyses. Results for the sensitivity analysis are reported in Appendix 13 (see Table 56 ).0.00.20.40.60.81.0 13579 1 1 1 3(u) 15 17 19 21Probability Rankin gExtra-amniotic PGE2 VD not achieved within 24 hours FIGURE 8 Rankograms for each of the 20 induction interventions for hyperstimulation and VD not achieved within 24 hours.

This included 33 active interventions in addition to placebo and no intervention. Important differences were observed in posterior mean residual deviance and DIC values suggesting that, for the full network, there was evidence of inconsistency (see Appendix 11 ,Table 45 ). The addition of a continuity correction of 0.5 for studies with zero events (on either arm) did not improve model fit. We conducted a prespecified sensitivity analysis examining the effect of removing trials at high risk of bias. The REs model, continuity corrected and excluding trials at high risk of bias, provided an adequate fit to the data (see Appendix 11 ,Table 45 ). Therefore, reported results are based on this model, with 307 trials and 57,370 women (see Tables 5 and6, and Figure 3 ). Thirty-one interventions, in addition to placebo and no intervention are included in the analysis. No trials comparing breast stimulation, homeopathy or castor oil were included in this analysis because of a high risk of bias. Table 5 reports the posterior median ORs (95% CrI) for each intervention relative to placebo (the full results for all comparisons are reported in Appendix 12 ,Table 51 ). As an informal check of consistency, we note that for all interventions, the direct and NMA results are similar.

Conversely, i.v. prostaglandin appears to increase odds of CS, although this does not reach statistical significance. Table 6 reports the posterior mean ranks and absolute probabilities for CS. The interventions with the lowest posterior mean rank (6) were titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol solution and corticosteroids, with the lowest absolute probability of all interventions at 17% and 15%, respectively. However, the wide CrIs around summary estimates suggest considerable uncertainty. The intervention with the worst posterior mean rank is i.v. prostaglandin ranked 33 (95% CrI 32 to 33) and an absolute probability of CS of 66%, albeit with wide CrIs (95% CrI 16% to 98%). Figure 9 reports the rankograms for this outcome. We note that for all of the interventions the rankograms are flat, with relatively low peaks -indicative of considerable uncertainty around the probability any intervention is the 'best '. We do not therefore include an assessment of which probability is best in our summary for CS. 0.00.20.40.60.81.0 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33Probability Rankin gNo treatment Instrumental delivery CS (a) 0.00.20.40.60.81.0 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33Probability Rankin gPlacebo Instrumental delivery CS (b) FIGURE 9 Rankograms for each of the 33 induction interventions for CS and instrumental delivery.

There were no trials remaining that compared corticosteroids, hyaluronidase, breast stimulation or castor oil. Model fit statistics for the model assuming consistency were indicative of a lack of fit, but this was judged to be borderline. The residual deviance indicated a slight improvement in fit for the model assuming inconsistency. This was accompanied by an increase in heterogeneity and a higher DIC. On balance, therefore, a REs NMA model assuming consistency was still preferred (see Appendix 11 ,Table 46 ). Reported results are based on this model, with 299 trials and 32 interventions (see Table 7 andFigure 4 ). Table 7 reports the posterior median ORs (95% CrI) for each intervention relative to placebo (the full results are reported in Appendix 12 ,Table 52 ). As a further check of consistency, we note that for all of the interventions the direct and NMA results are similar. Using placebo as the reference intervention two interventions resulted in significant reduction in instrumental delivery, namely vaginal PGE 2pessary (slow release) and Foley catheter. Table 8 reports the posterior mean ranks and absolute probabilities for instrumental delivery. The intervention with the lowest mean rank (6) was Foley catheter, with a 95% CrI ranging from 2 to 12 (of 30 interventions). This intervention had lowest absolute probability of 13% (95% CrI 5% to 28%) to 29%). However, we note that although the posterior mean rank was '8'for oestrogen and '7'for buccal/sublingual misoprostol, respective 95% (oestrogen: 1 to 28 and buccal misoprostol: 1 to 20). This uncertainty is also reflected in the CrIs around the ORs for these interventions in Table 7 . The intervention with the highest absolute probability of instrumental delivery (i.e. worst) was i.v. prostaglandin at 30% (95% CrI 10% to 58%). Figure 9 reports the rankograms for instrumental delivery. We note that for all of the interventions the rankograms are flat, with relatively low peaks -indicative of considerable uncertainty around the probability any intervention is the 'best '. We do not therefore include an assessment of which probability is best in our summary for instrumental delivery. SeeAppendix 13 (Table 59 ) for the results for the sensitivity analysis, excluding trials at high risk of bias. Removing these trials also removed five interventions from the analysis. Consequently, posterior mean ranks appear to have changed (although 95% CrI are overlapping between the two analyses). Uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes After excluding trials with 0% or 100% events in all arms, 180 trials assessed the outcome of uterine hyperstimulation. The analysis includes 19 interventions, in addition to placebo and no intervention. There were no trials remaining that compared PGF 2, amniotomy, 2, i.v. prostaglandin, sexual intercourse, acupuncture, breast stimulation, homeopathy, castor oil or oral prostaglandins (see Figure 5 ). Model fit statistics were suggestive of inconsistency for this network (see Appendix 11 ,Table 47 ). In the first instance, a continuity correction of 0.5 was added to each cell for those studies with zero events in either arm, allowing the log OR to be estimated. This improved the model fit, and the results presented below are based on the continuity corrected REs NMA model assuming consistency. Table 9 reports the posterior median ORs (95% CrI) for each intervention relative to placebo (the full results for each intervention compared with every other are reported in Appendix 12 ,Table 53 ). We note that for all of the interventions the direct and NMA results are similar. Relative to the size of the intervention effect estimates, high to moderate between-trial heterogeneity was observed for this outcome [=0.54 (95% CrI 0.38 to 0.72)]. Figure 8 reports the rankograms for uterine hyperstimulation. The safest intervention in terms of risk of uterine hyperstimulation was double-balloon or Cook 's catheter, with a 47% probability of being the best and a 91% probability of being in the top three interventions.DOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

The mean rank for double-balloon or Cook 's catheter was '2', with a 95% CrI ranging from 1 to 7 (of 19 interventions). Double-balloon or Cook 's catheter also had the lowest absolute probability of hyperstimulation at 1% (95% CrI 0% to 3%). The probability of being ranked in the bottom three (i.e. intervention with highest risk of uterine hyperstimulation) was 64% for sustained-release misoprostol insert and 59% for vaginal misoprostol ( 50 \u00b5g). The intervention with the worst mean rank was vaginal misoprostol 50 \u00b5g: mean rank 19 (95% CrI 17 to 21). The absolute probability of uterine hyperstimulation for vaginal misoprostol 50 \u00b5g was 9% (95% CrI 2% to 25%). Results were largely robust to the pre-planned sensitivity analysis based on allocation concealment bias. The posterior mean rank for sustained-release misoprostol insert changed from 18 (95% CrI 11 to 21) to 11 (95% CrI 3 to 19).

The full data sets for these outcomes are reported in Appendix 14 (Tables 64 and65). In addition, there is a lack of a universally accepted definition for serious infant or maternal morbidity. Although we planned to include anysuch reported outcome by individual trials, the outcomes were still rarely reported. Only 21.3% of included trials (131/611) reported perinatal deaths with an incidence of 0.3% (94/32,248). A total of 77 out of 611 trials (12.6%) reported a total of 20 maternal deaths or serious morbidity [five deaths, 14 uterine ruptures and one intensive care unit (ICU) admission for infection], that is, an incidence of 0.1%. For completeness, we included the network diagrams for both outcomes ( Figures 10 and11). The network diagram includes those trials reporting at least one event (42 of the included trials reported at least one perinatal death and 16 trials reported at least one case of maternal death or severe morbidity).TABLE 10 Absolute probability of uterine hyperstimulation across all 19 interventions and placebo/no intervention included in the NMA.

There were no trials remaining that compared corticosteroids, relaxin, hyaluronidase, i.v. prostaglandin, breast stimulation, homeopathy or castor oil. Model fit statistics indicated evidence of inconsistency for this network, with the inconsistency model resulting in a considerable decrease in between-trial heterogeneity (see Appendix 11 ,Table 49 ). Comparing the NMA estimates with those from the pairwise analysis identified 23 intervention comparisons for which the NMA and direct evidence were in disagreement. A further investigation of this apparent inconsistency was conducted using a 'node-splitting 'approach.942Node splitting separates evidence on a particular comparison (node) into direct and indirect to identify how the indirect evidence was combining with, or adding to, the direct evidence to form the NMA estimates. Using this approach, 3 out of 23 comparisons were highlighted as having significant differences in the contribution of the direct and indirect evidence to the NMA estimate. The three comparisons were vaginal misoprostol ( 50 \u00b5g) against NO, vaginal PGE 2pessary (slow release) against titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol solution, and no treatment against oral misoprostol tablet ( 50 \u00b5g). The first two of these were identified as being a consequence of zero cells in the direct evidence estimating a very extreme treatment effect. However, the remaining comparison between no treatment and oral misoprostol tablet ( 50 \u00b5g) had statistically significant differences in the direct and indirect evidence (Bayesian p-value=2.98401E-05), even when trials with zero cells were removed. Within the no treatment against oral misoprostol tablet ( 50 \u00b5g) comparison, one trial in particular, Rath and Manus,701was identified as deviant from the rest of the evidence and was therefore re-examined. The criteria for admission to the NICU in this study were unclear, and the description of the facility was given simply as 'nursery '. A post hoc decision to remove this trial for this outcome was taken and a further analysis was subsequently carried out. The REs model, excluding the Rath and Manus trial701and assuming consistency, was a good fit to the data, and the results presented here are therefore from this analysis. Table 11 reports the posterior median ORs (95% CrI) for each intervention relative to placebo (full results are reported in Appendix 12 ,Table 55 ). Relative to the size of the intervention effect estimates, moderate between-trial heterogeneity was observed for this outcome [ =0.17 (95% CrI 0.04 to 0.30)]. Using placebo as the reference only, extra-amniotic PGE 2resulted in significant reduction in NICU admission. Table 12 reports the posterior mean ranks for NICU admission. Extra-amniotic PGE 2had the best mean rank of all interventions (4), with a 95% CrI ranging from 1 to 15. This intervention also had the lowest absolute probability of NICU admission at 4% (95% CrI 0.6% to 12%) and a 59% chance of being in the top three interventions. Figure 12 reports the rankograms for NICU admission. For all interventions the rankograms are flat and indicative of considerable uncertainty around the probability any intervention is the 'best '. We do not therefore include an assessment of which probability is 'best 'in our summary for this outcome as it would be misleading. All results were robust to the preplanned sensitivity analysis excluding studies at high risk of bias for allocation concealment and are reported in Appendix 13, Table 58 . Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes After the exclusion of trials with 0% or 100% events in all arms, 200 trials of 28 interventions assessed the outcome of Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes (see Figure 7 ). There were no trials remaining that compared PGF 2gel, oestrogens, corticosteroids, relaxin, hyaluronidase, breast stimulation, homeopathy or castor oil. Residual deviance statistics, for the model assuming consistency, suggested a lack of fit, with the model assuming inconsistency also having slightly lower heterogeneity. Further investigation indicated that this was due to the number of zero events in trial arms rather than heterogeneity in study design. The REs NMA model assuming consistency was therefore the preferred model and reported results are based on this.DOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

( continued )RESULTS FOR ASSESSMENT OF CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk56Table 13 reports posterior mean ORs (95% CrI) for each intervention relative to placebo (full results are reported in Appendix 12 ,Table 54 ). Relative to the size of the intervention effect estimates, moderate to small between-trial heterogeneity was observed for this outcome [ =0.19 (95% CrI 0.01 to 0.46)]. Using placebo as the reference intervention, only two interventions resulted in significant reduction in Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes: NO and buccal/sublingual misoprostol. Table 14 reports the absolute probabilities and posterior mean ranks for each intervention. The safest intervention in terms of risk of Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes was double-balloon or Cook 's catheter, with a mean rank of '4'; however, the 95% CrI ranged from '1'to'22'out of 28 interventions, reflecting the considerable uncertainty in this estimate. Double-balloon or Cook 's catheter also had the lowest absolute probability of an event at 1.1% (CrI 0.02% to 6.5%). Buccal/sublingual misoprostol had a posterior mean rank of '5'(95% CrI 1 to 15) and an absolute probability of Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes of 1.4% (95% CrI 0.2% to 5%). Table 14 also reports that three further interventions had a posterior mean rank of '7': titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol solution, NO and oral prostaglandins. However, the uncertainty around these rankings is considerable. Low ranking interventions include i.v. oxytocin with amniotomy, misoprostol vaginal pessary (sustained release) and membrane sweeping. Note that the ORs relative to placebo did not achieve statistical significance for any of these interventions (see Table 13 ). Figure 12 reports the rankograms for Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes. For all of the interventions the rankograms are flat and indicative of considerable uncertainty around the probability that any intervention is the 'best '. Therefore, we did not include an assessment of probability for being the 'best 'in our summary for this outcome.1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 Rankin gBuccal/sublingual misoprostol 0.00.20.40.60.81.0Probability(ac) Apgar score < 7 at 5 minutes NICU admission FIGURE 12 Rankograms for each of the 29 induction interventions for Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes and NICU admission.

In Table 15 we set out findings from these trials. We were unable to pool any results from trials in either pairwise or NMA. The trials focused on a broad range of interventions (10/29 examined oxytocin) and comparators. Furthermore, outcome definitions varied considerably. For mechanical methods, the questions related to discomfort during the initial procedure (e.g. insertion of catheter or membrane sweeping). For other methods there were more global assessments of the process. There were no preferred methods and, in general, women were satisfied with (or at least accepted) the induction process. Complementary methods Unfortunately, it was not possible to assess the efficacy (VD within 24 hours) of trials of complementary interventions or membrane sweeping. Relative to placebo, membrane sweeping performed marginally better than acupuncture or sexual intercourse, with an OR of 0.74 (95% CrI 0.53 to 0.99) for CS and an absolute probability of CS of 20% (95% CrI 3% to 54%) compared with 21% for both sexual intercourse (95% CrI 3% to 58%) and acupuncture (95% CrI 3% to 57%). For instrumental delivery, membrane sweeping was consistent, with both an increased and decreased odds of assisted birth, and was ranked '26'(95% CrI 16 to 31) out of 32 interventions. For both 'NICU admission 'and 'Apgar score <7a t 5 minutes 'outcomes, membrane sweeping was associated with a low absolute probability of either event. Subgroup analyses We planned to conduct subgroup analyses to explore the effect of different clinical subgroups on effectiveness data. Here we present subgroup analyses for three outcomes: (1) failure to achieve VD within 24 hours of induction; (2) CS; and (3) Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes. The prespecified confounders were (1) women with intact or ruptured membranes; (2) different gestational ages; (3) women with or without a previous CS; and (4) women with low ( <6) or higher ( 6) Bishop scores. Table 16 reports the breakdown of trials for each of these possible subgroups. Subgroup analysis for intact membranes compared with ruptured membranes When the analysis was limited to only those trials in which all women had intact membranes, 56 trials of 15 treatments formed a connected network for the outcome of no VD within 24 hours (see Appendix 15 ). When restricted to those trials that included only women with ruptured membranes , a connected network of 17 trials of 12 treatments was possible. Note that studies including women with both intact or ruptured membranes, which did not report results for each subgroup separately, are not included here. Reported results are based on the REs NMA model, assuming consistency (see Appendix 15 ). All active interventions are compared with vaginal PGE 2gel, as placebo is no longer available in the restricted networks.RESULTS FOR ASSESSMENT OF CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk60TABLE 15 Maternal satisfaction with the method of induction Study ID Intervention Comparison Satisfaction outcomes Results acceptance ofMisoprostol with of minimaldiscomfort at insertion, in contrast to 35%acceptance, moderate discomfort and resentmentof'something between thighs 'in the Foley catheters group ( p<0.05)Study in Nigeria, 2003.

For the subgroup including only women with intact membranes , i.v. oxytocin with amniotomy ranked 'best 'for achieving VD within 24 hours. Amniotomy is clearly not a feasible option for women with ruptured membranes, and this is reflected in the subgroup analysis for ruptured membranes , in which it does not feature in any of the trials. For this subgroup the CrIs are extremely wide, reflecting extreme uncertainty in which treatment is best for women with ruptured membranes. Outcome: caesarean section A total of 160 trials of 31 treatments were available for analysis when restricted to trials in which all women had intact membranes. The subgroup for trials that included only women with ruptured membranes formed a connected network of 47 trials of 17 treatments (see Appendix 15 ). As before, studies reporting pooled data for women with both intact or ruptured membranes, or those who did not report details for this characteristic, are not included here. Reported results are therefore based on the REs NMA model, assuming consistency (see Appendix 15 ). For the subgroup of women with intact membranes we note that the posterior mean rank for titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol solution has changed from '6'to'14', albeit with considerable uncertainty in the relative ranking (95% CrI 3 to 28) ( Table 18 ). Similarly, the mean rank for PGF 2gel has decreased from 11 to 21, with very wide CrIs (95% CrI 3 to 30), showing that there is considerable uncertainty in the relative rankings. The mean rank for extra-amniotic PGE 2has improved from '22'to'4', although, again, the CrIs indicate considerable uncertainty, which should be taken into consideration in any conclusions (95% CrI 1 to 26).TABLE 16 Subgroups by outcome Trials includedVD not achieved CS Apgar 141 studies, 21 treatments307 studies, 33 treatments200 studies, 28 treatments All women with a previous CS 0 studies Not connected 0 studies No women with a previous CS 115 studies 215 studies 153 studies All women with intact membranes 58 studies 161 studies 98 studies 19 treatments 29 treatments 28 treatments All women with ruptured membranes 17 studies 49 studies 37 studies 12 treatments 17 treatments 18 treatments All women with Bishop scores of 6 5 studies 13 studies 6 studies 5 treatments 8 treatments 7 treatments All women with Bishop scores of <6 106 studies 202 studies 128 studies 19 treatments 18 treatments 25 treatments Apgar, Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes.

An OR of <1 favours the active intervention (i.e. fewer undesirable events occurred on the active intervention).RESULTS FOR ASSESSMENT OF CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk70When limiting the network to trials that included only women with ruptured membranes, we observe that vaginal misoprostol (both doses), titrated misoprostol solution have the highest rankings, with 95% CrI including the best ranking. As with other subgroup analyses the CrIs are very wide, making clinical interpretation quite difficult. Outcome: Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes For the outcome of Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes, the subgroup in which all women had intact membranes was a connected network of 98 trials of 26 treatments. When the analysis was limited to only those trials in which all women had ruptured membranes, 37 trials of 16 treatments assessed the outcome of Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes (see Appendix 15 ). However, we observed meaningful differences in the posterior mean residual deviance, suggesting that there was evidence of unresolved inconsistency (see Appendix 15 ). As such we do not report the findings for these subgroups. Subgroup analysis for women with low Bishop score ( <6) or higher Bishop score ( 6) Outcome: vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours For the outcome of no VD within 24 hours when the analysis was limited to only those trials in which all women had a Bishop score <6, 106 trials of 17 treatments assessed the outcome of no VD within 24 hours. However, we observed meaningful differences in the posterior mean residual deviance, the DIC values and the SDs, suggesting that there is evidence of inconsistency. Consequently, we do not report results for this subgroup here. No meaningful analysis could be carried out on women with a Bishop score 6, as the network only included five studies comparing seven treatments and was not connected (see Appendix 15 ). Outcome: caesarean section For the CS outcome, restricting to trials in which all women had a Bishop score <6 allowed a connected network of 203 trials comparing 28 treatments. When the analysis was limited to only those trials that included women with a Bishop score 6, a connected network of 10 trials of 10 treatments assessed the outcome of CS (see Appendix 15 ). Full results are shown in Table 19 . Results are largely robust to the analysis, only including studies with women with a Bishop score <6. A posterior mean rank for extra- amniotic PGE 2changed from '22'to'4'and this treatment became significantly better than placebo for preventing a CS. Similarly, acupuncture changed from having a mean rank of '16'to'3'and became significantly better than placebo. Outcome: Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes For the outcome of Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes, restricting the analysis to only those trials in which all women had Bishop scores of <6 produced a connected network of 128 trials comparing 24 treatments. However, because of the number of zero events, the NMA model would not converge and therefore we cannot report results. Similarly, we do not report results for women with a Bishop score 6 due to zero events, as the network included only six studies and seven treatments. Formal subgroup analysis either was not possible or did not show clear subgroup differences in terms of cervical status. It is noteworthy that far fewer trials tested i.v. oxytocin with amniotomy in women with unfavourable cervix than other interventions, such as PGE 2, misoprostol and mechanical methods (see Table 19 ). This is hardly surprising, given that amniotomy is very difficult or even impossible in women with very unfavourable cervix. Overall, women with favourable cervix are more likely to achieve VD within 24 hours, but this should not produce biased results in our NMA as this would apply to both the experimental group (e.g. oxytocin with amniotomy) and the control group (e.g. any prostaglandin) as well (i.e. the relative effect between two treatments is not affected). Nevertheless, as oxytocin with amniotomy has been predominantly tested in women with favourable cervix, our recommendations relating to this intervention are restricted to this subgroup.DOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

For women with a previous CS there were no trials remaining which would allow an analysis based on failure to achieve VD within 24 hours, or Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes ( Table 20 ). There were only four trials remaining for the outcome of CS; however, the network was not connected and so an analysis was not possible. Summary We presented the impact of 31 interventions (excluding no treatment and placebo) on failure to achieve VD within 24 hours, CS, instrumental delivery, uterine hyperstimulation, Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes and NICU admission. For a total of 17 methods (11 prostaglandins, two mechanical methods, oxytocin with or without amniotomy, NO and mifepristone) we were able to produce rankings for all six outcomes (Table 21 ). The data were incomplete for other methods and other key safety outcomes, namely neonatal mortality/morbidity, maternal mortality/morbidity and maternal satisfaction, which we have described narratively. Table 21 is intended to provide a broad summary of findings across outcomes; however, it does notreport CrIs. Therefore, it is important that this table is interpreted in the context of relevant tables for each outcome, which set out the uncertainty around rankings.TABLE 19 Trials recruiting women with unfavourable and favourable cervix for selected interventions InterventionsNumber of trials reporting cervical statusNumber of trials recruiting women with different cervical statusPercentage of trials including only women unfavourable cervix Oxytocin with amniotomy 22 1 unfavourable 11 mixed 10 favourable not reported4.5 Vaginal and intracervical PGE2 284 Misoprostol 168 unfavourable 33 mixed 8 favourable 37 not reported80 Mechanical methods 69 66 unfavourable 2 mixed 1 favourable 3 not reported96RESULTS FOR ASSESSMENT OF CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk72TABLE 20 Odds ratios and 95% CrI for CS.

Our analysis shows that i.v. oxytocin combined with amniotomy has the best chance of achieving VD within 24 hours of induction, but this intervention is restricted to women with intact membranes. Misoprostol (vaginal route, titrated oral solution, buccal/sublingual) and vaginal PGE 2normal-release pessaries also performed well. Compared with placebo, corticosteroids and titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol achieved the lowest odds of an eventual CS; however, there was considerable uncertainty in these findings. For instrumental delivery, Foley catheter performed well taking into account the OR, posterior mean ranks and absolute probabilities. However, we again note the uncertainty which surrounds these estimates and the moderate degree of observed heterogeneity. The safest intervention in terms of risk for uterine hyperstimulation was double-balloon or Cook 's catheter. The intervention with the worst mean rank was vaginal misoprostol 50 \u00b5g, with a 9% absolute probability of uterine hyperstimulation. Neonatal intensive care unit admission and an Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes were used as proxies for neonatal safety outcomes in the absence of consistent definitions of neonatal mortality and morbidity across the trials. The safest intervention in terms of risk of Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes was double-balloon or Cook 's catheter, with a mean rank of '4'; however, the 95% CrI ranged from 1 to 22 out of 26 interventions, reflecting the considerable uncertainty in this estimate. Unfortunately, it was not possible to assess the efficacy (VD within 24 hours) of trials of complementary interventions or membrane sweeping. Relative to placebo, membrane sweeping performed marginally better than acupuncture or sexual intercourse for CS. For both NICU admission and Apgar score <7a t 5 minutes outcomes, membrane sweeping was associated with a low absolute probability of either event. In broad terms, our subgroup analyses, when available, were consistent with overall results.RESULTS FOR ASSESSMENT OF CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk76Chapter 4 Assessment of cost-effectiveness Introduction In this chapter we compare the cost-effectiveness of different methods of induction of labour. We begin by setting out our decision question. We then describe previous studies that have addressed this question; however, we found that none of these provided a model that we could apply to compare the cost-effectiveness of the different methods of induction identified in our review. We then describe our de novo decision model, which we developed to answer our decision question, followed by a description of the evidence sources that were used to provide inputs to the model effectiveness, treatment costs, other resource-use (hospital) costs and utilities. We used the results of the NMA presented in Chapter 3 when possible. Because modes of delivery are not independent (a woman must deliver one of three ways: CS, VD within 24 hours or VD after 24 hours of induction), we need to estimate these outcomes jointly. In order to include as many studies as possible in our analysis, we condition on CS. This means we use the NMA for the CS outcome as presented in Chapter 3 , but conduct a new NMA for the 'failure to achieve vaginal delivery within 24 hours 'outcome, conditional on not having had a CS, using the subset of studies which reported both outcomes. We then present results and end with a discussion. Decision question Population The population of interest was defined in accordance with the inclusion criteria for the systematic review and NMA (i.e. pregnant women carrying a viable fetus and who are eligible for any method of third trimester labour induction). Interventions We included all of the interventions that were identified in the systematic review (see Chapter 3 ) for which we had sufficient information to evaluate the model. This meant that 19 interventions out of a total of 34 (Box 3 ) were included in the cost-effectiveness analysis, and the remaining prostaglandin, sexual intercourse, acupuncture, breast stimulation, homeopathy, castor oil and oral prostaglandins). Note that this does not mean that the excluded interventions were not cost-effective - simply that we did not have enough information to assess their cost-effectiveness. The included interventions were a variety of pharmacological and mechanical interventions. A further issue arose with the vaginal PGE 2pessary (normal release) intervention which, as described in Chapter 3 , was a heterogeneous mix of interventions in which PGE 2was administered vaginally using a range of 'pessaries ' (frequently produced in trial hospital pharmacies) that are either not readily reproducible or not currently available to the NHS. It is important that this group is distinguished from PGE 2slow-release pessaries that are used in current NHS practice. We included placebo in the results but interpret this as 'no intervention ', as it would be delivered on the NHS. Outcomes Obstetrics is different from most other medical specialties in that decision problems involve the health of two patients (mother and child) and an intervention or treatment can affect the health of both. Often, an intervention that is beneficial to the mother can carry a higher risk for the child and vice versa. The birth of a child also has a major impact on the new mother, and the health of the child in the time immediately following birth can have a significant impact on the mother 's own health. Our model includes both maternal and neonatal outcomes, and we attempted to capture the costs and utilities of both mother andDOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

We report expected total costs (treatment costs plus other resource costs), expected utility (for mother and baby combined) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), which measure the additional expected cost per 1 unit of additional utility for one intervention compared with another. We conducted a fully incremental analysis. We report a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, which reflects uncertainty in model inputs. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis is summarised with expected total costs, expected total benefits, ICER, an incremental cost-effectiveness plane and a cost- effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC), which plots the probability of each intervention being the most cost-effective, based on expected net benefit for a given willingness-to-pay per unit increase in utility. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) methods of technology appraisal guide954 suggests that the time horizon of the model applied should be long enough to capture all relevant costs and benefit differences between the interventions. We acknowledge that there are some potential long-term adverse events that are associated with the process of labour and that some outcomes, such as CS and serious birth canal injuries, can have a life-long impact on health-related quality of life (e.g. urinary incontinence) and costs. However, we assumed that most cost differences that are related to methods of induction are likely to be realised during and immediately after the birth. The evidence sources that were used to inform utilities did not explicitly state a time frame; however, they are unlikely to reflect many consequences that occur post discharge. The time frame of the analysis was, therefore, taken to be from induction to hospital discharge. We acknowledge that this is a limitation that ignores cost and utility consequences in the longer term. Discounting was deemed unnecessary because of this short time frame. We take a UK NHS perspective.BOX 3 List of interventions included in base-case cost-effectiveness analysis 1. Vaginal PGE 2tablet. 2. Vaginal Vaginal PGE 4.

Placebo.ASSESSMENT OF COST-EFFECTIVENESS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk78Previous economic evaluations We performed a review of the literature (details in Appendix 17 ) to identify previous studies that have attempted to address our decision question. We identified two RCTs14,955in which an economic evaluation was also conducted. In both of these trials,14,955only two methods of induction were compared using costs and efficacy data that were collected alongside the trials; however, neither of them attempted to quantify quality of life. Petrou et al.14compared PGE 2gel to PGE 2tablets in a cost-effectiveness analysis with the main outcome measure being incremental cost per hour prevented between induction and delivery. Van Baaren et al.955assessed the economic consequences of labour induction with Foley catheter compared with PGE 2gel, in an economic evaluation conducted alongside the PROBAAT (prostaglandin or balloon catheter for induction of labour at term) RCT. This study calculated the cost to prevent one CS, or maternal/neonatal morbidity. The latest clinical guideline on induction of labour produced by NICE in 2008 included a cost-effectiveness analysis of the timing of the first offer of induction of labour.9This analysis used a state-transition (Markov) model to simulate the cost-effectiveness of the different timing strategies, with benefits measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The primary source of clinical data was the systematic review undertaken as part of the guideline. The QALY estimation took into account only the health of the infant and not the health of the mother, as no studies could be identified in the literature that estimated the utility gain or loss to women as a result of induction. The assumption made was that a baby who survived with a serious morbidity gained only 0.75 QALYs for each 1 QALY gained by a healthy baby. Despite the large number of RCTs that were identified in our systematic review (see Chapter 3 ), there has been no attempt to examine all induction methods together within an economic model. We have, therefore, developed a de novo model (described below) to estimate the cost-effectiveness of various methods for the induction of labour using the data obtained from the systematic review and NMA of RCTs, along with hospital costs and utilities. Health-economic model A decision-analytic model956was constructed to compare the costs and effects of the different methods of induction of labour. Because we consider only short-term consequences, we chose to use a decision tree to represent the costs and consequences of different methods of induction. A decision tree is a graphical representation of different possible outcomes following a decision, in which probabilities are given to different paths along the branches of the tree, and costs and utilities attached to each branch. This enables us to compute probability-weighted costs and outcomes to arrive at an expected cost and utility value for each alternative treatment option. The outcomes included were rate of VD within 24 hours, CS rate and frequency of admission to the NICU, as well as resource use and utilities. This structure was informed by the literature and expert opinion, and was finalised through discussions with the steering group. An illustration of the model structure is provided inFigure 13 . Squares represent decision nodes for the method of delivery chosen, whereas circles represent chance nodes at which different possible outcomes are assigned a probability, and triangles represent outcomes. The model starts by dividing the population into those who deliver vaginally within the first 24 hours; have an emergency CS; and deliver vaginally after 24 hours. Under each model of delivery, babies can either be born with no complications or be admitted to the NICU, which, in the context of randomised trials, we assumed relates to intervention and/or mode of delivery (CS or VD), but is less likely to relate to length of labour (i.e. whether a VD was within 24 hours of induction or not). NICU admission is divided into transitional care for those babies who need some medical treatmentDOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Utility scores and resource use were thought to vary depending on these levels of care. Inputs to economic model Effectiveness inputs We required absolute probabilities for each of the paths in the branches of the tree shown in Figure 13 , for each intervention. The NMA presented in Chapter 3 provided information on relative effects on these probabilities (in the form of ORs). In order to obtain absolute probabilities on all interventions we needed to apply these relative effects to absolute probabilities on a reference intervention. The choice of reference intervention is not important; however, it needs to be an intervention for which there is evidence available on absolute probabilities for all paths in our decision tree, and that evidence is relevant to the decision population under consideration. We chose vaginal PGE 2(tablet) as the reference intervention, as there were several UK-based RCTs including this intervention for each of the probabilities that were required in the model.Induction of labourCS VD24 Vaginal delivery after 24 Transitional care Intensive careHigh-dependency care Transitional care Intensive careHigh-dependency care FIGURE 13 Decision tree for comparison of different methods of induction.ASSESSMENT OF COST-EFFECTIVENESS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk80The NMA presented in Chapter 3 analyses each of the outcomes independently. However, as can be seen from Figure 13 , these outcomes are not independent. For example, a failure to achieve a VD in 24 hours includes both women who deliver by CS and those who deliver vaginally but not within 24 hours. A woman has to deliver in one of three ways: a VD within 24 hours (VD24), a CS or a VD after 24 hours (VD >24). We therefore re-analysed the data, as described in Appendix 16 , to estimate these three probabilities allowing for the dependence in the data. We assumed that the relative effects for NICU admission are independent of timing of delivery but dependent on mode of delivery. We also assumed that the probability of NICU admission is 1.5 times higher for a CS delivery (according to data on 2837 inductions of labour for live births in Liverpool Women 's NHS Foundation Trust in 2014). Under this assumption it can be verified that the probability of NICU admission for VD, p(NICUvd), and the probability of NICU admission for CS, p(NICUcs), can be obtained from the overall probability of NICU admission, p(NICU) using of CS births, p(CS), is based on the NMA presented in Chapter 3 being applied to the proportion estimated on the reference intervention, as described below and in Appendix 16 . The relative effects for NICU admission from the NMA in Chapter 3 are applied to the probability of NICU admission on the reference intervention ( Table 22 ) to obtain the absolute probability of NICU admission, p(NICU) for each intervention. The formulae above are then used to obtain p(NICUvd) and p(NICUcs). Note that all of these quantities are estimated using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, which samples directly from the joint posterior distribution. The decision tree is evaluated for each of these simulated samples so that we have a simulation of utility and cost estimates for each intervention. These simulations ensure that the uncertainty in the model inputs are fully reflected in the estimation of costs and utilities. There were five UK studies315,549,834,957in our review that provided information on the probability of a CS on the reference intervention. There was one UK study in our review that provided information on the probability of VD within 24 hours, given no CS, on the reference intervention. There were two UK studies834providing information on the probability of NICU admission on the reference intervention. These studies were chosen as they were the only UK-based studies that evaluated the reference treatment and were therefore thought to be most representative of the target population. Where there was more than one study, the reference intervention arms were pooled using single-arm meta-analysis (results shown in Table 22 ). A REs model was used for both the probability of CS and the probability of NICU admission as a result of the heterogeneity between the included studies. This is reflected in the wide CrIs for these probabilities (see Table 22 ).

Applications for commercial reproduction should be addressed to: NIHR Journals Library, National Institute for Health Research, Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre, Alpha House, University of Southampton Science Park, Southampton SO16 7NS, UK.81We applied the ORs from the NMAs (see Chapter 3 andAppendix 16 ) to the absolute probabilities for the reference intervention (see Table 22 ), to obtain absolute probabilities for all interventions. Note that this was done within the Bayesian MCMC simulation, which samples from the joint posterior distribution so that all correlations and uncertainties are fully reflected in the estimates. The resulting estimates are given inTables 23 -26. Note that these results differ from those presented in Chapter 3 . First, we are using a different reference intervention on which to apply relative effects. Second, because we are modelling the mode of delivery jointly (so probabilities sum to 1), the number of studies from which the VD within 24 hours is estimated is reduced (as we require studies to report all delivery outcomes fully). One point to note is that the estimate of the probability of a VD after 24 hours with i.v. oxytocin plus amniotomy is '0', based on a single small study (25 women in this arm) with no women delivering vaginally after 24 hours. Cost inputs The perspective adopted for the economic evaluation was that of the service provider (UK NHS). In accordance with this perspective, the costs included in the economic analysis were the direct costs incurred as a result of the interventions. These included the intervention costs, costs of method of delivery and length of neonatal stay in level I, II or III units. The price year was 2012 -13.

These are calculated on a full absorption basis to identify the full cost of delivering the service. It was assumed that a VD within 24 hours would constitute a short stay under the costing code, whereas a VD after 24 hours would be coded as long stay and therefore incur higher costs. The cost of a long-stay emergency CS was also used as most emergency CSs result in a stay of >24 hours.

All hospitalised infants incur per-patient/day costs. The unit cost for an inpatient day is also given in Table 27 . Probability of admission to each level of neonatal care, and average length of stay in each level, was taken from data on term admissions at Liverpool Women 's NHS Foundation Trust. The data from 100 at-term NICU admissions between July and October 2014 showed that 19% of admissions were to intensive care, 7% were to high-dependency care and 74% were to transitional care. Median length of stay was 2 days for intensive care, 1.5 days for high-dependency care and 2 days for transitional care. The other costs included in the analysis were the costs that were associated with the different methods of induction. These were taken from the British National Formulary (BNF)959for the pharmacological interventions and from the published literature or manufacturer costs for the mechanical interventions. Vaginal PGE 2pessary (normal release) preparation varied considerably across trials and is not currently available on the NHS (see Chapter 3 ). In order to include this method, we assumed that the cost is equal to that for vaginal PGE 2tablet and gel. Given these uncertainties, we have presented results excluding this intervention. The intervention costs are shown in Table 28 .

However, our literature review did not identify any evidence on the EQ-5D for the outcomes in our model. Furthermore, because of the short time-horizon of our model, the EQ-5D is unlikely to be very sensitive to changes in outcomes in our model. Instead, we attributed a utility score to each of the outcomes in our model, which represents the strength of preferences for a set of health-related outcomes, where utility scores take values of between '0'and '1', with '1'representing perfect health. It was necessary to identify the best available utility estimates for health states that were associated with the consequences of induction of labour for use in the model. The health states used in the model included emergency CS and VD for the mother, and transitional care, high-dependency care and intensive care for the child. A literature search was undertaken to identify evidence on these utility values within published literature. A search was carried out in PubMed, The Cochrane Library [including Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), CENTRAL, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and Economic Evaluations Databases], NHS EED and the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database. Details of the search strategy are presented in Appendix 17 . The number of studies retrieved in each search is shown in Table 29 . Studies were also identified through searching specialist health economics resources, such as the Cost- effectiveness Analysis Registry and reference list checking. After examining titles and abstracts to identify those that were likely to be relevant, 12 studies were found and full papers were obtained. The full-text papers were then screened by two reviewers (EK and NJW) to identify four relevant studies ( Figure 14 ). The list of excluded full articles and reasons for their exclusion can be found in Appendix 17 . Many of the studies that were deemed inappropriate to inform the model relied on the use of assumptions or judgements obtained from expert panels to assign a utility value to the health states of emergency CS, VD and NICU admission, rather than using empirical evidence. Three of the studies960 -962identified that were deemed relevant elicited health-state valuations for these states using the standard gamble technique, which is a recognised preference-based measures of health-related quality of life. The other study963elicited utilities using the prospective measure of preference method, which is a prospective modification of the time trade-off method and standard gamble tools that have been previously described and validated in other settings.964 TABLE 29 Number of studies retrieved in each search Database Number retrieved HTA database 199 NHS EED 2247 The Cochrane Library 8908 PubMed 30,029DOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Three of the studies used appropriate respondents (patients) of a sufficient sample size to give robust estimates. The exception was the study by Plunkett and Grobman,962which used a panel of five experts to assign utilities. None of the studies gives utility values for intensive, high dependency and transitional neonatal care, as required in our model. Vandenbussche et al.960gives utilities for 'transient neurological symptoms ', and Pham and Crowther961give utilities for admission to 'neonatal nursery '. It was not clear in either of these studies if the utilities relate to the mother, baby, or both. In the absence of utilities specifically for the health states in our model, we used the lower interval reported in these two studies (0.7 from Table 30 )t o represent intensive care, the higher interval (0.99 from Table 30 ) to represent transitional care and the midpoint (0.845) to represent high-dependency care. There is clearly a high degree of uncertainty in these values, and so we conducted a sensitivity analysis as detailed in Table 31 . In sensitivity analyses 1 and 2 we vary the utility for high-dependency care to 0.7 (equal to intensive care), and 0.7725 [midpoint between 0.7 and 0.845 (base case)]. In sensitivity analyses 3 and 4 we assume a lower utility score for intensive care (0.57 based on our own small survey described below). In sensitivity analysis 3 we use the midpoint between 0.57 and 0.99 (0.78) for high-dependency care, and in sensitivity analysis 4 we use a quarter of the way between the 0.57 and 0.99 (0.675) for high-dependency care. Both the Turner et al. study963and the Plunkett and Grobman study962provide estimates of utilities relating to mode of delivery; however, we use only the values from Turner et al. ,963as it is based on 102 pregnant women, rather than five experts. We therefore used the utility values of 0.92 and 0.59 for VD and emergency CS, respectively, as reported in Turner et al.963(see Table 30 ). However, no confidence intervals are reported for these figures, so we cannot reflect the uncertainty in the estimates.Potentially relevant articles identied from the electronic search and screened for retrieval (n = 41,383) Total full papers screened (n = 14) Total papers included in the review (n = 4)Papers excluded from review (N = 10) Excluded as utilities not elicited from patients, n = 2 Excluded as no utilities measured, n = 6 Excluded owing to wrong patient population, n = 1 Excluded owing to lack of instrument to value health states, n = 1Papers rejected at the title and abstract stage (n = 41,371) FIGURE 14 Flow chart summarising the review process.ASSESSMENT OF COST-EFFECTIVENESS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk88TABLE 30 Included studies StudyUtility value given for: How derived NICU VD Emergency CS Turner et al.963 Vaginal delivery compared with elective CS: the views of pregnant women and clinicians.

We administered a questionnaire asking respondents to rate different health states. The full questionnaire and results are given in Appendix 18 . An example question is given in Figure 15 . This type of rating scale is called a visual analogue scale (VAS) and is commonly used as a method of measuring preferences for health outcomes.965 Ten respondents completed this questionnaire. This group included all members of the project steering group including clinicians, health economists, systematic reviewers and a patient representative. The health states evaluated were the health of the mother following normal VD and CS, and the health of the mother and child following the child 's admission to the ICU, high dependency unit or transitional care unit. The data were analysed using a model that accounted for the between-respondent variability in overall level of the utility scores, and assumed common mean differences in utility scores for the different outcomes. Details of the statistical model are given in Appendix 18 . The estimated scores from this questionnaire were 0.65 (CrI 0.51 to 0.79) for a VD and 0.42 (CrI 0.17 to 0.67) for CS. Interestingly, although the absolute values of the scores differ, the ratio of the utilities for VD and CS taken from Turner et al.963agrees almost exactly with those arising from our own questionnaire. We therefore felt it appropriate to calibrate the scores from our questionnaire to those obtained in Turner et al.963to obtain uncertainty limits to put around the estimates from Turner et al.963for use in the economic model. Our questionnaire obtained scores for intensive care, high-dependency care and transitional care from both the mother 's and baby 's perspective. Summing these scores for mother and baby for transitional care gave a value of '1', very similar to the 0.99 obtained from the literature review. On this basis, summing the values for mother and baby from our questionnaire for intensive care gives a value of 0.57, which we use as a lower limit in our sensitivity analysis (detailed in Table 31 ). The final utility values that went into the model are shown in Table 32 . The continuous scale below goes from the worst health state you can imagine to the best. Please place a mark on the scale to indicate how you would rate your health if you had: restricted mobility pain requiring painkillers a urinary catheter inability to drive, carry heavy things a wound that required cleaning and drying daily.

This can be conceptualised as a hypothetical cohort of patients who vary in their probabilities, utilities and costs, as described by our joint uncertainty in the parameter estimates, and who experience the consequences of each induction strategy. Total utilities and costs are then averaged over this cohort to obtain the expected total utility and expected total cost for each induction strategy. This allows the assessment of multiple clinical outcomes as well as costs and cost-effectiveness and ensures that full joint uncertainty and correlations between parameters are taken into account. The cost-effectiveness model was evaluated using Microsoft Excel\u00aeversion 2013 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). The analysis requires simulated samples from the joint distributions of all model inputs. For the cost parameters, Monte Carlo simulation was performed within Excel to obtain the simulated samples. The absolute probabilities and utility inputs were estimated using Bayesian inference, computed using MCMC simulation in OpenBUGS. A total of 60,000 MCMC samples from the posterior distributions were taken from OpenBUGS and read into Excel, from which the simulated samples were drawn for the model, taking care to preserve correlations from the MCMC. For each intervention we present the expected total utility and expected total cost, averaged over the simulation sample, together with 95% CrIs. We present an incremental analysis in which (1) interventions are ordered by increasing expected cost; (2) interventions that are dominated (have a higher expected cost and lower expected utility than another intervention) are identified; and (3) ICERs are computed for each non-dominated intervention relative to the previous (lower expected cost) non-dominated intervention, for which the ICER is: ICER=additional expected cost additional expected utility. (1) The reported ICERs can be interpreted as the additional expected cost per additional unit gain in utility for an intervention compared with the previous non-dominated intervention in the table. We also report cost-efficiency frontiers, which plots expected cost against expected utility for each intervention. The frontier line indicates the intervention with the lowest expected cost for a given expected utility, so that interventions above the line are not cost-effective compared with interventions lower downTABLE 32 Utility estimates used in model Delivery mode: utility (95% CrI)NICU admission (base-case utility, see Table 27 )Delivery mode and NICU admission: product of utilities (95% CrI) VD 0.92 (0.72 to 1) None (1) 0.92 (0.72 to 1) Transitional care (0.99) 0.91 (0.71 to 0.99) High-dependency care (0.845) 0.78 (0.61 to 0.85) Intensive care (0.7) 0.64 (0.50 to 0.7) Emergency CS 0.59 (0.25 to 0.95) None (1) 0.59 (0.25 to 0.95) Transitional care (0.99) 0.58 (0.25 to 0.94) High-dependency care (0.845) 0.50 (0.21 to 0.80) Intensive care (0.7) 0.41 (0.18 to 0.67) The first column shows the utilities used for mode of delivery; the second column shows the utilities used for NICU admission type of care; and the third column is the product of the first two columns, corresponding to branches of the decision tree (see Figure 13 ).DOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

The choice between interventions on the frontier line will depend on willingness-to-pay per additional unit of utility. For each intervention we computed net benefit for given willingness-to-pay per additional unit of utility, , (ceiling ratio) where net benefit is defined as: Net benefit =utility*cost. (2) 'Net benefit 'converts utilities to a monetary scale, so that the costs and utilities can be compared directly. Expected net benefit is the average net benefit over the simulation samples. For a given willingness-to-pay threshold , the optimal intervention is that with the highest expected net benefit. We present expected net benefit for =\u00a320,000. We present the uncertainty in the optimal intervention by plotting the probability that each intervention is the most cost-effective (has highest net benefit) against willingness-to-pay per unit of utility (CEACs). Probabilities that are close to 1 indicate that the optimal intervention is very certain, whereas probabilities that are much lower indicate that there is uncertainty as to which intervention is best. Because CEACs can be misleading when there are interventions with a very high degree of uncertainty,966we exclude interventions from the plot that have both a high probability of being most cost-effective and a high probability of being least cost-effective. We also present uncertainty using the incremental cost-effectiveness plane, which displays the incremental cost of each treatment compared with vaginal PGE 2tablet from each simulated sample against the incremental utility of each treatment compared with vaginal PGE 2tablet. Owing to the large numbers of interventions being compared, and the high degree of overlap of some of these, we include only the top three or four interventions (according to probability of being the most cost-effective) in the incremental cost-effectiveness planes. We use value of information methods967to explore how sensitive the optimal intervention is to uncertainty in the model inputs, and to guide research recommendations. If there was no uncertainty in the model inputs then we would know the optimal intervention perfectly. The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) measures the value (in terms of net benefit) resulting from elimination of uncertainty in all model inputs. The expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) measures the value (in terms of net benefit) from elimination of uncertainty in a some of the model inputs, and can be used to explore which model inputs are the key drivers of decision uncertainty, and may be most beneficial for further research efforts. We compute EVPI and EVPPI per person for a willingness-to-pay per unit of utility threshold of \u00a320,000. We also present population-level EVPI and EVPPI, given an annual incidence of labour inductions in England and Wales of 150,000,2,3and assuming a lifetime of the intervention of T =1 year and 5 years, respectively, discounted at 3.5%. The lifetime of the intervention represents the time until the intervention becomes obsolete, for example by being superseded by a new intervention. EVPPI for subsets of parameters were computed using a Gaussian process emulator968using the Sheffield Accelerated Value of Information web application.969 Results Base-case results Table 33 shows the expected total cost and expected total utility for each treatment, averaged over the simulation sample along with their CrIs. Interventions are ordered by increasing expected total cost (treatment costs plus resource costs), with buccal/sublingual misoprostol and i.v. oxytocin with amniotomy having the lowest expected total cost, and placebo (no intervention) having the highest expected total cost. Note that all methods of induction have lower expected total costs than placebo (no intervention) because they reduce costly outcomes (VD in >24 hours, CS and NICU NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk92TABLE 33 Base case: expected total costs, expected total utilities, ICERs and expected net benefit at a \u00a320,000 willingness-to-pay threshold total cost, (1847.79 to 2822.48)0.805 (0.65 to 0.94) 13,788.52 Dominated CI, confidence interval.

Intracervical PGE 2has the lowest expected utility. As the majority of interventions (all except intracervical PGE 2) have no more than a 0.02 difference in expected utility between them, they could be assumed to be clinically equivalent, so that a decision between them is effectively based on minimising total costs. Note that the confidence intervals show that there is a high degree of uncertainty in these estimates. Any intervention that has a higher expected cost and lower expected utility than another intervention is said to be dominated by that intervention. As can be seen from Table 33 , all treatments apart from titrated low-dose oral misoprostol solution are dominated by buccal/sublingual misoprostol, which is more effective, in terms of increased utility, and less expensive than the other interventions. As titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol solution is computed: cost additional expected utility=\u00a342.38 0.002=\u00a321,190. (3) Therefore, \u00a321,190 is the additional expected cost per additional unit gain in utility required for titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol solution compared with buccal/sublingual misoprostol. The expected total costs and expected utilities are displayed graphically in a cost-efficiency frontier (Figure 16 ). Any intervention above the line is not cost-effective compared with interventions lower down for a given expected utility. The graph shows that all of the other interventions apart from buccal/ sublingual misoprostol and titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol are above the line and are therefore dominated, as they are more expensive and less effective. i.v. oxytocin lies very close to the line. Intracervical PGE 2is removed from the graph for visualisation purposes, as it is considerably less effective than the rest of the treatments and also relatively expensive, placing it far from the line. Placebo is the treatment that has the highest expected total cost and is therefore far from the line. The expected net benefit at a \u00a320,000 willingness-to-pay threshold (see Table 33 ) is highest misoprostol frontier.ASSESSMENT OF COST-EFFECTIVENESS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk94We present the uncertainty surrounding the cost-effectiveness of the various interventions, using a CEAC (Figure 17 ) and the cost-effectiveness plane ( Figure 18 ). The CEACs (see Figure 17 ) plot the probability that each of the interventions is the most cost-effective by computing the proportion of simulations for which that intervention had the highest net benefit for a given willingness-to-pay per unit increase in utility. Out of the 19 interventions evaluated, only three had a probability of >10% of being cost-effective at results oxytocin with amniotomy were very uncertain, and i.v. oxytocin also had a high probability of being the least cost-effective. To avoid misleading conclusions, we have removed i.v. oxytocin with amniotomy from Figure 17 , and, for clarity, give labels only for interventions for which it was clear that the probability of being cost-effective is >10%. Figure 17 shows that at any willingness-to-pay value up until around \u00a323,000, buccal/sublingual misoprostol has the highest probability of being cost-effective. Above this threshold, titrated low-dose oral misoprostol solution has the highest probability of being cost-effective. This probability is never >35%, indicating a large degree of uncertainty in the optimal intervention. 1.0 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0 0 5 1 01 52 02 53 03 54 04 55 0Buccal/sublingual misoprostol Titrated low-dose oral misoprostol Value of (\u00a3000)Probability of being cost-effective FIGURE 17 Base-case CEAC.

Applications for commercial reproduction should be addressed to: NIHR Journals Library, National Institute for Health Research, Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre, Alpha House, University of Southampton Science Park, Southampton SO16 7NS, UK.95The high degree of uncertainty between these interventions is seen clearly in the cost-effectiveness plane (see Figure 18 ), which plots the simulated pairs of incremental utility and incremental cost values for each intervention (compared with vaginal PGE 2tablet). As there are a large number of interventions to display, and the majority of interventions were very similar in terms of costs and utilities, the plot is unreadable if all interventions are included. For visual clarity, we plot only the interventions that were found to have had a>10% probability of being cost-effective of at any willingness-to-pay value, along with intracervical PGE 2, the intervention with the lowest average utility. As can be seen from the graph, the majority of the points for buccal/sublingual misoprostol, titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol solution and amniotomy are plotted in the bottom right-hand corner, indicating that these interventions are more effective and less expensive than vaginal PGE 2tablet. However, the location of some of the points in the other quadrants indicates that this is not certain. All of the points for intracervical PGE 2, for example, are plotted in the top- and bottom-left quadrants, showing that although there is uncertainty in the cost, intracervical PGE 2never has a utility score higher than vaginal PGE 2tablet. Sensitivity analysis to assumed utilities Varying the utility estimates, as detailed in Table 31 , had a very minor effect on the results. The interventions were ranked from lowest to highest expected cost in the same order and the expected utilities varied only on the second or third decimal point. Subgroup analysis (i): women with intact membranes only To examine the effect that membrane status had on the results, a scenario analysis was carried out restricting to mothers with intact membranes only. When we included all interventions for which we had sufficient information to evaluate the model, only 13 out of a total of 34 interventions (see Table 34 and seeAppendix 16 ) were included in analysis, and the remaining interventions were excluded. Note that placebo (no intervention) was not included in this analysis, so comparisons with no intervention cannot be made. Table 34 shows the expected total utility and expected total cost for each treatment when the analysis is limited to women with intact membranes. Interventions are again ordered in order of increasing expected cost (treatment costs plus resource costs) with titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol solution now having the highest expected total cost and vaginal misoprostol (dose <50 \u00b5g) and i.v. oxytocin with lowest expected cost. Titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol solution still has the highest expected utility, and intracervical PGE 2still has the lowest expected utility. The confidence intervals again show that there is a high degree of uncertainty in these estimates. As can be seen from Table 34 , all interventions apart from titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol solution and i.v. oxytocin dominated by vaginal misoprostol (dose <50 \u00b5g), which is more effective in terms of increased utility, and less expensive. As i.v. oxytocin with amniotomy is non-dominated relative \u00b5g), computed: additional expected utility=\u00a30.94 0.006=\u00a3156.66. (4) Therefore, \u00a3156.66 is the additional expected cost per additional unit gain in utility required for i.v. oxytocin with amniotomy compared with vaginal misoprostol in women amniotomy, an ICER additional expected utility=\u00a3474.02 0.012=\u00a339, 501.66. (5) Therefore, \u00a339,501.66 is the additional expected cost per additional unit gain in utility required for titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol solution compared with i.v. oxytocin with amniotomy in women with intact membranes only. The intervention with the highest expected net benefit at \u00a320,000 threshold is i.v. oxytocin with misoprostol (dose <50 \u00b5g) (\u00a314,464), and the intervention with the lowest expected net benefit is intracervical PGE 2at \u00a310,563.TABLE 34 Subgroup analysis: women PGE2pessary (normal 2028.67 (1662.47 2065.24 (1691.42 39,501.66 CI, confidence interval. a Expected total costs, expected total utilities, ICER and expected net benefit at a \u00a320,000 willingness-to-pay value.

However, as in the other analyses, there is little difference between the utility scores. The intervention with the highest expected net benefit is buccal/sublingual misoprostol (\u00a314,296) followed by titrated (low-dose) vaginal misoprostol (dose 50 \u00b5g) (\u00a314,125), and the intervention with the lowest expected net benefit is intracervical PGE 2at \u00a310,798. The CEAC for women with an unfavourable cervix subgroup is presented in Figure 21 . Buccal/sublingual misoprostol has the highest probability of being most cost-effective, followed by titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol solution, but there is a high degree of uncertainty in these results, with the probability being around 50%. The incremental cost-effectiveness plane for the subgroup analysis ( Figure 22 ) shows incremental costs and utilities (compared with vaginal PGE 2tablet) for the two interventions that had a probability of being cost-effective of >10%. The majority of the points are located in the bottom right-hand quadrant, indicating that they are likely to be less expensive and more effective than vaginal PGE 2tablet. 1.0 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0 0 5 1 01 52 02 53 03 54 04 55 0 Value of ceilin g ratio (\u00a3000)Probability of being cost-effectiveBuccal/sublingual misoprostol Titrated low-dose oral misoprostol solution FIGURE 21 Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve for subgroup analysis (ii): women with an unfavourable cervix only.

The per-woman EVPI is \u00a3187, which corresponds to a population EVPI of \u00a328M for all of the inductions in England and Wales over a 1-year time horizon, increasing to \u00a3131M over a 5-year time horizon. This large value suggests that the decision is sensitive to uncertainty in the model inputs, and so it is potentially of value to reduce this uncertainty through future research studies. Comparing EVPPI for different subsets of model inputs indicates to which model inputs the decision is most sensitive and where future research efforts may be best invested. EVPPI is higher for cost parameters (\u00a319) than for utility parameters (\u00a30); however, EVPPI for both cost and utility parameters together (\u00a3102) is higher than for cost parameters alone. This suggests that there is no value in reducing uncertainty in either costs or utilities without also reducing uncertainty in the other. There is a high value in reducing uncertainty in all of the transition parameters for mode of delivery (\u00a3114). We explored the potential value of a new trial comparing the two interventions with the highest expected net benefit in the base case [buccal/sublingual misoprostol vs. titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol] providing information on all transitions for those interventions, costs and utilities. This gives an EVPPI of \u00a3110, which corresponds to a population EVPPI of \u00a316.5M over a 1-year time horizon, increasing to \u00a377M over a 5-year time horizon. However, if costs and utilities are not collected then this value disappears (EVPPI of \u00a32). This suggests that a large well-conducted trial may be a worthwhile use of resources, but it is essential to collect information on costs and utilities as well as transition probabilities for mode of delivery and NICU admission.

We were able to perform the analysis only for the interventions for which we had sufficient information on all outcomes required in the model. This does not mean the excluded interventions are not cost-effective, just that we have no evidence. Therefore, our conclusions on the cost-effectiveness of the included interventions needs to be interpreted within the set of interventions that we were able to include. However there were no interventions that were identified by the NMA as being effective that were not included in the cost-effectiveness analysis. Furthermore, only a subset (86) of the studies provided information on both VD within 24 hours and CS for the joint modelling required in the economic model. Therefore, the economic evaluation is based on fewer studies than the NMA presented in Chapter 3 for VD within 24 hours. 2. It is assumed that the proportion of babies who are admitted to NICU depends on mode of delivery (CS or VD), but not on whether a VD was within 24 hours of induction or not. Of those admitted to NICU, we assumed that the proportion of babies cared for in intensive (19%), high dependency (7%) or transitional care (74%) would not vary depending on method (vaginal vs. CS) or timing of delivery (<24 hours;>24 hours), or intervention. 3. It was also assumed that the length of stay in intensive, high dependency and transitional care was fixed at 2, 1.5 and 2 days, respectively, based on the data from the Liverpool Women 's Hospital. 4. It was assumed that long-term costs and benefits would be equal across induction methods, and that any variation would be captured in the time between induction and discharge. 5. The NMA gave estimates on the rate of instrumental delivery, Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes and uterine hyperstimulation, but these were assumed to be unnecessary in the model, as the differences in costs and benefits would be captured in the other outcomes included. 6. Some important outcomes, such as post-partum haemorrhage, were not reported as an outcome in trials and therefore could not be included in the economic model. 7. Although we would have liked to, we did not have enough evidence on parity to explore cost-effectiveness in primiparous and multiparous women separately. Conclusions In summary, the base-case analysis found that all of the methods of induction were cost-saving compared with no treatment. It is noteworthy that there is considerable uncertainty in our cost-effectiveness estimates, with the majority of the interventions having very similar utility values, and mainly differing in total costs. With this caveat, buccal/sublingual misoprostol and titrated oral misoprostol were identified as being the interventions with the highest expected net benefit and the highest probability of being cost-effective. At any willingness-to-pay value of >\u00a323,000 per unit increase in utility, titrated low-dose oral misoprostol solution seems to be the intervention that is most likely to be the most cost-effective for use on the UK NHS. Given that we were able to analyse only two subgroups (intact membranes and unfavourable cervix), and the number of interventions compared -and studies included -were lower than in the base case, the results of subgroup analyses should be interpreted cautiously (i.e. as hypothesis generating). In the subgroup of women with intact membranes, and limiting to interventions feasible on the NHS, i.v. oxytocin with amniotomy was identified as being the intervention with the highest expected net benefit and the optimal intervention at any willingness-to-pay value. However, there was again a lot of uncertainty in this estimate, with buccal/sublingual misoprostol and titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol also with a moderate probability of being most cost-effective.ASSESSMENT OF COST-EFFECTIVENESS NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk102Buccal/sublingual misoprostol and titrated low-dose oral misoprostol solution were found to be the interventions that were most likely to be cost-effective in women with an unfavourable cervix. The majority of the interventions, with a few notable exceptions, such as intracervical PGE 2, result in similar expected utility and vary mainly in terms of cost. There is a considerable degree of uncertainty in these estimates, demonstrated by the wide confidence intervals around the values. There is a need to study further utilities on both mother and baby outcomes from both mother and baby perspectives. This research should be conducted using preference-based measures on large samples and with uncertainties fully reported. We would urge future trials in this area to present results according to mutually exclusive clinically relevant subgroups (e.g. parity, membrane and cervical status, previous CS) to allow more evidence to inform subgroup analyses. We would also urge trialists to report results in a format that allows the construction of the number of vaginal deliveries within 24 hours, the number CSs and the number of vaginal deliveries after 24 hours. It would also be useful to report the NICU admissions according to mode of delivery. Haemorrhage and sepsis (antibiotic usage) are also important adverse outcomes that have consequences for the economic evaluation but which are inconsistently reported. The value-of-information analysis suggests that the decision is very sensitive to uncertainty in the model inputs, and there is potential value in reducing this uncertainty through future research studies. Further large well- conducted trials may be a worthwhile use of resources, but it is essential to collect information on costs and utilities, as well as transition probabilities for mode of delivery and NICU admission.DOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

We then set out the strengths and limitations of analyses before considering the clinical implication of findings. Finally, we offer recommendations for future research. Key findings of the systematic review and network meta-analysis Thirty-four active treatment types/regimens were included in our review, including different dose regimes and routes of administration. Overall, the search identified >1000 studies and, after eligibility assessment using our PICO (population, intervention and relevant comparators, outcomes) criteria, 611 trials were included in the review. Together, these trials reported findings for >100,000 women who were randomised to different methods for third-trimester induction of labour. The active interventions most likely to achieve VD within 24 hours were i.v. oxytocin with by vaginal administration of PGE 2(pessary -normal release). It should be stressed that the rankings have wide CrIs for all of the above methods, indicating considerable uncertainty. The rankings range from 1st to 6th and 1st to 9th for vaginal misoprostol ( 50 \u00b5g) and i.v. oxytocin with amniotomy, respectively, to 1st to 13th for PGE 2pessary. Compared with placebo, several treatments showed a statistically significant reduction in the odds of CS: titrated low-dose misoprostol, catheter, membrane sweeping and buccal/ sublingual misoprostol. In this group, titrated oral misoprostol achieved the lowest odds of an eventual CS but there was still considerable uncertainty in this finding, as observed by the posterior mean rank of 6th (out of 33) and 95% CrI from 2nd to 13th (out of 33) for oral misoprostol solution. There was little to distinguish between the other interventions with considerable uncertainty in treatment rankings. i.v. prostaglandins performed worse than placebo and significantly increased the odds of CS. Other poorly performing interventions included vaginal PGE 2tablet, oral misoprostol tablet Uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes was one of the key safety outcomes. Here double-balloon catheter, NO and laminaria had the highest probability of being among the best three treatments, whereas i.v. oxytocin with amniotomy, slow-release misoprostol pessary and high-dose vaginal misoprostol tablets (which was among the best treatments for efficacy) were most likely to increase the odds of excessive uterine activity. For other safety outcomes there were insufficient data or too much uncertainty around estimates to identify which treatments performed 'best '. Few studies collected information on women 's views. On the whole, women tended to have positive views, or at least accepted the induction process, but there was insufficient information to determine whether or not some methods were preferred over others. Our findings also suggest that of the seemingly less 'medicalised 'induction methods, there is little to choose among them in terms of safety. Of interest is that none of the included studies examining these methods (membrane sweeping, acupuncture and sexual intercourse) reported our effectiveness outcome - failure to achieve VD within 24 hours -suggesting that when it comes to the urgency of delivery, the expectations from these methods is very different.DOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Unfortunately, it was possible to carry out only two of these analyses (membrane status and Bishop scores) owing to lack of data or inconsistency in the results for other subgroups. Our two subgroup analyses were restricted to only a fraction of 611 included trials and three outcomes (VD within 24 hours, CS and low Apgar score). The results were broadly in agreement with overall results. i.v. oxytocin with amniotomy and high-dose vaginal misoprostol tablets remained the most effective interventions for achieving VD within 24 hours in women with intact membranes. Key findings of the cost-effectiveness analysis All methods of induction were cost-saving compared with no treatment, although there is considerable uncertainty in our cost-effectiveness estimates. It is important to stress that the interventions have very similar expected utility values, and differ mainly in expected total costs. Titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol and buccal/sublingual misoprostol had the highest probability of being the most cost-effective intervention at any willingness-to-pay value. Given that we were able to analyse only two subgroups (intact membranes and unfavourable cervix), and the number of interventions compared and studies included were lower than in the base case, the results of subgroup analyses should be interpreted cautiously (i.e. as hypothesis generating). In the subgroup of women with intact membranes, and limiting to interventions that were feasible through the NHS, i.v. oxytocin with amniotomy was identified as the intervention that was most likely to be most cost-effective. In the subgroup of women with an unfavourable cervix, buccal/sublingual misoprostol and titrated low-dose oral misoprostol solution were found to be the interventions that were most likely to be most cost-effective. Strengths In our systematic review we made considerable effort to include all RCTs with no language restrictions, which led to the inclusion of >600 trials, with data for >100,000 women and babies. The NMA provided an opportunity to examine the relative effectiveness of all treatments used for the induction of labour in a coherent and methodologically robust way across important clinical outcomes. Although there are now increasing numbers of NMAs reported in the literature, and some relate to competing treatments in obstetrics,970as far as we are aware this NMA includes more trials and participants than any other in this topic area. Network meta-analysis is only valid on the assumption that all of the treatments in the network would be suitable for all included women. We were thorough in our evaluation of six important potential treatment effect modifiers (previous CS, parity, membrane status, Bishop score, gestational age and single/multiple pregnancy) and found no clinically important differences in the distribution of these potential effect modifiers across the interventions. We also conducted informal and formal statistical checks of model fit and inconsistency. When lack of fit and/or inconsistency between evidence sources was observed, it was resolved by excluding studies that were assessed as being at high risk of bias. To our knowledge this is the first attempt to simultaneously compare more than two treatments for the induction of labour in a cost-effectiveness analysis. A study by Petrou et al.14suggested that PGE was more cost-effective 2tablets, and Van Baaren et al. 's study955concluded that Foley catheter induction was more cost-effective than PGE 2gel. These results are not directly comparable with the results from this study, as they use different measures of benefit, but it is still worth mentioning that in our cost-effectiveness analysis these interventions were found to be less effective and more expensive than titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol solution, vaginal misoprostol (dose<50 \u00b5g).DISCUSSION NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk106Limitations Systematic review and network meta-analysis Broadly, the aim of induction of labour is to achieve early delivery of the baby with the minimum harm to women and babies, and we selected outcomes to reflect these aims. However, not all of the included trials provided data on all of our key outcomes. The number of women undergoing CS was generally well reported. However, in view of high heterogeneity and apparent inconsistency it was necessary to restrict our analysis to RCTs at low risk of bias for the allocation concealment domain. The number of women who did not give birth vaginally within 24 hours (our main efficacy outcome) was reported in less than one-quarter of trials. Key safety outcomes were also reported relatively infrequently. Approximately one-third of trials were included in the NMA for infant admission to NICU (205) and there was considerable heterogeneity between trials (possibly as a result of inconsistent definitions of this outcome). Similarly, uterine hyperstimulation and low infant Apgar score were reported in fewer than one-third of trials. Overall, maternal mortality and severe morbidity and infant mortality event rates, when reported, were very low. Unfortunately, these outcomes were too infrequently reported to make the pooled analysis possible. We had also intended to report serious infant morbidity but this outcome was poorly reported and inconsistently defined in trials. Consequently, we used admission to NICU as a proxy outcome for infant morbidity. Neonatal mortality was reported in only 21.3% of these trials and the incidence was low at 0.3%. Of course, it should not be assumed that if infant mortality was not reported then it did not occur, but it is probable that death rates were also low in those trials failing to report this important outcome. Very few trials collected data and reported findings relating to women 's views about the induction process. This was surprising, as some methods of induction are likely to be both painful and unpleasant. Again, because of the dearth of data and inconsistency in the way outcomes were measured and reported across trials, we were unable to include findings on maternal preferences and satisfaction in our formal quantitative analysis. There was also insufficient information from trials evaluating alternative and complementary methods to include them in the analysis of our main efficacy outcome. None of the trials included for the analysis of number of women failing to deliver within 24 hours included an alternative method of induction. For safety outcomes, alternative and complementary methods of induction did not appear to be safer than pharmacological and mechanical methods. The trials included in the review recruited women with varied clinical characteristics, and it is important to bear this in mind when interpreting results. The indications for induction were not always reported and, when they were, these varied across trials. Many trials excluded women with a history of CS or multiple pregnancies. Predominantly, women recruited to trials were at >37 weeks 'gestation, including post-term pregnancies and term PROM. Most of the trials were carried out in hospital settings because most methods of labour induction require constant attendance and monitoring by skilled clinical staff. However, we did include 79 trials examining interventions that were carried out in outpatient, community or home settings. For all outcomes we observed moderate heterogeneity between study effects. This is not surprising, given the clinical heterogeneity described above in settings and women who present for induction of labour. Heterogeneity may also be attributable to the varied quality of included studies. Overall, approximately half of the studies were assessed as being at high or unclear risk of bias. Consequently, we conducted REs NMA for all outcomes to allow for this heterogeneity. We report the mean from the REs distribution of study effects, although this assumes that our focus is on the effects observed in an 'average study ', whereas other summaries might be more appropriate, such as the shrunken estimate for the UK trials971or a prediction for a new study population.DOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Particularly for the analy sis of safety outcomes, the findings were not clear-cut (i.e. there were no clear 'best 'or'worst 'treatments for most of these outcomes). This uncertainty did not apply just to results for CS. This uncertainty is not nece ssarily surprising, as a large number of interventions were examined in the network. Although some inte rventions were examined in a large number of trials, data for other interventions were sparse, event rates for som e outcomes were very low, and some outcomes were also inconsistently defined (e.g. hyperstimulation syndrome). This means that we were not able to use all of the available data in our analysis. In particula r, the low event rates for NICU admission meant that in some arms of trials no events were reported, which led to problems in estimation of relative effects and also increased uncertainty in the economic analy ses. Heterogeneity in the analyses may also have been caused by the fact that trials were carried out over a long time period during which induction and CS rates in particular have increased steadily. These temporal changes could have contributed to heterogeneity and increased uncertainty of findings. More intensive surveillance may also have led to apparent increases in some outcomes (e.g. hyperstimulation). Cost-effectiveness analysis Our cost-effectiveness analysis was confined to short-term outcomes up until discharge from hospital, although we are aware that some outcomes may have a longer-term impact on women and their families, and also on NHS resources. The analysis was complicated by the fact that outcomes related to both women and their babies, and the two are interlinked. Women may be profoundly affected by any adverse outcomes in their newborn and, conversely, the baby may be affected by adverse outcomes for the mother. In our analysis the well-being of women and babies were combined in a single utility value for each outcome. The evidence sources informing utilities for method of delivery were assumed to represent the mothers 'well-being. However it was not clear whether the utilities for NICU admission and intensity of care required represented utility for the mother, baby or both (and, if so, the relative weight given to mother and baby: women (and even society) may value the health of the baby above their own). We needed to distinguish those women who had a CS, those who had a VD within 24 hours, and those who had a VD after 24 hours. We found that results from trials were not always reported in a way that allowed u s to estimate the outcomes together in this way. There was sufficient information to estimate effects for only 18 interventions and our conclusions on cost-effectiveness are therefore limited to this data subset. The RCTs identified in the systematic review did not provide any evidence on the proportion of NICU admissions following births by CSs, nor on the proportion of babies admitted to different intensities of NICU care (intensive care, high-dependency care and transitional care). We have, therefore, used routinely collected hospital activity data from Liverpool Women 's Hospital to inform these inputs to our model. We identified only four studies960 -963reporting preference-based measures of utility relevant to the outcomes in our model, none of which reported EQ-5D, our preferred measure. The health states did not correspond directly with those in our model, and so assumptions were necessary. It was also not clear in these studies960 -963whether or not the utility was for the mother, baby or both (and if so the relative weight given to mother and baby). Furthermore, measures of uncertainty were not reported alongside the utility estimates. In an attempt to address these limitations, we used our own small-scale survey to put uncertainty limits on the literature-based utilities and to define sensitivity analyses. However, note that our survey is severely limited due to being restricted to the project steering group and also limitations with the VAS instrument that it used.972Although the scores are bias prone and may not be comparable to utilities elicited through other measures, the resulting ordinal preferences we obtained were found to have some face validity (the patterns seen across respondents were broadly comparable and in line with intuition) and can be considered as a first step towards defining utilities for mother/baby pairs. A large-scale study measuring utilities (preferably using EQ-5D) on antenatal and postnatal women, reporting results (together with uncertainty estimates) from both the mother and baby perspective, including time post discharge, would be of great value in addressing the limitations described above.DISCUSSION NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk108Discussion of the clinical implications of findings Our NMA suggests that oxytocin with amniotomy and misoprostol are the most effective in achieving vaginal births relatively quickly. Interestingly, there was little difference between different misoprostol regimens, with the exception of oral tablets. Both high- and low-dose oral tablets, appear to be inferior to low-dose oral solution, buccal/sublingual and all vaginal regimens. Vaginal PGE 2also performed well, although our results favoured pessary (normal release) over methods currently available in the NHS (gel, tablet and slow-release pessary). We have already mentioned that in our NMA the term 'PGE 2pessary ' captures vaginal administration that could not be classified as tablets, gel or slow-release pessaries which are currently commercially available. Consequently, this is a rather heterogeneous mix of study-specific dinoprostone preparations, often produced by local pharmacies. Intravenous oxytocin with amniotomy performed well, but this method was used only with intact membranes and therefore can be recommended only in this subgroup. Furthermore, the majority of the trials evaluating this method included women with more favourable cervix for whom delivery within 24 hours is more likely. However, just because the absolute rate of VD in 24 hours is higher when the cervix is favourable does not necessarily mean that the relative effects between tested interventions would differ. It is important to stress again that oxytocin with amniotomy has been mainly tested, and has been shown to perform well, in women with a favourable cervix, and the intervention is therefore recommended only for this group. The safety profile of different methods was less clear. For example, misoprostol (low-dose vaginal tablets and buccal/sublingual) was associated with relatively high hyperstimulation; however, this finding was not borne out in increased rates of CS. One would expect that the two are related with persistent and clinically important uterine hyperstimulation eventually resulting in CS. The cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that titrated (low-dose) oral misoprostol solution had the highest utility for mothers and babies, and buccal/sublingual misoprostol had the lowest cost to the NHS. Notwithstanding the considerable uncertainty of cost-effectiveness results, it is still surprising that treatments in common use in the NHS (e.g. PGE 2vaginal gel) did not appear to be the most effective, most cost-effective or safest. Therefore, our findings may have important implications for clinical practice in the UK. The current recommendation of the World Health Organization973is for low-dose oral misoprostol tablets rather than titrated oral solution and, therefore, not in line with the findings from this analysis. Our main measure of efficacy was whether or not treatments resulted in VD within 24 hours. This definition of efficacy may be controversial given that cervical ripening has often been regarded as a distinctly different process from induction of labour. This view is reflected in the fact that changes in Bishop scores were often the main measure of efficacy in many of the included randomised trials. We argue that women and clinicians view cervical ripening and labour induction as part of the same seamless process, with the main aim to achieve a safe vaginal birth of a healthy baby in the shortest time possible. The outcomes we used in the cost-effectiveness analysis were VD within 24 hours, CS and NICU admission; these outcomes were reported reasonably frequently and we thought that these outcomes provided a reasonable balance of efficacy (benefit) and harm. At the same time, as we have seen from the results of the NMA, there may be a trade-off in terms of harms and benefits of different treatments: those agents that stimulate contractions and thereby achieve faster delivery may cause excessive uterine activity that may lead to problems for women and babies. We had expected that serious maternal and neonatal adverse events would be rare in the cohorts of women recruited to RCTs of induction of labour. Nevertheless, it was disappointing how infrequently mortality and serious morbidity were reported. Our assessment of safety was therefore limited to CS, hyperstimulation with fetal heart changes, NICU admission and infant Apgar score, at best proxies for serious adverse events.DOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

It was not surprising to us that many trials included in the review excluded women with previous CS or uterine scar for other reasons. The efficacy of induction agents that may cause excessive uterine activity must be seen in this context. We took the view that country of setting was not likely to be a critical treatment effect modifier, because in all included RCTs intrapartum fetal monitoring and early access to CS were available to most women. Even in those trials for which the induction agent was administered outside a hospital setting, arrangements were in place for monitoring and emergency admission in case of complications. Given these circumstances, the findings from our analysis are more likely to be applicable in high-resource settings, such as the NHS. Very few trials considered women 's views. Our own small-scale utility elicitation exercise showed that respondents set great store by the health of babies and women may therefore would be likely to accept induction if a clinician considered that this would potentially improve neonatal outcomes. At the same time, given the similar utility values for a broad range of induction agents, there is surely scope for taking women 's views into account. Women need to be informed of the advantages and drawbacks of different methods of induction and to be aware that there is a choice of interventions available. Recommendations for future research The considerable uncertainty in our findings points the way for further research. In terms of populations, it is striking how little randomised evidence relates to important subgroups, such as women with previous CSs. Future studies should, at the very least, make available the results by subgroups when they are included. When induction of labour is clinically indicated, a placebo or no-intervention arm in a trial may not be feasible or even ethical (our study shows that placebo is neither effective nor cost-effective). We suggest that titrated oral misoprostol solution should be used as a comparator, particularly in the NHS setting, and future RCTs should be powered to detect a method that is more cost-effective than misoprostol solution. Clearly, the fact that this method is currently unlicensed with virtually no pharmacokinetic data poses a considerable challenge. We are conscious that, at present there are no internationally agreed core outcome sets for labour induction studies. Until such time, we urge all triallists to report 11 outcomes included in this NMA in all future RCTs: lfailure to achieve VD within 24 hours luterine hyperstimulation resulting in FHR changes lNICU admissions (by level of care and mode of delivery) lApgar score <7 at 5 minutes lneonatal deaths satisfaction.DISCUSSION NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk110It is also important to report results separately for all clinically important subgroups (e.g. parity, membrane and cervical status and previous CS) to allow individual patient data meta-analysis and network analysis. There is also an urgent need to explore women 's views of the process as part of any future trial. Finally, there is a need for well-conducted studies to measure utilities from the perspective of the mother and baby, preferably using the EQ-5D instrument.DOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

See below for searches run and strategies used. lScreens the results, gets hard copies of all relevant papers. lAssigns each paper reporting a RCT/clinical controlled trial (CCT) (by Cochrane definition) to a review topic or topics, depending on the intervention, and adds it to the database with a topic classification number to aid retrieval. The Group has a very detailed topic list. For this project, all of the papers assigned to the 'Induction of labour 'topic were identified using the broad classification number for this topic.

Specialised register inclusion criteria Topic scope Controlled trials comparing alternative forms of care used either during pregnancy (but not to terminate early pregnancy) or within 28 days of delivery. Study design A controlled trial has been defined as a trial involving humans in which allocation to the intervention has either been at random, or by some quasi-random method, such as by alternation, or on the basis of the case record number or date of birth. These criteria have been applied fairly liberally to avoid excluding potentially useful studies involving concurrent comparisons of alternative policies. In other words, the register includes reports that, if necessary, can subsequently be rejected as methodologically inadequate by a member of the Group preparing a systematic review. No language restrictions are applied.DOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Results from NMA and pairwise meta-analysis (when possible). All are considered undesirable outcomes. An OR of>1 favours placebo (i.e. fewer events occur on a placebo than active treatment). An OR of <1 favours the active treatment (i.e. fewer undesirable events occurred on the active treatment). Empty cells indicate that direct evidence was not available for that comparison.

If a study reports all outcomes then we can jointly estimate the probability of each of these outcomes using a multinomial likelihood, which ensures that the three outcome probabilities sum to 1. However, not all of our included studies report all of these outcomes. Restricting to only studies that report all three outcomes substantially reduces the number of studies that are included to 86. In order to include as many studies as possible, we note that the multinomial likelihood with three outcomes can be written as two conditionally independent binomial likelihoods. We therefore first estimate the relative effects (ORs) for CS using the NMA presented in Chapter 3 (including 307 studies). Then, conditional on not having a CS, we estimate the relative effects (ORs) for a VD within 24 hours compared with after 24 hours, in an additional NMA performed specifically for the economic model (including 86 studies -see below). Care is required to ensure that the correct denominator (number of women who did not have a CS) is used in this analysis. Given estimates of the probability of (1) a VD within 24 hours and (2) CS conditional on failure to achieve a VD in 24 hours, for the reference treatment, ref, we can apply the ORs estimated in the NMA to obtain probabilities for these outcomes for any intervention k using the relationship: log -odds (probability (k))=log-odds (probability(ref)) +log-odds ratio. We can then find the overall p(VD24) =(1-p(CS)) x p(VD24 given no CS). The probability of a VD in >24 hours, p(VD >24), can be computed as >24)=1-p(VD24) -p(CS). For the additional NMA for a VD within 24 hours given no CS, after excluding trials with zero events in all arms and those that did not report both CS and failure to deliver vaginally within 24 hours, 86 trials of 21 interventions were incorporated, including placebo and no intervention comparisons. The network plot is shown in Figure 34 . For the additional NMA for a VD within 24 hours given no CS, in the subgroup of women with intact membranes only, 33 trials of 13 interventions were included. The network plot is shown in Figure 35 . For the additional NMA for a VD within 24 hours given no CS in the subgroup of women with an unfavourable cervix only, 63 trials of 19 interventions were incorporated, including placebo and no intervention. The network plot is shown in Figure 36 .DOI: 10.3310/hta20650 HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 2016 VOL. 20 NO. 65 \u00a9 Queen 's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

Overall utility scores are very variable across respondents, but similar patterns are seen between health states. We fitted a normal distribution to the utility scores for the first state (VD from the mother 's perspective), giving an estimated mean score 0.65, across respondents, and estimated between respondent SD of 2.05. Then for each of the other health states we estimate the mean difference in score relative to state 1 (VD from the mother 's perspective) and between-respondent SD in these differences. Modelling differences in this way accounts for the variability between respondents and allows for correlations between scores from the same respondent. Adding the estimated mean difference to the mean score for health state 1 gives an absolute score for each health state, and dividing by 10 gives a value on the interval 0 -1. The OpenBUGS code is given below. Table 77 shows how the utility scores from the questions in the VAS questionnaire are combined to obtain the utility scores for the health states required in our model. Note that to obtain the utility scores for the mother 's perspective only the first term is used for each state, whereas for the utilities from the baby 's perspective only the second term is used for each state. 012345678910Utility score (\u00d7 10) 1.
