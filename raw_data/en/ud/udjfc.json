Sometimes I am literally running out the door to head to work, and I pop 2 gummies in my mouth! This one packs a punch of ginger and is bright Turmeric color so you know you are getting your dose! I also prefer the liquid vitamins because I can take them in the morning with my breakfast. My doctor recommended this to me to help support my thyroid imbalances I was having and it has helped me tremendously! Tastes great and the bottle lasts a very long time. Highly recommend! Truly love MaryRuth's Probiotic Weight Management! Keeps my system moving gently on a regular basis. I take it after breakfast in the morning and it makes a world of a difference! Amazing product! Great quality. We love the Nighttime Multimineral it has a great relaxing effect without the groggy feeling in the AM. My 2yr old takes it too! Happy rested toddler = happy rested parents.
