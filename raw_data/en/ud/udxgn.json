We are happy to announce that we are now offering European Mistletoe (mistletoe) injections as a supportive treatment for individuals who have been diagnosed with cancer. The History Of European Mistletoe Therapy For Cancer Treatment More than a popular romantic symbol of love and fertility, mistletoe has been used throughout history to treat medical conditions from arthritis to seizures, and was even thought to be a healer of all ailments in some cultures. In the early twentieth century, European physicians began treating their patients who were living with cancer with injections of mistletoe extract. Unlike it's red-berried American counterpart, European mistletoe, Viscum album L., is a hemiparasitic plant with white berries. It contains lectins and viscotoxins, active constituents that have been shown to stimulate immune function and display anti-cancer properties in cell culture and animal studies.*1, 2 Studies On Mistletoe Injection For Cancer Treatment Many of the studies which investigate the efficacy of mistletoe as a treatment for cancer present mixed results regarding its potential ability to prolong survival and reduce tumor recurrence and metastases. However, many of these studies lack methodological validity. Despite the controversy presented in the available research, mistletoe treatment is commonly prescribed as a complementary cancer treatment in Europe. Benefits Of Mistletoe Therapy For Cancer Treatment The strongest current evidence for mistletoe treatment indicates its potential ability to improve quality of life and well-being in individuals who have cancer. Subcutaneous injections of mistletoe have been shown to improve appetite, sleep, weight maintenance, and overall quality of life in individuals who are receiving best supportive care as well as conventional cancer treatment. Moreover, this treatment has not been shown to interfere with chemotherapy and or commonly cause serious adverse effects. *3, 4 Randomized controlled trials have shown mistletoe treatment to improve quality of life in individuals with non-small cell lung, ovarian, breast, and pancreatic cancers. *5,6,7 Quality of life was not shown to be improved in individuals with head and neck cancers, however. Mistletoe treatment has not yet been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and clinical trials are underway in the US to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this treatment. Average Cost Of Mistletoe Injection For Cancer Treatment The average cost of mistletoe treatment ranges from $100-200 per month.
