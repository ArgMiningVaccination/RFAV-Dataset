The vials equate to up to 25,000 doses when administered through a new method that injects the vaccine between layers of skin rather than beneath the skin, requiring only one fifth of a vial. The Food and Drug Administration authorized the emergency use of the new vaccination method last week in an effort to stretch the short-supplied, two-dose JYNNEOS vaccine treatment. Even with the additional doses, Dallas County has not yet expanded who is eligible to get the vaccine, said Dr. Philip Huang, the county's top health official. Currently, the vaccine is limited only to people who have had known skin-to-skin exposure to the virus or men who have sex with men if they have had multiple or anonymous partners in the last two weeks. Huang said it's still unclear how long the health department will have to make the new vials last. \"We're going to start to get to where we have to do the second doses of the people who've gotten the first dose, too. So, there's a lot of different things going on,\" Huang said. A majority of cases in this monkeypox outbreak have occurred in men who have sex with men, although the virus can spread to anyone, regardless of sexual orientation. The health department is working with several community partners \u2014 including Abounding Prosperity, AIDS Healthcare Foundation, Community Health Empowerment and Prism Health North Texas \u2014 to distribute the shots.

Shipment of the additional doses comes less than two weeks after Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins [ issued an emergency declaration ](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2022/08/05/dallas-county-declares-emergency-due-to-monkeypox-outbreak/)due to the monkeypox outbreak. Jenkins said the county is using the declaration to try to source more doses of the vaccine, which are being distributed by the federal government. The Texas Department of State Health Services will likely receive another 5,000 vials \u2014 or 25,000 doses \u2014 within the next week to distribute throughout the state, said department spokesperson Chris Van Deusen. With [292 confirmed and 45 suspected cases](https://www.dallascounty.org/departments/dchhs/monkeypox.php) as of Friday, Dallas County accounts for the largest portion of monkeypox cases in the state. The Centers for Disease Control reported 815 cases in Texas on the same day. [Dallas expands monkeypox vaccine eligibility, but some are frustrated at limited access](/news/2022/08/02/dallas-expands-monkeypox-vaccine-eligibility-but-some-are-frustrated-at-limited-access/) Monkeypox is a virus similar to the now-extinct smallpox that primarily spreads through skin-to-skin contact or contact with contaminated materials like bedding or clothing. The virus causes flu-like symptoms and a blistery rash that may be located on or near the genitals. The symptoms, which can be very painful, typically start within three weeks of exposure to the virus. The illness lasts about two to four weeks and is rarely fatal. While state and local health departments wait for more vaccine doses, Van Deusen said education about the monkeypox virus will be crucial to stopping its spread. \"We want to make sure people are aware of it and know how they can reduce their own risk,\" he said. Dallas County residents who qualify for the vaccine can call the health department's monkeypox hotline at 972-692-2780. Callers should retry the hotline if the phone disconnects because of high call volumes, according to the health department website. [Worried about monkeypox? Here's "}
