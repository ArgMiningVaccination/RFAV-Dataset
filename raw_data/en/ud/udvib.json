The latest incident raises further questions about the sector's credibility and the effectiveness of its regulatory systems. Several other Indian-made pharmaceutical products have been withdrawn in recent months over quality concerns. On June 8, India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation declared a batch of Typbar typhoid vaccine \"not of standard quality\" after it failed standard testing. The vaccine, produced by Bharat Biotech in northern India, has since been recalled. Health officials said the levels of a particular molecule - O-acetyl - did not comply with national specifications. In its statement, Bharat Biotech said that there were no reports of adverse events or safety issues due to the batch. The Typbar typhoid vaccine is the first vaccine in India to get a World Health Organization Good Manufacturing Practice (WHO-GMP) pre-qualification certificate and is currently sold in more than 50 countries, according to Bharat Biotech. The recall of the typhoid vaccine follows previous controversies involving India's Covid-19 vaccine, cough syrups, and even eye drops sold to the United States. In January 2021, Bharat Biotech, with crucial backing from the Indian government, got its Covid-19 vaccine endorsed by the regulators despite discrepancies in the number of clinical trial participants and trial protocols. The company later said there were no issues with the \"veracity\" of the data that had been used. Repeated quality issues In October 2022, the World Health Organisation (WHO) issued an alert stating that four cough syrups being supplied to The Gambia by the India-based Maiden Pharmaceuticals Ltd were of substandard quality. The WHO confirmed that the cough syrups were [linked to the death of 66 children](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/prosecute-pharmaceutical-company-70-cough-syrup-child-deaths/) due to acute kidney injuries in the country. Maiden Pharmaceuticals denies any wrongdoing. And in February of this year, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recalled an Indian-made eye drop linked to [an outbreak of drug-resistant infections in 55 people](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/alert-cancer-drug-containing-life-threatening-bacteria/), which led to one death and permanent vision loss in five others. As global reliance on Indian pharmaceuticals continues to increase, [these recurring incidents highlight a disconcerting trend](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/indian-drug-factories-face-raids-waves-cough-syrup-child-deaths/), suggesting that quality control measures in Indian pharmaceutical manufacturing may be falling short. \"These repeated quality issues raise important questions about the regulatory oversight and inspection processes in place within the industry, posing risks to the health and well-being of individuals who rely on these products,\" said Malini Asoila of the All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN), a patients' rights campaign group. A report by the United States Trade Representative (USTR), which advises the White House on matters of trade, found that 20 per cent of all pharmaceutical products sold on the Indian market are counterfeit. In May, India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation declared that almost four per cent of the drugs, cosmetics and medical devices samples it tested in April were \"not of standard quality\" (NSQ). Ms Asoila added: \"There is no reason to believe there are not drugs being 'silently' recalled by companies or that they continue to circulate without public getting to know. \"Even though there are numerous instances of the NSQ, it never comes to the notice of the public because there is no recall policy in India.\" She added: \"The formal recall policy should be a priority given the fire India is under for multiple cases of poor quality drugs being exported. \"Given the increasing instances of sub-standard medicines entering global supply it is worth it to put in place immediately a drug recall policy for the domestic market.\" Protect yourself and your family by learning more "}
