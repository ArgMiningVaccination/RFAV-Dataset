About Our Plans - HMO - A Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plan provides health care from specific doctors and hospitals under contract with the plan. You pay co-payments for some services, but you have no deductible, no claim forms, and a geographically restricted service area. - PPO - A Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) is similar to a traditional \"fee-for-service\" plan, but you must use doctors in the PPO provider network or pay higher co-insurance (percentage of charges). You must usually meet an annual deductible before some benefits apply. You're responsible for a certain co-insurance amount and the plan pays the balance up to the allowable amount. - EPO - The Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO) plan offers the same covered services as an HMO plan, but you must seek services from the plan's network of preferred providers. You are also able to access physicians and specialists that participate in the network without a referral. You pay copayments, for some services, but you have no deductible, no claim forms, and a geographically restricted service area. - Combination Plans - A combination plan means at least one family member is enrolled in a Medicare health plan and at least one family member is enrolled in a Basic health plan through the same health carrier. CalPERS requires all family members to have the same health carrier.
