This publication compares covered services, co-payments, and benefits for each CalPERS health plan. It also provides information about plan availability by county and a chart summarizing important differences among health plan types. You can use this information to determine which health plan offers the services you need at the cost that works for you. The 2017 health plan premiums are available at the CalPERS website at www.calpers.ca.gov . Check with your employer to find out how much they contribute toward your premium. The 2017 Health Benefit Summary provides only a general overview of certain benefits. It does not include details of all covered expenses or exclusions and limitations. Please refer to each health plan's Evidence of Coverage (EOC) booklet for the exact terms and conditions of coverage. Health plans mail EOCs to new members at the beginning of the year, and to existing members upon request. In case of a conflict between this summary and your health plan's EOC, the EOC establishes the benefits that will be provided. We recommend that you only use this publication in conjunction with the current year's health premium rate schedule and EOCs. To obtain a copy of the health premium rate schedule for any health plan, please go to the CalPERS website at www.calpers.ca.gov or contact CalPERS at 888 CalPERS (or 888 -225-7377). Other Health Publications This publication is one of many resources CalPERS offers to help you choose and use your health plan. Others include: Health Program Guide: Describes Basic and Medicare health plan eligibility, enrollment, and choices CalPERS Medicare Enrollment Guide: Provides information about how Medicare works with your CalPERS health benefits You can obtain the above publications and other information about your CalPERS health benefits through my|CalPERS at my.calpers.ca.gov or by calling CalPERS at 888 CalPERS (or 888 -225-7377).About CalPERS CalPERS is the largest purchaser of public employee health benefits in California, and the second largest public purchaser in the nation after the federal government. Our program provides benefits to more than 1.4 million public employees, retirees, and their families. Depending on where you reside or work, CalPERS offers active employees and retirees one or more types of health plans, which may include: Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO) (for members in certain California counties) The CalPERS Board of Administration annu - ally determines health plan availability, covered benefits, health premiums, and co-payments. Whether you are working or retired, your employer or former employer makes monthly contributions toward your health premiums. The amount of this contribution varies. Your cost may depend on your employer or former employer's contribution to your premium, the length of your employment, and the health plan you choose. For monthly contribution amounts, active employees should contact their employer, State retirees should contact CalPERS, and contracting agency retirees should contact their former employer. CalPERS Health Program Vision Statement CalPERS will lead in the promotion of health and wellness of our members through best-in-class, data-driven, cost-effective, quality, and sustainable health benefit options for our members and employers. We will engage our members, employers, and other stakeholders as active partners in this pursuit and be a leader for health care reform both in California and nationally.2017 Health Benefit Summary| 1Contents Considering Your Health Plan Choices 2 Understanding How CalPERS Health Plans Work . . . . . . 5 Enrolling in a Health Plan Using Your Residential or Work ZIP to Help You Choose Your Health Plan 10 Accessing Health Plan Information . . . 10 . . . . . 15 CalPERS Your Health Plan Choices Selecting a health plan for yourself and your family is one of the most important decisions you will make. This deci - sion involves balancing the cost of each plan, along with other features, such as access to doctors and hospitals, pharmacy services, and special programs for managing specific medical conditions. Choosing the right plan ensures that you receive the health benefits and services that matter to you. If you are a new CalPERS member or you are consider - ing changing your health plan during Open Enrollment, you will need to make two related decisions: Which health plan is best for you and your family? Which doctors and hospitals do you want to provide your care? The combination of health plan and providers that is right for you depends on a variety of factors, such as whether you prefer a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) or Preferred Provider Organization (PPO); your premium and out-of-pocket costs; and whether you want to have access to specific doctors and hospitals. We realize that comparing health plan benefits, features, and costs can be complicated. This section provides information that can simplify your decision- making process. As you begin that process, the following are some questions you should ask: Do you prefer to receive your health care from an HMO or PPO? Your preference will impact the plans available to you, your access to health care providers, and how much you pay for certain services. See the chart on the next page for a summary of the differences among plan types.1 What are the costs (premiums, co-payments, deduct - ibles, and coinsurance)? Beginning on page 16 of this booklet, you will find information about benefits, co-payments, and covered services. Visit the CalPERS website at www.calpers.ca.gov to find out what the premiums are for the various plans. Does the plan provide access to the doctors and hospi - tals you want? Contact health plans directly for this information. See the \"Health Plan Directory\" on page 14 of this booklet for health plan contact information. 1 Note that in a few counties where access to HMOs is limited, a third option, Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO), is available. An EPO provides benefits similar to an HMO with some PPO features.2017 Health Benefit Summary| 3Understanding How CalPERS Health Plans Work The following chart will help you understand some important differences among health plan types.

As you consider your health plan choices, you should determine which health plans are available in the ZIP Code in which you are enrolling. In general, if you are an active employee or a working CalPERS retiree, you may enroll in a health plan using either your residential or work ZIP Code. If you are a retired CalPERS member, you may select any health plan in your residential ZIP Code area. You cannot use the address of the CalPERS-covered employer from which you retired to establish ZIP Code eligibility. To enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, you must use your residential address. In addition, Medicare Part D Employer Group Waiver plans require you to provide a physical address. If you have a combination of Basic and Medicare members on your health plan, you must choose a health plan that has both Basic and Medicare plan options avail - able within your residential ZIP Code area. If you use your residential ZIP Code, all enrolled depen - dents must reside in the health plan's service area. When you use your work ZIP Code, all enrolled dependents must receive all covered services (except emergency and urgent care) within the health plan's service area, even if they do not reside in that area. To determine if the health plan you are considering provides services where you reside or work, see the \"Health Plan Availability by County\" chart on the following page. You can also use the Health Plan search by ZIP Code , which is available on the CalPERS website at www.calpers.ca.gov , to find out which plans are available in your area. If you have questions about plan availability or coverage, or wish to obtain a copy of the Evidence of Coverage, contact the health plans using the \"Health Plan Directory\" on page 14.Once you choose a health plan, you should select a primary care physician. Except in the case of an emer - gency, the doctors you can use \u2014 and the medical groups and hospitals you will have access to \u2014 will depend on your choice of health plan. Many people find their doctor by asking neighbors or co-workers for a doctor's name. Others receive referrals from doctors they already know. Still others simply select a physician from their health plan who happens to be nearby. You can also use the Health Plan Chooser tool (described on pages 10-11), which is available on the CalPERS website at www.calpers.ca.gov . Before you choose a health plan, you should call the doctor's office and ask if he or she is affiliated with the plan you are selecting and the hospital you prefer to use. Either way, you should confirm that the doctor is taking new patients in the plan you select. If you need to be hospitalized, your health plan or medical group will have certain hospitals that you are able to use. If you prefer a particular hospital, you should make sure the health plan you select contracts with that hospital. See page 15 for a list of resources that can help you evalu - ate and select a doctor and hospital.

Included here are details about using my|CalPERS, the Health Plan Chooser, and the Health Plan Choice Worksheet . Accessing Health Plan Information with my|CalPERS You can use my|CalPERS at my.calpers.ca.gov, our secure, personalized website, to get one-stop access to all of your current health plan information, including details about which family members are enrolled. You can also use it to search for other health plans that are available in your area, access CalPERS Health Program forms, and find additional information about CalPERS health plans. If you are a retiree, CalPERS is your Health Benefits Officer. Retirees may change their health plan during Open Enrollment by calling CalPERS toll free at 888 CalPERS (or 888 -225 -7377) or by using the my|CalPERS Member Self-Service function. Comparing Your Options: Health Plan Chooser The Health Plan Chooser (\"The Chooser\") is an online tool that provides a convenient way to evaluate your health plan options and make a decision about which plan is best for you and your family. With this easy-to-use tool, you can weigh plan benefits and costs, and view how the plans compare based on objective quality of care measures and patient experience. The Chooser is available to help you make health plan decisions at any time. You can use it to: Review health plan options during Open Enrollment. Evaluate your health plan options and estimate costs. Review a health plan option when your employer first begins offering the CalPERS Health Benefits Program. Review health plan options due to changes in your marital status or enrollment area. Explore health plan options because you are planning for retirement or have become Medicare eligible.The Chooser takes you through five steps that provide you with key information about each health plan. At each step, you can rate the plans. When you finish, the Chooser gives you a Results Summary chart highlighting the plan(s) you rated as the best fit in each category. This chart allows you to easily determine which plan meets your needs. Be sure to tell us what you think about the Health Plan Chooser by completing a survey located in the Chooser's \"Results\" page. The Health Plan Chooser provides customized help in selecting the health plan that is right for you and your family. You can find the Health Plan Chooser by visiting the CalPERS website at www calpers ca gov. Under the \"I Want To\" category, select \"View Health Plan Rates,\" and then find the Health Plan Chooser on the right hand side under \"Resources.\"2017 Health Benefit Summary| 11How to Use the Health Plan Chooser Step 1 Estimate Your Costs Your out-of-pocket costs will differ from plan to plan depending on several factors, including how much your employer contributes toward your premium, how often you go to the doctor, and how many prescriptions you fill each year. A chronic illness (e.g., heart disease, asthma, diabetes) can also affect your out-of-pocket costs. When you enter specific information about these variables into the Chooser, you will receive an estimate of how much your out-of-pocket costs will be each year. (Remember that any dollar amounts indicated on the Chooser are estimates only.) Step 2 Find a Physician Unless you moved recently, you probably already have a primary care physician. You can use the Chooser to link to the health plan provider directories, to see if your physician is in the health plan you are considering. If your physician is not in the plan you are considering or if you would like to change physicians, you can search for physi - cians in your area by name or by specialty. Step 3 Review Health Care Quality and Patient Experience Ratings The Chooser links you to important resources and infor - mation about health care quality and patient experience, and allows you to see how consumers rate their health plan's clinical performance. You can consider a plan's overall rating in providing recommended care in key areas such as diabetes, asthma, heart disease and lung disease. Step 4 Evaluate Plan Features On the surface, you may think that all health plans are pretty much the same\u2014but if you look more closely, you will find differences in several areas. The Chooser helps you identify the differences by allowing you to evaluate features in three categories: Help to Stay Healthy Medical Conditions How to Save Money For example, if you smoke and would like to quit, you can find out what type of smoking cessation program each plan offers. If your child has asthma, you can find out about asthma management programs. If you fill multiple prescriptions each year, you can get helpful tips on how to save money on your medications. Step 5 Compare Plan Costs and Covered Services This part of the Chooser provides a summary of your costs for doctor visits and hospital stays, deductibles/ coinsurance (if applicable). To see more detailed informa - tion about your cost for various services, select the common services tabs. For more information about CalPERS health plans and access to the Health Plan Chooser, visit our website at www.calpers.ca.gov . To speak with someone at CalPERS about your health plan choices, call 888 CalPERS (or 888 -225 -7377).12|2017 Health Benefit SummaryComparing Your Options: Health Plan Choice Worksheet An alternative tool we provide to help you choose the best plan for yourself and your family is the Health Plan Choice Worksheet, which you can find on page 13 of this booklet. Like the Chooser, this worksheet can be used to compare factors such as cost, availability, benefits, and quality of care measures. Simply follow the steps listed in the left column of the Worksheet. Several questions can be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no,\" while others will require you to insert information or call the health plan. Some of the information can be found on the CalPERS website at www.calpers.ca.gov . If you need assistance completing the form, contact CalPERS at 888 CalPERS (or 888 -225 -7377). 2017 Health Benefit Summary| 13Plan name and phone numbers: Select the type of plan: (circle choice) HMO PPO EPOAssoc. Plan 1 HMO PPO EPOAssoc. Plan 1 Step 1\u2014Cost Calculate your monthly cost Enter the monthly premium (see current year's rate schedule). Premium amounts will vary based on 1-party/2-party/family and Basic/Medicare. Enter your employer's contribution For contribution amounts, active members should contact their employer; retired members should contact CalPERS. Calculate your cost Subtract your employer's contribution from the monthly premium. If the total is $0 or less, your cost is $0. Step 2\u2014Availability Search available plans online Use our online service, the Health Plan Search by Zip Code, at www.calpers.ca.gov to find out if the plan is available in your residential or work ZIP Code. You may also call the plan's customer service center. Call the doctor's office Confirm that they contract with the plan and are accepting new patients. Ask what specialists are available and the hospitals with which they are affiliated. Step 3\u2014Comparisons How does the plan rate in quality of care measures? See page 15 to find out. Compare the benefits See pages 16-31. CalPERS plans offer a standard package of benefits, but there are some differences: acupuncture, chiropractic, etc. Step 4\u2014Other Other considerations: Does the plan offer health education? Do you or your family have special medical needs? What services are available when you travel? Are the provider locations convenient? What changes are you planning in the upcoming year (e.g., retirement, transfer, move, etc.)?
