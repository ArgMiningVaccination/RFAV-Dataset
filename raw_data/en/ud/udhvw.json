In this article we discuss the benefits of acupuncture for dogs and cats, its safety, side effects, and how to book an appointment. What does acupuncture do for dogs and cats? Western Scientific Acupuncture has researched and built on TCVM over the last 40 years and has helped explain many of the healing actions of acupuncture including: increased local oxygen delivery to tissues, muscle relaxation, stimulation of pain relieving and anti-inflammatory substances through the normalising of the hypothalamus and autonomic nervous system. Most chronic conditions can be treated with acupuncture including: - Chronic pain e.g arthritis, spinal or nerve damage - Behavioural problems linked to pain e.g. lick granulomas - Chronic digestive disturbances - Chronic respiratory disease - Chronic eye disease - Alongside common first-line medical treatments used for cancer, major organ and metabolic disease. The effects of acupuncture treatment are cumulative. Treatments take 30-45 minutes. The number and interval of follow-up treatments varies with the condition; once a week for 2-4 weeks and then wider intervals but the goal is to achieve the greatest degree of improvement and maintain that level with the fewest treatments necessary. Is acupuncture safe for dogs and cats? Under UK law, Veterinary Acupuncture can only be administered by qualified vets and should follow accurate diagnosis of any underlying conditions. Acupuncture is extremely safe and well tolerated by our patients. It uses centuries old techniques that originate from traditional chinese veterinary medicine (TCVM) which aimed to correct an imbalance of vital energies caused by disease in the body. Needles are inserted into acupuncture points where nerves and blood vessels converge, sites called \"Meridians\".
