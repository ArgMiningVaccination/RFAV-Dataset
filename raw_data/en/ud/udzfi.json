Holistic therapy combines traditional treatment methods with additional therapies and non-medicinal services that enhance the recovery experience. It focuses on healing the whole individual: mind, body, and spirit. This approach to treatment is flexible and adjusts to the changing needs of individuals throughout the recovery process. Some of the areas of focus include: - Uncovering the underlying causes of addiction - Promoting physical fitness and health - Boosting self-confidence and sense of self-worth - Reducing the appeal of drugs and alcohol - Strengthening resistance to cravings and temptation Treatments Involved in Holistic Therapy for Addiction Holistic therapy focuses on multiple aspects of healthy living. Some of the most popular activities found in holistic treatment include: - Yoga: This encourages participants to focus inward and channel their energy. With a combination of physical exercise and inner reflection, yoga can be a powerful stress reliever and a healthy outlet. - Meditation: Meditation allows a person to let go of all other thoughts and activities. By focusing on their breathing and clearing their mind, meditation can create an inner sense of peace and calm that can relax an agitated mind and encourage self-reflection. - Massage therapy:Massage therapy can be used to help release tension and stress in the body. Many believe that stress and anxiety is carried in the body and can manifest as real ailments, pain, and fatigue. Massage therapy seeks to release that and encourage healing. - Acupuncture: Similarly to massage therapy, acupuncture is used to release the build-up of stress, toxins, and negative energy in the body. Acupuncture is used to relieve the body of that weight and encourage healing. - Nutritional therapy: Those who use drugs and alcohol often do not have balanced diets. Their bodies may be lacking the nutrition it needs to stay healthy and strong. Nutritional therapy is a way to heal the body and ensure it receives the nourishment it needs to overcome addiction. - Art therapy: Art therapy is used as a way to release stress, pain, and other negative emotions. It can be a way to express thoughts and feelings a person may have trouble verbalizing and can become a therapeutic hobby. Art therapy encourages expression through a healthy outlet. - Spirituality: Exploring spirituality does not necessarily have to be religious in nature, but it can be helpful for many in treatment. Spirituality can help people find purpose in their own lives and connect with those around them. For some, this may involve looking to a higher power. For others, this may be best expressed through energy and balance. There are a wide range of activities that can be classified as holistic because they are intended to treat the entire person and not just the symptoms of their addiction. While a holistic therapy can provide benefits to those symptoms, its intention is to address the underlying root cause of addiction. Holistic therapy seeks to create balance and address potential obstacles a person in recovery might face. Combining Holistic Care with Traditional Addiction Treatment? Holistic treatment is inviting and may appeal to those who are hesitant to enter a more traditional treatment program. Holistic care combines the practices of conventional treatment with new, modern approaches to recovery in order to improve the recovery experience. Used together, these therapies can reduce anxiety about entering treatment and help improve recovery outcomes. Holistic treatment focuses on finding balance and addressing all aspects of life. Holistic care provides healthy outlets, new coping mechanisms, and different ways to express oneself in a productive way. It works well with traditional treatment methods because it builds upon proven methods and enhances the treatment experience. By focusing on the mind, body, and spirit simultaneously, the various aspects of life that may lead to the development of addiction can all be explored thoroughly and thoughtfully. Successfully maintaining sobriety requires a complete lifestyle change and holistic therapy provides a safe environment to begin making those changes early in recovery. Why the Shift Toward Holistic Therapy for Addiction? As more is understood about addiction, treatment methods have evolved to address the complex needs of clients. While treatment focuses on helping a person achieve sobriety, it cannot be the sole purpose of the program. Treating the addiction is a vital component of recovery, but preventing relapse means going beyond that. The underlying causes of addiction can continue to enable the risk of relapse without proper treatment. This makes the growing shift towards holistic treatment more understandable. "}
