In 2007, attorneys representing Amen complained that the article placed him in a negative light that was unfair. Our response included questions similar to those I raised in my article. Here are the questions, the answers we received from Attorney Gayle Mayfield-Venieris of Mayfield & Associates, and my comments about the answers. Question: What evidence is there that patients treated at the Amen Clinics that have SPECT tests do better than patients treated by competent professionals who do not use SPECT? Has any case series or controlled trial demonstrated such benefit? Amen response: Amen Clinics tracks treatment response among its patients. 85% of our patients report a high degree of satisfaction with our services. We are not a typical psychiatric clinic. We typically see patients who have failed 3 or 4 other mental health professionals, and who have an average of 3.5 psychiatric disorders using standard DSM diagnostic measures. No one keeps response rates on such a complex diagnostic group, yet our results are very encouraging. Comment by Dr. Hall: This is an admission that there is no evidence. High satisfaction rates are not relevant to the question of efficacy. I don't doubt that Dr. Amen helps many of the people who consult him. The key question, however, is whether or not SPECT scanning is justifiable for most of them. Question: Are Dr. Amen's SPECT findings consistent enough that blinded observers could agree on the diagnosis from the scan alone? Amen response: We never make the diagnosis from the scan alone. We treat whole people, not brain scans. Having said that, we have a high degree of inter-rater reliability in reading the scans and teach others how to read them with the same accuracy. Comment by Dr. Hall: This admits that their scans have a low specificity, and that they are relying in part on subjective factors to make their diagnoses. Question: What are the rates of false positives and false negatives? Amen response: For which disorders? Children, adults and the elderly are all treated at Amen Clinics. SPECT is a very reliable measure of blood flow and activity patterns in the brain. We always use it with clinical information. If you take our work with ADHD, we have scan patterns that predict with 85% accuracy who will respond and who will get worse with stimulant medication. Comment by Dr. Hall: The answer is \"We don't know.\" And unless it is published for peer review, and replicated, the 85% claim for ADHD remains questionable. Question: Have the effects of different treatments on the scans actually been compared? If so, how and where has such data been published? Amen response: We have published a study on EMDR and have one in the works on meditation. On Amen Clinic's Web site, we have a \" [medication and treatment response section]\" where we list many scientific abstracts concerning before and after treatment with SPECT. Comment by Dr. Hall: Since EMDR itself has not been validated, I do not believe it is possible to use it to validate SPECT results. Before-and-after treatment scans are meaningless until they are put into perspective in a controlled study. If a scan changes after treatment, it should be asked whether other treatments or placebo might lead to the same change. Amen is claiming to base treatment choices on scans, but he hasn't established a firm basis for those choices. Question: What is \"brain balance,\" and how is it measured? Amen response: We measure it through before and after SPECT studies. We look for three things: (i) areas of the brain that work well; (ii) areas of the brain that work too hard; and (iii) areas of the brain that do not work hard enough. We also compare our work through a large normal database that we have. The goal is to balance brain function, such as calm the overactive areas and enhance the underactive ones. Comment by Dr. Hall: The statement above does not define balance or state how it is quantified. Question: What do SPECT scans show that should change how a patient is treated? Amen response: Many things: - SPECT shows the function or dysfunction of specific brain regions implicated with specific problems, such as the prefrontal. cortex with executive function and the medial temporal lobes with getting information into long-term storage. Thus, we can target brain systems, not just vague DSM diagnoses. - SPECT shows unexpected findings that may be contributing to the problem(s), such as toxicity, potential areas of seizure activity, or past brain trauma. This dramatically changes treatment,' such as eliminating the toxin. - SPECT shows potential underlying seizure activity that may be contributing to the problem (often more accurately seen by SPECT than standard EEG, especially in the areas of the medial temporal lobes). - SPECT shows specific target areas for treatment, such as an overactive anterior cingulate gyrus (seen with OCD spectrum disorders) or an underactive temporal lobe (seen in seizure disorders and other disorders such as trauma). - SPECT shows the specific effect of medication on the brain and subsequently how to adjust dosages. Patients often report that SSRI's are helpful but also cause demotivation or memory problems. SPECT studies can show when SSRI's are causing excessive decreased prefrontal or temporal lobe activity that clinical evaluation only hints at. . - SPECT scans helps provide real, demonstrable answers to refractory symptoms and, in addition, helps clinicians ask better and more targeted questions\u2014about toxic exposure, brain injuries, anoxia, inflammation, or infection, that patients may have initially denied or forgotten. - SPECT scans help clinicians prevent mistakes or hurting patients by prescribing the wrong treatments, such as unnecessarily stimulating an already overactive brain or calming an underactive one. - SPECT scans help to evaluate those who may be. at risk for dementia\u2014the brain starts to change long before people show symptoms of dementia. One. study reported that there has to be a loss of 30% in the hippocampus before symptoms occur. Using autopsy data in 54 patients, Bonte reported that brain SPECT had a positive predictive value for Alzheimer's disease of 92% . SPECT scans can help differentiate between types of dementia. - SPECT scans can identify specific areas of the brain hurt by trauma to better target treatment and help deal with insurance, legal and rehabilitation issues. - SPECT scans can often identify a specific cause or reason that contributes to recovering alcoholics, drug addicts, eating disordered, or sexual addicts relapse behavior in their recovery from an addictive process. For example, the patient may have suffered 'an injury in the prefrontal cortex or temporal lobes or limbic system, or prefrontal cortex, each of which could contribute to the relapsing behaviors. - SPECT scans allow patients to have a specific physical representation of their problems that is accurate and reliable. - SPECT scans help develop a deeper understanding of the problem and lead to decreased shame, guilt, stigma and self-loathing. They can increase self-forgiveness. Patients can see that their problems are, in part, a medical problem. - SPECT scans help to increase compliance. The images can powerfully influence a patient's willingness and ability to accept and adhere to a treatment program as they realize they are not taking medication for their problems of anxiety, depression, rage, or ADD, but rather to optimize brain function, an idea similar to needing glasses for their eyesight. - SPECT scans may help families understand when things will not get better, such as having permanent brain damage from an injury, which allows patients and families to accept the condition and provide accordingly. - SPECT scans help substance abusers decrease denial and increase motivation for treatment by seeing the damage they have done to their own specific brain. SPECT scans can help motivate recovering alcoholics and addicts to continue in sobriety as it becomes clear that further use will cause increased brain damage. - SPECT scans. physically show patients, how treatments have impacted (improved or worsened) brain function. - SPECT scans help motivate verbally and physically abusive spouses to follow medication protocols by seeing they have a physical abnormality that may be contributing to their problems. - SPECT scans are useful for. patients who are suffering with a \"post chemotherapy toxic brain.\" It gives them insight into their cognitive struggles and also helps their doctors see what is physical and what might be emotional or traumatic sequelae of having cancer. - SPECT scans allow patients to understand why specific treatments are indicated, which medications are helpful, and why certain medical interventions are chosen. Comment by Dr. Hall: The above list contains lots of claims but little substance. For instance, do we really need thousands of dollars worth of radioactive injections and scans to \"help patients understand\" the treatments we prescribe? Where are the objective data showing what percentages of patients have a better outcome with this information? This reminds me a bit of the ultrasound pictures of fetuses offered at some malls\u2014nice to have for your scrapbook, but not medically necessary or useful.. Question: Does Dr. Amen claim that SPECT can help evaluate the patient's \"soul\"? If so, what gets measured? Amen response: No. Dr. Amen uses the analogy that the brain is the Hardware of the Soul, but has never said he could measure the soul. You can read his book, \"Healing the Hardware of the Soul,\" to get a better understanding of his thoughts in this area. Comment by Dr. Hall: The first chapter of the book is called \"The Brain Is the Soul's Fragile Dwelling Place: The Feedback Loop Between the Brain and the Soul Offers New Answer.\" It claims that the brain-soul connection can \"help The passage in which this claim appears also speculates that \"Mother Teresa and Mahatma Gandhi had optimal brain function\" whereas \"Adolph Hitler and other brutal dictators had faulty brain wiring.\" The book describes SPECT as a \"window into the hardware of the soul.\" The book also promises that \"clinically based brain-soul healing techniques . . . will help you optimize your brain and improve your relationships, work, and spiritual connections in the deepest ways possible.\" It seems to me that Dr. Amen regards the soul as more than an analogy. Question: Why did Dr. Amen leap into clinical applications, writing for the public, appearing on television, and lecturing about findings that most doctors would consider preliminary? Amen response: Dr. Amen started this work in 1991. At the time, other doctors, including academics, were using this technique, including Ismael Mena at UCLA, Nora Milne at UC, Irvine, James Merikangas at Georgetown, and Thomas Jaeger at Creighton. The American Psychiatric Association sponsored all-day workshops on brain SPECT in child and adult psychiatry. Dr. Amen has taught at the APA annual meeting on five occasions. He also started publishing on his work. The Society of Nuclear Medicine has procedure guidelines on the use of SPECT in clinical practice and recommends it for brain injury and dementia, two common uses of the Amen Clinics. Dr. Amen is a clinician and he found dramatic positive results from using the scans. Others were doing the work as well in 1991. Dr. Amen is the most visible because of his writing and speaking skills, and his ability to attract patients. Comment by Dr. Hall: The fact that Amen \"believed\" he was seeing dramatic positive results does not mean that his explanation for what he saw was correct. It is all too common for clinicians and patients to deceive themselves. That is why beliefs should be tested with scientific studies. The APA may welcome Amen's opinions, but its current (2006) Psychiatric Evaluation of Adults Guideline states that \"the clinical utility of neuroimaging techniques for planning of individualized treatment has not yet been shown.\" Question: Do the Amen Clinics use a consent form that indicates what uses of SPECT are experimental? If so, please supply me with a copy. Amen response: Amen Clinics has a general. consent form for SPECT. It states some professionals consider SPECT experimental, but many do not: Amen Clinics has nearly 2,000 mental health professionals who refer patients to its clinics. You can see Amen Clinics' SPECT Consent form in its [intake packet]. Comment by Dr. Hall: The pertinent paragraph in the consent form states: Brain SPECT studies are widely recognized as an effective tool for evaluating brain function in seizures, strokes, dementia and head trauma. There are literally thousands of research articles on these topics. In our clinic, based on our fifteen years of experience, we have developed this technology further to evaluate neuropsychiatric conditions. Unfortunately, many physicians do not fully understand the application of SPECT imaging and may tell you that the technology is experimental, but over 1,000 physicians and mental health professionals from across the United States have referred patients to us for scans. This is not a fair representation of the facts. Doing research that follows a clearly stated protocol that can lead to valid conclusions is one thing. But exposing patients to expense and unnecessary radiation based on hunches is something else. A consent form is supposed to place a procedure in proper perspective. It's true that SPECT has been extensively studied and has recognized medical uses. However, the above paragraph fails to make it clear that many (and possibly most) of the Amen Clinic's scans are taken for nonrecognized uses\u2014such as a \"general brain health checkup.\" The consent form acknowledges that opposition exists, but it implies that physicians who consider SPECT experimental for these purposes are ignorant. It should state that the prevailing medical opinion does not support SPECT use for most psychiatric disorders. The front page of the 20-page intake packet states that the clinic does not bill insurance but provides receipts that may be submitted to insurance carriers for reimbursement. I believe this statement is misleading because insurance companies do not cover SPECT scans for most of Amen's patients. SPECT is indeed approved for a few specific indications, but the Amen Clinic is using it for other indications that are clearly experimental at this stage. The policy statements of [Aetna](http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/300_399/0376.html), [BlueCross BlueShield of Georgia](anGeorgia Blue Cross/Blue Shield d), [CIGNA](http://www.cigna.com/customer_care/healthcare_professional/coverage_positions/medical/mm_0169_coveragepositioncriteria_nuclear_imaging.pdf) provide detailed discussions of what these companies considers proven versus experimental uses. The letter from Attorney Mayfield-Venieris also stated: There is no indication that Dr. Hall has any clinical experience with SPECT or any other experience that justifies her assertions or qualifies her as an expert in this field. On the contrary, Dr. Hall is a family physician and cites no references in support of her opinions. No, I do not have any clinical experience with SPECT, but I am as qualified as any other critical thinker to read the claims on Amen's Web site and recognize that they are not backed up with good evidence. Experience is not an issue; I would not have to have experience practicing homeopathy to determine that it is bogus, or experience doing C-sections to determine that they save babies' lives. Experience can even be a detriment because those who work in the field may be unduly influenced by personal experiences, testimonials, and financial interests, and sometimes it takes an outsider to see things more objectively. It is natural to be enthusiastic about any new imaging or treatment procedure, but initial promises are not always fulfilled. If Dr. Amen's method is not as good as he thinks, he is subjecting patients to unnecessary radiation and expense; if it is as good as he thinks, his lack of rigorous research is postponing the day when it will be generally recognized and offered to everyone and paid for by insurance. There are arguments for doing everything possible to help difficult patients before the research is complete, but there are also arguments for limiting treatment to closely monitored research settings until the truth is known.

The New England Journal of Medicine has published a review article that criticizes the \"imprecisely defined condition\" referred to as chronic Lyme disease.\" This term is used by a small number of practitioners (often self-designated as \"Lyme-literate physicians\") to describe patients whom they claim have persistent Borrelia burgdorferi infection, which they suggest requires long-term antibiotic treatment and may even be incurable. Once the spurious diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease is made, patients are commonly treated for months to years with multiple antimicrobial agents, some of which are inactive against B. burgdorferi in laboratory tests. The authors conclude: Chronic Lyme disease is the latest in a series of syndromes that have been postulated in an attempt to attribute medically unexplained symptoms to particular infections. Other examples that have now lost credibility are \"chronic candida syndrome\" and \"chronic Epstein-Barr virus infection.\" The assumption that chronic, subjective symptoms are caused by persistent infection with B. burgdorferi is not supported by carefully conducted laboratory studies or by controlled treatment trials. Chronic Lyme disease, which is equated with chronic B. burgdorferi infection, is a misnomer, and the use of prolonged, dangerous, and expensive antibiotic treatments for it is not warranted.

FTC expands attack on Trudeau book infomercial.The FTC has charged the marketers of Kevin Trudeau's book, The Weight Loss Cure 'They' Don't Want You to Know About, with misrepresenting the book's contents in their infomercial. [ [FTC charges marketers of \"Weight-Loss Cure\" book with misrepresenting book's contents](http://www.casewatch.net/ftc/news/2007/trudeau2.shtml). FTC news release, Oct 5, 2007] The ad claims that the weight-loss plan outlined in the book is easy to do, can be done at home, and ultimately allows readers to eat whatever they want. However, the plan is complex and grueling and requires severe dieting, daily injections of a prescription drug that consumers cannot easily obtain, and lifelong dietary restrictions. The FTC has already filed similar charges against Trudeau.

In 2004, the Commission sued the same four defendants for making deceptive advertising claims for two dietary supplements and billing consumers' credit cards without authorization. Trudeau and ITV Direct are accusing the FTC of trying to suppress their free speech. However, although the First Amendment protects the contents of books, ads for books are commercial speech that is not legally permitted to misrepresent what the book says. NHS homeopathic coverage shrinking. Spurred in part by letters from prominent scientists, the United Kingdom's National Health Service is reducing coverage of homeopathic treatment.

Homeopathy 96:4-16, 2007] Homeopathy is based on the misguided notion that substances shown to cause symptoms when administered to healthy people can, if appropriately diluted, cure diseases that manifest the same symptoms. During the 19th century, homeopathy's founder and his early followers conducted \"provings\" in which they administered herbs, minerals, and other substances to healthy people, including themselves, and kept detailed records of what they observed. Later these records were compiled into reference books that are used to match a patient's symptoms with a \"corresponding\" homeopathic product. However, the accumulated data are meaningless because no control groups or other statistical safeguards were used to determine whether the symptoms were actually related to the administered substances. Homeopathy relies on provings because the vast majority of homeopathic products have never been tested for effectiveness. [Barrett S. [Homeopathy: The ultimate fake](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/homeo.html). Quackwatch, Oct 4, 2007] The current reviewers, who call provings one of homeopathy's \"pillars,\" concluded that, \"The central question of whether homeopathic medicines in high dilutions can provoke effects in healthy volunteers has not yet been definitively answered, because of methodological weaknesses of the reports.\" In other words, despite more than 200 years of supposed testing, the homeopathic community has failed to validate its basic method of remedy selection. The reviewers call for better designed provings to provide \"results that can be trusted.\" However, because all of homeopathy's \"pillars\" are invalid, it would be more prudent to relegate them to quackery's dustbin. Kansas battling over dubious injectables. A court battle has arisen over the use of phosphatidylcholine and sodium deoxycholate injections for the alleged purpose of eliminating of reducing local fat accumulations. Neither drug has been proven safe and effective for that purpose. In August, the Kansas State Board of Healing Arts voted to consider such use as \"dishonorable conduct\" unless it is part of an FDA-sanctioned clinical trial under an Investigational New Drug Application. However, a chain of clinics that offer the injections (trade-named Lipodissolve) has obtained a court order blocking the ban until the Board goes through a public comment procedure.

The Washington Court of Appeals has issued a mixed ruling (shown below) in the case of Monte Kline and his clinics. In 2005, a King County Superior Court Judge ordered Kline, who prescribed dietary supplements and other products based on the results of electrodermal testing (EDT), to pay nearly $2 million in penalties and attorneys fees for violating the State of Washington's Consumer Protection Act (CPA). The judge also ruled that Kline and Pacific Health Center (PHC), of Bellevue, Washington, were practicing medicine, naturopathy, and acupuncture without a license and ordered them to stop doing so. The Appeals Court concluded: We agree with the trial court's ruling that, although the defendants use alternative practice methods and terminology, their actual practices fall under the statutory definitions of medicine, naturopathy, and acupuncture. But practicing any of these disciplines without a license is not a per se CPA violation. The State failed to prove defendants did not have the level of competence they represented to the public or that any member of the public was even potentially injured by their actions. As such, the State did not prove a violation of the Act. Because the State did not prove defendants violated the CPA, the trial court also erred in imposing penalties under that statute. The Appeals Court ruling wiped out the huge penalty award and instead required the state to pay Kline's attorneys fees in defending against the charge that he had violated the Consumer Protection Act. However, Kline subsequently announced that he would close his Bellevue clinic because the \"unlicensed practice\" ruling barred him from doing EDT. IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON |STATE OF WASHINGTON, | PACIFIC HEALTH CENTER, INC., a PUBLISHED OPINION Filed September 25, 2006 AGID, J. \u2014 The trial court granted the State's motion for partial summary judgment, ruling that the defendants violated the Consumer Protection Act (CPA) because their alternative health care practice, based primarily on electrodermal testing, constituted the unlicensed practices of medicine, naturopathy, and acupuncture. The defendants appealed both the trial court's ruling and the penalty it imposed, arguing the award was excessive. We agree with the trial court's ruling that, although the defendants use alternative practice methods and terminology, their actual practices fall under the statutory definitions of medicine, naturopathy, and acupuncture. But practicing any of these disciplines without a license is not a per se CPA violation. The State failed to prove defendants did not have the level of competence they represented to the public or that any member of the public was even potentially injured by their actions. As such, the State did not prove a violation of the Act. Because the State did not prove defendants violated the CPA, the trial court also erred in imposing penalties under that statute.

Their practice consists primarily of using electrodermal testing (EDT) to detect imbalances in \"Qi\", the Oriental medicine concept of energy flow in the body.1 Essentially, EDT uses a computerized, signal- emitting galvanic skin response (GSR) device to measure changes in electrical conductance at acupuncture points on a person's hands. Based on the imbalances detected during EDT, PHC employees recommend and provide various remedies including dietary changes, nutritional supplements, homeopathic mixtures and herbs. 1Kline explains this energy flow as follows: \"In terms of Oriental medicine theory, there is an assumption that there is an ideal energy flow level on the different acupuncture meridians that correlates with optimum health. And when you have an imbalance which could be characterized as an overenergized or underenergized meridian, that creates a disturbance which . . . ultimately could create a specific health problem.\" On the opening page of their website, PHC asks \"Are you sick & tired . . . of being sick & tired?\" They claim they can help with a variety of conditions, including candida, high cholesterol, allergies, and immune deficiencies. They describe EDT as follows: This revolutionary analysis technique . . . was pioneered by renowned West German physician, Reinhold Voll, M.D. in 1953. Various methods of Electrodermal Testing are currently used by over 40,000 medical doctors in Europe and by an increasing number of health practitioners in the United States. Electrodermal Testing involves taking simple, painless, electrical resistance readings on the surface of the skin at acupuncture points on the finger. The subtle differences in the electrical resistance detected by the sophisticated testing instrument determines specifics such as nutrient deficiencies, food and environmental sensitivities, toxicities, . of various foods, environmental substances, nutrients, toxins, etc. [to] change the skin resistance readings, indicating a 'yes' or 'no' relative to a particular test. These filters, originally in test vials, are now recorded electronically in the computer for simpler testing. The computerized Electrodermal Testing allows the practitioner to test vitamins, minerals, enzymes, herbs, and homeopathic remedies for their \"balancing effect\" on the body, measured by their improving previously poor test readings. Thus, the guesswork of nutritional programs is eliminated. Electrodermal Testing has been described as a method of \"conducting an electronic interview with the human body.\" Not too unlike the electronic measurements of Dr. McCoy of \"Star Trek\" fame, we believe Electrodermal Testing is the health care of the 21st century. PHC offers a money-back guarantee. They also provide clients a form called a \"Superbill\" that lists various \"Diagnostic Categories\" including allergy, P.M.S., fibromyalgia and multiple vitamin deficiencies. PHC's radio program, seminars, and website expressly state that Kline is not a physician or naturopath and that his Ph.D. and expertise are in holistic nutrition.2 They provide prospective clients with a letter stating that PHC is a \"non-medical, complementary health practice\" which primarily uses EDT, which \"measures the body on a different level than conventional medicine tests[.] . . . It is considered an investigational technology. . . . We encourage our clients to have regular physical examinations and appropriate conventional tests from their medical doctor.\" At the first appointment, the client signs a disclosure/authorization form stating that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the GSR device to assess \"nutritional deficiencies, food allergies, the presence of toxins, Candida, Epstein-Barr virus, or weakness of organs or glands.\"3 It also states: I understand that the staff of Pacific Health Center are not medical or naturopathic physicians. I understand that Electrodermal Testing does not fall under state licensure requirements, and the staff of [PHC] function as nutritional consultants, as allowed by law. I do not seek nor have the [PHC] staff offered medical diagnosis, cure, advice, or treatment for any particular disease[,] ailment, injury, infirmity, deformity, pain, or other physical or mental condition. I understand that [PHC] staff will not administer or prescribe any drugs or medicinal preparations. Rather, I understand this program focuses on building health through nutritional balancing, desensitization and detoxification.4 No one at PHC holds any Washington health practice licenses. 2Kline's Ph.D. is a correspondence degree based on a volume of work he submitted over a number of years. 3(Emphasis omitted.) 4(Emphasis omitted.) The State began an action against PHC and Kline on September 29, 2003, alleging violations of the Consumer Protection Act, chapter 19.86 RCW, in three separate counts. Count one alleged appellants made unsubstantiated claims about what EDT could do, count two alleged they misled the public into thinking they were physicians practicing medicine, and count three alleged that the GSR device was deceptive because the FDA had not approved it for their chosen use. On February 7, 2005, the Department of Health (DOH) alleged in an administrative action that PHC and Kline engaged in the unlicensed practices of medicine, naturopathy, and acupuncture. On March 1, 2005, the State amended its complaint to delete the FDA-related count and add three new CPA counts, one for each of appellants' alleged unlicensed practices. DOH's administrative action was stayed, and on August 10, 2005, DOH filed an action for injunctive relief in Superior Court. After the trial court consolidated the State and DOH actions, the State moved for partial summary judgment on the three alleged unlicensed practice-related CPA violations. At the hearing on the State's motion, the State said it was not asking the court to decide whether EDT was a valid modality, but only whether appellants were practicing medicine, naturopathy, and/or acupuncture. The court granted the motion, ruling that appellants violated the CPA by engaging in the unauthorized practices of medicine, naturopathy and acupuncture. The trial judge specifically found a violation of the CPA based on the Bowers decision.5 5Bowers v. Transamerica Title Ins. Co., 100 Wn.2d 581, 675 P.2d 193 (1983). \"Let me just state also for the record, just so that it's addressed specifically, and anybody reviewing this understands that under Bowers I do believe that this court's determination that there has been a lawyer's practice is a violation of the Consumer Protection Act.\" She said her ruling was a narrow one: I didn't think there were any factual questions as to what the practices of the defendants were. So there [were] no factual questions. The sole question that came before me today is: Are those practices then required to be licensed under the statute? And the three statutory provisions that the State cited were ones, as we all know, governing certain practices, either of medicine, naturopathic medicine or acupuncture. I found those acts, as a matter of law, fall under those statutes. I didn't go further than that. And I honestly don't know what's left of the complaint. She \"found as a matter of law, because of the type of practices, that it was a violation of the Consumer Protection Act. We did not go any further than that in making any determination or assessment about the validity or treatments of these tools or modalities.\"6 The court granted injunctive relief enjoining appellants' unlawful actions, but permitted appellants to operate as nutritionists as allowed under RCW 18.138. It ordered a civil penalty of $1 million and restitution in the amount of $701,630.11.7 On November 29, 2005, the court entered a final judgment amount of $1,997,011.40, including civil penalties, restitution, costs and attorney fees. 6At the end of the hearing, after the parties discussed the proposed order, the court confirmed that she was not ruling on the validity of EDT as a practice method: I never reached the merits of this machine in terms of whether it was effective or not, whether it was science-based or not. That was not the issue. The issue was simply were his practices as he prescribed the materials the unlicensed \u2014 or the practice, frankly, within the three statutes \u2014 are [they] actions that should be licensed under those three statutes? That is the sole basis for the decision. . . . 7The court found appellants had committed 9,426 separate violations within the statute of limitations' allowable period on the State's claim. It awarded slightly more than $100 per violation. On September 30, 2005, the court amended the order specifying the terms of the consumer restitution payment, and on October 11 the court entered an order clarifying that it had granted DOH's request for injunctive relief as part of the original summary judgment ruling. DISCUSSION I. Practice of Medicine, Naturopathy, and/or Acupuncture8 We review summary judgment orders de novo, making the same inquiry as the trial court.9 Summary judgment is proper only when there is no genuine issue about any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.10 We consider all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.11 Questions of fact may be determined as a matter of law when reasonable minds can reach only one conclusion.12 8The State has moved to strike portions of appellant's reply brief, asserting that the \"legislative facts\" appellants cite are not facts at all and this court should not take judicial notice of them. They have no bearing on our decision, so we deny the State's motion to strike. The State has also moved for sanctions under RAP 10.2(i) and RAP 18.9 because PHC mailed its reply brief late. RAP 18.9 provides that we may order a party to pay sanctions for failing to comply with appellate rules. The postal date stamp on the reply brief is April 27, 2006, two days after the April 25, 2006 extended deadline. Appellants argue they put the envelope in the mail on April 26, which was still one day late. But the State does not contend that it was harmed by the short delay, and we decline to impose sanctions for such a minor transgression. 9Jones v. Allstate Ins. Co., 146 Wn.2d 291, 300, 45 P.3d 1068 (2002). 775, 698 P.2d 77 (1985) (citing La 85 Wn.2d 154, 531 P.2d 299 (1975); Balise v. Underwood, 62 Wn.2d 195, 381 P.2d 966 (1963)). The first question this court must answer is whether PHC practices medicine, naturopathy, and/or acupuncture as the Washington Legislature has defined those professions. Statutory interpretation and the question whether a statute applies to a particular set of facts are issues of law we review de novo.13 When interpreting statutes, our primary goal is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent.14 We begin with the statute's plain language and ordinary meaning, but also look to \"the applicable legislative enactment as a whole, harmonizing its provisions by reading them in context with related provisions and the statute as a whole.\"15 If the statute remains susceptible to more than one reasonable meaning, it is ambiguous and we may resort to construction aides.16 13State v. Jackson, 91 Wn. App. 488, 491, 957 P.2d 1270 (1998) (citing State v. Tatum, 74 Wn. App. 81, 86, 871 P.2d 1123 (1994)), review denied, 137 Wn.2d 1038 (1999). 14Quadrant Corp. v. Cent. Puget Sound Growth Hearings Bd., 154 Wn.2d 224, 238, 110 P.3d 1132 (2005) (citing King County v. Cent. Puget Sound Growth Mgmt. Hearings Bd., 142 Wn.2d 543, 555, 14 P.3d 133 (2000)). 15Id. at 239 (citing King County, 142 Wn.2d at 555, 560). 16State ex rel. Citizens Against Tolls v. Murphy, 151 Wn.2d 226, 242-43, 88 P.3d 375 (2004). In Washington, anyone practicing medicine, naturopathy, or acupuncture must have a valid current license.17 DOH may obtain an injunction preventing a party from practicing without a license.18 To determine whether PHC's practice falls under any or all of the three licensed practices at issue, we have to determine what EDT is and how PHC uses it. Like the trial court, we do not reach the merits of EDT as a health care modality, but instead only consider whether PHC's practice falls under the statutes. client's initial appointment takes about an hour and half and typically costs $395.19 The client fills out a confidential client information form that asks, among other things, what \"health complaints\" the client seeks help with, whether he has seen \"other doctors\" for \"this condition(s),\" and for current and past prescription medications. During the EDT procedure, the client sits across a desk from the \"tester\" who attaches the GSR device to the client and stimulates acupuncture points on the client's fingers with a Piezo stimulator. The tester takes an initial reading with nothing in the circuit, and then adds many different homeopathic dilutions consisting of foods, environmental substances and toxins to the circuit to determine if the client has energy imbalances or blockages. The client holds \"the negative probe (a brass rod) of the instrument while [the] tester touches the positive probe to the [client's] opposite hand. Correct reading is based upon proper location of the acupuncture point, probe angle, probe pressure, probe stroke and smoothness of the reading.\" The tester then adds various nutritional supplements to the circuit \"to determine if they are prone to re-balance or restore energy flows.\" A consultant does the second half of the testing, \"reviewing the client's health concerns, testing Other Disturbances, Energetically Weak Organs, Toxins, checking specific supplements to design a program, and explaining the program to the client.\" Positive EDT readings are recorded in writing on three different forms. There is a $99 follow-up appointment that lasts about an hour and involves all the same testing but does not include all the explanations. 19Our description of PHC's practice, including EDT, is based largely on their responses to the State's interrogatories. Based on the EDT results for a given client, PHC employees fill out an \"Electrodermal Test\" form listing various specific deficiencies, such as vitamins, minerals, toxins and \"other disturbances,\" including depression, stress and autoimmune problems. They fill out a \"Food Avoidance List\" checklist form listing the foods a client should avoid based on his EDT test. They also give the client a \"Supplement Schedule\" listing vitamins, minerals, herbs, digestive aids and homeopathic remedies the client should take based on his EDT results. PHC employees make the homeopathic dilutions themselves and sell clients supplements and homeopathic remedies. A. Practice of Medicine PHC argues the trial court erred by ruling that they practice medicine. Under RCW 18.71.011, a person practices medicine if, among other things, he or she (1) Offers or undertakes to diagnose, cure, advise or prescribe for any human disease, ailment, injury, infirmity, deformity, pain or other condition, physical or mental, real or imaginary, by any means or instrumentality; [or] (2) Administers or prescribes drugs or medicinal preparations to be used by any other person. No person may practice or represent himself or herself as practicing medicine without first having a valid license to do so.20 The legislature passed Chapter 18.71 as an exercise of the police power to protect the health and well-being of the people of Washington.21 20RCW 18.71.021. 21RCW 18.71.003(1)(2). PHC asserts that they do not diagnose physical or mental conditions when they use EDT to determine the effects of particular substances on a person's energetic balances. They urge us to interpret the statute to exclude holistic, non-invasive health care, contending that a literal interpretation of the statute would cover virtually any service related to the human condition and would nullify related statutes' protections for oriental medicine, herbology, and nutritional counseling. The State argues that PHC's actual practices plainly fall within the statutory definition of practice of medicine. It contends there is no indication the legislature intended to cover only invasive diagnostic and treatment methods used for traditional western biomedical conditions when it regulated medical practice. No cases interpret RCW 18.71.011(1), but an older Washington case provides useful analysis, and several other jurisdictions have grappled with issues similar to ours. In State v. Greiner, the State charged a chiropractor with practicing without the necessary certificate.22 At that time, it was a misdemeanor for any person to practice \"medicine and surgery, osteopathy, or any other system or mode of treating the sick or afflicted in the state of Washington\" without a certificate.23 Grenier had the complaining patient \"remove her street clothing . . . she diagnosed the patient's ailments with the aid of a vibrator; she manually manipulated the supposedly diseased parts; she prescribed a dietary for the patient; she collected a fee; and advised the patient to return for further manipulation.\"24 Grenier argued that her methods were \"adjustments\" rather than \"treatments\" and that chiropractic science was not a subject for State regulation. The court held her explanation was a \"mere play upon words,\" and that chiropractic science was clearly a mode of treating the sick and afflicted. As such it is, by all authority, subject to regulation. To call the method of treatment \"chiropractic\" and the treatments given \"adjustments\" does not change its nature. If the practice has any beneficial purpose at all its purpose is to heal the sick and afflicted, and to regulate the practice of healing the sick and afflicted is unquestionably within the acknowledged powers of the state.25 2263 Wash. 46, 114 P. 897 (1911). 23Id. at 49 24Id. at 51. 25Id. at 51-52. In People v. Cantor, the California Court of Appeals considered whether a hypnotist practiced medicine.26 The relevant statutory components were \"practicing or attempting to do so, or advertising or a holding out as practicing, any system or mode of treating the sick or afflicted, or diagnosing, treating, or prescribing for any ailment, disease, disorder, or other mental or physical condition of any person.\"27 Cantor advertised and told clients he would help with their headaches and weight problems. He tried to hypnotize them, put his hands on their heads in an attempt to relieve their conditions, and gave them instructions for self-hypnosis. He told them he was not a doctor. The court held that the evidence showed the defendant was \"advertising,diagnosing and treating[.]\"28 It further stated: It is our considered opinion that, in the light of the record in this case, the practice of hypnotism as a curative measure or mode of procedure by one not licensed to practice medicine, amounts to the unlawful practice of medicine. While it may be that one day the use of hypnotism may be recognized sufficiently to warrant the Legislature to license that practice, to date it has not done so. To the extent that appellant employed or attempted to practice his hypnotic powers, he was practicing medicine within the meaning of [the statute].29 26198 Cal. App. 2d Supp. 843, 18 Cal. 363 (1961). 27Id. at 845. 28Id. at 849. 29Id. at 850. In People v. Amber, the New York Supreme Court had to decide whether acupuncture fell within the following statutory definition of the practice of medicine: \"diagnosing, treating, operating, or prescribing for any human disease, pain, injury, deformity or physical condition.\"30 Amber argued that acupuncture was a unique treatment method not contemplated by the law and that only \"Western allopathic medicine\" fell within the statute.31 The court described acupuncture in detail based on a treatise provided by the defendant and acknowledged that it was a method and theory quite different from typical western medical treatment. But the court held that \"a statute intended to regulate, limit or control the diagnosis and treatment of ailments must necessarily be broad enough to include the gamut of those known, whether or not recognized and even those not yet conjured.\"32 It stated that it found nothing in the pertinent provisions of the [statute] which exclude, directly or by implication, any manner of diagnosis or treatment which is not embraced within the definition of \"Western allopathic medicine\". . . . Whether actions constitute the practice of medicine is dependent upon the facts and not upon the name of the procedure, its origins or legislative lack of clairvoyance.33 3076 Misc. 2d 267, 268, 349 N.Y.S.2d 604 (1973) (quoting N.Y. Education Law \u00a7 6521). The statute had retained its broad language since it was enacted in 1907. Id. at 269. 31Id. at 273. 32Id. 33Id. Importantly, the court noted that despite the defendant's detailed description of acupuncture, he had scrupulously avoided [ ] the fact that a patient is necessarily involved and that such patient seeks treatment, not out of curiosity but only because he is suffering pain or other physical ailment; that before he, the patient, can expect the anticipated relief from the harmonious workings of the dual forces of Yin and Yang, a diagnosis must be made, if not to recognize a \"Western\" disease, then at least to determine the existence of a disharmony brought about by the disequilibrium of Yin and Yang; that a proper diagnosis or determination necessarily involves an expert ability to palpate the 12 pulses in order to read the condition of the 12 organs and thus determine which of the 12 meridians must be used to convey the Yin and Yang to the seat of disharmony with the object of restoring the vital essence of \"ch'i\", which is described as an harmonious mixture of Yin and Yang. . . .34 The court concluded, \"[i]t may be, in fact, that acupuncture as a separately licensed healing modality is an idea whose time has come. It is not, however, for this court to declare its arrival. That task is for the Legislature.\"35 34Id. at 274. 35Id.. at 275. Accord, People v. Roos, 118 Ill. 2d 203, 514 N.E.2d 993 (1987). In People v. Rogers, defendant alternative health practitioner hooked clients up to a Phazx machine, a computer-based machine which used electrical impulses with attachments secured with Velcro.36 The defendant assessed the conditions of various organs based on the machine's readings and recommended various dietary and exercise changes, along with remedies which she sold to the clients, based on the conditions the machine indicated. Michigan defined the \"practice of medicine\" as the \"diagnosis, treatment, prevention, cure or relieving of a human disease, ailment, defect, complaint, or other physical or mental condition, by attendance, advice, device, diagnostic test, or other means, or offering, undertaking, attempting to do, or holding oneself out as able to do, any of these acts.\"37 Rogers argued only that Michigan's statutory definition of \"practice of medicine\" was overbroad and void for vagueness. There was no question her conduct constituted the practice of medicine under the statute. The Michigan Court of Appeals held that previous court decisions had narrowed the statute sufficiently to make it constitutional.38 36249 Mich. App. 77, 641 N.W.2d 595 92 (quoting MCL 333.17001(1)(d)). 38Id.at 101. PHC mentions that there are obvious constitutional issues in this case, but cite the Rules of Appellate Procedure limitations as the reason why they provide no supporting argument. As in these cases, under the plain language of the statute, PHC employees do practice medicine. They offer services to people with various afflictions and tell them they can help them feel better. Appellants maintain that they merely identify and treat energetic, or \"Qi,\" imbalances rather than actual physical or mental conditions. But they represent that they can help people with arthritis, immune deficiencies, high cholesterol, and other physical conditions. They say in their brochure that they can help with \"problems\" such as candida, headaches, depression, PMS, infections, and osteoporosis. They use EDT to test for nutrient and mineral deficiencies, energetically weak organs, toxicities, and food and environmental sensitivities. EDT is the \"means or instrumentality\" they offer and use to find and advise on these conditions. Based on the EDT results, appellants fill out a checklist identifying a client's conditions, not the client's \"Qi\" levels. They then suggest, mix, and sell remedies intended to help relieve or cure those conditions. As appellants describe it, \"Qi\" is inextricably linked with physical and mental conditions. Further, the \"Superbill\" appellants provide clients includes a section titled \"Diagnostic Categories\" that lists various conditions and ailments including allergy, P.M.S., fibromyalgia, and multiple vitamin deficiencies. These conditions are assigned codes that correspond to classification numbers used by medical professionals when billing insurance companies. PHC's terminology may differ from that of mainstream Western medicine, but ultimately they offer and use EDT to determine, or \"diagnose,\" physical conditions or potential conditions, and then they suggest and provide remedies to address, or \"treat,\" those conditions. They may diagnose conditions by analyzing energy levels, but they still diagnose conditions. As the Amber court stated, \"[w]hether actions constitute the practice of medicine is dependent upon the facts and not upon the name of the procedure, its origins, or legislative lack of clairvoyance.\"39As in Amber, PHC's clients, or \"patients,\" come to them for treatment because they suffer pain or discomfort or some other physical or mental manifestation, not because their \"Qi\" is out of balance. Before those clients can obtain the relief expected from a balanced \"Qi,\" PHC employees must make a diagnosis, if not to recognize a \"Western\" condition, then at least to determine the existence of an imbalance brought about by various sensitivities or deficiencies. 3976 Misc. 2d at 273. Nothing supports PHC's view that the statute is intended to cover only diagnoses of serious conditions or invasive biomedical advice. Nor does anything demonstrate that the legislature intended to include only traditional Western medicine practices in its definition of \"practice of medicine.\" We acknowledge appellants' concern that the statute's plain language could allow the State to regulate many practices the legislature could not have intended to regulate, such as elementary school teachers instructing students on health and hygiene or a Pilates instructor advising a client to hold in her stomach to prevent lower back pain. But those situations are not before us. Using EDT as an instrumentality to determine, or \"diagnose,\" medical conditions in a patient and then recommending and selling specific remedies to that person to address those conditions, are practices that unquestionably fall within the valid police power the legislature exercised when it regulated the practice of medicine. PHC argues that even if their actions fall under the plain language of the statute, related statutes and trends in public policy indicate the legislature could not have intended to require that they be licensed.40 They contend the legislature intended that citizens have the freedom to choose alternative medicine practices. The State points out that Washington does so by licensing various \"alternative\" practices, including naturopathy, acupuncture, and massage. As the State argues, the legislature chose to license alternative health care to protect consumers from deceptive or harmful practices. 40Appellants cite various papers and declarations extolling the virtues and validity of EDT. But the validity of EDT is not at issue in this case. RCW 18.71.030 enumerates 14 exemptions to the statute, including some activities which constitute the practice of medicine, such as dentistry and naturopathy, but which may be performed under another license.41 No one at PHC is licensed in any discipline, so this provision does not apply to them. RCW 18.36.050 lists four exemptions from the practice of naturopathic medicine, including the \"practice of oriental medicine or oriental herbology, or the rendering of other dietary or nutritional advice.\"42 But those exemptions only apply to the identified practices and do not exempt other practices, such as EDT, from licensure requirements. The same logic applies to the acupuncture statute, chapter 18.06 RCW, which excludes from acupuncture licensure requirements dietary advice based on oriental medical theory provided it is not given in conjunction with certain listed techniques.43 But, again, PHC is not merely giving dietary advice. PHC also cites the Dietitians and Nutritionists statute, chapter 18.138 RCW, which excludes health food stores from licensing requirements.44 But the same problem arises because PHC is not merely operating a health food store. Simply because some of their practices taken alone, would not require a license, does not mean they may engage in other activities which require \"idea whose time has come is to allow alternative providers to provide health care for those who increasingly want it without being hampered by regulation.\" They point to other states that have enacted legislation allowing alternative providers to practice without a license provided their actions are not invasive. But our legislature has not yet embraced that policy. Even if EDT as a separately licensed, or even unregulated, health care modality is indeed an idea whose time has come, we must leave that decision to the legislature. PHC's actions constitute the practice of medicine under RCW 18.71.011. B. Practice of Naturopathy The legislature passed the naturopathy act, chapter 18.36A RCW, because it found it \"necessary to regulate the practice of naturopaths in order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.\"45 The legislature defines the practice of naturopathy broadly to include manual manipulation (mechanotherapy), the prescription, administration, dispensing, and use, except for the treatment of malignancies, of nutrition and food science, physical modalities, minor office procedures, homeopathy, naturopathic medicines, hygiene and immunization, nondrug contraceptive devices, common diagnostic procedures, and suggestion . . . .46 Nutrition and food science \"means the prevention and treatment of disease or other human conditions through the use of foods, water, herbs, roots, bark, or other natural food elements.\"47 A license is required to practice naturopathy.48 As noted above, the statute exempts the practice of oriental medicine or herbology, or rendering other dietary practice consists primarily of nutritional counseling and oriental medicine. But they prescribe and mix specific homeopathic remedies based on a specific client's EDT results. They intend that those remedies will prevent and treat the particular conditions EDT indicates are present. They also put together food avoidance lists based on the EDT results. Because they do more than simply recommend homeopathics or render nutritional advice, PHC employees practice naturopathy under RCW 18.36A.040. C. Acupuncture The legislature defines \"acupuncture\" as a \"health care service based on an Oriental system of medical theory utilizing Oriental diagnosis and treatment to promote health and treat organic or functional disorders by treating specific acupuncture points or meridians.\"50 Acupuncture includes, among other things, the \"[u]se of electrical, mechanical, or magnetic devices to stimulate acupuncture points and meridians,\" and \"[d]ietary advice based on Oriental medical theory provided in conjunction\" with certain techniques including electrical stimulation of acupuncture points and meridians.51 Acupuncturists PHC argues they do not practice acupuncture because they do not use EDT to treat anything. They acknowledge that they use a \"Piezo stimulator\" in the EDT process to mildly, non-invasively stimulate acupuncture points and meridians. But because this stimulation merely awakens the points and meridians for measurement purposes rather than treatment, it is not as professional acupuncture. However, the plain language of the statute requires only that the electrical devices \"stimulate acupuncture points and meridians\" to qualify as acupuncture. It does not require that the electrical device actually treat anything.53 PHC employees practice acupuncture under RCW 18.06.010. 53RCW 18.06.010(1)(b). II. Consumer Protection Act The CPA prohibits unfair or deceptive trade practices.54 Where there is no dispute about what a party does in its trade or business, whether those actions constitute an unfair or deceptive trade practice under the CPA is an issue of law this court reviews de novo.55 Conduct need not be intentional to be unfair or deceptive aslong as it has \"the capacity to deceive a substantial portion of the public.\"56 The legislature has explicitly stated which statutory violations are per se CPA violations.57 The unlawful practice of medicine is not a per se violation of the CPA.58 54RCW 19.86.020. 55Robinson v. Avis Rent A Car Sys., 106 Wn. App. 104, 114, 22 P.3d 818 (citing Leingang v. Pierce County Med. Bureau, 131 Wn.2d 133, 150, 930 P.2d 288 (1997); Sign-O- Lite Signs, Inc. v.

Schwab, 103 Wn.2d 542, 548-49, 693 P.2d 108 (1985) (violations of statutes promulgated in the public interest do not constitute per se CPA violations) (citing Haner, 97 Wn.2d at 761-63). In Bowers v. Transamerica Title Insurance Co., the Washington Supreme Court held that Transamerica's closing agents' preparation of certain closing documents constituted the practice of law, and that by preparing the documents the closing agents represented that they had the legal competence to do so.59 The court held that [p]otential clients might readily and quite reasonably believe that Transamerica's closing agents were qualified to provide the expertise that could be expected from a lawyer. Such a belief, though reasonable, is not well founded. In fact, the record is clear that the closing agents possessed no such expertise. Transamerica's conduct was therefore unfair and deceptive.60 The Bowers plaintiffs were damaged because Transamerica's unauthorized practice of law induced them to close real estate transactions without consulting legal counsel, who could have informed them of dangers inherent in the transactions.61 59100 Wn.2d 581, 675 P.2d 193 (1983). 60Id. at 592. 61Id. The State maintains that it does not allege a per se violation of the CPA. Rather, it argues that PHC violates the CPA by engaging in practices limited by law to licensed health care professionals. It also contends PHC has the capacity to deceive the public because, like the defendants in Bowers, they engage in practices for which they represent they have the expertise and training that only licensed professionals possess. PHC argues that even if their actions constitute the practice of medicine, that does not necessarily mean what they do has the capacity to deceive a substantial portion of the public. The trial court relied on Bowers in ruling that PHC violated the CPA. Appellants represented themselves as being skilled in EDT and providing remedies based on EDT results. The State essentially argues that claim alone has the capacity to deceive consumers if the party's actions constitute the practice of medicine. In other words, when an unlicensed entity claims to and does perform some act covered by the practice of medicine statute, he or she is inherently less skilled than was represented to the public. This, the State asserts, is by definition a deceptive practice. But that does not account for people who, although unlicensed, have represented what they do correctly. The State effectively asks this court to adopt a per se rule that any unlicensed person who represents himself as skilled in a health practice modality violates the CPA if that modality constitutes the practice of medicine, regardless of whether his actual skill level matches his representations. That is not what Bowers held. The defendants in Bowers represented that they were skilled in preparing closing documents, which constituted the practice of law, when in fact they were not. The crucial point for our CPA analysis is not simply that they were unqualified to practice law, but rather that the record demonstrated they were, in fact, not skilled in preparing the very closing documents they held themselves out as qualified to prepare. It was not their unlicensed practice of law itself that violated the CPA, as that would be a per se violation, but instead their lack of skill in preparing and advising clients about the meaning of those documents. Here, PHC employees used EDT to diagnose and treat conditions. This constitutes the practice of medicine, but the State has not proved they were in fact not skilled in using EDT. To prove a deceptive practice, the State must demonstrate that PHC employees were not skilled in doing what they represented to the public they could do. Instead, the State relies solely on the fact that appellants were not licensed as proof that they misrepresented their skill level. Bowers is not broad enough to support the State's position. Bowers held that by preparing closing documents, the defendants had represented to the public that they were competent to prepare those documents when they were not. Their false representation of their level of competence was the deceptive practice for CPA purposes, not their unauthorized practice of law. Competence to perform a particular act and being licensed to perform that act are two different things. A party practicing law or medicine without a license does not deceive the public if they do not claim to be licensed and are, in fact, competent or skilled in doing what they represent they can do. Someone who practices law or medicine without a license is not necessarily incompetent to perform the service that constitutes the practice of law or medicine. Under Bowers, the issue is whether that person in fact misrepresented his or her level of competence. PHC represented to the public that they were skilled in EDT and could help people with various problems and maladies. They specifically said they were not medical doctors and did not claim to be licensed to practice any discipline. To prove a CPA violation, the State had to show that PHC employees were not skilled in using EDT or helping people in the manner they represented. This the State failed to do. In fact, the record is replete with evidence that PHC's clients believed its employees were competent at what they did. Further, although the State need not present evidence that PHC's practices actually caused harm, it has failed to produce any evidence that there is even a reasonable possibility of harm. PHC has practiced for over 15 years in Washington. In that time, the State has not received any consumer complaints. Indeed, the only input from citizens has been outrage that the State was prosecuting PHC. The State must at least demonstrate that appellants' actions have a reasonable possibility of causing harm. Because it has not done so, its CPA claim cannot stand. The trial court erred by ruling that appellants violated the CPA. Thus, it also abused its discretion by ordering penalties under the CPA. ATTORNEY FEES We award appellants reasonable attorney fees and costs because they are the prevailing party in the CPA action.62 62 The prevailing party in a CPA action may, in the discretion of the court, be awarded attorney fees and costs. RCW 19.86.040. We affirm the trial court's ruling that appellants engaged in the practices of medicine, naturopathy, and acupuncture. We reverse the trial court's ruling that appellants violated the CPA and its award of penalties under the CPA. We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. _________________________ WE CONCUR: _________________________ _________________________ This page was revised on September 5, 2007.

Performance report on Arizona homeopathic licensing board published. The Arizona Auditor General has released it 2007 [performance audit and sunset review](http://www.homeowatch.org/reg/arizona_sunset_2007.pdf) of the Arizona Board of Homeopathic Examiners. The report said that if the state legislature chooses to continue the Board, three steps should be taken to address three issues that limit public protection: - The Board appears to allow conduct that the state medical and osteopathic boards consider unsafe or unprofessional. For example, it has allowed two physicians to continue to practice although their other licenses have been revoked. The Arizona legislature should consider forming a study committee to determine the best way to help ensure that one board's actions do not negate another board's actions. - Consumers may be confused by a physician holding both a homeopathic and a medical or osteopathic license. As a result, they may not know whether the treatment being provided is standard or nontraditional. To ensure that patients know they are receiving nontraditional treatment, the legislature should require homeopathic physicians to obtain informed consent. - The board's name should be changed to reflect the fact that it authorizes acupuncture, chelation therapy, and several other nonstandard practices that have nothing to do with homeopathy. Because the homeopathic board was actually formed to enable maverick physicians to practice dubious treatments, the recommended measures would offer little consumer protection.

Respondent is subject to disciplinary action under section 10 and section 10, subdivision (b), in conjunction with California Code of Regulations, title 16, section s 311 and 317, subdivisions (p), (q) and (x), in that Respondent's advertising contains misstatements, falsehoods, misrepresentations, distorted, sensational and/or fabulous statements with the intention and/or tendency to deceive the public regarding her chiropractic practice as follows: a. Respondent advertises that she received her \"Diploma in Homeopathy\" from the British Institute of Homeopathy, which program is entirely \"home study\" and a correspondence course. Homeopathy is not taught in accredited chiropractic colleges in the State of California. b. Respondent advertises that the best way to help a child who has an ear infection is to boost their immune system through the use of homeopathic remedies. She also claims that misalignments of the spine will decrease the body's healing capacity. There is no forensic or scientific evidence to support these statements. c. Respondent advertises that vaccines are not proven to be effective or safe and that they weaken the immune system. She further states that cbi1dren vaccinated with childhood diseases are likely to contract those diseases as an adult. This is a distorted, sensational misstatement. d. Respondent advertises that chiropractic adjustments help the immune system to function at 100% capacity. Respondent further states that one may have adequate white blood cells, but without stimulation from the nervous system they will not act. This statement is unsupported by scientific evidence. e. Respondent advertises that the use of chiropractic manipulation and the \"neuro emotional technique\" are effective infertility treatments. Respondent states that the neuro emotional technique is a technique that is invaluable when dealing with infertility. There is no forensic or scientific evidence to support these statements. f. Respondent advertises that the use of \"surface electromyography (\"SEMG\") and thermography can detect stuck patterns of nerve interference caused by sub1uxations. The American Association of E1ectrodiagnostic Medicine states that there are no clinical indications for the use of SEMG in the diagnostic treatment of disorders of nerve or muscle. The California Chiropractic Board states that SEMG should be limited to research purposes and considered investigational. g. Respondent advertises that labor time can be decreased as a result of receiving chiropractic care during pregnancy. She also states that chiropractic adjustments can enhance the functioning of the placenta to ensure that the baby is receiving an optimum amount of nourishment for proper growth and development. She further states that chiropractic care can help with complications that arise during pregnancy and is beneficial in high-risk pregnancies. There is no forensic or scientific evidence to support these statements. h. Respondent advertises the practice of \"breech turning protocol\" during the final two weeks of pregnancy as taught by Dr. Webster. The breech turning protocol described by Dr. Webster is unsupported by scientific evidence. i. Respondent advertises that subluxation may cause fallopian tube malfunction, may result in infertility or ectopic pregnancy, and that endometriosis may result. She further states that ovarian function may also be compromised with resulting problems with egg maturation and egg release during ovulation. Respondent further states that in men, subluxation can cause problems with penile and testicular function, and also with sperm production, maturation, erection and flow of sperm. These statements are false and unsupported by scientific evidence. j. Respondent states that infant car seats lack support of the neck because whenever the car is stopped and then accelerated, their heads go forward and back and side to side, which can cause vertebrae to sub1uxate. She further states that \"emotional and toxic stress, another cause of vertebral sub1uxations, is becoming a bigger issue for kids today as they try to cope with common scenarios like divorce, violence and peer pressure. II These statements are misrepresentations, exaggerations and sensational statements, which are scientifically unsupported. k. Respondent advertises that regular chiropractic spinal checkups during pregnancy can detect and eliminate the restrictions to the baby's development. She further states that because the nervous system controls and coordinates every function in the body, regular chiropractic care starting at birth (or preferably in utero) absolutely helps children to grow up healthier and happier. These claims are misrepresentations, distortions, and sensational and fabulous statements, which are scientifically unsupported. l. Respondent states that it is important for kids to have their spines checked from birth onward and that the only professional qualified to do this is a chiropractor. This is a false, distorted misstatement. m. Respondent advertises that the use of non-invasive Bioenergetic testing can determine which foods and/or environmental factors one has allergies to. This is a distorted, sensational misstatement in that Bioenergetic testing/Meridian Stress Assessment is investigational and experimental, and is not taught in accredited chiropractic colleges as a viable diagnostic tool. Respondent further advertises that the use of chiropractic technique can desensitize a person from specific allergies. This statement is distorted and sensational in that no such technique exists. n. Respondent advertises that\" chiropractors are specialists when it comes to bones, muscle, and nerves.\" This statement is a falsehood, misrepresentation and misstatement in that chiropractors are not specialists. SECOND CAUSE FOR DISCIPLINE (Beyond the Scope of Practice) 12. Respondent is subject to disciplinary action under section 10 in conjunction with California Code of Regulations, title 16, section 302, in that Respondent advertises that she provides the following services: homeopathic remedies, flower remedies, homeopathic consulting, fertility/infertility counseling, allergy testing, bioenergetics testing, hair analysis, Doula & Birth support services, functional nutrition and other services which fall outside the scope of Chiropractic practice. A chiropractic license does not authorize the holder to deliver a human child, to practice obstetrics, or to use any drug or medicine included in materia medica.

Hinson, Esq., 900 17th St., N.W. #900, Washington, DC 20006-2596 INITIAL DECISION This proceeding was initiated on January 11, 1991, when the Postal Service filed a Complaint alleging that the Respondents named in the caption are engaged in conducting a scheme or device for obtaining money or property through the mail by means of false representations in violation of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005. Specifically, the Complaint, as amended, alleges in paragraph 8 that Respondents falsely represent, directly or indirectly, in substance and effect, whether by affirmative statement, implication or omission, that: (a) SST Super Stories is a talk show that regularly features and reviews products and is not a program length commercial; (b) Oncor is recommended by impartial health professionals who are independent from the distributor of the product; (c) Oncor can cure or treat impotency; (d) Oncor can increase sexual desire in men; (e) Oncor is recognized by the medical community as an effective drug for the treatment of impotency; (k) Oncor is safe and non-habit forming for all users; (m) Oncor is recommended by someone who has no reason to be biased. After the hearing, the Complaint was amended to delete subparagraphs (f)-(j) and (l) as duplicative, and to amend (m) as above. In timely filed Answers, as amended, Respondents deny that they make the false representations alleged in the Complaint or that they have otherwise violated the statute. A hearing was held by the Administrative Law Judge on June 12, 1991, in Phoenix, Arizona. All parties were represented by counsel and afforded full opportunity to be heard, adduce relevant evidence, and examine and cross-examine witnesses. Complainant presented the testimony of Thomas H. Stanisic, M.D, Marvin Dean Crothers, M.D., and Postal Inspector Joseph Beyers. Respondents presented the testimony of John Charles Reed, M.D., Tariq Kuraishy, J. Dudley Chapman, D.O., and Peter Spiegel. All parties presented documentary evidence. Both parties presented additional documentary evidence after the hearing, all of which is rejected as untimely. At the conclusion of Complainant's case, Respondent moved to dismiss and the Administrative Law Judge reserved judgement on the motion and asked Respondent to put on its case (Tr. 109). In view of the conclusions reached herein, the motion is denied. During the hearing, Respondent presented the testimony of Dr. Chapman concerning a study that he conducted. However, Respondent did not notify Complainant of this study prior to the hearing in accordance with the Order requiring prehearing witness summaries. Accordingly, that testimony is hereby stricken. (It is also noted that Respondents TWP and the McIlvennas replied to Complainant's pretrial discovery request for medical studies by saying the latter were \"irrelevant, and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\") Notwithstanding this ruling, all of Chapman's testimony has been considered by the Administrative Law Judge in making this decision, and it does not change the result reached herein. On August 9, 1991, the parties filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law which have been duly considered. To the extent indicated below, proposed findings and conclusions have been adopted; otherwise, they have been rejected as irrelevant or contrary to the evidence. The findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth below are based on the entire record herein, including observation by the Administrative Law Judge of the witnesses and their demeanor, the briefs, stipulations, exhibits, and other relevant evidence adduced at the hearing: FINDINGS OF FACT 1. P.O. Box 29012, Phoenix, AZ is controlled by Respondent Sergio and Spiegel Television for Oncor, Inc. (\"SST\"), a direct response advertising agency (Stip., Tr. 7-8). SST is a Nevada corporation with a registered office at 821 Riverside Drive, Reno, Nevada 89503 and a business address of 2714 Pico Boulevard, Suite 200, Santa Monica, CA 90405 (Complaint ##2, 3; SST Ans.). 2. Peter Spiegel is the chief executive officer of SST (Tr. 227). Mr. Spiegel and his partner, William Sergio, specialize in the production of program length television commercials known as \"infomercials\" (Tr. 227-229, CX-7). Respondent William Sergio is both a director and president of SST. Messrs. Sergio and Spiegel direct and control the activities of SST (Compl. #3; SST Ans.). 3. Taylor-Wright Pharmacals, Inc. (\"TWP\") is a Delaware corporation registered in California as a foreign corporation. Its principal place of business is 1023 Edwards Road, Burlingame, CA (Complaint #4; TWP Ans.). 4. Respondent Robert T. McIlvenna is president and secretary of TWP. Respondent Winnie O. McIlvenna is vice president and treasurer of TWP. They direct and control the activities of TWP (Complaint #5; TWP Ans.). 5. The product Oncor is a homeopathic drug which contains avena sativa in the strength \"1-X.\" 6. The scheme to market Oncor was a joint enterprise undertaken by SST and TWP. Their contract provided, inter alia, that TWP was responsible for manufacturing, assembling, packaging, and labelling the product; providing two professional endorsements of the product, at least one of which was to be from a medical doctor licensed in the United States; and providing at least 10 strong customer testimonials (CX-7, #4). 7. The contract provided, inter alia, that SST would draft a production script for a 28 minute \"television show in the format of an infomercial,\" employ a celebrity host, secure a professional television studio, edit the show, pay expenses of persons appearing on the commercial, develop a direct response advertising program for Oncor, analyze all advertising media, and select those media most suitable for direct response advertising of Oncor (CX-7, ## 2, 3). SST would also provide a written estimate of projected sales and inventory requirements to TWP, provide a merchant credit card account, and create a logo and package design for the product. SST retained the exclusive right to the name. 8. Both Spiegel and Sergio participated in drafting the script for the Oncor commercial (Tr. 253-254). SST would not be compensated unless the show went on the air and sales of the product Oncor were profitable (Tr. 237). 9. Under the contract, TWP was obligated to provide legal review of the program. SST hired Kirkpatrick Dilling, Esq., for this purpose and paid for his services with the understanding that TWP would reimburse SST. Mr. Dilling kept both parties advised of potential legal problems with the program (Tr. 235). Also, Mr. Speigel kept TWP advised of Mr. Dilling's advice (Tr. 248). Mr. Dilling ultimately advised them that the program in question was in compliance with applicable law (Tr. 238; SST Ex. A-E). Mr. Dilling's employment was terminated by SST on January 28, 1991 (Tr. 250). 10. TWP provided the individuals who gave testimonials in the Oncor commercial. 11. Proceeds were distributed in accordance with the contract (Tr. 259). Oncor was sold for $49.95, and consumers were directed to either (a) mail a check payable to Oncor to P.O. Box 29012, Phoenix, Arizona 85030, an address controlled by SST, or (b) authorize a charge to a credit card account over the telephone. All credit card sales were made through SST's merchant credit card account. Pursuant to formulas set forth in the contract, SST shared a substantial portion of the proceeds from the sale of Oncor with TWP (CX-7, ## 10-11; Tr. 7, has produced an infomercial on the Bahamian diet and is working on one for the Malibu cookie diet (Tr. 250-251). It produced one for Push Button Weight Loss which was never aired (Tr. 251). Although SST did not produce it, an advertisement for SST, drafted by Mr. Sergio, takes credit for an infomercial for another homeopathic product impotency called Y-Bron (CX-13; Tr. 252). n1 n1 CX-13 was received for the limited purpose of rebuttal of Mr. Spiegel's testimony that SST did not produce the Y-Bron program; however, Mr. Spiegel's testimony on this point is credible, and the exhibit has not otherwise been considered. Respondent's post-trial motion to strike this exhibit is untimely and is denied. Complainant's Expert Witnesses 13. Thomas H. Stanisic, M.D., has been a professor of surgery/ urology at the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center since 1977 (Tr. 12). After graduating from Northwestern University Medical School summa cum laude in 1969, he subsequently became Board Certified in urology. He is currently involved in patient care and research, with a specialty in male sexual dysfunction and impotence (Tr. 13). For the past 10 years a large portion of his practice has been in impotence (Tr. 21). He has published on the subject of pharmacologic treatment of impotence in geriatric medicine (Tr. 14; CX-1). He is trained in traditional medical practice, and has no experience with homeopathic medicine (Tr. 14-15). He is a well-qualified expert in sexual dysfunction and his testimony was both forthright and credible. 14. Dr. Stanisic is very familiar with the world literature in the treatment of diseases of male sexuality (Tr. 26). He performed in depth research in medical journals and text books on the product in issue, and found no reference to this drug as a remedy for impotence (Tr. 21). He finds that avena sativa or oat plant is not recognized in traditional medicine or urology as a drug for impotence (Tr. 22, 24). 15. Impotence is usually caused by either physical or psychological problems (Tr. 23). The latter individuals are treated with psychotherapy or behavioral therapy by a sex therapist or a psychologist skilled in sexual dysfunction (Tr. 23). Physically impotent persons are diagnosed only after sophisticated testing. They may have hormone deficiencies, a problem with blood supply to the penis, or a need for a permanent penile prosthesis (Tr. 24). 16. Dr. Stanisic believes the product in issue is dangerous since a person might delay getting effective treatment for the cause of their problem, which may be multiple sclerosis or prostate cancer (Tr. 27). Also, some people may actually be dissuaded from seeking any other treatment since Oncor is not effective for the treatment of impotence (Tr. 43). 17. Dr. Stanisic's opinions herein are in accord with the informed medical consensus among urologists (Tr. 28). 18. Marvin Dean Crothers, M.D., is a physician in private practice specializing in homeopathic medicine and family practice, and has treated patients for impotence or sexual dysfunction (Tr. 47-48, 52). After receiving his M.D. degree in 1973, he began his formal training in homeopathy in 1976, and started teaching homeopathy in 1980 at the International Foundation for Homeopathy in Seattle, Washington. He is also Treasurer of the Council on Homeopathic Education, which is an accrediting agency for homeopathic courses in the United States (Tr. 48). He is a past president and current member of the board of directors and trustees of the American Institute of Homeopathy (Tr. 48-49). The latter is a national organization of medical doctors and dentists similar to the American Medical Association. Dr. Crothers is a well-qualified expert in homeopathic medicine and was a credible witness. 19. Homeopathy is based upon the \"law of similars\", i. e. that if a medicine produces certain symptoms in a healthy person, that the same medicine will cure diseases which produce the same symptoms (Tr. 50). A typical homeopathic medical examination entails examining all physical and mental complaints of the patient, medications taken, and family medical history (Tr. 51). Factors affecting the symptoms in question are reviewed. Thereafter, reference is made to traditional homeopathic texts such as Materia Medica to ascertain the one medication which most closely matches all of the patient's symptoms (Tr. 51). In view of this approach, the best match for a patient complaining, in part, of impotence may be a medicine which is not even listed as a cure for impotence (Tr. 53). Only one medicine is given since a second medicine might complicate what happens to the patient (Tr. 62). 20. There is very little information about avena sativa in the homeopathic texts, and it is not frequently used (Tr. 53). It has been listed as a cure for \"impotency\" in the Pocket Manual of Homeopathic Materia Medica, Boericke (9th Ed.) (Tr. 64-66), and for \"irregularities of the male sexual system\" (among other symptoms) in Dictionary of Practical Materia Medica, Clark. These are both authoritative homeopathic reference works. However, the texts also list at least 30 other medicines for impotence, and it is the job of the homeopathic physician to evaluate the total picture of that person's symptomatology to find the one medicine that is likely to work. In Dr. Crothers' opinion, giving a single medication like avena sativa to every patient with impotence would not be effective (Tr. 57). 21. It follows that the mere listing of avena sativa in any of the standard, authoritative homeopathic reference works as being indicated for impotence, does not establish that the substance will be an effective remedy for that disease. 22. Homeopathic products are sold over the counter for acute conditions with recent and sudden onset or self-limiting conditions (Tr. 79, 82). Since impotence or sexual dysfunction is chronic rather than self-limiting and is potentially dangerous, it is inappropriate to market a product through the mail without medical supervision (Tr. 56, 82). 23. Also, Dr. Crothers thinks that the product is dangerous since it is likely to be ineffective, and the patient is unlikely to seek appropriate homeopathic care which could be effective (Tr. 56-57). 24. Dr. Crothers' testimony is in accord with the informed consensus among reputable homeopathic practitioners (Tr. 59-60). Respondents' Expert Witnesses 25. John Charles Reed, M.D., is a licensed homeopathic doctor. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1970, he had the equivalent of a residency in family practice and thereafter entered the Public Health Service until 1974. He was a family physician until 1982 in a pre-paid health plan. Thereafter he has been in private practice focusing on chronic pain and stress-related disorders. He uses acupuncture, oriental medicine, homeopathy, nutrition, and psychological therapies (Tr. 111). He is a member of the American Institute of Homeopathy and the National Center for Homeopathy (Tr. 113). He is also a member of the Arizona State Board of Homeopathic Medical Examiners and is a past president of the board (RX-1). 26. He notes that the Pocket Manual of Homeopathic Materia Medica, Boericke (9th ed.) (RX-3), which is used as a reference work by homeopathic practitioners (Tr. 117), lists avena sativa as a medicine for \"sexual debility\" and \"spermatorrhea: impotency; after too much indulgence.\" The Dictionary of Practical Materia Medica, Clarke, lists it for \"irregularities of the male sexual system.\" Dr. Reed considers those references to be \"indications for the use of avena sativa in those conditions\" (Tr. 119-120). 27. Tariq Kuraishy is a consultant to manufacturers who market homeopathic products. He has a master's degree in pharmaceutics from the University of London, England. He is an expert in the actual manufacture and formulation, and the purity of extractions (Tr. 131). He was vice president of the American Association of Homeopathic Pharmacists (Tr. 133). In his opinion, the product Oncor complies with the guidelines of the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States (HPUS), a compilation of standards for source, composition, and preparation of homeopathic drugs (Tr. 134; RX-6, p. 2).n2 Drugs listed in the latter publication have specific criteria for their production and manufacture. The term 1-X applied to avena sativa indicates one tenth of the product weight per volume of the active ingredient to the final form. The oat plant is extracted one part with nine parts of alcohol/water solvent (Tr. 135). He was a consultant to Taylor-Wright Pharmacals when they produced the product in issue (Tr. 137). n2 According to FDA Compliance Policy Guide 7132.15, a product's compliance with requirements of the HPUS does not establish that it has been shown by appropriate means to be safe and effective for its intended use (RX-6, p.3). 28. Joseph Dudley Chapman, D.O., is a gynecologist, teacher, author, editor, and sex therapist. He is an expert in sexual dysfunction (Tr. 150). After receiving his B.S. from Roosevelt University of Chicago, he attended the College of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery in Des Moines, Ohio. He later received a Ph.D. from the Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality, where he is now on the faculty (Tr. 139-140). He is also a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Ohio University (Tr. 140). He has written two books, \"The Feminine Mind and Body\" and \"The Sexual Equation,\" presented many papers before professional groups, written about 100 articles on a broad range of subjects including many on gynecology and obstetrics, and has given many lectures and media appearances on sexuality because of his intense convictions about the subject (Tr. 141; RX-7). 29. He participated in an informal study designed by Dr. Loretta Haroian, Research Director for the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality (CX-4, p. 3; Tr. 155), in California on a homeopathic product containing avena sativa. He performed his part of the study in Cleveland, Ohio. The study began with a questionnaire on sexual history including questions about difficulty obtaining erections (Tr. 156). The people who identified themselves as dysfunctional, including men who had trouble obtaining erections, were asked to participate in a double blind cross-over study (Tr. 157). He had about 60 women and about 28 men as subjects (Tr. 161). Twelve of the original 40 men dropped out early because \"it was not working\" (Tr. 166-167). He does not know how many persons Dr. Haroian studied (Tr. 165). 30. Dr. Chapman has never known what amount of avena sativa was given the subjects in his group (Tr. 171). In fact, he allowed his subjects to vary the amount that they took indiscriminately (Tr. 191). At first, he used avena sativa in a dry, powder form, which he told the subjects to mix with orange juice. Later, he switched the subjects to a liquid form of avena sativa (Tr. 172). By talking with his subjects, he determined that a large segment of the men were starting to have enhanced sexual desire and function (Tr. 143-144, 183). Then he asked these men to participate in a hormone study, which was his primary interest (Tr. 144, 167). Dr. Chapman theorizes that avena sativa enhanced male sexual desire and erectile function by interfering with the binding of sex hormone binding globulin with testosterone (Tr. 146-147), thereby increasing testosterone levels in men (Tr. 176-177). He concluded that the amount of free testosterone increased in all of the final 28 subjects, but that avena sativa did not help about 35% of the original 40 male subjects (Tr. 182, 184). However, Dr. Chapman admits that the improvement in sexual dysfunction may have been due to the placebo effect (Tr.185). Finally, although he maintained written data, Dr. Chapman has never put his findings into the form of a report because he says \"it's still confusing, and I need more research\" (Tr. 173). Dr. Haroian has never made a written report of her findings (Tr. 202). 31. Based on his study, Dr. Chapman believes that Oncor is indicated for impotency, sexual debility, spermatorrhea and nervous exhaustion (Tr. 147). However, when he gave this opinion at the hearing, he was not even aware of the dosage level of the Oncor product (Tr. 188). He does not believe the dose makes any difference, although he says that a \"dropper-full\" daily is the minimum dose (Tr. 190-191). However, the dosage of homeopathic preparations and the frequency of repetition must be individualized to the patient (RX-5 at 38). Dr. Chapman's study lacks credibility and his opinion regarding Oncor's effectiveness is not persuasive. The False Representations 32. In their television commercial, Respondents make the representations set forth in subparagraphs (a)-(e), (k) and (m) of paragraph 8 of the Complaint. The language of the program length commercial which makes these representations is set forth under the representations quoted below. Each of these representations is materially false. (a) \"SST Super Stories\" is a talk show that regularly features and reviews products and is not a program length commercial. 33. Respondent's \"SST Super Stories\" is presented in the format of a typical television talk show. The \"host\" of the show, Chad Everett, interviews \"guests\" while an audience watches attentively and claps at appropriate times. The show consists of three segments, each of which is followed by a commercial with a toll free number to order the product, plus a fourth segment consisting of closing comments and disclaimers. The juxtaposition of material in television advertisement format with material in talk show format reinforces the impression that \"SST Super Stories\" is a talk show rather than a paid advertisement (CX-3). 34. The impression that \"SST Super Stories\" is a regularly scheduled show is made by the name of the show and by several references to Oncor being the topic of the day, implying that the show appears on other days with other topics (CX-4, lines 5, 26-27, 35-38, 528-529). 35. As previously stated, the \"show\" consists of four segments, with a standard television commercial for Oncor appearing after each of the first three segments. The first and fourth segments each have two references to the fact that the program is a paid advertisement. However, viewers tuning in after the first commercial could see two segments and two more commercials with an opportunity to order the product through a toll free number, and they would not see or hear the \"paid advertisement\" language. Even if they saw the disclaimer in the last segment, they may have already ordered the product. The second and third segments do have words appearing on the screen for a few seconds stating \"Results may vary from individual to individual,\" which is a type of advertisement disclaimer; however, many viewers would fail to see this language or would still not realize that the program is a paid advertisement. 36. Thus the above disclaimers are insufficient to dispel the overall impression that the program is a talk show. Since the Oncor program is a program length commercial, Representation (a) is false. The representation is material because it enhances the credibility of the representations made regarding the effectiveness of the product, and makes the statements made by the doctors and audience members appear independent and objective. (b) Oncor is recommended by impartial health professionals who are independent from the distributor of the product. 37. The program contains numerous endorsements of the product by Dr. Dudley Chapman, Dr. Loretta Haroian, and one by Dr. Marguerite Rubenstein. Dr. Chapman received a Ph.D. from the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality (\"Institute\") and is a member of the Institute's faculty. Dr. Haroian is Dean of Professional Studies at the Instutute, and Dr. Rubenstein is both Director of Practicum Studies and a member of the Institute's Board of Directors. 38. The program conveys the impression to the ordinary viewer that these health professionals were selected to be on the show by the producer and that they are impartial. Accordingly, the program makes Representation (b). 39. The representation is false since each of these professionals is closely tied to Respondents Robert and Winnie McIlvenna, who direct and control TWP. Robert is president and a member of the Board of Directors of the Institute. Winnie is the Comptroller and a member of the Board of Directors of the Institute (CX-9; CX-11; CX-12 at 29-30). The representation is material since their alleged impartiality tends to enhance the credibility of the product and induce its purchase. (c) Oncor can cure or treat impotency. 40. The program clearly makes Representation (c) by statements such as the following: So today we're gonna take a look at the subject of male impotence, or lack of sexual desire, or of sex drive, and an exciting homeopathic product called ONCOR, which is helping victims of this problem by stimulating their sexual desire. This product is recommended for men who are impotent, as well as for men who may need a little extra something in their sex life. (CX-4, lines 35-42; see also lines 5-9). 41. In addition, the \"host\" and many guests on the show stated or implied that Oncor was effective for impotence (CX-3). 42. Representation (c) is false. The active ingredient in Oncor is avena sativa (CX-5), and the traditional medical community does not consider that substance to be an effective treatment for impotence (Tr. 21-22, 24). This conclusion is in accord with the informed medical consensus (Tr. 28). 43. Furthermore, although avena sativa is one of a number of substances that a reputable practitioner of homeopathic medicine might prescribe for impotence, the substance is not always a proper treatment. A homeopath does not attempt to cure or treat a single symptom such as impotence in isolation. Instead, he treats the patient as a whole. A typical homeopathic medical examination entails examining all physical and mental complaints of the patient, medications taken, and family medical history (Tr. 51). Thereafter, reference is made to traditional homeopathic texts such as Materia Medica to ascertain the one medication which most closely matches all of the patient's symptoms (Tr. 51). In view of this approach, the best match for a patient complaining, in part, of impotence may be a medicine which is not even listed as a cure for impotence (Tr. 53). 44. There is very little information about avena sativa in the homeopathic texts, and it is not frequently used (Tr. 53). It has been listed as a cure for \"impotency\" in the Pocket Manual of Homeopathic Materia Medica, Boericke (9th Ed.) (Tr. 64-66), and for \"irregularities of the male sexual system\" (among other symptoms) in Dictionary of Practical Materia Medica, Clark. However, the texts also list at least 30 other medicines for impotence, and it is the job of the homeopathic doctor to evaluate the total picture of that person's symptomatology to find the one medicine that is likely to work. It is the informed consensus among reputable homeopathic doctors that giving a single medication like avena sativa to every patient with impotence would not be effective (Tr. 57, 59-60). Accordingly, Representation (c) is materially false. (d) Oncor can increase sexual desire in men. 45. This representation is made during the program by statements such as the following: So today we're going to take a look at the subject of male impotence and lack of sexual desire or of sex drive and an exciting homeopathic product called \"ONCOR\" which is helping victims of this problem by stimulating their sexual desire. (CX-4, lines 5-9; also 38-40) . . . It seems to enhance in three areas: the first is libido, or sexual desire; the second is sexual performance, or the ability to have an erection; and the third is sexual sensation, or the feeling of pleasure. (CX-4, lines 118-121) 46. Representation (d) is materially false for the same reasons stated above with respect to Representation (c). (e) Oncor is recognized by the medical community as an effective drug for the treatment of impotency. 47. The program makes this representation through the statements of Doctors Haroian, Chapman, and Rubenstein, who are introduced as medical experts. Dr. Haroian states that \"According to the Homeopathic Materia Medica, the active ingredient in ONCOR is indicated in situations of impotence, sexual debility, and nervous exhaustion.\" Dr. Chapman states: Anyone who is impotent or can't get an erection can try it before he tries more dramatic measures. If there isn't some physical reason (as I said before), any man who suffers from lack of sexual desire or lack of sex drive can try \"ONCOR\" to get things going again. [CX-4 at 245-249; see also 291-308] 48. Dr. Rubenstein, described as a leading sex therapist, states: And I can see Oncor as a product that, for some people, can make a difference. It can enhance your sexuality, your orgasms, erections, arousal, it can increase libido, it can make you feel good about your sexuality again. And that's a lot to say about a product. Oncor is a good product and I'm going to continue to recommend it. 49. For the reasons stated above with respect to Representations (c) and (d), Representation (e) is materially false. (k) Oncor is safe and non-habit forming for all users. 50. This representation is made by the language \"Oncor is a male potency formula that, taken as directed, can be a safe and effective approach for some forms of non-organic impotence\" (CX-4, lines 175-177). Moreover, the representation is implied in such an advertisement for a medical treatment. 51. Representation (k) is materially false since many users of Oncor would not be helped, and taking the drug would cause them to delay seeking help for the cause of their problem. Some of these people may have serious conditions such as diabetes, prostate cancer, or multiple sclerosis (Tr. 27, 43, 56-57, 90). However, since Dr. Stanisic is not an expert in alcoholism, his opinion that 20 drops twice a day of the product, which contains alcohol, would be a problem for an alcoholic, is rejected. Since there is no credible evidence that Oncor is habit forming, Representation (k) is only partially false. (m) Oncor is recommended by someone who has no reason to be biased. 52. One of the primary \"guests\" on the program is Ray McIlvenna, who is portrayed as an ordinary consumer who has had a positive experience with the product and who highly recommends it to viewers. He was seated on stage with the medical experts. The program gives the impression that Ray McIlvenna has no reason to be biased in favor of the product. 53. Representation (m) is materially false. Ray McIlvenna is a close relative of Respondent Robert \"Ted\" McIlvenna, the manufacturer of the product, and they are both on the Board of Directors of the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality (CX-11, CX-12 at 30; Tr. 255-257). Thus Ray McIlvenna is not an ordinary consumer and the program should have disclosed that he has a reason to be biased. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 1. (a) The meaning of an advertisement is to be determined in light of the probable impact of this material on a person of ordinary mind. Donaldson v. Read Magazine, 333 U.S. 178, 189 (1948); Peak Laboratories, Inc. v. U.S. Postal Serv., 556 F.2d 1387, 1389 (5th Cir. 1977). The statute is intended to protect the gullible, naive, and less critical viewer, as well as the more sophisticated, wary viewer. Fields v. Hannegan, 162 F.2d 17 (D.C. Cir. 1947), cert. denied, 332 U.S. 773 (1947); M.K.S. Enterprises, Inc. v. Service, F. Supp. 1180, 1184 (E.D.N.Y. [P.S. Docket No. 19/185](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1986deci/19-185.htm) (P.S.D. July 10, 1986). Express misrepresentations are not required. It is the net impression which the advertisement is likely to make upon individuals to whom it is directed which is important, and even if an advertisement is so worded as not to make an express representation, if it is artfully designed to mislead those responding to it, the false representation statute is applicable. G.J. Howard Co. v. Cassidy, 162 F. Supp. 568 (E.D.N.Y. 1958); See also, Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748 (1976). (b) Where an advertisement is ambiguous or capable of more than one meaning, if one of those meanings is false, the advertisement will be held to be misleading. Rhodes Pharmacal Co. v. F.T.C., 208 F.2d 382, 387 (7th Ralph J. Galliano, [P.S. Docket No. 19/15](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1985deci/19-15.htm) (P.S.D. May 2, 1985 at p. 9). It is not difficult to select words that will not deceive. See, United States v. 95 Barrels of Vinegar, 265 U.S. 438 (1924). (c) An inconspicuous disclaimer is not sufficient to dispel the effect of false representations. [redacted], supra; Gottlieb v. Schaffer, supra. (d) The Administrative Law Judge can determine whether the representations are made, their effect on the ordinary mind, and materiality without the assistance of lay or expert testimony. Standard Research Labs, [P.S. Docket No. 7/78](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1980deci/7-78.htm) (P.S.D. Oct. 27, P.S. Docket 16/120-121, 31, F. Supp. rev'd on other grounds, 256 F.2d 681 (2nd Cir. 1958). 2. Applying the foregoing standards, I find that Respondents' advertisements make the representations alleged in ## 8(a)-(e), (k), and (m) of the Complaint. The language and other matter contained in the television program which directly or impliedly makes these representations is described in the findings of fact. 3. As set forth in the findings of fact, the representations set forth in subparagraphs (a)-(e) and (m) of paragraph 8 of the Complaint are false. Representation (k) is partially false. 4. Complainant established through the credible and forthright testimony of Drs. Stanisic and Crothers that the informed consensus among both allopathic and homeopathic doctors is that Oncor is ineffective for the treatment of impotence and lack of sexual desire. Accordingly, it is encumbent upon Respondents to produce persuasive evidence proving the consensus to be in error. Standard Research Laboratories, [P.S. Docket No. 7/48](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1980deci/7-48.htm) (P.S.D. April 4, 1980). Respondents have failed to produce such persuasive evidence. Respondent's expert, Dr. Reed, did not even testify as to the effectiveness of the product, but merely noted that the homeopathic texts \"indicated\" the use of avena sativa for impotence and \"sexual debility.\" As stated previously, the testimony of Dr. Chapman about his \"study\" has been rejected due to the failure of Respondents to inform Complainant of this study prior to the hearing. However, even if this testimony were considered, it would not persuade the Administrative Law Judge that the informed consensus is in error. In this regard, the study was neither reliable nor scientific, and Dr. Chapman was not a credible witness. 5. The fact that Respondents may have relied upon the advice of counsel is not a defense to an action under 39 U.S.C \u00a7 3005, where it is not necessary to prove scienter, or an intent to deceive, to establish a violation of the statute. Lynch v. Blount, 330 F. Supp. 689, 693 (S.D.N.Y. 1971). 6. The representations made by Respondent are material because they have a tendency to persuade viewers to order and pay for Respondent's product. 7. Since the Respondents Taylor Wright Pharmacals, Inc. and Sergio and Spiegel Television for Oncor, Inc. were in a joint venture for the sale of Oncor, and remittances were solicited through the mail, the jurisdiction of the Postal Service under 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005 is established for all respondents connected with the scheme, including the principals of the corporations. 8. Complainant has established its case by a preponderance of the reliable and probative evidence of record. S.E.C. v. Savoy Industries, Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1168 (D.C. Cir. 1978). 9. Respondents are engaged in the conduct of a scheme for obtaining remittances of money through the mail by means of materially false representations in violation of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005. 10. Accordingly, the attached False Representation Order and Cease and Desist Order should be issued. This page was posted on April 19, 2007.

Hinson, Esq. | 900 17th St., N.W., #900 Washington, DC 20006-2596 POSTAL SERVICE DECISION Respondents William Sergio, Peter Spiegel, and Sergio & Spiegel Television For Oncor, Inc. (collectively referred to as Respondents SST) and Respondents Taylor-Wright Pharmacals, Inc. and Robert T. and Winnie O. McIlvenna (collectively referred to as Respondents TWP) have filed separate appeals from an Initial Decision of an Administrative Law Judge which concluded that both sets of Respondents are engaged in a scheme or device for obtaining money or property through the mail by means of materially false representations in violation of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005. Complainant opposes Respondents' appeals. Background The General Counsel of the United States Postal Service (Complainant) initiated this proceeding by filing a Complaint, subsequently amended, alleging that Respondents, by the use of a program-length television advertisement sometimes known as an infomercial, [1/](#psdser%20fn-1) are engaged in a scheme or device for obtaining money or property through the mail by means of materially false representations in violation of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005. Specifically, Complainant alleges in Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Amended Complaint (hereinafter referred to as Complaint) that Respondents falsely represent: \"a. SST Super Stories is a talk show that regularly features and reviews products and is not a program length commercial; b. Oncor is recommended by impartial health professionals who are independent from the distributor of the product; c. Oncor can cure or treat impotency; d. Oncor can increase sexual desire in men; e. Oncor is recognized by the medical community as an effective drug for the treatment of impotency; * * * * * k. Oncor is safe and nonhabit forming for all users; * * * * * m. Oncor is recommended by someone who has no reason to be biased.\" [2/](#psdser%20fn-2) Respondents filed answers which, as amended, denied they make the representations alleged the Complaint or that those representations are materially false. Following a hearing at which the parties presented witness testimony and introduced documentary evidence, the Administrative Law Judge issued an Initial Decision in which he concluded that Respondents make the representations alleged in the Complaint. With the exception of a portion of the representation alleged in Paragraph 8(k) of the Complaint, the Administrative Law Judge found that all of the representations are materially false. As a result, the Administrative Law Judge concluded that Respondents are conducting a scheme for obtaining money through the mail by means of materially false representations in violation of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005 and that the cease and desist order attached to the Initial Decision should be issued against all Respondents. Respondents SST and TWP have filed two separate appeals in which they take issue with the Administrative Law Judge's findings and conclusions and the recommendation for issuance of the proposed cease and desist order attached to the Initial Decision. Exceptions and Discussion I. EXCEPTIONS OF RESPONDENTS SST SST first contends that the Administrative Law Judge incorrectly concluded that the infomercial in issue does not adequately inform the viewer that it is a program length commercial advertising the sale of the product Oncor. Complainant counters that the Administrative Law Judge properly relied on the commercial itself in arriving at the conclusion that it falsely represents that it is a talk show which regularly features and reviews products, rather than a program length commercial. The Administrative Law Judge correctly concluded that the infomercial does not adequately inform the viewer that it is a program length commercial. The format and content of the infomercial would most probably lead the ordinary viewer to believe that the program is a regularly scheduled talk show that features and reviews products. The disclaimers included in the program are not sufficiently prominent or strategically placed during the course of the program to put ordinary viewers on notice that they are watching a commercial (Exhs. CX-3 & -4). [3/](#psdser%20fn-3) Thus, for the reasons stated in the Initial Decision, the Administrative Law Judge did not err in concluding that the representation in Paragraph 8(a) of the Complaint is made by Respondents' advertising. SST's primary contention on appeal is that the Administrative Law Judge erred in concluding that a cease and desist order should be issued in this proceeding (I.D., Conclusions of Law (COL) \u00b6 10). In support of this contention, SST asserts that a cease and desist order is similar to an injunction and should only be issued where there has been a knowing and persistent violation of the false representation statute. According to Respondents SST, since they relied on the advice of counsel that their infomercial was in compliance with all federal advertising requirements, they cannot be found to have intended to violate the Postal Service statute. In addition, SST contends that no evidence was presented establishing that they purposely engaged in a generalized scheme to violate \u00a7 3005, engaged in other past illegal conduct, or are likely to engage in any illegal conduct in the future. Complainant asserts that factors such as intent and the likelihood of future violations should not be considered in determining whether SST has violated 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005 or whether a cease and desist order should be issued. Even if the likelihood of future violations is considered, however, Complainant contends that Respondents SST have not satisfied their burden of presenting evidence showing that they are unlikely to engage in such future violations. Under 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005(a)(3), a cease and desist order may be issued when evidence satisfactory to the Postal Service establishes that a person is engaged in conducting a scheme or device for obtaining money or property through the mail by means of false representations. Such cease and desist orders have been routinely issued against businesses and individuals responsible for making false representations in order to protect the public from future false representation schemes. See Pub. L. 98-186, 97 Stat. 1315 (1983); 1983 U.S. Code Cong. and Admin. News, p. 2014 (for legislative history on purpose of 1983 amendment to \u00a7 3005). See also FTC v. Standard Educ. Soc'y, 302 112, 119-210 20, 1992), aff'd, (P.S.D. July 24, 1992); United Savers of Am., [P.S. Docket No. 33/98](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1991deci/33-98.htm) at 4 (P.S.D. June 7, 1991); W.G. Charles Co., P.S. Docket Nos. 19/105, et al. at 43-44 (P.S.D. Sept. 30, 1985). Although SST contends that case law involving the issuance of injunctions is also applicable to the issuance of cease and desist orders, and would preclude SST's inclusion in any cease and desist order issued in this proceeding, we do not agree. The statutory policy of protecting the public from future violations of the Postal false representation law distinguishes a cease and desist order issued under 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005 from the more limited focus of the typical injunction. Thus, because the public interest is involved, we have not relied on the cases cited by SST which pertain to the issuance of injunctions. Since the Administrative Law Judge determined that all of the Respondents including SST were responsible for the false representations alleged in the Complaint, he did not err in including SST in the cease and desist order which he recommended for issuance in this proceeding. As Complainant contends, a showing of intent to deceive is no longer required in order to establish that a violation of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005 has occurred. See United States v. International Term Papers, Inc., 477 F.2d 1277, 1280 (1st Cir. 1973); M.K.S. F. Supp. 1180, 1971), aff'd, 404 U.S. Products, Inc., [P.S. Docket No. 28/90](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1990deci/28-90.htm) at 10 (P.S.D. June 27, 1990). Therefore, advertising which involves misrepresentations, even though innocent and based on the advice of counsel, is considered to be a false representation scheme and the basis for issuance of a cease and desist order under 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005. See Athena Products, Ltd., [P.S. Docket No. 7/99](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1981deci/7-99.htm) at 36 (P.S.D. June 26, 1981); U.S. Zip Code Service, [P.S. Docket No. 2/171](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1974deci/2-171.htm) at 7 (P.S.D. April 15, 1974). Similarly, where a party has been found to have been engaged in a false representation scheme, factors such as that party's good faith, past practices or the likelihood of future violations will not serve as a basis for denying the issuance of a cease and desist order, unless a strong showing of a change in circumstances has been made which will assure that the public is protected from future misconduct. Such a showing has not been made by SST in this case. Cf. Professional Opportunity Magazine, Inc., [P.S. Docket No. 33/55](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1990deci/33-55.htm) at 6 (P.S.D. Sept. 14, 1990); The New Body Boutique, Inc., [P.S. Docket No. 11/95](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1983deci/11-95.htm) at 5 (P.S.D. Jan. 12, 1983); Conan Research, [P.S. Docket No. 12/7](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1982deci/12-7.htm) at 3 (P.S.D. July 29, 1982). Accordingly, even though SST may not have intended to violate the Postal false representation statute and sought legal advice in connection with the formulation of the Oncor commercial, the Administrative Law Judge did not err in concluding that a violation of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005 has occurred, that a cease and desist order should be issued and that SST should be included in the order. SST additionally complains that Paragraph III, subparagraphs 1, 2 and 6, of the proposed cease and desist order are overly broad and unjustifiably vague, [4/](#psdser%20fn-4) and therefore, violate their First Amendment right to engage in commercial speech. According to SST, the need for greater specificity is particularly important in a Postal false representation case because of the civil penalties which may be assessed under 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3012. SST also contends that a cease and desist order should not be issued because there are no guidelines for determining when a advertisement is misleading and it is improper to leave such determinations to a case-by-case determination by an Administrative Law Judge. Complainant asserts that the Postal Service has authority to issue cease and desist orders prohibiting future false representations and that such false representations are not entitled to First Amendment protection. In addition, Complainant contends that the proposed provisions of the cease and desist order are sufficiently specific to place SST on notice of the conduct prohibited and, in the event SST is uncertain of their meaning and application to future advertisements, they may seek an advisory opinion from the Postal Service's General Counsel. As Complainant contends, the Postal Service is authorized by 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005 to issue cease and desist orders limiting future misconduct, [5/](#psdser%20fn-5) and this authority is not limited by the absence of specific Postal Service regulations. Rather, court and administrative decisions [6/](#psdser%20fn-6) provide sufficient guidance to prospective advertisers on what constitutes a false representation, and what, if any, disclaimers may be sufficient to alert the ordinary reader to the true import of advertising solicitations. Cf. Ron Cooper, [P.S. Docket No. 35/112](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1992deci/35-112.htm) at 6 (P.S.D. Feb. 7, 1992), aff'd, (P.S.D. Mar. 20, 1992). Moreover, there is no impropriety in having an Administrative Law Judge and the Judicial Officer serve as the triers of fact and decide on a case-by-case basis [7/](#psdser%20fn-7) what constitutes a false representation. As SST itself points out, the distinction between deceptive and nondeceptive advertising may require resolution of exceedingly complex and technical factual issues and the consideration of nice questions of semantics. These questions can most appropriately be answered on a case-by-case basis by the Postal Service Administrative Law Judges and the Judicial Officer, who are charged with the responsibility for making factual and legal determinations in cases arising under the Postal false representation law. Thus, the absence of regulations providing guidance to advertisers or the fact that the falsity of representations is determined by an Administrative Law Judge and the Judicial Officer does not infringe on SST's First Amendment rights nor deprive SST of due process of law. As SST recognizes, false commercial advertising is not protected by the First Amendment. [8/](#psdser%20fn-8) Further, cease and desist orders containing broad provisions, commonly referred to as fencing-in provisions, have been consistently upheld when (1) they are reasonably related to the unlawful act found to exist, Jacob Spiegel Co. v. FTC, 327 U.S. 608, 613 (1946), and (2) there is a likelihood, based on the violator's past conduct, that he will commit additional violations. American Home Products Corp. v. FTC, 695 F.2d 681, 705-06 (3d Cir. 1983). See also FTC v. Mandel Bros., Inc., 359 U.S. 385, 392-93 (1959); FTC v. National Lead Co., 352 U.S. 419, 430 (1957); FTC v. Ruberoid Co., 343 U.S. 470, 473 (1952); American Genealogies, Inc. v. USPS, 717 Docket No. 29/117](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1989deci/29-117.htm) at 5 (P.S.D. Mar. 16, 1989). Clearly, a reasonable relationship exists between the provisions proposed in the cease and desist order and the prior materially false representations made by SST in the Oncor infomercial. Moreover, SST is in the business of producing infomercials (Tr. 228-31 & 250-51) without regard to the product involved, and the terms of the cease and desist order are intended to preclude the use of infomercialt to misrepresent any product SST may be involved in promoting. Thus, the inclusion in the cease and desist order of the prohibition against representing that a commercial is something other than a commercial, i.e. a regularly scheduled television program; a product is recommended by impartial experts; or that a product is endorsed by someone who is unbiased, all of which were falsely represented in the Oncor infomercial, are related and reasonable restrictions on SST's future advertising. [9/](#psdser%20fn-9) Further, while there is no proof that SST has engaged in any other false representation scheme or that it will commit future violations of the Postal Service statute, the fact that SST previously falsely represented a health care product and continues to be in the business of producing infomercials establishes that there is a likelihood SST will commit future violations (I.D., Findings of Fact (FOF) \u00b6 \u00b6 16, 23 & 50-51). Moreover, SST and not Complainant, bears a heavy burden to establish that there is no danger of recurrent violation. See Finderhood, Inc., at 17 (P.S.D. Mar. 20, 1992); Professional Opportunity Magazine, Inc., at 6 (P.S.D. Sept. 14, 1990), and cases cited therein. Absent a showing of a change in circumstances which would make a resumption of the practice impractical or impossible, SST has not satisfied this burden/ Id. See also United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Ass'n., Inc., 393 U.S. 199, 203-04 (1968); United States v. Oregon State Medical Soc'y, 343 U.S. 326, 333-34 (1952). We are also not persuaded that greater specificity in the terms of the cease and desist order is required because of the possible imposition of civil penalties under 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3012. The order's provisions need only be as specifjc as the circumstances permit. See Colgate-Palmolive Co., 380 U.S. at 392-93; American Home Products Corp., 695 F.2d at 704-05. In this proceeding, the proposed provisions of the cease and desist order clearly place SST on notice of the false representations they are prevented from making and SST should have no difficulty applying those provisions to their future commercials. As has often been held, \"[i]t is not difficult to chopse statements, designs, and devices which will not deceive.\" [10/](#psdser%20fn-10) United States v. 95 Barrels of Vinegar, 265 U.S. 438, 443 (1924); Finderhood, Inc., at 8 (P.S.D. July 24, 1992). See also Paul, Marbin & Co., Inc., [P.S. Docket No. 28/190](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1989deci/28-190.htm) at 13-14 (P.S.D. Oct. 20, 1989); Card Redemption Center, [P.S. Docket No. 30/37](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1989deci/30-37.htm) at 10 (P.S.D. July 27, 1989). Accordingly, it is determined that the proposed provisions of the cease and desist order are reasonably calculated to prevent false representations similar to those previously made or likely to be made. Thus, the proposed cease and desist osder does not infringe on SST's First Amendment rights, is not so vague as to be in violation of the Due Process Clause, and is a reasonable implementation of the Postal false representation statute. SST's exceptions on appeal are therefore denied. II. EXCEPTIONS OF RESPONDENTS TWP TWP has listed a number of findings of fact and conclusions of law to which they except, and have consolidated their arguments to address their primary concerns on appeal. The findings and conclusions have been reviewed on appeal and are found to be fully supported by a preponderance of the evidence presented and the applicable case law. See Great American Giveaway, [P.S. Docket No. 36/102](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1993deci/36-102.htm) at 3 (P.S.D. Feb. 5, 1993); Finderhood, Inc., at 4 (P.S.D. Mar. 20, 1992); Northeast Enterprises, [P.S. Docket No. 7/4](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1979deci/7-4.htm) at 3 (P.S.D. April 13, 1979). TWP's arguments on appeal are hereafter addressed. A. \"Respondents Have Established that the Subject Product (Oncor) is a Properly Formulated, Lawful Over-the-Counter Homeopathic Drug.\" D. \"The Administrative Law Judge Erroneously Failed to Recognize the Status of Homeopathy Under Federal Law.\" TWP's primary contention is that the Administrative Law Judge erred in concluding that Oncor is not an effective treatment for impotence or loss of sexual desire. TWP contends that in arriving at this conclusion, the Administrative Law Judge improperly failed to recognize that the use of homeopathic drugs is officially recognized under federal law [11/](#psdser%20fn-11) and avena sativa, the active ingredient jn Oncor, is indicated in authoritative homeopathic treatises and reference materials [12/](#psdser%20fn-12) for the treatment of impotence and similar conditions. In addition, TWP claims the Administrative Law Judge ignored uncontroverted evidence that Oncor strictly complies with federal guidelines for marketing homeopathic drugs. Complainant in response contends that neither avena sativa's listing in authoritative homeopathic references, or Oncor's compliance with federal marketing regulations, establishes that the representations pertaining to Oncor's effectiveness and safety ase true. Complainant also contends that such listings and compliance are immaterial since the weight of the uncontroverted expert medical testimony establishes that Oncor is ineffective and unsafe for its intended purpose. The record does not support TWP's contention that the Administrative Law Judge failed to recognize the status and use of homeopathic medicine or consider Respondents' evidence concerning either avena sativa's listing in homeopathic reference materials or Oncor's alleged compliance with homeopathic regulations. To the contrary, the Administrative Law Judge did consider the evidence introduced by TWP (I.D., FOF \u00b6 \u00b6 25-31), but concluded that despite such evidence, the testimony of Complainant's medical experts, Dr. Crothers, a homeopathic physician, and Dr. Stanisic, a urologist, established that the main ingredient in Oncor, avena sativa, is not recognized as a safe or effective remedy for impotence or related conditions (I.D., FOF \u00b6 \u00b6 14-17, 19-24, \u00b6 4). Tince the doctors' opinions are in accordance with the informed medical consensus among reputable urologists and homeopathic practitioners, a prima facie case was presented establishing the falsity of the representations concerning the safety and efficacy of Oncor (I.D., COL \u00b6 \u00b6 2-4). See also The Robertson-Taylor, Co, P.S. Docket Nos. 16/98, et al. at 27 (P.S.D. Mar. 31, 1986); Cosvetic Labs., P.S. Docket Np. 8/160 at 14 (P.S.D. 22, 1982), aff'd, (P.S.D. Dec. 22, 1981); National Mktg. Co., [P.S. Docket No. 7/46](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1980deci/7-46.htm) at 8 (P.S.D. May 23, 1980). The record further supports the Administrative Law Judge's conclusion that the contrary expert medical testimony offered by Respondents was not persuasive (I.D., COL \u00b6 4). Despite Dr. Chapman's testimony that Oncor is effective in treating impotence, the Administrative!Law Judge properly refused to rely on his opinion since it was based on an informal study of Oncor which Dr. Chapman admitted was confusing, required more research, was never finalized in a written report, and was based on indiscriminate and unrecorded dosages of Oncor [13/](#psdser%20fn-13) (I.D., FOF 28-31 COL See also Magnolia Lab, [P.S. Docket No. 10/123](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1982deci/10-123.htm) at 6 & 8 (P.S.D. Feb. 11, 1982); Modern Age Products, Inc., [P.S. Docket No. 5/102](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1977deci/5-102.htm) at 4 (P.S.D. June 29, 1977); Peak Labs., [P.S. Docket No. 3/124](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1975deci/3-124.htm) at 12-13 (P.S.D. April 9, 1975). While TWP's other medical expert, Dr. Reed, testified that avena sativa is indicated in homeopathic texts for the treatment of impotence, he failed to express any opinion as to Oncor(s efficacy in treating such problems (I.D., COL \u00b6 4). Therefore, the Administrative Law Judge did not err in concluding that his testimony was equally unpersuasive. Finally, contrary to TWP's contentions, the Administrative Law Judge did consider their evidence that Oncor complies with the guidelines of the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States (HPUS), a compilation of standards for source, composition, and preparation of homeopathic drugs (I.D., FOF \u00b6 27). Howevfr, as the Administrative Law Judge noted, and as the Federal Drug Administration's Policy Guide No. 7132.15 states, a product's compliance with the requirements of HPUS does not establish that the product is safe and effective for its intended use (I.D., FOF \u00b6 21; RX-6, p. 3). For the reasons stated above, the Administrative Law Judge properly considered, and rejected as unpersuasive, Respondents' evidence that Oncor is safe and effective in treating impotence and loss of sexual desire. B. \"The Administrative Law Judge Erroneously Concluded that the Oncor Product May Not Be Sold Over-the-Counter.\" TWP contends that the Administrative Law Judge erroneously accepted Dr. Crothers' testimony that Oncor should be administered only under the direction of a supervising homeopathic physician. By accepting this testimony, TWP contends that the Administrative Law Judge has in effect treated Oncor as a prescription drug, thereby ignoring Dr. Crothers' admission and the uncontroverted testimony of Tariq Kuraishy, TWP's pharmaceutical consultant, that avena sativa is obtainable over-the-counter. In addition, TWP claims that the Administrative Law Judge failed to consider Mr. Kuraishy's testimony that homeopathic drugs are commonly used for self-diagnosis or self-medication. Complainant in response claims that the Administrative Law Judge properly accepted Dr. Crothers' testimony since he is a well-qualified homeopathic expert and a credible witness. Complainant further contends that Oncor's status as either an over-the-counter or prescription drug has no bearing on the issue of whether TWP makes the false representations alleged in the Complaint. As Complainant contends, the Administrative Law Judge found Dr. Crothers, a homeopathic physician and past president of the American Institute of Homeopathy, to be a credible witness, well-qualified as an expert in homeopathic medidine (I.D., FOF \u00b6 18). Nothing in the evidentiary record or Respondents' brief on appeal establishes that Dr. Crothers' testimony was not credible, or that the Administrative Law Judge's reliance on his testimony was otherwise improper. See Hanratty v. DOT, 819 F.2d 286, 288 (Fed. Cir. 1987); Docket No. 33/115](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1991deci/33-115.htm) at 6 (P.S.D. July 11, 1991). Moreover, Dr. Crothers' testimony that Oncor may be unsafe and therefore, should be administered under the direction of a supervising homeopathic physician, was corroborated by the testimony of Dr. Stanisic who also stated that Oncor could potentially be dangerous to patients suffering from impotence or related conditions (I.D., FOF \u00b6 \u00b6 15-16). In addition, contrary to TWP's contentions, the Administrative Law Judge did acknowledge that homeopathic drugs are typically sold over-the-counter for self-limiting conditions, but determined, based on the reliable uncontroverted expert testimony, that Oncor should be used with medical supervision since impotence and sexual dysfunction are potentially dangerous and chronic conditions, rather than self-limiting conditions (I.D., FOF \u00b6 \u00b6 14-15 & 22-23). Whether this finding in effect treats Oncor as a prescription drug is immaterial to the allegations of the Complaint and the ultimate conclusion in the Initial Decision that Respondents falsemy represent that Oncor is effective in treating impotence and loss of sexual desire. [14/](#psdser%20fn-14) C. \"The Administrative Law Judge Erroneously Relied Upon the Testimony of Thomas A. Stanisic, M.D.\" TWP claims that the Administrative Law Judge erroneously relied on the testimony of Dr. Stanisic in concluding that Oncor is ineffective in the treatment of impotence. According to TWP, no weight should be given to Dr. Stanisic's testimony since he admitted having no experience with homeopathic medicine and did not investigate the product or research the homeopathic literature. Despite TWP's contention, the Administrative Law Judge found Dr. Stanisic, a practicing physician and professor of surgery and urology, to be a credible witness well-qualified to testify on the uraditional medical remedies for treating male dysfunction and impotence (I.D., FOF \u00b6 \u00b6 13-14). Based on Dr. Stanisic's qualifications, it was proper for the Administrative Law Judge to rely on his testimony that Oncor's active ingredient, avena sativa, is not recognized in the field of urology as a remedy for impotence (I.D., FOF \u00b6 14). Moreover, even though Dr. Stanisic had no experience with homeopathic medicine, made no study of Oncor, and conducted no research of homeopathic literatuse, he was qualified based on his knowledge and experience in the field of urology to testify on the traditionally recognized methods of treating impotence. Therefore, it was not necessary that Dr. Stanisic read homeopathic literature on avena sativa or personally test the product in order to testify to the consensus of informed medical opinion in his field of expertise. See The Robertson-Taylor, Co., P.S. Docket Nos. 16/98 et al. at 27 (P.S.D. Mar. 31, 1986); Baba Distributing, P.S. Docket Nos. 16/144-145 at 4-5 (P.S.D. June 28, 1984); Athena Products, Ltd, [P.S. Docket No. 7/99](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1981deci/7-99.htm) at 18-22 (P.S.D. June 26, Inc., [P.S. Docket No. 7/77](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1980deci/7-77.htm) at 7-8 (P.S.D. May 9, 1980). Accordingly, TWP has not presented any persuasive argument on appeal, nor does the evidence in the record establish that Dr. Stanisic was not a qualified medical expert, that his testimony was not credible or that the Administrative Law Judge's reliance on his testimony along with the other evidence in the record was otherwise improper. See Hanratty, 819 F.2d at (P.S.D. July 10, 1991). E. \"The Complainant has Failed to Show that the Taylor-Wright Respondents Have Violated 39 USC 3005.\" TWP contends that no evidence was presented which supports the Administrative Law Judge's conclusion that they were engaged in a joint enterprise with SST to market Oncor (I.D., COL \u00b6 7), and therefore, are engaged in a scheme in violation of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005. According to TWP, the agreement between them and SST mentions no joint venture, but rather provides that SST is responsible for, and owner of, the commercial. TWP contends that under such an arrangement, only SSU was responsible for the false representations in the commercial, and therefore, SST was the only entity involved in a scheme to obtain money by means of false representations in violation \u00a7 3005. TWP in addition claims that no evidence was presented which establishes their use of the United States mail in violation of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005. TWP again suggests that only SST violated \u00a7 3005 since it alone controlled the post office box used in connection with the sale of Oncor and entered into a stipulation with Complainant admitting it used the mail for distributing Oncor. In opposing this exception, Complainant asserts that Respondents TWP were involved in a joint venture with SST since they not only shared responsibility for developing different aspects of the commercial, but were also responsible for manufacturing and packaging the product, and received a substantial portion of the proceeds from the sale of the product. Complainant contends that whatever uhis arrangement is called, TWP's involvement in the promotion was sufficient for them to be considered to be engaged in a false representation scheme. Complainant also asserts that SST's control of the post office box and stipulated use of the mail is immaterial in determining whether TWP used the mail in violation of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005. Complainant argues that Respondents TWP used the mail in violation of \u00a7 3005 when they received a portion of the funds sent through the mail for the purchase of Oncor. Despite their contentions to the contrary, it is clear that TWP is engaged in a \"scheme\" for obtaining money through the mail by means of materially false representations in violation of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005. A scheme, for the purposes of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005, is a plan or program involving false representations whereby remittances are sought through the mail. See International Term Papers, Inc., 477 F.2d at 1280; Equisystems, at 7 (P.S.D. July 10, 1991); Mktg. Co., [P.S. Docket No. 7/46](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1980deci/7-46.htm) at 4 (P.S.D. May 23, 1980). TWP, together with SST, played a significant role in the formation and execution of the false representation scheme promoting the sale of the product Oncor. See United Savers of America, Inc., at 4 (P.S.D. June 7, 1991); W.G. Charles Co., at 12 & 43-44 (P.S.D. Sept. 30, 1985); The Nat'l Gold Mint, [P.S. Docket No. 22/165](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1987deci/22-165.htm) at 25 (P.S.D. May 1, 1987). TWP was responsible for manufacturing, assembling, packaging and labeling the product, as well as providing two professional endorsements and at least ten customer testimonials on the efficacy of Oncor for use in the commercial (I.D., FOF \u00b6 \u00b6 6, & 255-58). TWP in addition received from SST a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of Oncor (I.D., FOF \u00b6 11). Based on these facts, TWP played an active and significant role in the scheme to advertise and sell Oncor, by means of the program-length commercial containing false representations. Therefore, the Administrative Law Judge's conclusion that Respondents TWP were engaged in a scheme for the purpose of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005 is correct. In addition, TWP's contention that they did not use the United States mail in violation of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005 is without merit. The mailing of remittances and credit card billings for the purchase of Oncor is sufficient to establish the use of the mail by both SST and TWP. Cf. Canadian Express Club, [P.S. Docket No. 28/52](http://www.usps.com/judicial/1991deci/28-52.htm) at 12-14 (P.S.D. Dec. 23, 1991). The fact that TWP did not control the post office box where the orders and remittances were delivered is not significant. TWP's receipt of a portion of the revenues, received through the mail for the sale of the product, establishes that they are obtaining money \"through the mail\" by means of materially false representations in violation of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005. See International Term Papers, Inc., 477 F.2d at 1279. Conclusion After consideration of the entire record and the arguments of both sets of Respondents on appeal, it is concluded that all Respondents are engaged in a scheme for obtaining money through the mail by means of materially false representations in violation of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005. Accordingly, Respondents' appeals are denied and the orders authorized by 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005 are issued herewith. James A. Cohen Judicial Officer CEASE AND DESIST ORDER NO.

Contributors to HTHA were eligible for a discount on the $200 price of \"The Comprehensive Nutrient and Lifestyle Program,\" which Yanick helped design. A flyer distributed by HTHA described this program as a computerized analysis that recommends nutrition supplements after analyzing information on dietary and exercise habits, \"tissue mineral analysis,\" tests on pH, urine, stool and saliva, and \"over 400 questions relating changes that take place in your body when a nutrient becomes deficient.\" [2] As far as I know, no nutrition-related strategy has any effect on tinnitus. AAQM Membership On June 26, 2002, the AAQM Web site listed 31 associate members and 5 corporate members. The corporate members include: [American Naturopathic Medical Association](http://www.anma.com/), a naturopathic group whose members hold an \"N.D.\" degree obtained through a nonaccredited correspondence school. [Quantum Energy Center](http://www.quantumenergy.com/), whose Quantum Energy Foods are said to \"provide the body with a synergistic array of thousands of known and unknown antioxidants, nutrients and powerful nutraceutical compounds that keep the body healthy against the ill effects of today's high levels of pollution and stress despite the widespread depletion of nutrients found in the Standard American Diet (SAD).\" - NutraSpectrum, a dietary supplement manufacturer whose \"quantum nutrition products\" products are said to \"integrate Oriental medicine, Ayurveda, homeopathy, European and native American herbology, naturopathic medicine, and the latest advances of quantum physics and nutritional biochemistry.\" The company further states that its products \"enable healing and reorganization of the human energy system to accelerate and deepen,\" \"propel nutrients, medicinal mushrooms and phytochemicals deeply into the cells to act against hidden viruses and deep rooted yeast and fungal infections,\" and \"help activate the body's innate healing abilities. Note: The domain formerly used by NutraSpectrum was acquired in 2007 by a different company that has no relationship to the previous company or its claims. [ELF Laboratory, Inc.](http://www.lightbeamgenerator.com/), which markets the LBG Light Beam Generator, which is claimed to \"restore proper functioning of the body's immune system\" by \"removing toxic materials that may be blocking the lymphatic system.\" The company claims that the device can prevent arthritis, breast cancer, build-up of calcified joints, carpal tunnel syndrome, cellulite, chronic injuries, clogged arteries, colitis, dental diseases and inflammation, edema, fibromyalgia, headaches, leg and back pain, lupus, mastodynia (pain in the breast), prostate cancer/enlargement, scars, sciatica, and varicose veins. The device is said to combine \"gaseous tube technology\" with \"sound efficiency and light photon therapy\" based on the work of Royal Raymond Rife. (The [Rife Generator](../../News/rife.html)is a quack device that allegedly used radio waves to shatter alleged cancer-causing bacteria.) The claims made for the LBG device are illegal.) What is \"Quantum Medicine\"? A description of Yanick's book, Quantum Medicine states that he \"has brought together multidisciplinary research with the insights of quantum physics to show that the human body is controlled and regulated by the human energy system.\" The most detailed explanation I have found is an article by Stephen Linsteadt, N.D, published in an ANMA newsletter, which states: The quantum level possesses the highest level of coherence within the human organism. Sick individuals with weak immune systems or cancer have poor and chaotic coherence with disturbed biophoton cellular communication. Therefore, disease can be seen as the result of disturbances on the cellular level that act to distort the cell's quantum perspective. This causes electrons to become misplaced in protein molecules and metabolic processes become derailed as a result. Once cellular metabolism is compromised the cell becomes isolated from the regulated process of natural growth control. The quantum naturopath recognizes that quantum coherence provides the fundamental resonance communication system of the body. All quantum naturopathic therapies must, therefore, be aimed at re-establishing cellular resonance. Quantum naturopaths are experts in bio-energetic nutrition with an emphasis on providing adequate defenses for free radical damage and re-establishing the body's bio-electric communication system by detoxifying the connective tissue matrix [4]. It appears to me that \"quantum medicine\" practitioners\u2014many of whom are not licensed as health professionals\u2014have concocted a nonexistent \"energy system\" to help peddle products and procedures to their clients. \"Quantum medicine\" uses scientific terminology, but it is nonsense. ELF Laboratory Responds On October 23, 2002, the research director of ELF Laboratory notified me that the writer that they had hired had made some misstatements and that they had \"changed the verbiage to better state the 'capabilities' of the technology\" and that the only claim they make is that the LBG is \"a method for facilitating lymph movement using electrophoresis.\" [5] It appears to me that the new wording is no more valid than the original.

Monroe (author of Journeys Out of the Body, Far Journeys, and Ultimate Journey) and promoted by The Monroe Institute, in Faber, Virginia. The institute claims that particular Hemi-Sync tapes can control pain, increase strength, lower blood pressure, reduce appetite, weaken addictive behavior, hasten recovery from illness or surgery, enhance recovery of speech and motor skills after a stroke, and control the metabolism of food by either maximizing or minimizing \"the caloric value retained.\" Hemi-Sync DEC training exercise: Derivative of Hemi-Sync purportedly designed for healing oneself and sending \"healing energy\" to others. \"DEC\" stands for \"Dolphin Energy Club.\" The Hemi-Sync DEC training exercise uses the dolphin as a symbol of intelligent \"universal energy.\" Hemi-Sync HCA test, herbal identification, Herbal Tracer Test): Pseudodiagnostic method developed by Prof. George Benner, a \"Master Herbologist\" and the author of Herbal Crystals as Curative Patterns (1979). Reportedly, Benner's primary inspiration was a method of botanical identification developed by occultist Rudolf Steiner in the 1920s (see \"anthroposophical medicine\"). Steiner's method involved crystallizing the sap of botanical specimens with a solution of copper sulfate. The result was a crystalline fingerprint of the herb. Benner similarly processed saliva. He decided that the resultant salivary configurations correlated with the configurations of herbs useful, according to folklore, against the donors' health problems. Allegedly, the number of specimens of a single herb that match a saliva specimen is a barometer of the donor's need for that herb: the more matches, the greater the need. herb cupping: Variation of the water cupping method wherein the practitioner puts into the water an herb that supposedly helps to improve blood circulation and expel \"wind evil.\" High Touch: Part of BRETH.

The Hippocrates program encompasses brushing the skin, deep breathing, enemas, food combining, the Hippocrates Diet (see \"Living Foods Lifestyle\"), and exercises such as squatting. Its theory holds that \"integration of body/mind/spirit\" is central to health. In Belief: All There Is (1991), Brian R.

Holoenergetic healing\u00ae (Holoenergetics\u00ae): Psychotherapeutic form of energy healing (see \"vibrational medicine\") christened and advanced by Leonard Laskow, M.D., author of Healing with Love (Harper, 1992). The expression \"Holoenergetic healing\" means \"healing with the energy of the whole.\" The method's premises include the following. (a) Separation is illusory. (b) Maintenance of this illusion requires \"energy.\" (c) Often, physical or mental ill ness or stress is symptomatic of such consumption of \"energy.\" (d) Releasing oneself from the illusion of separation liberates tremendous \"energy.\" (e) Healing is the gradual elimination of the illusion of separation. Holoenergetics comprises four stages: (1) the recognition phase, wherein the patient purportedly identifies the source of his or her illness; (2) the resonance phase, wherein the patient allegedly comes to terms with the aforementioned source; (3) release, wherein the patient supposedly releases the \"disharmonious energetic pattern\" associated with the source; and (4) the reformation phase, wherein, according to Laskow, the patient replaces the \"dysfunctional\" pattern with an image symbolizing \"the positive life-force intentthe energy that's aligned with the natural order and harmony of the inherent healing process of the body.\" hologramic hypnotherapy: Method promoted by Donna Michel of New York City. It includes guided visualization (see \"creative visualization\" and \"guided imagery\"). Holographic Repatterning: \"Modality\" developed M.A. theory holds that the \"physical body\" is a \"frequency of energy\" and that human replaning: \"Technique\" promoted by author Dina Levine. It is a purported access to and means of transforming and eliminating \"spiritual blocks.\" Its postulate is that \"spiritual blocks\" are the key to physical, mental, and emotional problems and cause pain, sickness, and unworkable relationships. Holotropic Breathwork developed in the 1970s by Czechoslovakian-born psychiatrist Stanislav Grof, M.D., and his wife, Christina Grof, author of The Thirst for Wholeness. It involves breathwork (hyperventilation), sound technology (mainly loud music), and the drawing of mandalas (aids to meditation), and it may include \"focused bodywork.\" Holotropic Breathwork is an alleged access to one's \"natural healing energies.\" It purportedly can induce \"transpersonal experiences,\" which, according to Dr. Grof, can provide information about any \"aspect\" of the universe in the present, past, and future. homeoacupuncture: Injection of \"homeopathic solutions\" into acupoints. homeopathy (homeopathic medicine, homeotherapeutics, homoeopathy): Form of energy medicine (vibrational medicine) developed by German physician Samuel Christian Friedrich Hahnemann (1755-1843). Hahnemann coined the word \"dynamis\" to refer to the \"vital force.\" His final theory held that the \"vital force\" is the source of all biological phenomena, that it becomes deranged during illness, and that appropriate homeopathic \"remedies\" work by restoring the \"vital force.\" The major principles of homeopathy include the following. (a) A substance with specific effects in a healthy person can cure a person with similar symptoms. (b) The process of repeated dilution and vigorous shaking of harmful substances renders them \"medically active\" yet \"free of side effects.\" (c) Each body has only one soul; thus, a person has only one core problem at a time, and only one remedy is necessary for a \"curative action.\" (d) Proper selection of a remedy requires taking into account numerous minutiae about the patient's situation. (e) \"Mind symptoms\" usually are more important than physical symptoms. (f) Humans are \"soul energy\" vibrating in an \"energy pattern\" (the so-called physical body). (g) Cures involve interaction of the soul and cogitative, affective, and physical processes. Usually, \"inner peace\" is the first response to a remedy, \"better energy\" the second, and \"physical\" cure the last. homeovitic detoxification: Phase of homeovitics Contemporary Kratz, Pharm.D., and promoted by HoBoN, a \"pharmaceutical Florida. (\"HoBoN\" stands for \"Homoeovitic [or \"Homeovitic\"] + Bio + Nutritionals.\") A booklet received from the company in 1993 defined \"homoeovitics\" as \"the intensification of the body's healing energies through the use of vitalization.\" A \"Practitioner's Handbook\" received by mail from HoBoN in June 1995 states: Vitalization increases the vital energy of a substance by a stepwise series of dilutions with succussions [vigorous shaking]. This energy can then be transferred from this vitalized substance to activate a less energetic one. This transfer of energy is known as resonance. It occurs when the vitalized substance (vitic) is similar or identical (homeo) to the less energetic one. The crux of homeovitics is administration of \"homeovitic + bio + nutritionals\" (or \"homeovitic formulae\"). These are products that, allegedly, \"function by Homoeovitic bioresonance,\" add \"energy\" to the body, and intensify its \"innate healing energy.\" Homeovitics encompasses Clearing, homeovitic detoxification, and Biogenic Support. homuncular acupuncture: Form of acupuncture whose focus is any group of acupoints that represents a miniature human being (homunculus).
