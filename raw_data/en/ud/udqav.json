Jillian Epperly sells her books, containing the recipe for a brew (she calls it a 'protocol') of fermented cabbage, sea salts and other pungent ingredients on her website, reports [The Daily Mail.](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6244321/I-held-accountable-says-poop-cult-leader-claimed-cabbage-drink-cures-cancer.html) She exalts explosive diarrhea, which she refers to as \"waterfalls,\" as a healing proces to expel \"cancer-causing candida,\" earning her and her 58,000 Facebook followers the nickname \"poop cult.\" Over the summer, the family of one \"protocol\" follower with stage four pancreatic cancer even insinuated that Epperly's juice may have contributed to his death in July. Now, the FTC is cracking down on poop cult leader's dangerous quackery in a formal letter demanding her to present evidence of her lofty claims and threatening to force her to return her money to customers. But Epperly told Daily Mail Online in an exclusive interview that she \"cannot be held responsible.\" \"Out of like 60,000 people that took my juice, how many people have [died]? It's not fair to hold me to that kind of standard,\" she told Daily Mail Online. Epperly's beliefs and health claims ramble, range and change seemingly endlessly across her Facebook. According to her website, her book is the vehicle for the recipe and methodology of her cabbage concoction, but it bears the peculiarly sci-fi title, Exposing the Lies Candida: Weaponized Fungus Mainstreaming Mutancy. In a 2017 post in a closed Facebook group of the same name, she promised she had a \"protocol to reverse 100% of all your health issues A-Z vaccinated or not!!\" She continued, elaborating on conspiracy theories blaming the government, academia, biotech and even holistic and allopathic industries for giving people 'Candida/Cancer' through vaccines and other less clear mechanisms as a way of making money and exerting control over populations. Instead, on venues including Facebook, her own website and the Dr Phil show (another Dr Phil guest accused her of preying on vulnerable people), she has promoted her own garishly green drink as a way to purge the candida, via explosive bouts of diarrhea. She has also claimed that her drink can reverse autism and turn gay people straight. As stated in its warning letter to Epperly, the FTC \"prohibits false or misleading advertising claims and requires that health-related claims - such as claims that a product will treat or cure a disease or other health condition - be supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence at the time the claims were made.\" The married Canton, Ohio, resident responded with a slew of 22 Facebook posts in under 24 hours, oscillating between defensiveness and gratitude to the FTC for teaching her the difference between correlation and causation. In an interview with Daily Mail Online she defended her 'beliefs,' vowed to never make curative claims again, and eschewed responsibility for her past promises. \"I had people that said to me that they reversed their lung cancer and showed me their MRIs, but it's not in the book because I would've had to get it notarized and I didn't want to go through that and I wasn't there so of course it's not 100 percent substantiated,\" Epperly told Daily Mail Online. \"I thought I could at least say possibility, not cure, because I'm not allowed to say that because it's stage four biotech. \"But I thought I could play the word game [saying] \"possibility,\" but I can't say that.\" Now, instead of marketing her book and cabbage drink as a cure or 'possible' cure for any of these ailments, Epperly is defending the 'positive' effects of the juice and using FTC's own definition of causation means she is blameless. Her first is that \"it's all about the positive and the negative, and the juice is all the positive in the universe.\" The juice contains three ingredients: fermented cabbage, water and salt. Salt, Epperly believes, is a \"positive element\" for the immune system and cabbage contains important probiotics and nutrients. She says that the 'waterfalls' experienced by those who prescribe to her juice are \"not diarrhea,\" because \"diarrhea is when you poison the body.\" Her concoction, on the other hand, \"is an energizing force\" she says allowing the immune system to carry out negatives. It is unclear what these negatives are, but cabbage is high in fiber and wealth of scientific research demonstrates that excess fiber can cause diarrhea. Epperly admits that she has never studied her drink's effects in a controlled environment, and told Daily Mail Online that she has no degrees or certificates, but that 'I can read ... all the information is online and definitions are definitions.' Last year, Bruce Wilmot was dying of stage four pancreatic cancer when he started taking Jilly Juice. Epperly told Daily Mail Online that she reached out to him when he was in hospice. His social media accounts show that he was in home hospice, but not in a hospice facility, in June of 2017. 'When I reached out to him, I was a Good Samaritan and said, \"hey, I've got something that could possibly be good for you,\"' Epperly says. Wilmot posted pictures of every surface in his kitchen covered in giant jars of Jilly Juice. Epperly says that she eats a regular diet - that sometimes includes chicken fingers or \"whatever I want\" - but it is unclear what else Wilmot was eating. In July, his Rabbi found him collapsed in his home. Wimot's daughter described him as emaciated. \"I put out the possibility [the juice could help], I never said it was going to happen,\" Epperly says. \"He was drinking pineapple juice ... when it's not in a controlled condition and it's not in hospice, you cannot make a direct correlation to the juice.\" Since receiving the FTC notice, that has become her second mantra. As stated in a Facebook post today, she says \"Uhhh NOW I GET WHY CORRELATION DOES NOT MEAN CAUSATION.\" The FTC was accusing her of making false claims of causation. But Epperly has taken that to mean that she can't be held responsible for the effects of her Jilly Juice. In the same post, she wrote: \"IF I CAN'T BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR DEATHS IN THE MATRIX THEN NEITHER CAN BIOTECH or the EPA.\" Speaking with Daily Mail Online, she compared her juice to clinically proven drugs. \"That's like if you give someone the advice to take Tylenol and they took it and passed away. It wouldn't be fair to blame you,\" she said. Epperly says that there is no lawsuit against her pending from the Wilmot family, but if the revisions she has made to her website are not to the FTC's standards, she may face legal action from the agency.
