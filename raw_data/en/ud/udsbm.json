Parent/Guardian Signature _____________________________ Date____________________________ Parent/Guardian Signature _____________________________ Date____________________________ Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) covers a range of abnormalities. On one end of the spectrum is the severely autistic (\"Rainman\" type) patient; while on the other is a person with attention deficit disorder (ADHD). Persistent developmental delay (PDD) and Asperger's Syndrome lie in between. There has been a rapid and concerning increase in the incidence of ASD to the point where one in 50 children born will be diagnosed with ASD. The incidence is even higher in males. There has been much work in the field of genetics to identify anomalies that may cause ASD. So far, over one hundred genetic anomalies have been identified that are linked with ASD. However, if genetics were the sole cause of ASD, we would not see the alarming rise in its incidence. The rate of a solely genetic disorder should stay constant over time. There is a much more sophisticated understanding of the relationship between genes and environment that has come to the forefront\u2014a field called genomics. Genomics recognizes that the genetic blue print is only a set of possibilities; it is the interaction of those genes with the environment that determines how a person develops. With this in mind, a number of pioneering physicians and research scientists have been looking at ASD to find what environmental factors may play a role in the development of ASD and whether manipulating these factors could reverse the process and actually cure a child with ASD. This is known as the bio-medical approach to the treatment of ASD and has been championed by groups such as Defeat Autism Now! (previously known as DAN!) and The Medical Academy of Pediatric Special Needs (MAPS). This approach is what we use at Bio Energy to treat our patients who have been diagnosed with ASD. The first are of interest lies in the digestive tract. It has been known since autism was first described that most of these children have issues with their digestion. These range from simple stomach upset and bloating to severe, explosive diarrhea. Dietary changes frequently are the first step in treating ASD. Approaches include a gluten and casein free diet, a rotation diet, a specific carbohydrate diet, or a low oxalate diet. Gluten and casein are proteins found in grains (especially wheat) and dairy, respectively. They appear to be an issue of ASD children on two fronts. First, many children have delayed-type hypersensitivity to these proteins\u2014in essence, they are allergic to them. Secondly, these proteins are broken down into intermediates that act like opiates\u2014altering behavior and contributing to the children's separation from their environment. Over 60% of ASD children improved with this diet alone based on parent reporting. The rotation diet is based on a child's individual food sensitivities. We perform blood testing to determine a child's sensitivity profile and make recommendations on these results. The specific carbohydrate diet can aid children that have issues with intestinal candidiasis (yeast) or sugar sensitivities. The low oxalate diet can be helpful with children that remain agitated despite other interventions or if there is any evidence of joint problems. If this sounds overwhelming, don't worry. We try to tailor a child's diet to his or her specific issues based on history, observation, and some testing. The second area of importance for children with ASD is the arena of methylation and sulfation. These describe biochemical processes that are essential for detoxification and energy production. Children with ASD appear to be deficient in one or both of these areas. Because of this, they are much more sensitive to environmental toxins than are unaffected children. If an unaffected child is presented with an environmental toxin such as a pesticide residue, their sulfation mechanisms with take care of the problem. A child with ASD that has a problem with this system will be unable to process the same toxin without causing other problems. The ASD child will have to \"rob Peter to pay Paul;\" methylation and sulfation components will be stolen from energy production in order to assist with detoxification. The net result will be a cell that cannot function properly. The brain is particularly sensitive to this process. If these changes occur in an adult, they will experience \"brain fog\" and fatigue. If they occur in a child with a developing brain, they will result in delayed or regressed development and behavioral problems. Treatment involves identifying the toxins in the child's environment, removal of those toxins from both the environment and the child, and nutritional support to promote or supplement these systems. Much of the biochemical testing we do at Bio Energy is designed to identify these toxins and metabolic abnormalities. A third area of concern with ASD children is the immune system and the syndrome of chronic infections. Many ASD children have problems with recurrent infections with strep or other common organisms. One recent study demonstrated almost 60% of ASD children tested positive for Mycoplasma (a common atypical bacterial infection) while only 5% of unaffected children tested positive. A positive or negative result was based on the presence or absence of the bacterial DNA in the child's blood using an extremely sensitive technique called PCR. There were similar results when these children were tested for Chlymadia pneumonia and Human Herpes Virus 6. This would suggest that some part of the ASD child's immune system is not functioning properly. In addition, many ASD children have abnormal stool cultures showing many potentially disease causing (pathogenic) organisms as well as a lack of healthy bacteria. There are a number of stool and blood tests that we perform to try to identify and treat these organisms. Another issue with ASD children is heavy metal treatment with chelation. Many ASD children have elevated levels of lead, mercury, and other toxic metals when tested appropriately. A large percentage of children with ASD will show improvement with chelation (the process of removing these metals using compounds that bind them and remove them from the body). Most chelators we use also have the added benefit of being excellent supporters of the sulfation processes we discussed earlier. At Bio Energy, we use both urine challenge testing as well as hair analysis to determine who might benefit from chelation therapy. Children that demonstrate issues with sulfation may also be prescribed chelation in an effort to improve that function as well. Finally, a word on \"traditional\" treatment of ASD. Nothing we do at Bio Energy in the treatment of ASD is intended to replace the usual ABA, PT/OT/Speech therapies of traditional medicine. At the end of the day, ASD children have problems processing their environment. They need to be taught the most basic issues of life, social interaction, and appropriate behavior. The biomedical approaches are intended to allow this learning to occur, not replace the process of teaching. The same is true of medications. We will do everything we can to identify and correct reasons why a child is agitated and misbehaving; however, sometimes medication is the only way for a child to calm down enough to learn. We strive to be thorough in our approach to the child with ASD. This begins with parents filling out a thorough history of the child's development, history, and previous therapies that have been tried. We ask that this be done a few weeks in advance of the initial evaluation so that Dr. Neuenschwander can read it in advance. The actual appointment is scheduled for two hours. This will allow Dr. Neuenschwander to get a complete history and observe the child in action. Based on these ingredients, Dr. Neuenschwander will recommend further testing and or dietary changes and supplements. Bio Energy Medical Center James Neuenschwander, M.D. 4201 Varsity Drive, Suite A Ann Arbor, MI 48108 June, 2018 PATIENT CONSENT FORM To Whom It May Concern: May I ask that you sign a copy of this document and return it to Bio Energy Medical Center? Your signature will document your understanding and consent of the following principles and practice. There has been a rising incidence in the US and elsewhere of problems in children that fall diagnostically within a spectrum of autistic disorders (ASD) and possibly related attention problems (ADHD). To the extent that any individual displays symptoms of ASD and ADHD, he or she may be a participant in the rising incidence of these problems. To the extent that these problems are increasing in incidence beyond any measure that could be attributed to a purely genetic cause (which would be stable in incidence over long periods) any participant in the increase may be assumed to have causes consistent with environmental factors. Based on such considerations I would like to have such causes considered in the evaluation of my child. In asking Dr. Neuenschwander for help in optimizing the options for my child I have been aware that my child's syndrome includes many features that are not necessary to diagnose ASD or ADHD in a given child and may include symptoms related to other body systems than behavior, cognition and socialization. These symptoms are indicated on the questionnaire and other documents introduced at the initial visit. I was not seeking a treatment or cure for a disease such as Autism, but rather an approach focusing on my child as an individual. Is there something of which this person should be rid, which would result in better function? I understand that as a matter of public policy, no environmental cause has been proven link to ASD or ADHD or related problems in children or adults. I grasp the difference between public and private health policy and insist that the threshold for reasonableness in decisions applied to any given individual may be lower than that required for proof as applied to large groups of individuals. Moreover I insist that my child be treated as an individual, not solely on the basis of his or her diagnostic grouping. Therefore, borrowing from a list of possible environmental factors that have been suggested as causative of the rise of incidence in ASD, ADHD and possibly related problems I desire that such factors be considered in the investigation of the biochemical, immunological and toxicological aspects of my child's problems. I am familiar with writings or the contents of writings that describe the factors associated with the rise in incidence of ASD and related problems. These include the Newsletters of the Autism Research Institute, Biomedical Assessment Options For Children with Autism and Related Problems, by Pangborn, J and Baker, SM. Published by The Autism Research Institute, Biological Treatments for Autism and PDD, by William Shaw, PhD, Children With Starving Brains: A Medical Treatment Guide for Autism Spectrum Disorder, Second Edition, by Jaquelyn McCandless, MD, the syllabi of the meetings of the Defeat Autism Now! (DAN!) Organization, The Chemistry of Autism, by Baker, SM et all presented at the Autism Research Institute Defeat Autism Now! Conference in Philadelphia PA, April 2008, as well as various postings on the Internet that refer to the questions and theories expressed in these writing. I desire that my child be evaluated with diagnostic steps aimed at some or all of the following factors that are referred to in the above publications or in the references cited by them. These factors include possible responsiveness to: other over the counter antifungal substances. Diet excluding yeasts, molds, and sugars Diet excluding casein and gluten Diet excluding starches (Specific Carbohydrate Diet as described in Breaking the Vicious Cycle Administration of various sulfur bearing substances that are broadly considered to be useful in the detoxification of heavy metals but may also be effective in providing support to the chemistry of sulfation in its other roles in human biochemistry. These compounds are reduced gluthatione, and Epsom salt baths. Vitamin and mineral supplements Supplements of certain amino acids, which may, depending on diagnostic evidence, address problems of maldigestion of proteins, malabsorption of essential amino acids, abnormalities of precursors of neurotransmitters, and deficits of sulfuramino acids. Supplements of omega 3 oils Methylcobalmin (methylB12) or related antiviral compounds Probiotics Oral transfer factor Digestive enzymes Oral immune globulin Intravenous Immune globulin if I request referral to a doctor who gives it. Secretin I understand that none of the above constitutes treatment for a disease but in each case, if administered to my child, is a diagnostic measure designed to determine effectiveness. Only on the basis of initial persuasive evidence of effectiveness would any of these measures constitute more than a diagnostic test. I understand that the judgment of such effectiveness may be based on changes in signs, symptoms and laboratory tests. I further understand that there are scientifically plausible links implied among the various causative factors in the above list and that combinations of these measures may be helpful when single measures may fail. I understand that in my child's record, where any of these measures is listed in a section labeled treatment that the measure constitutes a therapeutic trial and as such is a diagnostic test of efficacy. I understand that essentially all of the above factors have been declared unproven. I understand that essentially all of the above factors may be considered unproven or experimental by third party payers. My acknowledgement below constitutes my consent to the diagnostic approach embodied in this document. Any specific measures taken have been or will be carried out by me or under my supervision as a parent. To the extent that some of the diagnostic approaches embodied in this document have already been undertaken in my child's care I acknowledge that my understanding of the approaches at the time of first considering each of these steps was essentially no different than at the time of signing this document. At no time in the course of my child's care did Dr. Neuenschwander lack my completely informed consent.

By signing this document, I am signifying that I understand and agree to its provisions. Parent:____________________________________________ Date________________________________ Bio Energy Medical Center \"English\" Version of Patient Consent Form The intent of this consent is to be clear on Bio Energy Medical Center's approach to the biomedical treatment of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit (ADHD), or related disorders. The salient points of the consent (in plain English) are: The \"standard\" model of ASD is that it is a genetically programmed psychiatric disorder. Therefore, the only treatment is to use behavioral/cognitive techniques and psychiatric medications. Even though the original description of autism included many physical symptoms, these are felt to be unimportant in the treatment of ASD. While Dr. Neu agree that there are many genetic components that are at play in ASD and related disorders, the manifestation of these genetic mutations are affected by environmental factors in the vast majority of children with ASD and related disorders. We ask that parents/caretakers be somewhat familiar with the biomedical approach. A number of books/references are listed. We do not expect you to read and memorize all these sources. They are listed so that you can become informed prior to your visit. The treatment protocols used by Dr. Neu are listed. None of the treatments are accepted by the \"powers that be\" in pediatrics as treatments for ASD. These treatments are used both diagnostically and therapeutically. Although we have many tests at our disposal, frequently the only way to determine if a treatment will be helpful is to try the treatment first (diagnostic trial). If it helps, we continue that treatment (therapeutic use). The protocols mentioned are always in addition to the behavioral and cognitive treatments. We do not currently offer these types of treatments at BEMC. Finally, the consent mentions that any treatments that are undertaken prior to officially signing the consent are done with the elements of the consent form in place.
