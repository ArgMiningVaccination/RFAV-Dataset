Bowles Vaccination is a topic that many DC's are quite passionate about. The dangers of vaccination are well known and I am proud to say our profession leads the way in alerting the public in this area of public health. In this offering of the ChiroThoughts newsletter we will be discussing [vaccination titer tests](/titer-testing). To begin, my wife and I did not vaccinate our two children. The only time our daughter ever had to see an MD (needed 4 stitches at age 4), the nurse went berserk on us for not having our child [vaccinated ](/titer-testing)at least for [MMR](/mmr-immunity--testing). Then immediately accused us of abusing our child. The MD helping us was a friend and understood our position and also questioned many 'routine' medical protocols. It was 1989 and for the time and place he was a rather forward thinking chap. We had our daughters stitches put in and off we went to lunch. I can definitely say that my vociferous daughter did not incur even a mild form lockjaw. Like many chiropractic kids, our children were both breastfed and obtained the natural immunity it provides. After breastfeeding, the most important thing I feel we did was to keep them out of those hazardous viral/bacterial cesspools commonly known as daycares. Sorry if I stepped on some toes a bit with that last comment. Regardless, get that sweet baby home where they belong. After our kids preschool years were completed we homeschooled our children through high school. Once again, keeping them away from too much prolonged interaction with adverse bacterial sewage. A predominately anti-inflammatory diet was the order of the day for our children until they learned to drive. We couldn't quite control those late evening teen gatherings at the local Taco Bell. However, as they got older they started looking for the healthier items available than the junk food options. The biblical truth of \"raise a child in the way he (or she) should go and they will not depart from you\" has universal applicability. Today our daughter is 25 and a grad student/teaching assistant at the University of Texas. Our son is 29 and is youth pastor/intern director for a large church near Austin, Texas. Over the years, neither of our children have had much more than a cold and bypassed all the typical childhood illnesses. They have both been adjusted since they were babies. My son brags to his peers about never having had an immunization or a prescription. Our household was and still is somewhat rare today. Sadly this is also true even in some chiropractic families. Many chiropractic mothers do not breastfeed and many are put in daycares. So, what does a parent do? What would I recommend to anyone if their children could not be breastfed or had to be placed in a daycare? I think the most reasonable and responsible thing to do is the vaccine [titer test.](/titer-testing) As I'm sure you recall from biochemistry, a [vaccine titer](/titer-testing) is the measure, or level, of antibodies in the blood stream. A Brief Review of [Titer Testing](/titer-testing) Testing vaccine titers will identify the presence of antibodies induced by natural means or artificially. If the levels are satisfactory, the person is considered to have \"protective antibody\" and is considered to be \"sufficiently immune\" to the disease tested. It can then legitimately argued that no further vaccination is necessary at this time. The [tests](/titer-testing) can be ordered for both children and adults and the \"protective levels\" are the same in all age groups. To reiterate, [titer tests](/titer-testing) do not distinguish between antibodies generated by artificial sources such as vaccination and those generated by natural exposure to disease agents through infection or breastfeeding. A person can develop a positive antibody [titer](/titer-testing) through four specific yet different mechanisms or in combination of mechanisms. - Active Artificial Immunity - Vaccination - Active Natural Immunity - By becoming ill and recovering from the infection. By being exposed to someone with the infection but without having any symptoms of the disease. - Passive Natural Immunity - Breastfeeding - Passive Artificial Immunity - Antiserum administration. Antibodies that developed in another individual or animal are injected into an individual. Therefore, [titer tests ](/titer-testing)measure an interaction between a viral or bacterial particles and the immune system. Medical researchers agree that when an adequate antibody titer is present, the person is considered to be immune. Titers can be used to determine the need for greater immunity and are the exact reflection of the ability of the immune system to respond to an antigen. Getting the titer done allows a parent or doctor to make an informed decision based on facts. The tests below are currently available to determine the potential need for the - Influenza A and B [Polio](/polio-titer-test) - vaccines (adult \"pneumonia shot\" and pediatric Prevnar) Many MD's Resist Vaccine [Titer Testing](/titer-testing) It should come as no surprise, that most MD's (especially the older ones) are hesitant to adjust any clinical regimen they have adopted or is accepted as \"usual and customary.\" All children brought in by well meaning parents are vaccinated with all doses of recommended vaccine, even if the additional doses are not needed to support the antibody response. I'm sure any DC and intelligent parents would agree that vaccination protocols should not be compulsory and even worse a one-size-fits-all regimen. In veterinary medicine, there is increasing evidence that over-vaccination is linked to acute and chronic diseases in animals. Dr. Jean Dobbs, once considered a rebel by the veterinary profession, has uncovered this link and speaks nationally on the topic of over-vaccination. Subsequently, veterinarians have begun to use annual [titer tests ](/titer-testing)to determine the need for additional vaccinations. This same option has been available for not only Fido but also we humans. The escalating numbers of illnesses seen in children across America are finally being attributed to the large numbers of vaccines children are receiving. It's no secret that more than 100 vaccine antigens and measurable amounts of chemicals are injected into children by the time they are 5 years of age. Because [titers](/titer-testing) are not routinely ordered, children with acceptable immunity are being over vaccinated with boosters that they simply do not need and would never need. Who should get a [titer test](/titer-testing)? - Parents who want to know their child's [immunity levels.](/titer-testing) - Parents who want to know if the vaccines they did have done \"worked\" - Parents who want the ability to easily refute compulsory vaccination in schools for their child having acceptable levels of immunity. - Parents that want to use natural means to bring their child's [immunity](/titer-testing)up to an acceptable level using natural supplementation. - Adults who are being required to obtain vaccinations for work. What's a Parent To Do? In my opinion, getting one's child vaccinated is a personal choice and that should be based on fact rather than a philosophy or passion about a cause. As for me and my house, what I would do today would be a bit different than in 1981 and 1985 when our children were born. First, I would get [titer testing ](/titer-testing)performed to properly check immunity levels. If all were well...I would excitedly say, \"up yours compulsory vaccination laws\". Second, if my child was deficient, I would contact a board certified Chiropractic Internist ASAP. Go to their website at www.councildid.com for more information. These men and women are dedicated to making our profession the natural physicians of choice for primary care for all Americans. Third, if all attempts to bring my child's immune levels to an acceptable level failed...I'd get only the vaccines required to bring my child up to an acceptable level of immunity. Building immunity using natural supplementation in all age groups is a primary function of the advanced training for Chiropractic Internists. My personal favorite and our doctor is Dr. Robert W. Smith located in Baton Rouge, LA. There are hundreds of others across the USA. Everything can be pretty much handled by phone or email.
