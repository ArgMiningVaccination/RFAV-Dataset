M. Keck observatories. The Institute also co-founded and co-manages the Laser Interferometer Gravitational- wave Observatory (LIGO). The Institute's extraordinary faculty, students, postdoctoral scholars, and staff produce transformative breakthroughs in fields ranging from quantum science and engineering to bioinformatics and the nature of life itself, from human behavior and economics to energy and sustain - ability. Caltech faculty and alumni have earned national and internation - al recognition, including 45 Nobel Prizes. Together with JPL, Caltech is Pasadena's largest employer and a source of programs that benefit the entire city. To learn more about Caltech, visit caltech.edu/about. MISSION The mission of the California Institute of Technology is to expand human knowledge and benefit society through research integrated with education. We investigate the most challenging, fundamental problems in science and technology in a singularly collegial, interdisciplinary atmosphere, while educating outstanding students to become creative members of society. HISTORICAL SKETCH In September of 1891, Pasadena philanthropist Amos G. Throop (pro - nounced Troop) established Throop University, the institution that would eventually become Caltech. Throop University opened its doors with 31 students and a six- member faculty. Throop might have remained simply a good local school had it not been for the arrival in Pasadena of astronomer George Ellery Hale. The first director of the Mount Wilson Observatory, Introduction10 General InformationHale became a member of Throop's board of trustees in 1907 and began molding the school into a first-class institution for engineering and scientific research and education. Hale would be joined later by chemist Arthur A. Noyes and physicist Robert A. Millikan. By 1920, the school was renamed the California Institute of Technology, and the enrollment was nine graduate students and 359 undergraduates, with a faculty of 60; a decade later there were 138 graduate students, 510 undergraduates, and a faculty of 180. At the present time there are nearly 1,000 undergraduates, 1,300 graduate students, and some 300 professorial faculty and more than 550 post - doctoral scholars. Caltech has more than 24,000 living alumni all over the world, many of them eminent in their fields of engineering, science, law, medicine, academia, and entrepreneurship. Caltech's divisional structure, which began to coalesce in 1926, today comprises the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering (BBE); the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering (CCE); the Division of Engineering and Applied Science (EAS); the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences (GPS); the Division of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS); and the Division of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy (PMA). To learn more about Caltech's his - tory and the people behind the Institute's success, visit archives.caltech.edu. EDUCATION AND RESEARCH Students at Caltech work toward undergraduate and graduate degrees alongside their intellectual equals in an academic environment that emphasizes interdisciplinary teamwork, critical thinking, mutual sup - port, and a deep understanding of core concepts and principles across fields. Caltech students, faculty, and postdoctoral scholars are addressing fundamental scientific questions and pressing societal challenges. Together, they are expanding our understanding of the universe, shifting paradigms, launching new fields, and inventing the technologies of the future. Caltech is home to more than 50 research centers and institutes. Some 90 percent of Caltech undergraduates participate in research during their time here. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH Caltech offers undergraduates 28 majors (called \"options\") and 13 minors across the six academic divisions. The most popular options are computer science, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and physics. Caltech also offers interdisci - plinary programs in applied physics, biochemistry, bioengineering, computation and neural systems, control and dynamical systems, environmental science and engineering, geobiology and astrobiology, geochemistry, and planetary astronomy. General Information11 Historical SketchThe Institute offers the opportunity for qualified students to engage in research early in their careers under the supervision of a faculty member. There are four principal avenues for undergraduate research: the senior thesis, the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF) program, research courses for academic credit, and research for pay under a faculty member's grant or contract. The senior thesis involves original research under the mentorship of a faculty member, an effort that develops research, writing, and pre - sentation skills that together provide an excellent preparation for future graduate studies and/or professional life. The SURF program provides continuing undergraduate students the opportunity to work on an individual research project in a tutorial rela - tionship with a mentor, usually a member of the Caltech/JPL research community, but occasionally a faculty member at another college or university. The work is carried out during a 10-week period in the sum - mer, after which SURF students submit a written report describing the project, methods, and results of their work. Most options offer undergraduate research courses in order to encourage research participation during the academic year; students should consult listings and descriptions of opportunities. In some circumstances, faculty will hire students to conduct research. Students should discuss this option with a prospective mentor. Students with work-study financial aid should also contact Caltech's Career Advising and Experiential Learning (CAEL) about how to apply funding to research positions. Learn more about undergraduate programs and research at sfp. caltech.edu/. GRADUATE PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH Students can enroll in Master of Science, Degree of Engineer, Doctor of Philosophy, BS/MS, and MD/PhD degree programs; the majority of graduate students are enrolled in the PhD program. The academic work of the Institute is organized into six divisions: Biology and Biological Engineering (bbe.caltech.edu); Chemistry and Chemical Engineering (cce.caltech.edu); Engineering and Applied Science (eas.caltech.edu); Geological and Planetary Sciences (gps.caltech.edu); Humanities and Social Sciences (hss.caltech.edu); and Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy (pma.caltech.edu). Graduate study at the Institute is divided further into a number of individual graduate options (degree programs), which are supervised by those professors whose interests and research are closely related to the area of the option. Entering graduate students are admitted into one of these options. The most popular options for graduate work are chemistry, physics, electrical engineering, and biology. Learn more at gradoffice.caltech.edu. ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIPS Caltech maintains an array of external partnerships with other insti - tutions in Southern California. These partnerships provide pre-med Education and Research12 General Informationstudents with opportunities to work in area hospitals and train with practicing clinicians; allow students to participate in ROTC through a joint program with USC; and offer a 3/2 dual degree for students from 13 select liberal-arts colleges. Caltech undergraduate students can cross-register at Occidental College and Art Center College of Design, and the Institute maintains relations with research partners such as the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UCSD. Undergraduate students can also study abroad in Cambridge, Copenhagen, Edinburgh, London, Paris, Melbourne, or the University of Chicago during their junior or senior years For graduate students, joint programs between Caltech and both the USC Keck School of Medicine and the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine grant MD/PhD degrees. FACULTY RESEARCH The contributions of Caltech's faculty have earned national and interna - tional recognition. Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities (AAU) in 1934 and remains a research university with \"very high\" research activity, primarily in STEM fields. Research is central to Caltech, and the Institute manages over $400 million in sponsored awards annually. Its largest federal funding agencies are the National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA), National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Defense, and Department of Energy. More than a quarter of Caltech's active and emeritus faculty members are members of the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and/or are fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Caltech receives more invention disclosures and holds more patents per faculty member than any other university in the United States. POSTDOCTORAL AND SENIOR POSTDOCTORAL SCHOLARS More than 550 early-career scientists and engineers conduct research at Caltech as postdoctoral scholars. In addition, JPL hosts postdoc - toral scholars whose studies cover many aspects of Earth, planetary, astrophysical, and technology research. All scholars work under the supervision of professorial faculty members or JPL researchers. RESEARCH CENTERS AND INSTITUTES Research centers and institutes across campus bring together scien - tists and engineers to collaborate and add innovative and diverse per - spectives to tackle society's most pressing challenges.

JPL's 6,500 employees are tightly connected to the campus research mission and together enable the Institute to push the frontiers of space and Earth sci - ence. JPL is currently responsible for operating 39 NASA missions, includ - ing the Curiosity and Perseverance Mars rovers, Juno Jupiter orbiter, and the Sentinel-6/Michael Freilich Earth science mission, all of which are pio - neering new approaches for space exploration. Caltech and JPL engage in collaborations and joint appointments of faculty, lecturers, and visitors. Learn more at jpl.nasa.gov. Jet Propulsion Laboratory16 General InformationSTUDENT LIFE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT RESIDENCES Seven of the undergraduate student residences are situated on either side of the Olive Walk near the southeastern end of the campus. The original four\u2014Blacker, Dabney, Fleming, and Ricketts\u2014were built in 1931 from the plans of Mr. Gordon B. Kaufmann, in the Mediterranean style to harmonize with the adjacent Athenaeum. The other three, designed by Smith, Powell and Morgridge, were completed in 1960, and are named Lloyd, Page, and Ruddock. Each of these seven residences is a separate unit with its own dining room and lounge, providing accommodations for between 65 and 100 students, depending on the facility. Each has its own elected officers; a long history of shared governance gives students a great deal of influence over their living environments. Residential life coordinators (RLCs) are specially trained full-time university employees specializing in college student development, community building, counseling, and crisis intervention. The RLCs supervise the resident associates (RAs) on programming and overall student wellness. The RLCs also assist Housing with the management and daily operations of the residences. Each residence has one or more RA, who are typically graduate stu - dents. Mail is delivered daily to the student mailboxes. Students should use their mailbox number, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91126, to facilitate handling of mail at the campus post office. For more information, please visit housing.caltech.edu. Avery House Made possible by a gift from trustee R. Stanton Avery, this undergrad - uate residence and innovative residential complex was designed by Moore, Ruble, Yudell, and completed in September 1996. Located at the north end of the campus, Avery has an RLC, two RAs, two faculty apartments, and rooms for about 136 undergraduates. Its dining facil - ities, meeting rooms, lounges, and library are designed to encourage informal faculty-student interaction and to attract all members of the campus community to join in this interaction. Avery hosts programs and social events that facilitate involvement between residents and fac - ulty in residence. Bechtel Residence Established in the fall of 2018 and located at the northeast edge of campus, the Bechtel Residence is the first residence to open on campus since 1996. Bechtel is named in honor of Caltech life trustee Stephen D. Bechtel, Jr., the founder of the S. D. Bechtel Foundation. The 95,000-square-foot residence is a multigenerational residence open to all undergraduates with: 211 student bedrooms arranged as singles and in suites; six RA and one RLC apartments; and two facul - ty-in-residence apartments. Bechtel was intentionally designed to pro - vide the community with the greatest flexibility to maximize space as well as to encourage broader interaction, engagement, and residential General Information17 Historical Sketchlife programming among residents. The facility includes three kitchens; eight common areas/study rooms; six laundry rooms; a 400-seat dining hall and servery; and support spaces. STUDENT RESOURCES AND ACTIVITIES Hameetman Center The Hameetman Center, which opened in 2019, is a new campus center built on the site of the former Winnett Student Center. The Hameetman Center replaces Winnett as Caltech's central community gathering place. The 24,000-square-foot two-story center is named in honor of the Hameetman Foundation and Caltech trustee Fred Hameetman (BS '62) and his wife, Joyce, who provided the initial fund - ing to initiate the design of the reimagined campus hub. It features a large public lounge, an expanded Red Door Marketplace, the Caltech Store, music rehearsal facilities, student club rooms, a multipurpose room, and a conference room. The rehearsal facility is made possible thanks to a gift from Emeritus Professor of Theoretical Physics Steven Frautschi and his wife, Mie. Residential Experience The Office of Residential Experience (ORE) has responsibility for the oversight of Caltech's residential programs, including programs carried out in the undergraduate houses, graduate student residences, and the Bechtel and Marks-Braun communities. The ORE works collaboratively with the Residential Life Coordinators, Resident Advisors, the Interhouse Committee, and other groups to ensure that student leaders in all our residential communities are trained and that there are programs in place to support their development. This is part of the shared governance that is central to the Caltech residential experience. The residence experience also includes member of the faculty who live in the undergraduate resi - dences. The Faculty in Residence (FIR) Team establishes an academic life and culture in Bechtel and Avery House. FIRs bridge the classroom experi - ence by hosting regular conversations over dinner and develop specialized academic programing, which can include: extracurricular activities, tours and excursions, cooperative community service projects, special events, and guest speaker programs. All residences and houses, including all their activities and programs, are expected to comply with Institute policies, Student Affairs policies, and the Caltech Code of Conduct. Potential Policy or Code of Conduct violations by a house or residence will be referred to the Caltech Routing committee. If the Routing Committee determines that the incident(s) is part of a Residential or House program or activity, it will be referred to ORE for further action. In this case, the Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs and Residential Experience (AVP) or desig - nee, will either (a) manage the situation directly with the community so the concerns can be addressed, or (b) initiate an investigation into the incident. If an investigation is conducted, the investigators will report their findings to the AVP who will make a decision concerning whether any violations occurred and any consequences that may be imposed. Student Life18 General InformationThe decision of the AVP may be appealed to the Vice President for Student Affairs within 10 days of the decision. During the investigation, the AVP can suspend activities of the house or residence until further notice if deemed necessary for the health, safety, or the other benefit of the community. A range of outcomes may be considered as consequences to the house or residence if the group is found to have engaged in a policy violation. Possible sanctions including community education and/or suspension of the activity or event. Examples of events that warrant a response include an unreg - istered event or party, mistreatment of members, and hazing. If the potential situation also includes a potential policy violation involving an individual student(s), the student(s) will be referred to the appropriate Dean's office and may be subject to disciplinary action. The Student Activities Center The SAC is located in the basement of the south undergraduate hous - ing complex and is open for student use 24 hours a day. The SAC provides office space for the officers of the undergraduate student gov - ernment, working space for student publications, rehearsal space for musical activities, and space for many other student-oriented functions. Whether students are interested in music, publications, student gov - ernment, gaming, photography, or simply finding a room for their group to meet in, the SAC will probably have what is needed. The center also houses the South House laundry room and has several club rooms, a small library, a shop, and a movie screening room\u2014most are open 24 hours. Faculty-Student Relations Faculty-student coordination and cooperation with regard to campus affairs are secured through the presence of students on faculty com - mittees, by faculty-student conferences, and by other mechanisms. Freshman Advisers Each member of the freshman class is assigned a faculty adviser and is a member of a small advising group. The adviser follows the freshman's progress and provides advice on any questions or problems that the freshman may have. Option Advisers Each member of the three undergraduate upper classes is assigned an option adviser, a faculty member in the option in which the student is enrolled. The adviser takes an interest in the student's selection of courses and progress toward a degree, and, eventually, in assisting the student toward satisfactory placement in industry or in graduate school. Normally, the association between student and adviser is established before the beginning of the sophomore year and continues through graduation. Athletics, Physical Education, & Recreation (APER) Caltech supports an extensive program of competitive athletics. As a member of NCAA Division III and the Southern California Intercollegiate General Information19 Historical SketchAthletic Conference, Caltech participates in intercollegiate competition in 20 sports\u201410 each for men and women. All teams compete during a regular season, with many also competing or qualifying for the con - ference tournament in their respective sport. Individual scholar-athletes and teams distinguishing themselves can earn the privilege of partici - pating in NCAA regional and national championships. Caltech also sponsors vigorous club sports programs and intramural competition. Club sports include Ultimate Frisbee, volleyball, badmin - ton and soccer. Intramural competitions are contested by residence house teams in several sports, including soccer, dodgeball, kickball, Ultimate Frisbee, basketball, volleyball, and floorball. Approximately 25 percent of Caltech undergraduates participate in intercollegiate athlet - ics and over 80 percent participate in some form of organized athletic competition each year. Outdoor athletic facilities include a brand-new turf mixed-use baseball and soccer field, a second natural grass mixed-use field, an all-weather running track, eight tennis courts, and two 25-yard, eight-lane swimming pools.

The department is also responsible for management of Caltech's recreation programs and physical education curriculum. More information can be found at gocaltech.com. Interhouse Activities The president of each undergraduate house represents that house on the Interhouse Committee (IHC), which helps to handle matters affect - ing the houses, in conjunction with staff from Student Affairs. Members of the IHC are expected to be enrolled and in good standing, both aca - demically (eligible, and not on probation) and disciplinarily (not on pro - bation), during their tenure in office. The IHC works in conjunction with the APER department to conduct intramural competitions as described above, and conducts its own Discobolus Trophy competition, in which a house may challenge the house holding the trophy to a mutually agreed upon contest. ASCIT The undergraduate student body forms the membership of a corpo - ration known as the Associated Students of the California Institute of Technology, Inc., or ASCIT. Governed by a board of directors consisting of six elected officers, it is involved in many aspects of student life; oversees publication of The Tech, our undergraduate student news - paper; the Big T yearbook; a literary magazine called Totem; and the Little t, which provides lots of helpful information to incoming students. A directory, along with other student information, such as campus positions, links to the Interhouse Committee (IHC) and Academics and Research Committee (ARC), and other helpful information is available online at donut.caltech.edu. Student Life20 General InformationBesides overseeing student publications and coordinating activities and policies, the ASCIT Board of Directors administers the corpora - tion's finances. ASCIT sponsors a wide variety of special-interest clubs and programs, working closely with Student Activities and Programs part of the Office of Residential Experience. The student government is active in campus affairs. The student members of standing faculty committee ensure that undergraduate opinion is considered seriously. Excellent informal relations between students and faculty and between students and administration promote discussion of mutual concern and goodwill. Student-faculty conferences are held every other year and serve to promote communication mainly around academic topics. Graduate Student Council The Graduate Student Council (GSC) is the student government for Caltech graduate students. It is the mission of the GSC to maximize the quality of life for the graduate student community at Caltech. The GSC Board of Directors interacts with the Institute's administrative bodies and is formed of subcommittees dedicated to academic sup - port, advocating graduate student issues, sharing student news, and organizing social events. Student Leadership Expectations Graduate and undergraduate student leaders who are in either elected or appointed positions must be enrolled and in good standing with the Institute. Honor System The Honor Code, embodied in the phrase \"No member shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community,\" is the fun - damental principle of conduct for all students and extends to all phases of campus life, including scholastic and extracurricular activities, relations among students, and relations between students and faculty. The Honor System is the most important tradition of the undergraduate student body. The Board of Control (Board), which is composed of elected student representatives, is charged with monitoring the academic Honor System for undergraduates, investigating course work violations, and making recommendations to the dean of undergraduate students. The purpose, composition, duties, and procedures of the Board, as well as the roles and responsibilities of the deans, faculty, vice president for student affairs, complainants (students reporting suspected violations), respondents (those against whom an allegation of an academic Honor System viola - tion is made), witnesses, and other participants in the process, are set forth in Article XIII of the Associated Students of the California Institute of Technology bylaws. The Board investigates the allegations of academic Honor Code violations by interviewing the respondent and any witnesses, and assessing the relevant evidence, and votes on recommendations to the dean about whether or not an Honor Code violation has been commit - ted and its scope (conviction/dismissal), how to nullify the unfair advantage gained (nullification), and how to uphold the Honor Code and protect the Caltech community from future violations (protection). The dean makes the General Information21 Historical Sketchdecisions after considering the Board's case report and any objections and further evidence raised by the respondent. The concepts of conviction, nullification, and protection are described in greater depth in the Honor Code Handbook provided to all students and available on line at deans.caltech.edu/HonorCode. The Conduct Review Committee, composed of students, faculty, and staff, hears cases involving non-academic Honor System and Institute policy violations for undergraduate students, and also makes recommendations to the dean. At their discretion, the dean of under - graduate students, or their designee, may directly handle a matter also involving the Honor System, the Code of Conduct, and Institute Policies for undergraduate students. The Honor System is also an important part of graduate student life. The dean of graduate studies is responsible for reviewing and making decisions concerning alleged Honor Code violations with respect to course-work. The Graduate Honor Council (GHC) serves as a consul - tative resource to the dean. At their discretion, the dean of graduate studies may request that the GHC investigate and hear a case, and provide its recommendations to the dean for final review and decision. All Members of the Graduate Honor Council must be in good standing with the Office of Graduate Studies and must attend a formal training before they may serve on a case. Examples of Honor Code violations include, but are not limited to, plagiarism, violations of the collaboration policy in a class, and/or using resources that were strictly prohibited for homework and/or exams. Incidents that are not handled by the dean of graduate studies include accusations of research misconduct, which are handled by the Office of Research Compliance; grade disputes, which are handled by the office of the provost. Institute Policy viola - tions are handled by the office of the dean of graduate studies or the appropriate administrative organization. Student Body Publications The publications of the student body include a weekly paper, The California Tech; an undergraduate research journal, CURJ; a literary magazine, Totem; a student handbook, the Little t, which gives a survey of student activities and organizations and serves as a campus direc - tory; a yearbook, Big T; an online undergraduate research opportunities handbook, UROH; and Caltech Letters, an online campus publication designed to let students talk about their research and their viewpoints on science with the broader world. These publications, staffed entirely by students, provide an opportunity for interested students to obtain valuable experience in creative writing, photography, artwork, reporting and editing, advertising, and business management. Performing and Visual Arts The Institute provides directors and facilities for choirs, concert band, jazz band, symphony orchestra, numerous chamber music ensembles, guitar classes, a theater program, ceramics and studio arts classes. These activities are centered in the Music and Theater Arts houses on Hill Avenue along the eastern edge of campus. Student Life22 General InformationStudent Clubs All student clubs must be officially recognized in order to be in and remain in good standing with the Institute. To become officially recog - nized, the club must annually apply for recognition. You will find details regarding this process outlined in the Student Club Handbook, which is available on the Office of Residential Experience website (ore.caltech. edu). Once the club is officially recognized, it may plan on maintaining that recognition for the duration of the current academic year. The details of how to remain in good standing with the Institute are outlined in detail within the Student Club Handbook. These details include club oversight, privileges, responsibilities, finances, and other very important information. A recognized club will receive the following privileges: the ability to recruit members; advertise events; secure funding; conduct officer elections; provide trainings and use Institute facilities for meet - ings and events. Additional, key elements of club recognition include but are not limited to, having an advisor, an appropriate purpose, and a leadership infrastructure. Note that only recognized clubs will be allowed to participate in the annual Club Fair. Clubs at Caltech are expected to follow Institute policy, Student Affairs policies, and the Caltech Code of Conduct. Potential policy or Code of Conduct violations by a club or in connection with a club event will be referred to the assistant vice president for student affairs and residential experience (AVP) or their designee, will either (a) man - age the issue with the club through an appropriate Institute response, or (b) initiate an investigation into the incident. If an investigation is conducted, the investigators will report their findings to the AVP who will make a decision concerning whether any violations occurred and any consequences that may be imposed. The decision of the AVP may be appealed to the vice president for student affairs within 10 days of the decision. During the investigation, the AVP may suspend the club's recog - nition and planned activities, if deemed necessary, for the health, safety, or other benefit of the community. A range of outcomes may be considered as consequences to the club if the group is found to have engaged in a policy violation. Possible sanctions examples include education, suspension of some or all of the group's privileges, or loss of their recognition status with the Institute. If the potential situation also includes a potential policy violation involving an individual stu - dent(s), the student(s) will be referred to the appropriate Dean's office and may be subject to disciplinary action.

AUDITING COURSES Persons affiliated with the Institute may audit courses if they obtain the consent of the instructor in charge of the course, and the dean of undergraduate students or dean of graduate studies, as appropriate, and pay the required fee (contact the Bursar's Office for audit fee). The fees are nonrefundable. Auditing cards may be obtained in the Registrar's Office. Regularly enrolled students and members of the faculty are not charged for auditing. Auditing cards are not required, but the instruc - tor's consent is necessary in all cases. No grades for auditors are reported to the Registrar's Office, and no official record is kept of the work done. Auditing Courses30 General InformationGRADES AND GRADING All permanent grades recorded for freshmen during the first and sec - ond terms they are enrolled will be either P , indicating \"passed,\" or F , indicating \"failed.\" The temporary grade of I (\"incomplete\") may be used as it is for other students. The temporary grade of E may be given to freshmen as described below for other students. It may also be used in a continuing course if the performance of the freshman concerned is not significantly below the current passing level, and if the student is maintaining a steady and substantial improvement; an E given for this reason will be automatically changed to a P if the freshman earns a P for the following term, and will change to an F if the student receives an F for the following term. The grade may not be used in this way for two successive terms nor for the last term of the course. If a first-quarter or second-quarter freshman is enrolled in a course in which the instructor gives letter grades, the registrar will record P for all passing grades. No grades given to a freshman during the first and second quarter in which they are enrolled will be used in computing the cumulative grade-point average. For all students beyond the first and second quarters of their fresh - man year, graduate and undergraduate, letter grades will ordinarily be used to indicate the character of the student's work: A, excellent; B, conditional; F , failed; I, incomplete. P may also be used as described below under Pass/Fail Grading. In addition, grades of A+ and A-, B+ and B-, C+ and C-, and D+ may be used. In any situation in which no grade is reported, the grade shall be assumed to be F . Failed. Means that no credit will be recorded for the course. The units, however, count in computing the student's grade-point aver - age, unless the course was taken on a pass/fail basis. The student may register to repeat the subject in a subsequent term and receive credit without regard to the previous grade, the new grade and units being counted as for any other course, but the original F and units for the course remain on the record. Grades other than E, I, and W are assumed to be based on work completed and evaluated at the time of grade submission. E and I Grades E Grades. At their discretion, instructors may give students who have not completed their work for a course by the end of the term a grade of E. The grade E indicates deficiencies that may be made up without repeating the course. If the instructor does not specify a date on the grade report sheet for completion of the work, students receiving an E will have until Add Day of the following term to complete their work for that course. Instructors may, however, require the work for the course to be completed by an earlier date. In addition, students should be aware that E grades can impact ability to meet eligibility requirements. If an E grade impacts a student's academic standing, the grade may be due by the first day of classes. See section Scholastic Requirements for additional information. If a student receives an E and does not complete the work by the General Information31 Historical Sketchdate specified by the instructor or by Add Day (or a different date spec - ified by the instructor), the grade will be changed to an F . Adequate time must be afforded to instructors to grade the work and to submit the final grade to the registrar. It is the responsibility of a student receiving an E to confirm that the registrar has recorded the terms for satisfying the completion of the work in the course. With the written permission of the instructor, a student may extend the E grade past Add Day of the following term, but doing so will cause an additional E grade to be registered. Each additional extension of the E will be until the date specified by the instructor or until Add Day of the following term, but in each case will require the written permission of the instructor and the registering of an additional E grade. E Count Limitations. After an undergraduate student has been awarded the grade of E six times, they are not eligible to receive E grades in any subsequent term. A petition for an E in a subsequent term may be approved by the Undergraduate Academic Standards and Honors (UASH) Committee in an exceptional case. Such a petition requires the support of the instructor and the dean or associate dean of undergraduate students. I Grades. The grade I is given only in case of sickness or other emergency that justifies noncompletion of the work at the usual time. It is given at the discretion of the instructor, after approval by the dean or associate dean of students or the dean of graduate studies. If a student is seeking an I grade due to a severe exacerbation or onset of a disability that occurred during the term, they should contact Caltech Accessibility Services for Students (CASS) at cass@caltech.edu. The time period within which the grade of I is to be made up should be indicated on the grade sheet, or students receiving an I will have until Add Day of the following term to complete their work for the course. In addition, students should be aware that I grades can impact ability to meet eligibility requirements. If an I grade impacts a student's academic standing, the grade may be due by the first day of classes. See section Scholastic Requirements for additional information. Students receiving grades of E or I should consult with their instructors, and one of the deans, at the time of issue regarding the work required and the time allowed. This time should, in most cases, coincide with the date fixed in the calendar for removal of conditions and incompletes (Add Day), and in fact if no other time is specified, this date will be assumed. However, except under extraordinary circumstances, the time for the com - pletion of the work will not be extended beyond one year after the date in which the grade of E or I was given. In the absence of an earlier deadline, an E will turn into an F one year after the date on which the E was given, and an I grade will turn into a W (standing for \"withdrawn\") one year after the date on which the I grade was given. Waiving of this one year rule is done in only the most exceptional of circumstances and requires the agreement, before that one year anniversary, of the dean of undergraduate students, chair of UASH, and executive officer of the department in which the course was taken. Grades of E and I shall not be considered in calculating a student's grade-point average. Grades and Grading32 General InformationPetitions and Exceptions Once recorded, a grade will only be changed on the basis of error. Such a change may be made only with the approval of the Undergraduate Academic Standards and Honors Committee or of the Graduate Studies Committee, whichever has jurisdiction. Petitions by undergraduate students for late drops (i.e., requests to drop a course after Drop Day) will be considered by the UASH Committee, but will only be approved if circumstances beyond the student's control prevented them from dropping a course or courses by the posted deadline. Such petitions must be submitted before the end of the term following the term when the course was taken, or within the first term of return, if the student is on leave in the term following the term when the course was taken. If approved, a W will be recorded on the student's transcript in place of a grade for that course. W's will not be included in the computation of the student's grade-point average. Courses will be expunged from the student's record only in exceptional circumstances, at the discretion of the UASH Committee. Petitions from graduating seniors submitted later than the first UASH meeting following graduation (which normally takes place shortly after graduation) will not be accepted for consideration, except to correct an error by the Institute. Grade-Point Average Grade-point average is computed by dividing the total number of cred - its earned in a term or an academic year by the total number of units taken in the corresponding period. Units for which a grade of F has been received are counted, even though the course may have subse - quently been repeated. Grades of P or F obtained in courses graded on a pass/fail basis are not included in computing grade-point average. Each course at the Institute is assigned a number of units corre - sponding to the total number of hours per week devoted to that sub - ject, including classwork, laboratory, and the normal outside prepara - tion. Credits are awarded as shown in the table below.

All other students, undergraduate and graduate, in courses with numbers under 200 will receive letter grades unless the course is designated \"graded pass/fail'' or unless, when it is allowed, the student submits a change to the course's grading scheme on or before Drop Day. In courses with numbers 200 or greater that are not designated either \"graded pass/fail'' or \"letter grades only,'' the instructor may decide separately for each student what class of grades to use. All research courses shall be designated \"graded pass/fail.'' All reading courses, seminar courses, or other courses that do not have a formal class structure shall be designated \"graded pass/fail'' unless the option secures an exemption from the Curriculum Committee or the Graduate Studies Committee and from the Faculty Board. A grade on the pass/fail system should be P if it would have been a D or better on the letter grade system. (Note that there is no D- grade.) The standards of failure in courses in which only pass/fail grades are used should be the same as they would be if the course were letter graded. Any instructor may, at their discretion, specify prior to registra - tion that their course, if not classified by the above regulations, is to be graded on a \"letter grades only'' basis or is to be graded pass/fail only, subject to possible review by the responsible option. The registrar must be notified of such specification two weeks before the beginning of registration. (Note: If the grading scheme is changed during the term, it is changed for everyone.) Each term, any student may select, subject to requirements imposed by the student's option, two elective courses in which they are to be graded on a pass/fail basis if the course is not designated as \"letter grades only'' and is not specifically required for the degree in their option. To make this election, a student must submit a change to the course's grading scheme in REGIS, or submit a written request to the Registrar's Office, on or before Drop Day. This election may be reversed or rein - stated at any time before the deadline. Students must resubmit their schedule in REGIS after all changes, and the pass/fail elec - tion must be approved by the student's adviser. The instructor must allow any eligible student to make this election. Grades and Grading34 General Information Of the units offered to satisfy the requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree, no more than 90 may be in courses graded pass/fail because of the student's election (this does not include those courses taken in the first two terms freshmen year or those designated pass/fail by the instructor, option, or curricu - lum committee). Procedures for Resolving Disputes over Grading At Caltech, the instructor has full responsibility for assigning grades to students enrolled in a course. On occasion, a student may not under - stand how a grade was determined and may seek further information. The student should first meet with the instructor or teaching assistant to discuss the grade. If after doing so the student believes the grade is unjustified or capricious, the following procedures are available. Before the end of the term following the term when the grade was issued, the student should contact the academic mediator, appointed by the provost, who will work with the student and instructor to resolve the problem. If the mediation effort is unsatisfactory to the student, they may request a formal review by an appropriate executive officer or academic officer. The executive officer will review the case and report the decision in writing to the student. If the executive officer decides that a change of grade is warranted, or if the student requests a further appeal, these shall be requested of the division chair. At the discretion of the division chair, a committee may be appointed to review the case. The committee members should interview everyone involved in the case (the student, the course instructor, the teaching assistant, and anyone else with relevant information), and make a written recommen - dation to the division chair. Only the division chair can authorize the registrar to enter a new grade in the student's transcript. NOTICES AND AGREEMENTS ACADEMIC RECORDS OF VETERANS The Institute maintains a written record of a student's previous edu - cation. This is part of the student's official transcript, and included on this is a summary of any prior college-level education. A true copy of a transcript of college-level work at other institutions is maintained as part of the student's record. The amount of credit granted for prior training is indicated on the student's official transcript and, where this results in the shortening of a required training period in the case of a veteran, the Veterans Administration is notified. The Institute's official transcript for each student shows the progress that student is making at the Institute. There is a record of each course enrolled in each term with a grade recorded for the course. The total number of units earned is kept so that the record will show continued progress toward the degree sought. The final grades are recorded at the end of each term of the school year, and the accumulative perma - nent record has on it grades for all subjects taken at the Institute. No General Information35 Historical Sketchstudent is allowed to enroll repeatedly in a course and withdraw with - out penalty. If a student enrolls in a course, they are expected to com - plete the course or receive a failing grade unless they withdraw from the course prior to the deadline for dropping courses. All students must maintain a minimum load equivalent to 12 quarter hours each term; no student may drop courses that would bring them below this level of effort. At any time when the student falls below the required number of units, fails to receive satisfactory grades, or engages in unsatisfactory conduct, the record is marked to indicate this, and the student is for - bidden to continue at the Institute. The grading system of the Institute is A+ (excellent) to F (failed). An A+ is equivalent to 4.3 and an F to 0.0. A student must maintain a grade-point average of 1.9 in any term in order to be able to enroll in a successive term at the Institute. A minimum 1.9 overall grade-point average is required for graduation. A student who drops below the required average (1.9 for a given term) is dismissed and must petition for reinstatement. A student may be reinstated by the Undergraduate Academic Standards and Honors Committee and, if so, is required to earn a 1.9 GPA during the immediately following term. The Veterans Administration is notified when a veteran is academically dismissed or is making unsatisfactory progress toward a degree. Since the Institute requires all students to carry a minimum full load that corresponds to 12 quarter hours each term, any student who finishes a term in good standing is considered to have made satisfactory progress. If a student withdraws from a course before the final date for withdrawal, no grade is given in that course. The time spent in school counts, however, and the student may be considered to have not made satisfactory progress in the event of such withdrawal. In order to withdraw from any course, a student must drop the course in REGIS or submit a written request to the Registrar's Office. The instructor should maintain the date on which the student was last in official attendance in that course. If a student reenrolls in that course and successfully completes it, that fact will be noted on their official transcript. VETERANS BENEFITS AND TRANSITION ACT OF 2018 (SECTION 103) Caltech adheres to the requirements of and complies with the Veterans Benefits and Transition Act of 2018, specifically S2248 PL 115-407 Section 103. This provision was effective August 1, 2019 for any students who are considered \"a covered individual\" using \"Chapter 33: Post 9/11 GI Bill\u00ae\" benefits or any participants in \"Chapter 31: Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program\" benefits at a pub - lic, private for-profit, or not-for-profit institution regarding unpaid tuition and fees. Caltech permits any covered individual to attend or participate in courses during the period beginning on the date on which the individ - ual provides to the educational institution a certificate of eligibility for entitlement to educational assistance under chapter 31 or 33 of this title. In accordance with S2248 PL 115-407 Section 103 Caltech will not impose any penalty, including the assessment of late fees, the denial of Notices and Agreements36 General Informationaccess to classes, libraries, or other Institute facilities, or the require - ment that a covered individual borrow additional funds, on any covered individual because of the individual's inability to meet their financial obligations to the institution due to the delayed disbursement of a pay - ment to be provided by the Secretary under chapter 31 or 33 of this title. GI Bill\u00ae is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official U.S. government Web site at www.benefits. va.gov/gibill. ACCESS TO STUDENT RECORDS The Institute maintains educational records for each student that include name, address, student identification number (including Social Security number), information on parents, guardian, and spouse, gener - al information on academic status at the Institute, previous school data, results of standardized admissions examinations, courses previously taken or being taken, credits, grades, as well as other educational records. Applicants for financial aid have an additional file holding those records. The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and Caltech policy afford students certain rights as well as establish limitations with respect to student educational records. These rights and limitations are as follows: 1. Caltech permits disclosure of educational records, without con - sent of the student, to Institute officials with legitimate educa - tional interests in them. An Institute official is a person employed by the Institute in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support-staff position (including security personnel and health and diversity center staff), a person or company with whom the Institute has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, consultants, contractors, or collection agent), a person serving on the Board of Trustees, or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another Institute official in performing their tasks. An Institute official has a legitimate educational interest if they need to review an educational record in order to fulfill their profes - sional responsibility. They are available to the registrar, provost, president, general counsel, vice president for development and institute relations, vice president for student affairs, dean of graduate studies, dean of undergraduate students, director of financial aid, and faculty of the Institute and their respective staffs for the normal academic and business purposes of the Institute. Records involving financial aid are maintained by the director of financial aid, and are available to the director and staff, to the dean of graduate studies and staff, to the Faculty Committee on Scholarships and Financial Aid, and to the Faculty Committee on Graduate Study, for the purpose of granting and administering the Institute's financial aid program. Except as authorized by federal or state law or regulation, none of these General Information37 Historical Sketcheducation records nor any personally-identifiable information contained therein, other than directory information (see below), may be made available to anyone else, other than the student, without the consent of the student. Where the student consents to disclosure of personally-identifiable information from the stu - dent's education records and Caltech chooses to disclose such information, if the student so requests, the Institute will provide the student with a copy of the records disclosed. The Institute will maintain a record of each request for access to and each disclosure of personally-identifiable information from the educa - tion records of a student, as required by applicable federal law or regulation. 2. Students are allowed access to their educational records as follows: A student may inspect and review their academic transcript during normal working hours. To inspect and review other records, the student must provide a written request to the registrar or to the director of financial aid or to the dean of grad - uate studies or to the dean of undergraduate students, or their designees, as appropriate. A mutually-convenient time will be arranged within 45 days after receipt of the request for the stu - dent to inspect and review the records in their file. At that time the student may examine all educational records in the file with the exception of those specifically exempted by Part 99 of Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations. If circumstances effec - tively prevent the student from exercising their right to review their education records, the Institute will make other arrange - ments. If a student believes the educational records relating to the student contain information that is inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of the student's rights of privacy, the student may ask the Institute to amend the record. The Institute will decide whether to amend the records as requested within a reasonable time after receiving the request. If the registrar, or the director of financial aid, or the dean of graduate studies, or the dean of undergraduate students, or their designees, decide not to amend the record as requested, the student will be informed of the decision and of their right to a hearing. The student will have, on request, an opportunity for a hearing to challenge the content of the records on the grounds that the information contained in the records is inaccurate, misleading or in violation of the priva - cy rights of the student. To request a hearing, the student must submit a written request to the vice president for student affairs or their designee. The vice president for student affairs or his/her designee will schedule such a hearing within a reasonable time after receipt of the request and will notify the student at a time reasonably in advance of the hearing of its date, time, and place. The student will be afforded a full and fair opportunity to present evidence relevant to the issues raised and may be assisted or represented by individuals of their choice at their own expense, including an attorney. The decision of the vice president or designee will be in writing, will be rendered within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the hearing, and will be final. This Notices and Agreements38 General Informationdecision will be based solely upon the evidence presented at the hearing and will include a summary of the evidence and of the reasons for the decision. If, as a result of the hearing, the Institute decides that the information is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the privacy rights of the student, the Institute will amend the record accordingly, and inform the student of the amendment in writing. However, if, as a result of the hearing, the Institute decides that the information is not inac - curate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the privacy rights of a student, it will inform the student of the right to place in the educational records a statement commenting on the information in the records and/or setting forth any reasons for disagreeing with the decision of the Institute. If the Institute places a state - ment in the education records of the student, the Institute will maintain the statement with the contested part of the record for as long as the record is maintained and will disclose the state - ment whenever it discloses the portion of the record to which the statement relates. 3. The Institute considers the following to be directory information: a student's name, UID, addresses (permanent, campus and local/off-campus, and email), associated telephone listings, ID photograph, date and place of birth, major field of study, year in school, current enrollment status, expected date of graduation, name of academic adviser, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height if a member of an ath - letic team, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, thesis title, hometown, and most recently attended educational agency or institution. Directory information may be made avail - able to requestors at the Institute's discretion. Any student may, however, have part or all of this information withheld by notifying the registrar in writing. That information will then be withheld for the balance of that academic year. If the information is to be withheld in subsequent years, new requests must be filed. 4. A student will not be required to waive any rights regarding access to educational records. However, a student may volun - tarily waive in writing right of access to confidential statements made by third parties respecting admission to educational agen - cies or institutions, applications for employment, or the receipt of an honor or honorary recognition. In case of waiver, the confidential statements will be used solely for the purposes for which they were specifically intended, and the student will, upon request, be notified of the names of all persons making such confidential statements. If a student should desire to waive right of access, may contact the registrar for more information. 5. The Institute reserves the right to destroy from time to time any and all educational records that it maintains on a student, except to the extent that the law requires their maintenance for a lon - ger period of time. However, where access to records has been requested, no destruction of those records will be allowed to take place until such access has been granted or denied. 6. Students who believe their rights under FERPA may have been General Information39 Historical Sketchviolated may file a complaint with the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW, Washington D.C. 20202-4605. Transcripts of Records A student, or former student, may request that official transcripts of their records be forwarded to designated institutions or individuals. Requests should be filed at the Registrar's Office at least five days before the date on which the transcripts are to be mailed. PARENT, GUARDIAN, AND EMERGENCY CONTACT NOTIFICATION POLICY Caltech understands and supports a student's right to confidentiality regarding educational records1 as well as matters related to a student's experience at the Institute. Most communications from Caltech regard - ing academics, health and safety, advising, enrollment, and policies are directed only to students. However, the Institute does encourage students to share important information with their parent(s) or guard - ian. Subject to the allowable exceptions under FERPA, there may be circumstances under which a Caltech administrator makes the determi - nation that notification to parent(s) or a guardian is indicated, and notifi - cation may be made without a student's consent. In most cases, when a Caltech administrator determines that involving parent(s) or guardian is necessary, the student will be given an opportunity to make contact in advance of the administrator's communication. Administrators will consider any relevant information which may indicate that notification to parent(s) or guardian may not be appropriate based on individu - al circumstances. The Institute expects all students to designate an emergency contact who is a parent or guardian or other family member who may be notified in order to address a health or safety emergency, and who is in a position to make decisions on the student's behalf in the case of a medical emergency. An alternate emergency contact also may be identified for other purposes. Situations that may warrant the involvement of a student's, parent(s), guardian, or emergency contact may include, but are not limited to: 1. Concerns about a student under the age of 18. Caltech administrators will initiate communication with the parent(s) or guardian of a minor student in the cases described below, as well as any other concerns about a minor student that may benefit from collaboration with the student's support sys - tem. 2. Change in enrollment or status of an undergraduate student. A change in the enrollment status of an undergraduate student may occur as a result of disciplinary action, unsatisfactory aca - demic progress, or other factors. If an undergraduate student is separated from the Institute, the parent(s) or guardian will be notified by mail at the permanent address on file. 3. Medical emergencies. State law prohibits health care professionals from disclosing Notices and Agreements40 General Informationmedical information to the parents or guardian of a student with - out the student's explicit consent. In the event a student is inca - pacitated, unable to communicate, or otherwise cannot make decisions on their own behalf, the Institute will first cooperate with medical providers and then notify the emergency contact, parent(s) or guardian on file as soon as possible. 4. Unexplained absence from campus. Caltech has established a policy to assist in locating Caltech students living in Caltech campus housing when Caltech has determined a student to be missing. The key components of this policy are as follows: Designation of Confidential Contact. Students have the option of identifying an individual to be contacted by Caltech within 24 hours after the time the student has been determined to be missing (missing person contact). This information will be accessible only to authorized campus officials and may not be disclosed except to law enforcement personnel in a missing per - son's investigation. If a student chooses not to provide a confi - dential contact and is deemed to be missing, Caltech will notify the student's emergency contact or parent. Reporting and Investigation. Any individual who believes a stu - dent living in on campus housing may be missing should imme - diately contact Caltech Campus Security. Once Caltech receives a missing student report, Security will notify the Vice President for Student Affairs, the Deans, the AVP for Student Affairs and Residential Experience and the Director of Housing. Upon noti - fication that any student may be missing, Caltech will initiate an investigation. If a student is determined to have been missing for twenty-four (24) hours and has not returned to campus, Caltech will notify the appropriate law enforcement agency and initiate other notifications as provided below. Notification Procedures. A student's missing person contact will be notified within 24 hours of a determination by Caltech that the student is missing. If no missing person contact has been designated, the student's emergency contact will be noti - fied. If the student is under 18 years of age and not an eman - cipated individual, Caltech is also required to notify a custodial parent or guardian within 24 hours of the determination that the student is missing. 5. Significant disruption to the campus community. The emergency contact, parent(s) or guardian of a student may be notified if the student is behaving in a way that is substan - tially disruptive to the campus community, there is reason to believe the student is at risk of harming themselves or others, or is placed under arrest or charged with a crime related to conduct on campus. 6. Repeated or flagrant violations of the Substance Abuse Policy. Caltech administrators may contact parent(s) or guardian if a student under the age of 21 is found responsible for serious or repeated violations of Institute policy related to the possession, use or distribution of alcohol or drugs. Consideration in these General Information41 Historical Sketchsituations will be given to the following conditions: the violation involved harm or threat of harm to self, others or property; the violation involved an arrest in which the student was taken into custody; the violation resulted in or could result in the student being suspended and/or removed from an Institute residence; the student has shown a pattern of violations; the student required urgent medical intervention as a result of consumption of alcohol and/or drugs. 7. Student death. In the event of a student death, Caltech administrators will coop - erate with law enforcement, the coroner, medical personnel, and any other relevant officials who will provide official notification to the deceased student's next of kin. There may be additional, unforeseen circumstances when we believe it is in the best interest of the student to notify a parent or guardian. We reserve the right to act in such cases on our own best judgment, framed within the approach to emergency contact and parental/guard - ian notification stated above. 1The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) ACCREDITATIONS AND AUTHORIZATIONS The California Institute of Technology is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC), 985 Atlantic Ave., Ste. 100, Alameda, CA 94501; (510) 748-9001. In addition, the Institute is authorized by the California State Department of Education, Office of Private Postsecondary Education, to operate as a private postsecond - ary educational institution and, by the same agency, to train veterans in the programs of the Veterans Administration. The Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, Inc. (111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, MD 21202-4012; 410-347-7700), has accredited Caltech's B.S. program in mechanical engineering. Further, the Committee on Professional Training of the American Chemical Society has approved Caltech's B.S. program in chemistry. The documents describing these accreditations and authorizations are on file and may be inspected in the Registrar's Office and the Provost's Office; the office of the Division of Engineering and Applied Science also has the documentation for ABET. WSCUC Accreditation and Distance Learning during the COVID-19 Pandemic Following guidance from the U.S. Department of Education, WSCUC- accredited institutions that make distance learning arrangements in order to accommodate students whose participation is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic are not required to seek approval or notify the Commission. This applies to institutions who implement distance learn - ing for any term that begins by December 31, 2020. Notices and Agreements42 General InformationSTUDENT PROBLEM RESOLUTION PROCESS Caltech provides a variety of routes, most of them informal, by which students may bring complaints, which do not fall within the jurisdiction of other Policies or the Honor System, for consideration and reso - lution. For example, in academic matters, students may begin with faculty-student conversations that may extend to the deans, the option representatives, the division chairs, the registrar, or to various com - mittees having faculty and student members. Non-academic matters can be dealt with informally by student leaders, resident associates, residential life coordinators, deans, and other student affairs offices. The Graduate Student Council (GSC) and the Associated Students of the California Institute of Technology (ASCIT) may become involved in some complaints, and sometimes ad hoc groups are formed to make recommendations. The Problem-Resolution Process (Process) is intended to deal with complaints by currently enrolled students for which reasonable efforts by the available informal routes have not led to an acceptable resolution. The first step in this Process is for the student to consult with the appropriate deans. One of the deans will then determine if the issue falls under this Process and, if appropriate, may appoint a facilitator to help resolve the issue. If the student's issue involves a decision or action of a dean, the vice president for student affairs or designee may appoint a facilitator to help resolve the issue. A facilitator will assist the student in trying to work out the problem. If the student is not satisfied with the results, the student may file a written notice of appeal to the vice president for student affairs or their designee. The decision of the vice president or designee is final. If a student has a complaint about Caltech's compliance with aca - demic program quality and accrediting standards that they believe warrants further attention after exhausting the steps outlined above, they may contact the WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC) at www.wscuc.org/comments. WASC is the academic accrediting body for Caltech. An individual may contact the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education (BPPE) for review of a com - plaint. BPPE may be contacted at 2535 Capitol Oaks Drive, Suite 400, Sacramento, CA 95833, website: www.bppe.ca.gov; telephone: (916) 431-6959; fax: may contact WASC or the BPPE with complaints as well. STUDENT PATENT AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE AGREEMENT The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) has a responsibility to see that inventions and copyrightable materials (including software) developed in connection with Caltech be used for the public benefit, and be con - sistent with Caltech's contractual obligations. In view of the patent and copyright policies of Caltech in force on this date and as may from time to time be amended, and my use of and access to Caltech facilities and equipment, I agree to the following: Caltech retains all rights in inventions and computer software I generate as a student at the Caltech campus, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and General Information43 Historical Sketchother facilities owned or managed by Caltech, with the following excep - tions: 1.

INSTITUTE POLICIES ACCEPTABLE USE OF ELECTRONIC INFORMATION RESOURCES Caltech provides electronic information resources (including, but not limited to, computers, computer accounts and services, networks, software, electronic mail services, electronic information sources, video and voice services, servers, websites, mobile devices, and related services) to assist members of the Caltech community in the pursuit of education and research. This policy, in conjunction with other appli - cable Caltech policies, sets forth the acceptable use of all electronic information resources owned or managed by Caltech (including those operated by third parties for Caltech, such as accounts issued by third-party cloud services for Caltech) (collectively, \"Caltech IT resourc - es\") and describes the rights and responsibilities of Caltech and faculty, staff, students, and other members of or visitors to the Caltech com - munity with respect to the use of these resources. Caltech IT resources are intended to be used to carry out the legit - imate business of Caltech, although some incidental personal use is General Information47 Historical Sketchpermitted. Faculty, staff, students, and other members of or visitors to the Caltech community (\"users\") who use Caltech's electronic infor - mation resources should be guided by the Caltech Code of Conduct. Passwords and other authentication mechanisms or devices issued to users are for their use only and are not to be shared with others. Users assume responsibility for the appropriate use of Caltech IT resources and agree to comply with all relevant Caltech policies and all applicable local, state, and federal laws. Examples of inappropriate or unautho - rized use of Caltech IT resources include: sending a communication or using electronic information resources, including websites that illegally discriminate against, harass, defame, or threaten individuals or organizations; engaging in illegal conduct or conduct that violates Caltech pol - icy; destruction of, damage to, or malicious tampering with equip - ment, software, or data belonging to others; disruption, interception, or unauthorized monitoring of electronic communications; interference with use of Caltech systems; violations of computer security systems; unauthorized use of accounts, access codes, or identification numbers; use that intentionally impedes the legitimate computing activities of others; use for commercial purposes; use for political or lobbying activity that jeopardizes Caltech's tax-exempt status and violates Caltech policy; violation of copyrights, software license agreements, patent protections and authorizations, or protections on proprietary or confidential information; violation of copyright laws by downloading and sharing copy - righted files; unauthorized use of Caltech's trademarks; violations of privacy; academic dishonesty; sending chain mail, spam, or other junk messages; fraudulent activity using Caltech IT resources; downloading, viewing, and/or sharing of materials in violation of Caltech's policies regarding Unlawful Harassment and Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct; unauthorized intrusion into computer systems to alter or destroy data or computer applications (e.g., hacking or cracking); unauthorized security testing or scanning of Caltech IT resources or of another entity; or sending communications that attempt to hide the identity of the sender or represent the sender as someone else. Caltech will apply this policy consistent with applicable requirements under the laws and regulations governing Caltech's operations. This policy will not be construed or applied in a manner that improperly interferes with employees' rights under the National Labor Relations Act. Institute Policies48 General InformationCaltech IT resources are Caltech property or licensed by Caltech for Caltech's use. Users of Caltech IT resources should not have an expec - tation of privacy with respect to their use of these resources or any of the data, files, or other records generated by, stored, or maintained on them. For cybersecurity and other lawful purposes, Caltech may collect, store, and analyze information on both of the following: (1) any and all use of Caltech's electronic information resources and (2) any data or communications transmitted to or from, received or printed from, or created, stored, accessed, or recorded on Caltech's electronic infor - mation resources. This is true regardless of the labeling of the data, the use of encryption, the deletion of the data or communications, or any other factor. Password capabilities and other authentication measures are pro - vided to users in order to safeguard electronic messages, data, files, and other records (including computer files and records, electronic mail, and voicemail) from unauthorized use. These safeguards are not intended to provide confidentiality from Caltech monitoring with respect to personal messages or files stored on electronic information resourc - es owned and managed by Caltech. While Caltech does not routinely examine the content of electronic mail messages or otherwise monitor individual usage, it does routinely monitor the normal operation of computing and networking resources, including network activity patterns, system logs, general and individual usage patterns, and other indicia necessary to ensure the integrity and stability of its electronic information resources. Caltech will investigate suspected abuse, misuse, or compromise of its resources, systems, and services. Any user found to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including loss of administrative rights or network/system access and termination of employment or admission to the Caltech community. Caltech retains the right to inspect, review, or retain the content of electronic messages or other data, files, or records generated, stored, or maintained on Caltech IT resources at any time without prior notifi - cation. Any such action will be taken for reasons Caltech, within its dis - cretion, deems to be legitimate. These legitimate reasons may include, but are not limited to, responding to lawful subpoenas or court orders; investigating misconduct (including research misconduct); determining compliance with Caltech policies and the law; and locating electronic messages, data, files, or other records related to these purposes. Users must therefore understand that any electronic messages, data, files, and other records generated by, stored, or maintained on Caltech IT resources may be electronically accessed, reconstructed, or retrieved by Caltech even after they have been deleted. Caltech personnel who wish to access the content of electronic mail, data, files, or other records generated, stored, or maintained by any user must request authorization as follows: (1) from the provost for any situations that require access to electronic material associated with faculty and other academic personnel; (2) from the vice president for administration and chief financial officer for staff and postdoctor - al scholars at campus or the JPL director for human resources for General Information49 Historical Sketchemployees and postdoctoral scholars at JPL; (3) from the vice presi - dent for student affairs for students; or (4) from the general counsel for the purposes of complying with legal processes and requirements or to preserve user electronic information for possible subsequent access in accordance with this policy. In all cases, the Office of the General Counsel should be consulted prior to deciding on whether to grant access. In the case of a time-critical matter, if the authorizing official is unavailable for a timely response, the general counsel may authorize access. Users of Caltech IT resources are advised that some authoriza - tions already have been granted. For example, the Caltech information security team has certain authority to monitor Caltech IT resources for cybersecurity purposes. In conclusion, the use of Caltech electronic information resources is a privilege, not a right, and Caltech may revoke this privilege or decline to extend this privilege at any time. Suspected illegal acts involving Caltech electronic information resources may be reported to governmental authorities and may result in prosecution by those authorities. Any questions concerning the appropriate use of any of Caltech's electronic information resources or relevant Caltech policies should be directed to the provost, the general counsel, the chief information officer, the associate vice president for human resources, the JPL director for human resources, the dean of undergraduate students, or the dean of graduate studies. Related Policies: Nondiscrimination and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy Unlawful Harassment Policy COMPLIANCE WITH EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS The mission of the California Institute of Technology is to expand human knowledge and benefit society through research integrated with education. We investigate the most challenging, fundamental problems in science and technology in a singularly collegial, interdisciplinary atmosphere, while educating outstanding students to become creative members of society. Export control laws and regulations as referred to in this Policy include a number of federal laws and regulations that impact an export or import transaction such as those of the Departments of State, Commerce, Treasury, Defense, Energy and U.S. Customs. These laws have existed for many years, however, the events of September 11, 2001 and subsequent events around the world have pushed national security concerns to the forefront. The U.S. government has responded to global security concerns by tightening the export control regulations that govern the transfer of U.S. strategic technology for national security and foreign policy reasons and in furtherance of economic objectives. The export control laws are intended to control the transfer of sensitive information or goods to individuals, entities or countries of Institute Policies50 General Informationconcern. The laws impose restrictions dependent on the type of infor - mation or goods and the identity of the foreign persons and entities. The regulations contain a fundamental research exclusion and specific university exemptions that allow most of the research activities being performed at U.S. universities to be carried out without the need of export licenses or other restrictions, subject to certain conditions. The fundamental research exclusion, as defined in the U.S. export regulations, applies to basic and applied research in science and engi - neering performed by universities, so long as that research is carried out openly and without restrictions on publication or access to or dis - semination of the research results. Caltech is an institution of higher learning conducting fundamental research in science and engineer - ing. While the fundamental research exclusion applies to much of the research carried out at Caltech, we are not fully relieved of our respon - sibility to comply with the export control regulations. The National Policy on Transfer of Scientific, Technical and Engineering Information, i.e., Presidential National Security Decision Directive 189 (NSDD 189) recognizes the important contributions that U.S. universities make in science and engineering that allow our nation to remain innovative and competitive. This National Policy provides the framework for the fundamental research exclusion. The fundamental research exclusion applies only to research con - ducted in the United States. This exclusion allows most of the activities conducted at Caltech to be performed without the need for an export license. However, there are certain activities and information that are not covered by the fundamental research exclusion and remain subject to the export control laws and regulations. Examples of activities not covered by the fundamental research exclusion are: 1. Receipt by Caltech of third-party export controlled or other restricted information (e.g., information with restrictive marking language) which requires that appropriate measures be taken to ensure that the information is properly safeguarded from unau - thorized transfers to foreign persons; 2. Under certain conditions, the disclosure of specific information and the provision of specific types of services to foreign persons (non-U.S. citizens, non-legal permanent residents, or non-U.S. legal entities) inside the United States (\"deemed exports\"), e.g. proprietary data, results of research where we have accepted restrictions on dissemination or participation of foreign nationals; 3. Travel abroad: Engaging in activities subject to the export reg - ulations with persons and entities abroad such as traveling with export controlled information on electronic devices; release or disclosures of restricted US technology to foreign persons; travel to sanctioned or embargoed countries; 4. The export of controlled items and information outside the United States including: controlled hardware, software and technology (e.g., physical and non-tangible exports; emails, backing up controlled information outside the US); and 5. Financial transactions or other dealings involving prohibited par - ties or sanctioned countries. General Information51 Historical SketchThe export control laws and regulations may apply to research activ - ities whether or not they are funded by grants or contracts. The export control laws are administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce through its Export Administration Regulations (EAR - dual- use items), the U.S. Department of State through its International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR - space and military items), and the U.S. Department of Treasury through its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC - economic and trade sanctions). These laws control the condi - tions under which certain information, technologies, and commodities can be transmitted overseas to anyone, including U.S. citizens, or to a foreign person on U.S. soil. Caltech is committed to comply fully with these federal laws and regulations. Caltech takes its commitment to openness in research very seri - ously. Caltech's policy, as set forth in the Faculty Handbook, does not allow acceptance of any government contract or grant that impinges on Caltech's ability to freely publish and otherwise disseminate the results of its research. The transfer of export controlled information or items requires added levels of security, safeguarding responsibil - ities and, in some instances, government authorization. For these reasons, research activities in which students will be provided with export-controlled technology (including technical data, software or items) with ITAR or high EAR (e.g., 500- and 600-series Export Control Classification Number*) controls or licensing requirements, must be for - mally approved by the Office of the Provost. To that end, Caltech has established an Export Compliance Office and has appointed a Director for Export Compliance who also functions as Caltech's Empowered Official. The Empowered Official is the per - son who has legal authority to sign export control license applications and other requests for export approval on behalf of Caltech, and is the person responsible for developing and implementing export compliance programs, campus procedures, awareness programs for faculty and training programs for staff. Caltech expects all faculty and staff to comply fully with all appli - cable export control laws and regulations. (The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a federally funded research and development center, has a separate Export Compliance Policy.) Noncompliance may result in violations that can subject both the individual and Caltech to civil sanc - tions and criminal penalties. It is the responsibility of Caltech faculty and staff to ensure Caltech's compliance with this policy. The Director for Export Compliance has been designated as the primary contact for export control issues. For more information or for questions, please contact: Adilia F . Koch, Director for Export Compliance, (626) 395-4469 or the Export Compliance Office staff at (626) 395-2641 or export@caltech. edu. * Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) are described on the Department of Commerce's website here: https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/licensing/commerce-con - trol-list-classification/export-control-classification-number-eccn. Institute Policies52 General InformationCONFLICTS OF INTEREST POLICY 1.0 Policy The mission of Caltech is to expand human knowledge and benefit society through research integrated with education. In pursuit of this mission, Caltech adheres to the Code of Conduct comprising its code of conduct and strives for the highest level of integrity and public con - fidence. Caltech's integrity rests on the personal integrity of each of us who is called upon to act on behalf of Caltech. Caltech is committed to ensuring that decisions made on its behalf reflect the highest ethical standards and that its research and instruction remain a rigorous and open inquiry, unencumbered by conflicts of interest, real or perceived, that might affect the sound judgment of its trustees, officers, senior management, faculty, students, postdoctoral scholars, visitors and staff. Each of us, therefore, is responsible for identifying and resolving conflicts between personal and institutional interests. We each must act in the best interests of Caltech and refrain from taking part in any transaction where we do not believe in good faith that we can act impartially. Individual conflicts of interest may affect Caltech's trustees, officers, faculty, postdoctoral scholars, visitors or staff. An individual conflict of interest is a situation that may compromise an individual's profes - sional judgment in carrying out Institute business due to an external relationship that directly or indirectly affects the interest of the indi - vidual or an immediate family member. Each situation that presents a potential for conflict of interest must be fully disclosed to Caltech and managed or eliminated before moving forward. Conflicts of interest also include conflicts of commitment, which are situations in which external activities, either paid or unpaid, interfere with an employee's primary obligation and commitment to Caltech. While everyone should take care to avoid conflicts of commitment, there are special consider - ations, including disclosures, that apply to those performing federally sponsored research at Caltech. Federal sponsors have an interest in ensuring that the researchers supported on their awards are not over committed. The Division Chairs and the Office of Research Compliance serve as resources to researchers who have questions concerning whether particular activities they are considering may pose a conflict of commitment. Faculty, postdocs, visiting researchers and research staff are expected to comply with this policy and are required to complete Caltech's Financial Interest and Commitment Disclosure Form within 30 days of hire and on an annual basis, and to submit changes or addi - tions within 30 days of a new interest, activity, or change. In academic research, the term conflict of interest refers especially to situations in which financial or other personal considerations may compromise, or may have the appearance of compromising, an investi - gator's professional judgment in conducting or reporting research. The bias can affect collection, analysis, and interpretation of data, hiring of staff, and procurement of materials, sharing of results, choice of proto - col, and the use of statistical methods. Conflicts of interest can affect all scholarly fields. General Information53 Historical Sketch Caltech has established its conflict of interest policies and proce - dures that apply to all Caltech employees, including faculty, to ensure compliance with Caltech's ethical standards as well as with the laws, rules, and regulations that govern Institute activities, while fostering and sustaining an environment of openness and integrity. 2.0 Individual Conflicts of Interest The broad principles in this policy encompass a variety of situations, many of which do not fall into patterns for which specific guidelines may be established. Conflicts of interest inevitably arise from time to time in everyday business life; some may appear to be inconsequential or may even be advantageous to Caltech. It is important, however, that all employees make timely disclosure of any such conflict of interest. Each employee should apply their sense of integrity and common sense to disclose any circumstances that are, may become, or may give the appearance of a possible conflict of interest. Supplementing this broad policy statement are the following rules to be observed on specific matters: 2.1 Each employee has a duty to act in the best interest of Caltech and avoid actions that would call into question the integrity of the employee or Caltech. 2.2 An employee who has directly or through family or business con - nections, a material interest in suppliers of goods or services, or an interest in contractors or potential contractors with Caltech, should not act on behalf of Caltech in any transaction involving that interest. No employee should participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract with any party with whom they are negotiating regarding potential employment or any arrangement concerning potential employment. 2.3 An employee should avoid outside activity involving obligations that may conflict or appear to conflict with Institute interests, including its interest in the employee's full- or part-time services (i.e. a conflict of commitment). Activities to disclose include, but are not limited to, paid or unpaid directorships, external academic appointments, editorial positions, service on advisory boards, consulting or similar arrangements, and other outside employment. Campus and JPL staff and postdoctoral scholars are required to obtain approval prior to engaging in outside activities. Campus and JPL staff and postdoctoral scholars must complete the Request for Outside Activity form as required in Personnel Memorandum PM 9-3. 2.4 To avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, an employee should provide full disclosure of any business or financial enter - prise or activity in which they are involved that might influence, or might appear to influence, their official decisions or actions on Caltech matters. 2.5 An employee should refrain from personal activities that include, but are not limited to, the purchase or sale of securities, real property, or other goods or services in which they could use or might appear to have the opportunity to use, for personal gain, Institute Policies54 General Informationconfidential information or special knowledge gained as a result of their relationship with Caltech. 2.6 An employee should refrain from unauthorized disclosure of non - public information concerning Caltech. Additionally, an employee should not use nonpublic information accessed through the per - formance of a government contract for personal gain. 2.7 No employee should make unauthorized use of Caltech resources for their personal benefit or for the benefit of any other person. Incidental personal use of resources is autho - rized by Caltech. See Acceptable Use of Electronic Information Resources Policy and JPL Rules for requirements at JPL. 2.8 It is sound practice to discourage gifts and favors from people with whom Caltech has a business relationship. Personal gifts of more than nominal value should be tactfully declined or returned to avoid any appearance or suggestion of improper influence. Any employee involved in awarding or administering contracts using federal or other government funds should keep in mind that state and federal law contain prohibitions against soliciting or accepting gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or potential contractors. 2.9 Any employee doing business on behalf of Caltech with specific vendors should refrain from participating going on leisure trips with representatives of those vendors. Such trips are not appro - priate, even when a staff employee pays a fee to the vendor to participate in such trips. 2.10 No employee should act in any Institute matter involving a member of their immediate family including, but not limited to, matters affecting family members' employment or evaluation or advancement in Caltech. Immediate family includes an employ - ee's spouse or domestic partner and children. The employment of relatives as that term is defined in Personnel Memorandum (PM 9), is subject to the conditions and restrictions described in PM 9, including the requirement to complete the Nepotism Evaluation process whenever a relative of an employee is considered for employment in the same organization as the employee. Any employee who believes that their conduct or activities may or may appear to conflict with these guidelines or activities or otherwise create a conflict of interest, should make an appropriate disclosure. You may also report possible conflicts of interest by calling the Campus Hotline at (626) 395-8787 or submitting a hotline form. JPL employees should consult Laboratory requirements, and seek guidance and/or report possible conflicts of interest by contacting the JPL Ethics Office. 3.0 Additional Faculty Responsibilities It is acknowledged that, in their wider roles as academicians and pro - fessionals, the faculty may be subject to conflicts of interest that are not necessarily financial and that are not within the scope of a policy that is designed to address conflicts of interest in the employer-em - ployee setting. For example, this policy is not designed to address conflicts that may be encountered in service to a professional society. General Information55 Historical SketchOther activities not covered by this policy are best handled within the ethical guidelines established by the Faculty Handbook. Faculty members must be aware of potential conflicts to ensure an open and productive environment for research and teaching. Conflicts of interest may arise when faculty members have the opportunity to influence Caltech's business decisions or when outside relationships may or may appear to compromise the integrity of decisions made as teachers and researchers. A faculty member's general commitment to Caltech requires that members perform their responsibilities to Caltech and appropriately use their own judgment in deciding whether to engage in a variety of extramural activities, within the confines set forth in the Faculty Handbook. As a result, Caltech relies on its faculty to be alert to the possible effect of outside activities on the integrity of their deci - sions and on their ability to fulfill their obligations to Caltech and to fed - eral and private research sponsors. Accordingly, in addition to the con - flict rules set forth above, the following guidance is provided for faculty: 3.1 Disclosure is imperative if the faculty member directs students in a research area and, as a result, the faculty member intends to realize financial gain. An example is a research area within the ambit of a business in which the faculty member has a signifi - cant ownership interest or which employs the faculty member as a consultant. Any involvement of undergraduates, graduate students, or postdoctoral scholars in the outside professional activities of the faculty member directing the student's research must be specifically approved in advance by the division chair. The student or postdoctoral scholar must also sign the written disclosure to signify understanding of the issues involved. 3.2 Disclosure is mandatory if the faculty member has a significant interest in a business under circumstances that link the fortunes of the business to the faculty member's research. 3.3 Disclosure is mandatory if the faculty member is to receive spon - sored support for research from a business for which the faculty member is a consultant, or in which the faculty member has a significant financial interest. 4.0 Conflict of Interest Requirements Imposed by Federal Sponsors Federal sponsors, including National Science Foundation (NSF) and Public Health Service (PHS), have issued specific rules regarding the disclosure of significant financial interests and the management of financial conflicts of interest as a condition for submitting propos - als and accepting awards of financial support from these agencies. Members of the Caltech community proposing or working on any activity funded by a federal sponsor, including NSF or PHS (including the National Institutes of Health) are required to comply with Caltech's Policy and Procedures for Managing Conflict of Interest Requirements Imposed by Federal Sponsors, and other sponsor disclosure require - ments. Institute Policies56 General Information5.0 Institutional Conflicts of Interest Policy Institutional conflicts of interest differ from individual conflicts of interest. An institutional conflict of interest is a situation in which the research, teaching, outreach, or other activities of Caltech may be compromised because of an external financial or business relationship held by Caltech that may bring financial gain to Caltech. 5.1 Identifying Institutional Conflicts of Interest Caltech has many legitimate interests that may at times conflict. Management of institutional conflicts of interest is by its very nature more complex than that of individual conflicts of interest. External relationships to sponsors and supporters of the insti - tution, the local community's acceptance of economic develop - ment activities, the institution's obligations as a charitable orga - nization receiving preferential tax treatment, and the institution's perception of its teaching, research, and academic missions all impact how potential conflicts of interest are managed. The examples and issues presented below do not necessarily con - stitute inappropriate conflicts of interest. Each situation must be judged on the facts and merits of the relationship with an eye to what reasonable individuals outside Caltech might consider to be appropriate. Any activity, financial and/or operational, that may bring into question Caltech's reputation, integrity, and objectivity should be considered for possible conflicts of interest. The following are examples of potential situations that may give rise to institutional conflicts of interest: 5.1.1 Significant gifts to Caltech from a commercial sponsor of research may raise questions about the influence of the company on Caltech's research programs and how they are managed. Similar concerns arise when individual companies sponsor research or provide significant consulting income to a significant number of faculty members within a single academic division. Gifts or promise of gifts, in exchange for favorable terms on a technology license or a first look at intellectual property may also pose a problem. 5.1.2 The acquisition of goods and services for Caltech represents a large portion of Caltech's expenditures. Purchasing goods and services from companies that sponsor research at Caltech, or who are licensees of Institute technology, may raise issues similar to those raised by large gifts from commercial sponsors. 5.1.3 A potential institutional conflict of interest exists simply by Caltech having a license agreement with, or an equity position in, a company sponsoring a faculty member's research. In these situations, there may be, or may appear to be, a bias to accept terms and conditions that would facilitate the company's success. General Information57 Historical Sketch5.2 Reporting Institutional Conflicts of Interest If you identify a situation that appears to be an institutional con - flict of interest, you should report the situation to either the vice president for administration and chief financial officer or to the provost on campus or to the associate director for business at JPL. You may also make a report by calling the Campus Hotline at (626) 395-8787 or the JPL Ethics Office at (818) 354-6338 or submitting a hotline form. DISABILITY AND REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION 1.0 Policy It is Caltech's policy to comply fully with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Rehabilitation Act, and other applicable federal and state laws to ensure equal opportunity for otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities, including disabled veterans. Caltech does not discriminate based on physical or mental disabilities and is committed to ensuring that there is no unlawful discrimination or harassment in any of its aca - demic or employment programs, services, activities, or in any terms and conditions of employment. As required by law, Caltech will make reasonable accommodations to otherwise qualified individuals with known disabilities, including students, faculty, postdoctoral scholars, staff, volunteers, interns, and job applicants, to ensure equal employment opportunities and equal access to Caltech educational programs, services, activities, and facilities unless doing so would constitute an undue hardship or a fundamental alteration. Caltech also will provide reasonable accommodations to employees with pregnan - cy-related conditions consistent with federal and state law. Caltech also, as appropriate, will conduct a fair, timely, and thorough investigation into complaints within the scope of this policy to deter - mine what occurred and take reasonable steps to remedy the effects of any discrimination and prevent recurrence of the behavior. Caltech pro - vides all parties with appropriate due process and reaches reasonable conclusions based on the evidence collected. Caltech takes appropri - ate action, including disciplinary measures, when warranted. 2.0 ADA Coordinators The following individuals have been designated to coordinate Caltech's efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under applicable disability laws and Caltech policy (ADA coordinators).

Caltech performs these functions through the following committees and administrative and management structure: Institute Policies60 General Information General Information 2.1 Institute Environment, Health and Safety Committee Caltech's Institute Environment, Health and Safety Committee (\"IEHSC\") is responsible for recommending campus wide envi - ronmental, health and safety policies to the president. The IEHSC is responsible for making recommendations regarding the allocation of Institute resources so as to maintain environmental (e.g., air emissions, soil contamination, water discharges, hazardous waste management) and workplace health and safety compliance. In addition, the committee mon - itors developments through the campus Environment, Health, and Safety Office to ensure that Institute policies are observed, remain current, and are consistent with the anticipated changes in regulatory requirements. 2.2 Campus Environment, Health, and Safety Office The Environment, Health, and Safety Office (\"EHS\"), which reports to the associate vice president for facilities, is respon - sible for providing technical, regulatory, and related advisory services to the campus community. EHS works in partnership with the academic divisions and administrative departments to develop and implement safety programs that provide technical guidance and training support relevant to the operations of the laboratories and workplace, are practical to carry out, and com - ply with the law. This includes general orientation in prudent lab - oratory practices, emergency response procedures, occupational safety, and familiarity with Institute environmental, health and safety policies and procedures. EHS also initiates site reviews to assess potential hazards and determine effective controls, and coordinates hazardous waste training and hazardous waste disposal. EHS, working closely with the Office of the General Counsel, reviews legislation, recommends policies, provides reg - ulatory agencies with required data and reports, and investigates and reports environmental, health and safety incidents. 2.3 Campus Division Chairs and Department Heads The Caltech campus consists of divisions conducting research and educational activities, and administrative departments sup - porting the operations of Caltech. It is the responsibility of each division chair and department head to ensure that their units conduct operations in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and implement Caltech's environmental, health and safety policies and procedures. Division chairs and department heads maintain responsibility for day-to-day management and implementation of their environmental, health and safety pro - grams. Division chairs and department heads may designate an individual with the authority to implement, manage, and enforce environmental, health and safety compliance programs within the division or administrative office. With guidance and assis - tance from EHS, the responsible individual (i.e. the division chair, department head or their designee) shall manage the environ - mental, health and safety activities in the division or department.61 Historical Sketch Institute Policies 2.4 JPL Office of Safety and Mission Success The Office of Safety and Mission Success at JPL (\"JPL OSMS\") establishes and leads the Environmental, Health and Safety and Mission Assurance Programs for projects, programs and major tasks. JPL OSMS appropriately manages risks and enhances the probability of mission safety and success. In this capacity, JPL OSMS is an independent organization, reporting directly to the JPL director. JPL OSMS continually assesses risk and provides infrastructure to ensure that JPL maintains compliance with the JPL Prime Contract and applicable federal, state, and local envi - ronmental, health and safety requirements. JPL OSMS applies knowledge, innovation, and independence to achieve successful missions that inspire the world while safeguarding JPL's people, assets and reputation. 2.5 JPL Environmental, Health and Safety Program Management The JPL Occupational Safety Program Office, the JPL Systems Safety Program Office, and the JPL Environmental Affairs Program Office are chartered with establishing and leading pro - grams related to occupational safety, systems safety, and envi - ronmental compliance, respectively, and are tasked with appro - priately managing risks and enhancing the probability of mission safety and success. These JPL program offices, working closely with the Office of the General Counsel, review legislation, rec - ommend policies, provide regulatory agencies with required data and reports, and investigate and report environmental, health and safety incidents. Each of the environmental, health and safe - ty program management offices has office-specific policies that are detailed in JPL Rules! 2.6 Campus and JPL Manager and Supervisor Responsibilities All managers and supervisors, both academic and administra - tive, at campus and JPL, are responsible for conducting opera - tions in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and Caltech policies, practices, and programs. Managers are respon - sible for ensuring that areas under their management have ade - quate resources for environmental, health and safety programs, practices and equipment. Managers are also responsible to ensure that those areas under their management are in compli - ance with Caltech's environmental, health and safety policies, practices, and programs. Supervisors, including principal investigators (\"PIs\"), with guidance and assistance from the environmental, health and safety offices listed above, are responsible for implementing environmental, health and safety policies, practices, and pro - grams, ensuring that workplaces, including laboratories and equipment, are safe and well-maintained, training and informing employees, students, and visitors about workplace-specific hazards and safety procedures, providing personal protective equipment, correcting violations, investigating incidents and complaints, overseeing proper storage and disposal of hazard - ous materials, enforcing policies (including appropriately disci - plining employees and students who violate environmental and 62 General Informationsafety requirements), and appropriately documenting activities and processes. Faculty are responsible for the safety of work undertaken in their laboratories. Faculty members may designate a qualified individual, known as a Safety Coordinator, and empower that individual to assist in the day-to day safety activities within their research groups, however faculty members remain fully respon - sible for the safe conduct of work in their laboratories. 2.7 All faculty, staff and students All faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars, and students at campus and JPL are responsible for: Keeping themselves informed of conditions affecting their health and safety, Participating in safety training programs as required by the governing organization's policy and their supervisors, Performing work in a safe and prudent manner, Adhering to health and safety practices in their workplaces, classrooms, and laboratories, and Advising of or reporting potentially unsafe practices, illegal activities or serious hazards in the workplace, classroom or laboratory, and cooperatively participating in the investigation and/or remediation of any incidents. The success of Caltech's environmental, health and safety management activities requires the active involvement of individuals through participation in training, compliance with established environmental, health and safety procedures, and reporting hazards and potential violations. It is the responsibility of all faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars, and students at Caltech to disclose fully any activity that may result in a violation of environmental, health or safety laws or regulations, and to cooperatively participate in the investigation and remediation of any incidents. 2.8 Visitors and Contractors Visitors and those who do business with Caltech either at Campus or JPL, such as contractors, consultants and vendors, are responsible for performing their work in a manner that pro - tects Caltech from environmental, health and safety risks, and complies with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations and all applicable environmental, health and safety policies, practices and programs. 3.0 Reporting In matters of actual or potential regulatory enforcement action, investigations, or employee complaints, the appropriate environmental, health and safety office will work closely with the Office of the General Counsel to coordinate Caltech's response to external regulatory agen - cies concerned with workplace health, safety, and environmental com - pliance. Any questions or concerns regarding compliance should be brought to the attention of the appropriate manager or supervisor, or to the appropriate environmental, health and safety office. Alternatively, con - General Information63 Historical Sketchcerns can be raised with the appropriate division chair or vice president at campus, or the OSMS director at JPL.

Local, state, and federal laws and regulations establish civil and criminal penalties for violations of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including substantial fines and possible imprisonment. Caltech views compliance with all laws, regulations, and Institute guidelines as conditions of employment, and violation of such require - ments shall be considered grounds for disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment or involuntary leave/expulsion from Caltech. NONDISCRIMINATION AND EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY 1.0 Policy Caltech is committed to equal opportunity for all persons. It prohibits discrimination and harassment in employment based on the following protected characteristics (unlawful discrimination and harassment): Race (includes hair texture and protective hairstyle) Color Religion (includes religious dress and grooming practices) Sex/gender (includes pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, and/ or related medical conditions) Gender identity and gender expression Sexual orientation Marital status Medical condition (genetic characteristics, cancer, or a record or history of cancer) Military or veteran status National origin (includes language use and possession of a driv - er's license issued to persons unable to prove that their pres - ence in the United States is authorized under federal law) Ancestry Disability (mental and physical, including HIV/AIDS, cancer, and genetic characteristics) Genetic information Request for family care leave Request for leave for a serious health condition Request for Pregnancy Disability Leave Institute Policies64 General Information Domestic violence victim status Age (over 40) Criminal Background (Fair Chance Act) Any other factor protected by federal, state, or local law Association with an individual who is in one of the foregoing protected characteristics It is the policy of Caltech to provide a work and academic envi - ronment free of discrimination as required by federal and state law. Discrimination is different treatment based on protected characteris - tic listed above and/or applying policies and practices that have an adverse impact on individuals based on protected characteristics. Harassment on the basis of any legally protected characteristic is a form of discrimination and is likewise prohibited by this policy. The law prohibits discrimination by co-workers and third parties as well as supervisors and managers. Interns, volunteers, and persons performing services under a contract with Caltech are also covered by this policy. Caltech will take all reasonable steps to eliminate dis - crimination and harassment in its work and academic environment. Complaints concerning Sex- and Gender-Based discrimination and harassment and sexual misconduct are governed by the Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy. Caltech is an equal employment opportunity and affirmative action employer, and will, whenever possible, actively recruit and include for employment members of underrepresented minority groups, women, protected veterans, or individuals with disabled veteran status, and otherwise qualified persons with disabilities. Caltech will hire, transfer, recruit, train, and promote based on the qualifications of the individ - ual to ensure equal consideration and fair treatment of all. All other employment actions, such as work assignments, appointments, com - pensation, evaluations, training, benefits, layoffs, and terminations are governed by this policy. Personnel actions will be reviewed to ensure adherence to this policy. 2.0 Responsible Administrators Caltech's associate vice president for human resources and JPL's director for human resources have been assigned to direct the estab - lishment of and to monitor the implementation of personnel procedures to guide our affirmative action programs. They will have responsibility to review and update the affirmative action plans annually, including responsibility for the audit and reporting system. A notice explaining Caltech's policies will remain posted. In addition, Caltech has designated equal opportunity coordinators who are responsible for assisting with and coordinating the education and compliance efforts relating to equal opportunity and nondiscrimi - nation laws and Caltech policies. The following individuals have been designated as equal employment opportunity coordinators: the provost is the coordinator for faculty, the assistant vice president for human resources is the coordinator for campus staff and volunteers, the asso - ciate deans of students are the coordinators for undergraduate stu - dents and interns, the dean of graduate studies is the coordinator for General Information65 Historical Sketchgraduate students and interns, and the director for human resources at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is the coordinator for employees, interns, and volunteers assigned there. The assistant vice president for equity and equity investigations, who manages the Equity and Title IX Office, has been designated as Caltech's Title IX coordinator. The contact number is (626) 395-3132, email: equity@caltech.edu, or the office in Room 205, Center for Student Services. The Title IX coordinator is sup - ported by four deputy coordinators for faculty, staff, and students, and employees at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Further information is available on the website of the Equity and Title IX Office. Managers and supervisors are responsible for monitoring decisions regarding personnel actions to ensure that these decisions are based solely on factors other than protected characteristics and on legitimate, nondiscriminatory job requirements for the position in question and the reasonableness of any necessary accommodations for persons with a disability. 3.0 Reporting Concerns and Complaints Individuals who become aware of, witness, or experience conduct they believe to be in violation of this policy are urged to contact any of the above-mentioned coordinators, the Caltech Equity and Title IX Office, or JPL Employee Relations Group immediately. In addition, they may utilize Caltech's anonymous hotline at (626) 395-8787. Complaints will be investigated promptly, in accordance with the Procedures for Complaints of Unlawful Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation (\"Unlawful Harassment Procedures\"). Confidentiality will be maintained to the extent possible. Supervisors and managers are required to report any complaints of discriminatory conduct to one of the above-designated coordinators so that Caltech can try to resolve the complaint internally. Individuals who violate this policy may be sub - ject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employ - ment or expulsion. 4.0 Reporting to Outside Agencies In addition, employees who believe they have been subject to unlawful harassment or discrimination have the right to file a complaint with the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which have the authority to remedy violations. Employees, students, and others participating in Caltech's educational programs and activities may file complaints with the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights at (415) 486-5555 (or ocr.sanfrancisco@ed.gov) or (800) 421-3481 (or OCR@ ed.gov). Complaints may also be directed to the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education at http://bppe.ca.gov. 5.0 Investigation of Complaints Caltech will conduct a fair, timely, and thorough investigation into com - plaints within the scope of this policy to determine what occurred and take reasonable steps to remedy the effects of any discrimination and prevent recurrence of the behavior. Caltech provides all parties with Institute Policies66 General Informationappropriate due process and reaches reasonable conclusions based on the evidence collected. Caltech takes appropriate action, including disciplinary measures, when warranted. 6.0 Policy against Retaliation No one may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by this policy or the related procedures, or because the individual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, participated, or refused to participate in any manner in any action or process under this policy or the related procedures. Intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination for the purpose of interfering with any right under this policy or the related proce - dures constitutes retaliation. The rights and privileges secured under this policy and the related procedures include but are not limited to: (i) filing or assisting in the filing of a complaint or report of a suspected violation of this policy; (ii) opposing any act or practice made unlawful by any federal, state or local laws requiring equal opportunity; (iii) participating, assisting, or otherwise cooperating in an investigation, compliance review, hearing, or any other activity related to a violation of this policy or administration of any federal, state, or local law requiring equal opportunity; and/or (iv) exercising any legal right protected by federal, state, or local law requiring equal opportunity. The following actions do not constitute retaliation: the exercise of rights protected under the First Amendment or Caltech's charging an individual with a policy violation for making a materially false statement in bad faith in the course of a resolution process. A determination that a respondent was responsible for alleged misconduct alone is not suf - ficient to conclude that any party made a materially false statement in bad faith. Complaints of retaliation will be addressed under the Unlawful Harassment Procedures. 7.0 Informational Resources Information on equal employment opportunity and nondiscrimina - tion, as well as copies of Caltech's Nondiscrimination and Equal Employment Opportunity, Unlawful Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation, Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct, and Violence Prevention policies are available from Caltech's Title IX coordinator and deputy coordinators, Human Resources, Student Affairs and deans' offices, the Center for Inclusion & Diversity resident associates, the Staff and Faculty Consultation Center, and Employee & Organizational Development at campus, and Employee Relations and the Human Resources Business Partners at JPL. The policies, available at the links below, are published in the Caltech Catalog and on the following Caltech websites: Caltech Human Resources, JPL Human Resources, Equity and Title IX, and Student Affairs. General Information67 Historical Sketch8.0 Caltech's Commitment to Equal Opportunity and Nondiscrimination To ensure equal employment opportunity and nondiscrimination, each member of the Caltech community must understand the importance of this policy and their responsibilities to contribute to its success. The president of Caltech fully supports Caltech's equal opportunity and affirmative action policies. Related Policies and Procedures: Unlawful Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation Procedures for Complaints of Unlawful Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct Procedures for Complaints of Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct under Title IX Disability and Reasonable Accommodation SEX- AND GENDER-BASED MISCONDUCT SECTION I: INTRODUCTION 1.0 Policy All members of the Caltech community have the right to be treated, and the responsibility to treat others, with dignity and respect. These principles are fundamental to the educational and intellectual mission of Caltech. It is the policy of Caltech to provide a work and academic environment free of discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, and retaliation. Caltech will not tolerate such conduct and is committed to educating the community in ways to prevent its occurrence. As defined in this policy, sex- and gender-based discrimination, sex - ual and gender-based harassment, and sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, sexual battery (i.e., nonconsensual sexual contact), dat - ing and domestic violence, sexual exploitation, and stalking constitute prohibited conduct and violate this policy. Such conduct generally vio - lates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; Title IX of the Education Code; and/or California law. All individuals are protected against prohibited conduct (defined below in Section III) regardless of gender. For the purposes of this pol - icy, the term \"gender\" is broadly defined, encompassing sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. Prohibited conduct can be committed by individuals of any gender and can occur between or among individuals of the same gender or different genders, strang - ers, or acquaintances as well as people involved in intimate or sexual relationships. Caltech also prohibits retaliation against an individual who reports, submits a complaint, or otherwise participates in good faith in any mat - ter related to this policy. Caltech will take prompt and equitable action upon receiving a Institute Policies68 General Informationreport of prohibited conduct to determine what occurred and will take steps to stop and remedy the effects of any such conduct and prevent its recurrence. Caltech provides all parties with appropriate due pro - cess and will take appropriate action, including disciplinary measures, when warranted, up to and including termination of employment or changes to student enrollment status, including expulsion. Any reference in this policy to a Caltech administrator is understood to include not only that administrator but also their designee. 2.0 Scope This policy applies to all current students, faculty, supervisory and non - supervisory staff, postdoctoral scholars, volunteers, interns, vendors, independent contractors, persons performing services under contract with the Institute, visitors, and any other individuals who are regularly or temporarily employed, studying, living, visiting, or otherwise participat - ing in Caltech's educational programs or activities (\"covered persons\"). The requirement not to discriminate in Caltech's educational programs or activities also extends to admissions and employment. Inquiries about the application to Caltech of Title IX and its implementing regula - tions may be referred to the Title IX Coordinator. This policy applies to (a) prohibited conduct occurring on Institute- controlled property, at Institute-sponsored events, in Institute programs or activities, or Institute-owned or controlled residential facilities, regardless of location; (b) prohibited conduct occurring on property or at events controlled or sponsored by Institute-affiliated organizations including student organizations, regardless of location; (c) prohibited conduct occurring off campus, in any location or context, whenever the respondent and the complainant are covered persons, if, based on the allegations, there is any reason to believe that the incident could con - tribute to a hostile educational environment or otherwise interfere with a student's access to education; or (d) prohibited conduct occurring outside of Caltech's educational programs or activities, whether they occurred on or off campus, if, based on the allegations, there is any reason to believe that the incident could contribute to a hostile edu - cational environment or otherwise interfere with a student's access to education. Organizations affiliated with the Institute or that use Caltech property or resources in connection with their activities also are prohibited from engaging in prohibited conduct. This policy also applies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Members of the Caltech community are encouraged to promptly report prohibited conduct to Caltech or consult with a confidential resource (see Appendix: Support Resources), regardless of where the incident occurred or who committed it. Supervisory employees and other Responsible Employees are required to promptly report prohib - ited conduct. An individual who has experienced sexual misconduct is encouraged to immediately seek assistance from a medical provider and report the incident to local law enforcement, which the confiden - tial Campus Sexual Violence Advocate can coordinate and facilitate. Reports to Caltech and law enforcement may be pursued simultane - ously. General Information69 Historical SketchEven if Caltech does not have jurisdiction under this policy over the person accused of prohibited conduct, or the allegations reported, Caltech will take prompt action, as warranted and appropriate, to provide for the safety and well-being of the individual reporting and the campus commu - nity, including taking reasonable steps to stop and remedy the effects of the prohibited conduct and to prevent recurrence of the behavior. 3.0 Retaliation Retaliation against any member of the Caltech community at any point in time for making a good-faith report of prohibited conduct or par - ticipating or refusing to participate in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing conducted by Caltech or a state or federal agency is strictly prohibited. Retaliation is defined as overt or covert acts of reprisal, interference, discrimination, intimidation, or harassment against an individual or group for exercising their rights under Title IX or other federal and state laws. Threats of retaliatory action also constitute retaliation. Retaliation violates this policy and is unlawful. Retaliation does not include charging an individual with a code of conduct violation for making a materially false statement in bad faith during the course of an investigation, proceeding, or hearing related to this policy, provided, however, that a determination regarding responsi - bility, alone, is not sufficient to conclude that any party made a materi - ally false statement in bad faith. The following are examples of conduct that may constitute retaliation: A faculty or staff supervisor suspects and assigns blame for an anonymous report to the Equity and Title IX Office and gives the suspected reporter undesirable work or lab assignments, or a lesser recommendation or salary increase than the suspected reporter merits based on their actual work. A faculty or staff supervisor refuses to continue to work with a student, subordinate, or colleague who has reported a concern about them to the Equity and Title IX Office. A student spreads false information around the house about a fellow student who has reported a concern about them or a friend to the Equity and Title IX Office. A student gets other students to engage in \"blackballing\" or socially ostracizing behavior against a student who was called as a witness in a Title IX investigation where the respondent was a friend of the student organizing the blackballing. A staff supervisor requires an employee who raised concerns with them about differential treatment between men and women on the team to track her weekly time on assignments, but no one else is required to track their time, and there is no prior employment history to support the necessity of tracking time. Caltech will take steps to prevent retaliation and will take prompt and appropriate corrective action to stop and remedy its effects if retaliation occurs. Caltech will involve senior academic, administrative, and Student Affairs leadership, as required, to prevent and remedy retaliation. Individuals who violate Caltech's policy prohibiting retaliation may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment or expulsion from Caltech. Institute Policies70 General Information4.0 Preservation of Evidence of Prohibited Conduct Prohibited conduct, as defined in this policy, may also be a crime. Individuals who have experienced sexual violence are urged to seek medical treatment as soon as possible. Sexual assault forensic exams (or rape kit tests) are available free of charge at multiple local medical centers (see the Appendix: Support Resources chart at the end of this section) and facilitate both evidence preservation and any necessary medical treatment. Evidence preservation is important in case an indi - vidual would like to file a report with law enforcement, pursue civil liti - gation, or obtain a protective order. If an individual chooses to receive a forensic exam, they should avoid showering, bathing, douching, eating, drinking, washing their hands, or brushing their teeth until after the medical examination. Exams should be performed within 72 hours of the incident. Individuals should save all clothing worn at the time of the assault. Each item of clothing should be placed in a separate paper bag, not a plastic bag. Individuals who have experienced sexual violence are strongly encouraged to preserve all physical and electronic evidence. Electronic evidence relating to any type of incident of prohibited conduct, such as texts, emails, and social media posts, should be pre - served. Once an individual reports a concern or receives notification of their involvement in a report or complaint under this policy, whether as a respondent or witness, they are required to preserve any physical or electronic evidence they have. An intentional failure to preserve such evidence may be grounds for disciplinary action. 5.0 Emergency Notifications and Timely Warnings In the event of a dangerous situation on campus that has involved an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employ - ees, Caltech will issue an emergency notification consistent with its emergency notification procedures. In the event that Caltech believes that there is a serious or continuing threat to the campus community, Caltech will issue a timely warning consistent with its timely warning procedures. Emergency notifications and timely warnings do not dis - close the name of the victim. SECTION II: REPORTING CONCERNS AND COMPLAINTS 6.0 Reporting to Caltech Any person may report prohibited conduct, whether or not the person reporting is the person alleged to be the victim of the alleged prohibited conduct. They may make their report in person, by mail, by telephone, by electronic mail, or by any other means that results in the Title IX Coordinator receiving their verbal or written report. They may also use the Report Form on the Equity and Title IX Office website, which can be submitted anonymously by not filling in the contact information. The Report Form is also available from the Equity and Title IX Office and at equity.caltech.edu. A member of the Caltech community who wishes to report prohibited conduct should do so as soon as possible after the incident, although reports may be made at any time. General Information71 Historical SketchAnyone who witnesses, experiences, or is otherwise aware of con - duct that the individual believes to be in violation of this policy, includ - ing retaliation, is urged to contact Caltech immediately. Individuals are encouraged to report to the Title IX Coordinator or a deputy coordinator. Any employee in a supervisory role, including faculty, must promptly report all alleged sexual harassment, sex and gen - der-based misconduct, and retaliation, regardless of its alleged severity or frequency, to the Title IX Coordinator at campus or Deputy Title IX Coordinator for JPL, who will provide guidance and advice. In addition, other employees qualifying as Responsible Employees under 6.2 below must promptly report any instance of prohibited conduct to the Title IX Coordinator or the Deputy Title IX Coordinator for JPL, as appropriate. If a member of the Caltech community would like support and guidance in reporting prohibited conduct, they may contact the Title IX Coordinator or a deputy coordinator, one of the deans or associate deans, the director of employee and organizational development in Human Resources, or the JPL section manager of talent management or Human Resources Business Partners at JPL. They may also contact any of the EEO coordinators identified in the Nondiscrimination and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy. Caltech is committed to protecting the privacy of all individuals involved in a report of prohibited conduct. All administrators involved in responding to a report of prohibited conduct understand the impor - tance of properly safeguarding private information. Caltech will make every effort to protect individuals' privacy interests consistent with Caltech's obligation to address reports made to Caltech. A student who participates as a complainant or witness in an investi - gation of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking will not be subject to disciplinary sanctions for a violation of Caltech's student conduct policies at or near the time of the incident, including but not limited to the Substance Abuse policy, unless Caltech deter - mines that the violation was egregious, including but not limited to an action that places the health or safety of any other person at risk or involves conduct that violates Caltech's policies prohibiting discrimi - nation or other serious misconduct like plagiarism, cheating, research misconduct, or other forms of academic dishonesty. 6.1 Title IX Coordinator and Deputy Coordinators The Title IX Coordinator is responsible for coordinating Caltech's compliance with Title IX and for Caltech's overall response to prohibited conduct falling under Title IX. The Title IX Coordinator oversees the implementation and application of this policy and the related procedures to ensure the prompt and equitable res - olution of complaints and the consistent treatment of the parties involved. In doing so, the Title IX Coordinator oversees all Title IX-covered and other sex- and gender-based misconduct com - plaints, monitors outcomes, identifies and addresses any pat - terns of systemic problems that arise, and assesses effects on the campus climate. The Title IX Coordinator is supported by four deputy Title IX Coordinators and a lead investigator, all of whom can answer Institute Policies72 General Informationquestions regarding Caltech's Title IX-related policies and Title IX. Deputy Title IX Coordinators also generally serve as co-in - vestigators to the lead investigator under the formal investigation process set out in the Procedures for Complaints of Sexual Misconduct.

A Responsible Employee is broadly defined to mean an employ - ee who has the authority to take action to redress sexual harass - General Information73 Historical Sketchment or provide supportive measures to students, or who has the duty to report sexual harassment to an appropriate school official who has that authority. At campus, the following are Responsible Employees: Title IX Coordinator, deputy coordinators for faculty, students, and staff, and associated staff in the Equity and Title IX Office All faculty members, teachers, instructors, and lecturers All deans and associate deans All Housing and Student Affairs directors and coordinators, including Residential Life Coordinators Resident Associates while performing the duties of employment Staff members with a supervisory or managerial role, whom Caltech has not designated as confidential resources Security officers All Athletics directors, coordinators, and coaches Employee Relations consultants Coaches of any student athletic or academic team or activity (e.g., employees who are club advisors, music coaches, etc.) Graduate student instructors, while performing the duties of employment Laboratory directors, coordinators, or principal investigators Internship or externship directors or coordinators Study abroad program directors or coordinators At campus, the term Responsible Employee does not include the licensed therapists in the Staff and Faculty Consultation Center and the Student Wellness Counseling Services, the Campus Sexual Violence Advocate, and the staff in Caltech's Center for Diversity and Inclusion, who have been designated by Caltech as confiden - tial resources. These individuals are not required to report prohibit - ed conduct to the Title IX Coordinator unless required by law to do so. However, these individuals shall inform each student who pro - vides the individual with information regarding sexual harassment of the student's ability to report to a Responsible Employee and direct the student to those specific reporting resources. At JPL, the following are Responsible Employees: Deputy Title IX Coordinator for JPL and associated staff Supervisors and managers Employee Relations representatives Education Office staff Chief Scientist Office staff At JPL, the term Responsible Employee does not include licensed therapists in JPL's Employee Assistance Program pro - vided through Empathia. Institute Policies74 General Information 6.3 Anonymous Reporting Caltech provides the following resources for anonymous report - ing: Campus Hotline (626) 395-8787 or (888) 395-8787 JPL Ethics Hotline (818) 354-9999 JPL Protective Services Division's Workplace Violence Hotline (818) 393-2851 For either Campus or JPL, by submitting a compliance Hotline Contact Form You may also use the Report Form on the Equity and Title IX Office website, which can be submitted anonymously by not filling in the contact information. If the reporting party wants to remain anonymous, they should not share any personally identifying information. If the reporting party does share such information, the Equity and Title IX Office will contact the reporting party with information about support resources and reporting options. If an investigation is pursued, the reporting party who identified themselves will be notified. 6.4 Notification of Law Enforcement Individuals who have experienced sexual assault, stalking, sex - ual exploitation, or domestic, relationship, or dating violence are encouraged to notify local law enforcement. Caltech will provide assistance in notifying law enforcement if the individual so chooses. An individual who has experienced sexual violence also has the right to decline to notify law enforcement or Caltech. Caltech has an obligation under California law to report inci - dents of sexual assault to law enforcement; however, Caltech will not report identifying information about the complainant without the complainant's consent after being notified of their right to have personally identifying information withheld. If the complainant does not consent to be identified, personally identi - fying information about the respondent also will not be provided. Individuals may also engage with the confidential Campus Sexual Violence Advocate (see Appendix: On-Campus Mental Health and Emotional Support Resources), who can facilitate a report to law enforcement. The Campus Sexual Violence Advocate will notify the Title IX Coordinator of a sexual assault for reporting purposes but will not provide any identifying infor - mation. Pasadena Police Department Call 911 for Emergency Response Non-Emergency Response: (626) 744-4241 207 N. Garfield Ave., Pasadena, CA 91101 General Information75 Historical Sketch7.0 Reports Involving Minors Every member of the Caltech community who knows of or reasonably suspects child abuse, including any prohibited conduct involving a minor, has a personal responsibility to report to Caltech Security or the JPL Protective Services Division immediately. A minor under the age of 18 is not considered to be capable of giving valid affirmative consent to sexual activity under this policy. Caltech employees who are mandated reporters have additional, legally required reporting obligations, including reporting immediately to the LA County Office of Child Protection and/or the local police depart - ment. See the Violence Prevention Policy for more information. 8.0 False Reports Caltech expects its members to act with honesty, sincerity, and good faith in reporting concerns under this policy. Caltech will not tolerate intentional false reporting of information, allegations, or evidence. A good faith complaint that is not substantiated by a preponderance of the evidence after an investigation is not considered a false report. However, when a complainant or third party is found to have inten - tionally fabricated or knowingly misrepresented information, allegations, or evidence, or otherwise to have acted with an intent to deceive or mislead in any of their dealings relating to Caltech's administration of this policy, they may be subject to disciplinary action. 9.0 Privacy Caltech will maintain the privacy of all individuals involved in a report of prohibited conduct to the extent possible. All Caltech employees who are involved in the Institute's receipt of the report and the response, including the Title IX Coordinator, deputy coordinators, and investiga - tors, receive training about respecting and safeguarding private infor - mation. Throughout the process, every effort is made to protect the privacy interests of all individuals involved in a manner consistent with the need for a thorough review and administration of the matter. Privacy generally means that information related to a report of pro - hibited conduct will only be shared with those individuals who have a \"need to know.\" The determination of who has a \"need to know\" is within the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator. These individuals are required to be discreet and respect the privacy of all individuals involved. No meetings or conversations that take place under this policy, the Procedures for Complaints of Sexual Misconduct, or the Procedures for Complaints of Unlawful Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation may be audio- or audio-visually recorded by anyone. The only excep - tion to this rule is that the Equity and Title IX Office, in compliance with Title IX, will record the hearing conducted under the Title IX Complaint Procedures in order to provide a verbatim record of the hearing. These recordings will be maintained by the Equity and Title IX Office. Institute Policies76 General Information10.0 Requests for Confidentiality or that Complaint Not Be Pursued With respect to allegations of prohibited conduct under this policy, the Title IX Coordinator and deputy coordinators make every effort to respect the concerns and goals of complainants, as well as their capacity to make independent choices regarding resolution options for addressing their complaints under this policy and the Title IX Complaint Procedures. In instances where a complainant requests that their name not be used, that Caltech not pursue any action against the respondent, including an investigation, or that no disciplinary action be taken, Caltech will seriously consider the request but weigh the request against Caltech's responsibilities, including under applicable laws, to take action to provide a safe, nonthreatening, and nondiscriminatory environment for all community members, including the complainant. The Title IX Coordinator will discuss with the complainant the reasons for their requests and attempt to address the underlying concerns, such as taking steps to prevent retaliation. Where the complainant remains committed to the requests men - tioned above, the Title IX Coordinator will weigh the request against factors that may lead the Title IX Coordinator to take action on behalf of Caltech, which may be contrary to the wishes of the complainant, including potentially disclosing the complainant's name and/or pro - ceeding to an investigation, to protect the health and safety of the complainant and the Caltech community. The factors considered are within the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator and include, but are not limited to, the nature and seriousness of the alleged conduct, whether the allegations are contested, the involvement of multiple respondents, the existence of multiple or prior reports of misconduct against the respondent, whether there was a weapon, physical restraints, battery, or other violence involved, whether the use of alcohol or drugs to induce vulnerability to sexual activity without consent was allegedly involved, whether there is evidence of a pattern of conduct, the pres - ence of other circumstances that suggest there is a significant risk that the respondent will commit further acts of prohibited conduct, the age of a complainant, whether the respondent is a faculty or staff member with oversight of students, whether there is a power imbalance between the complainant and respondent, whether the complainant believes that the complainant will be less safe if the complainant's name is disclosed or an investigation is conducted, and whether Caltech is able to conduct a thorough investigation and obtain relevant evidence in the absence of the complainant's cooperation. If Caltech determines that it can honor the student's request for confidentiality, it shall still take reasonable steps to respond to the complaint, consistent with the request, to limit the effects of the alleged prohibited conduct and prevent its recurrence without initiating formal action against the alleged respondent or revealing the identity of the complainant. These steps may include increased monitoring, supervi - sion, or security at locations or activities where the alleged misconduct occurred; providing additional training and education materials for stu - dents and employees; or conducting climate surveys regarding sexual violence. The institution shall also take immediate steps to provide for General Information77 Historical Sketchthe safety of the complainant while keeping the complainant's identity confidential as appropriate. These steps may include changing living arrangements or course schedules, assignments, or tests. The com - plainant shall be notified that the steps Caltech will take to respond to the complaint will be limited by the request for confidentiality. If Caltech determines that it must disclose the complainant's identity to the respondent or proceed with an investigation, it shall inform the complainant prior to making this disclosure or initiating the investiga - tion. The complainant is not required to participate in the ensuing pro - cess. Caltech shall also take immediate steps to provide for the safety of the complainant where appropriate. In the event the complainant requests that Caltech inform the respondent that the student asked Caltech not to investigate or seek discipline, Caltech shall honor this request. If the complaint includes allegations that may constitute a possible crime, the Title IX Coordinator will notify the complainant of their right to file a criminal complaint or to choose not to notify law enforcement. The Title IX Coordinator, depending on facts and circumstances, may also elect to file a formal complaint and initiate an investigation even if the complainant does have the standing to do so. All final determinations and decisions taken under this provision 10.0, except the complainant's decision to file a criminal complaint or to choose not to notify law enforcement, rest solely with the Title IX Coordinator. 11.0 Contacting Government Agencies Employees, students, and others participating in Caltech's educa - tional programs or activities may direct questions regarding Title IX to or file complaints with the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights, (415) 486-5555, ocr.sanfrancisco@ed.gov, or (800) 421-3481, OCR@ed.gov. In addition, employees may file complaints with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) at https://www.dfeh.ca.gov/contact-us or the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) at https://www. eeoc.gov. Complaints can also be directed to the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education at http://bppe.ca.gov. NASA-funded program participants may file a complaint at AssistedProgramComplaint@nasa.gov or find more information at https:// missionstem.nasa.gov/filing-a-complaint.html. NSF-funded program par - ticipants may file a complaint with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion at programcomplaints@nsf.gov, (703) 292-8020, or find more information at https://www.nsf.gov/od/odi/harassment.jsp. Participants in programs funded by other federal agencies providing federal financial assistance to Caltech may file directly with those agencies. Filing a complaint with a federal agency under Title IX must be done within 180 days of an alleged discriminatory or harassing event, and there is no requirement to exhaust remedies through (i.e., utilize or go through) Caltech's internal procedures before filing directly with a federal agency. Institute Policies78 General Information12.0 Clery Reporting The Clery Act requires Caltech to issue an Annual Security and Fire Safety Report, which includes crime statistics for sexual assault (rape, fondling, incest, and statutory rape), domestic violence, dating vio - lence, and stalking. Campus Security gathers these crime statistics from the Equity and Title IX Office, security reports, Pasadena Police Department information, JPL, and reports by Campus Security author - ities. Crime statistics do not disclose any identifying information about the complainant, respondent, witnesses, or others. For more infor - mation and statistics for the past three years, see the current Annual Security and Fire Safety Report. SECTION III: PROHIBITED CONDUCT 13.0 Introduction to Prohibited Conduct Covered under This Policy This section sets out what conduct is prohibited under this policy. For clarity, transparency, and administrative ease, this section delineates sexual harassment prohibited under the federal Title IX regulations (Section 15.0) and under the California Education Code (Section 16.0). All such misconduct is prohibited by Caltech. Additional misconduct prohibited by Caltech and other applicable law, including attempts and threats of prohibited conduct, is described in Section 17.0. Reported behavior that does not constitute prohibited conduct under this policy but is nevertheless determined to be inappropriate pursuant to another applicable Caltech policy may subject the offending individ - ual to disciplinary action. The term \"complainant\" refers to the individual who allegedly is the subject of the prohibited conduct, and \"respondent\" refers to the indi - vidual who is alleged to have engaged in the prohibited conduct. The complainant and respondent may sometimes be referred to collectively as the \"parties\" in this document and the related Procedures for Sexual Misconduct. The Title IX Coordinator will determine whether reported prohib - ited conduct is covered under the sexual harassment provisions of Title IX or constitutes other prohibited conduct as described under this policy and will apply the appropriate procedures. The Title IX Coordinator's determination will be communicated in writing to the parties. Allegations of Title IX-covered (Section 15.0) and California Education Code-covered (Section 16.0) prohibited conduct will be addressed under the Procedures for Complaints of Sexual Misconduct (\"Procedures\"). Where multiple allegations of prohibited conduct are at issue, and the Title IX Coordinator determines that only a portion falls within the scope of Sections 15.0 and 16.0, all of the allegations will be adjudicated under the Procedures for Complaints of Sexual Misconduct. Allegations of prohibited conduct falling exclusively under Section 17.0 will be addressed under Caltech's Procedures for Complaints of Unlawful Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation. General Information79 Historical Sketch14.0 Affirmative Consent Consent is a key component of various definitions of prohibited con - duct. Affirmative consent is the standard of consent in Caltech's policy. Affirmative consent is the affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agree - ment to engage in sexual activity. It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that they have the affirmative consent of the other person(s) to engage in the sexual activity. Lack of protest or resistance does not mean consent, nor does silence mean consent. Affirmative consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activ - ity and each time sexual activity is engaged in, and it can be revoked at any time. Consent to one form of sexual activity is not, by itself, consent to other forms of sexual activity. The existence of a dating relationship between the persons involved, or the fact of any past sexual activity between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of consent. It is not a valid excuse, including in the evaluation of complaints in any resolution process, in response to an alleged lack of affirmative consent that the respondent believed that the complainant consented to the sexual activity under either of the following circumstances: The respondent's belief in affirmative consent arose from the intoxication or recklessness of the respondent. The respondent did not take reasonable steps, in the circum - stances known to the respondent at the time, to ascertain whether the complainant affirmatively consented. It is not a valid excuse that the respondent believed that the com - plainant affirmatively consented to the sexual activity if the respondent knew or reasonably should have known that the complainant was unable to consent to the sexual activity under any of the following cir - cumstances: The complainant was asleep or unconscious. The complainant was incapacitated due to the influence of drugs, alcohol, or medication, so that the complainant could not understand the fact, nature, or extent of the sexual activity. The complainant was unable to communicate due to a mental or physical condition. A person who is incapacitated is not capable of giving effective con - sent to sexual activity. An incapacitated person lacks the physical and mental capacity to make informed, reasonable judgments about wheth - er or not to engage in sexual activity. A person who is incapacitated may not be able to understand where they are, whom they are with, how they got there, or what is happening. A person may be incapacitated by a temporary or permanent mental or physical condition, sleep, or unconsciousness. A person may also be incapacitated as a result of voluntary or involuntary (e.g., induced, forced) consumption of alcohol or drugs. Incapacitation is a state beyond mere intoxication or drunkenness. Just because someone is under the influence of alcohol or drugs does not necessarily mean that a person is incapacitated. Impairment must be significant enough to render a person unable to understand the fact, nature, or extent of the sexual activity. In Institute Policies80 General Informationevaluating affirmative consent in cases involving an allegation of inca - pacitation, Caltech considers the state and degree of intoxication of the reporting party and the knowledge of the respondent. One's own intoxication, even to the point of incapacitation, does not relieve an individual from responsibility for a policy violation when they engage in sexual conduct without the affirmative consent of the other party or parties. However, a respondent who was incapacitated during sexual conduct has the right to file a formal complaint alleging they were incapacitated and unable to consent to the reported sexual activity. 15.0 Sexual Misconduct Covered under Title IX Sexual harassment is covered under Title IX if it meets the definitions and scope requirements set out in this section. NOTE: While Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual harassment is subject to specific procedures that do not apply to complaints of sex- and gender-based discrimination. Accordingly, sex- and gender-based discrimination is addressed separately below in Section 17.0 to ensure that the appropriate procedures are applied. 15.1 Definition of Sexual Harassment under Title IX Sexual harassment means conduct on the basis of sex that satisfies one or more of the following: (1) an employee of Caltech conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of Caltech on an individual's participation in unwelcome sexual conduct; (2) unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to Caltech's educa - tion program or activity; or (3) sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking as defined below. 15.1.1 Sexual assault means an offense classified as a forcible or nonforcible sex offense under the uniform crime reporting system of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as follows: Sex Offenses, Forcible: Any sexual act directed against another person without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent. Forcible Rape: The carnal knowledge of a person, forcibly and/ or against that person's will or not forcibly or against the per - son's will in instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of his/her temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity. This definition excludes statutory rape. Forcible Sodomy: Oral or anal sexual intercourse with another person, forcibly and/or against that person's will or not forcibly or against the person's will in instances where the victim is inca - pable of giving consent because of his/her youth or because of his/her temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity. General Information81 Historical Sketch Sexual Assault with an Object: To use an object or instrument to unlawfully penetrate, however slightly, the genital or anal opening of the body of another person, forcibly and/or against that person's will or not forcibly or against the person's will in instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of his/her youth or because of his/her temporary or per - manent mental or physical incapacity. Forcible Fondling: The touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, forcibly and/or against that person's will or not forcibly or against the person's will in instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of his/her youth or because of his/her tempo - rary or permanent mental or physical incapacity. Caltech interprets forcible fondling to include potentially, depending on the facts and circumstances, (a) the disrobing or exposure of another without their consent, and (b) the touching of another person's private body parts for the purpose of sexual gratification without consent through clothing, as well as directly. Sex Offenses, Nonforcible: Unlawful, nonforcible sexual inter - course, except prostitution offenses. Incest: Nonforcible sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is pro - hibited by law. Statutory Rape: Nonforcible sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent, which in California is 18. 15.1.2 Dating and Domestic Violence Dating violence means violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim. The existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on a consideration of the following factors: the length of the relationship; the type of relationship; the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship. Domestic violence includes felony or misdemeanor crimes (a) by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim; (b) by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common; (c) by a person who is cohabitating with, or has cohabitated with, the victim as a spouse or intimate partner; (d) by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction receiving grant monies; or (e) by any another person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person's acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction. Depending on the facts and circumstances, the Title IX Coordinator may determine that not only allegations of physical Institute Policies82 General Informationviolence, but also allegations of the following misconduct qualify as dating violence or domestic violence: sexual, emotional, eco - nomic and/or psychological actions or threat of actions; threats of harm to one's family members, friends, or self-harm; and threats to reveal personal or confidential information (including, but not limited to, information regarding one's gender identi - ty or sexual orientation); and other actions or threats that are intimidating, frightening, terrorizing, or threatening. Allegations that do not qualify as dating violence or domestic violence and which do not otherwise fall under Sections 15.0 or 16.0 may be adjudicated under the Procedures for Complaints of Unlawful Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation, if deemed appropri - ate by Caltech. 15.1.3 Stalking means engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for his or her safety or the safety of others or suffer substan - tial emotional distress. \"Course of conduct\" means two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any action, method, device, or means, follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communi - cates to or about a person, or interferes with the person's prop - erty. \"Reasonable person\" means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar legally protected or other characteristics to the victim. Stalking is also covered by the Violence Prevention policy and should be reported to the Equity and Title IX Office and Security at campus or the Protective Services Division at JPL. 15.2 Scope of Requirements for Title IX Sexual Harassment Title IX addresses sexual harassment in an education program or activity of Caltech against a person in the United States. At the time of filing a formal complaint, a complainant must be participating in or attempting to participate in an education program or activity of Caltech. The term \"attempting to partic - ipate\" includes when a complainant has: (a) applied for admis - sion; (b) graduated but intends to apply for a new program; (c) graduated but intends to participate in alumni programs and activities; (d) gone on leave but is still enrolled; (e) gone on leave but intends to re-apply after the leave; (f) withdrawn due to alleged sexual harassment and expresses a desire to re-enroll if Caltech responds appropriately to the allegations. The term \"education program or activity\" includes build - ings or other locations that are part of the school's operations, including remote learning platforms; (b) locations, events, or circumstances, even if off-campus, over which Caltech exercised substantial control over both the respondent and the context in which the alleged sexual harassment occurred; and (c) any building, even if off-campus, owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by Caltech. General Information83 Historical Sketch 15.3 Limitation on Claiming Consent as a Defense to Sexual Harassment When a consensual personal relationship arises and a power dif - ferential exists, Caltech does not consider consent as a defense to a claim of sexual harassment. The individual in the relation - ship with greater power will be held responsible. 16.0 Sexual Misconduct Covered under the California Education Code Prohibited conduct under this policy is covered under the California Education Code (CEC) if it meets the definitions set out below in this section. 16.1 Definition of Sexual Harassment under the CEC Sexual harassment means unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, visual, or physical conduct of a sexual nature, made by someone from or in the work or educational setting, under any of the following condi - tions: (1) Submission to the conduct is explicitly or implicitly made a term or a condition of an individual's employment, academic sta - tus, or progress. (2) Submission to, or rejection of, the conduct by the individual is used as the basis of employment or academic decisions affect - ing the individual. (3) The conduct has the purpose or effect of having a negative impact upon the individual's work or academic performance, or of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work or educa - tional environment. When an individual sexually harasses a student, the harass - ing conduct creates a hostile environment on campus for the purposes of this section if the conduct is sufficiently serious that it interferes with or limits a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the institution's programs or activities. The more severe the conduct, the less need there is to show a repetitive series of incidents to prove a hostile environment on campus, particularly if the harassment is physical. A single or isolated incident of sexual harassment, including sexual violence, may create a hostile environment on campus if the incident is suffi - ciently severe. (4) Submission to, or rejection of, the conduct by the individual is used as the basis for any decision affecting the individual regarding benefits and services, honors, programs, or activities available at or through the educational institution. (5) Sexual violence, which means physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person without the person's affirmative consent, including rape and sexual battery. (6) Rape, which is defined as penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any part or object, or oral copulation of a sex organ by another person, without the consent of the victim. (7) Sexual battery, which means the (a) intentional touching, directly or through clothing, of another person's intimate parts Institute Policies84 General Informationwithout consent, (b) intentionally causing a person to touch the intimate parts of another, directly or through clothing, without consent, or (c) using a person's own intimate part to intentionally touch another person's body, directly or through clothing, with - out consent. Intimate body parts are the breast, genitals, groin, anus, or buttocks. (8) Sexual exploitation, which means a person taking sexual advantage of another person for the benefit of anyone other than that person without that person's consent, including, but not lim - ited to, any of the following acts: (a) The prostituting of another person. (b) The trafficking of another person, defined as the inducement of a person to perform a commercial sex act, or labor or services, through force, fraud, or coercion. (c) The recording of images, including video or photograph, or audio of another person's sexual activity or intimate parts, without that person's consent. (d) The distribution of images, including video or photograph, or audio of another person's sexual activity or intimate parts, if the individual distributing the images or audio knows or should have known that the person depicted in the images or audio did not consent to the disclosure. (e) The viewing of another person's sexual activity or intimate parts, in a place where that other person would have a reasonable expectation of privacy, without that person's consent, for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire. 16.2 Limitation on Claiming Consent as a Defense to Sexual Harassment When a consensual personal relationship arises and a power differential exists, Caltech does not consider consent as a defense to a claim of sexual harassment. The individual in the relationship with greater power will be held responsible. 17.0 Additional Conduct Prohibited by Caltech This section lists and describes additional misconduct prohibited by Caltech, and under applicable law, but that is not subject to the Procedures for Complaints of Sexual Misconduct. Complaints of such prohibited conduct will be addressed under the Procedures for Complaints of Unlawful Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation. 17.1 Prohibition on Sex- or Gender-Based Discrimination Sex and gender-based discrimination constitutes prohibited con - duct under this policy. Sex discrimination under Title IX occurs when a person in the United States, on the basis of sex, is excluded from participation in, or is denied the benefits of, or is subjected to discrimination, under any Caltech education program or activity. The term \"education program or activity\" encompasses all of the operations of Caltech. General Information85 Historical Sketch Sex- or gender-based discrimination also includes unfavor - able treatment on the basis of sex, gender, gender identity, gen - der expression, and sexual orientation. Gender expression means a person's gender-related appear - ance and behavior, whether or not stereotypically associated with the person's assigned sex at birth. 17.2 Prohibition on Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment Gender-based harassment is harassment based on an individ - ual's actual or perceived sex, gender, gender identity, or gender expression, including harassing or bullying conduct based on the individual's gender expression, gender identity, transgender status, gender transition, or nonconformity with sex stereotypes. 17.3 Prohibition on Relationships between Employees and Undergraduates This policy prohibits sexual or romantic relationships between an undergraduate student and a faculty member, postdoctor - al scholar, or staff member. Any Responsible Employee who becomes aware of such a relationship is expected to report it immediately to the Title IX Coordinator. The non-undergraduate party in the relationship will be held responsible for prohibited conduct violating this policy, regardless of whether a complaint is filed. 17.4 Prohibition on Evaluative Responsibilities in Certain Circumstances Even when relationships are consensual, care must be taken to eliminate the potential for harassment or other conflicts. Caltech practice, as well as more general ethical principles, prohibits individuals from participating in evaluating the work or academ - ic performance of those with whom they have romantic and/ or sexual relationships, or from making hiring, salary, or similar decisions regarding those individuals. Upon learning about a consensual relationship involving such a power differential, the supervisor, dean, or division chair should immediately notify the Title IX Coordinator and, in consultation with the Title IX Coordinator, should review and remedy any direct administra - tive or academic relationship between the involved individuals. The individual with greater power may be subject to disciplinary action for a violation of this prohibition. 17.5 Prohibition on Inequitable Treatment Stemming from Consensual Relationships Even when relationships are consensual, care must be taken to eliminate the potential for harassment or other conflicts. If a consensual relationship exists, it is not acceptable to treat the individual in the relationship more favorably than other similarly situated individuals in the context of employment or academic performance. Institute Policies86 General Information 17.6 Prohibition on Uncompleted Attempts or Threats of Prohibited Conduct To the extent that uncompleted attempts or threats of prohibited conduct are not covered in Sections 15.0 and 16.0 of this policy, they are covered in Section 17.0. Threats of prohibited conduct may also constitute retaliation under this policy. 17.7 General Caution about Maintaining Appropriate Professional Boundaries All members of the Caltech community should maintain respect - ful and professional boundaries with one another. This is par - ticularly important when Caltech employees, whether faculty, postdoctoral scholars, or staff, interact with their subordinates, or with graduate and undergraduate students, due to the power differential that exists between them. While certain conduct may not constitute prohibited conduct, it can create situations where students or others feel uncomfort - able but reluctant to voice that sentiment. Depending on the circumstances, such situations may include hosting students at private homes, sharing lodging on academic-related trips (e.g., conferences, field trips), wearing swimsuits (e.g., marine research outing), and any interaction where alcohol is consumed (e.g., dinners at conferences, field trips, holiday parties). Caltech encourages employees and other community mem - bers to think carefully about maintaining appropriate professional boundaries at all times, to state their boundaries as appropriate, and to consider seeking guidance from the Title Coordinator. 18.0 Examples of Prohibited Conduct The following illustrative examples are provided to help prevent inap - propriate behavior and are not evidence that similar allegations would automatically constitute that particular type of prohibited conduct. The examples below may constitute prohibited conduct, depending on the specific facts and circumstances. 18.1 Sex- or Gender-Based Discrimination Denying an employee a promotion because they are openly gay and some of the team who would be reporting to them strike you as somewhat conservative and you worry that the employee might not feel comfortable supervising them Rejecting a student from house membership because some students feel uncomfortable with the student's openness about their recent gender transition Rejecting a faculty candidate after a hiring team member opined that the candidate's voice and mannerisms are too high-pitched and animated to be perceived as sufficiently professional and authoritative to run a lab effectively Telling a masculine-presenting nonbinary individual that they cannot wear makeup or wear feminine clothing in the wor place General Information87 Historical Sketch 18.2 Sexual or Gender-Based Harassment Sending unwanted sexually-oriented jokes to a student or work group email list Displaying explicit sexual pictures in common areas of Institute housing or on a work computer station where others can view it Making or using derogatory comments, epithets, slurs, or jokes of a gender-based or sexual nature Ostracizing individuals from group activities because of their sex, gender or gender identity, gender expression, or sexua orientation, or because they objected to harassing behavior Making unwelcome graphic comments about an individual's body, using sexually degrading words to describe an individual Engaging in unwanted suggestive or obscene communications Engaging in unwelcome touching, fondling, or groping of a sexual nature Making unwanted sexual advances Promising a benefit to someone in exchange for engaging in sexual activity Exposing one's genitals to another without consent 18.3 Sexual Exploitation Observing, recording, viewing, distributing, or allowing another to observe, record, view, or distribute intimate or sexual images of another individual without that individual's consent Surveillance and other types of observations of intimate or highly personal activities, whether by physical proximity or electronic means, live or by a camera, such as watching a person undressing, showering, or engaging in sexual activity Taking steps to cause drunkenness or incapacitation by alcohol or drugs in order to make another person vulnerable to any degree of sexual activity Sexually based stalking or bullying, including by electronic means Offering someone for sexual activity in exchange for a benefit or payment Abuse of a position of vulnerability, power differential, or trust for sexual purposes Disrobing or exposure of another without their consent 18.4 Stalking Repeated unwanted communication, including face-to-face contact, telephone calls, voice messages, emails, text messages, postings on social networking sites, written letters, or gifts Posting picture(s) or information of a sexual nature on social networking sites or other websites Gathering information about the person through the use of Institute Policies88 General Information public records, online searches, going through the garbage, or contacting the person's family, friends, or co-workers Posting private pictures or videos on school bulletin boards or internet sites Installing spyware on another person's personal devices, including phones or computers Surveillance or other types of observation, including staring or peeping Pursuing, following, or showing up uninvited at or near place like classrooms, residence, workplace, or other places frequented by the person Directly or indirectly making threats to the person Inducing friends, family members, or other persons to engage in any of the above conduct Inducing friends, family members, or other persons to track and report on the person's whereabouts and activities 19.0 Informational Resources Information on prohibited conduct, as well as copies of Caltech's Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct; Nondiscrimination and Equal Employment Opportunity; Unlawful Harassment; and Violence Prevention policies are available from the following resources: At Campus: Caltech's Title IX Coordinator and deputy Title IX Coordinators, Caltech's EEO Coordinators, Human Resources, Student Affairs, the Deans' Offices, the Caltech Center for Inclusion and Diversity, Resident Associates, the Staff and Faculty Consultation Center, and Employee and Organizational Development. At JPL: JPL's deputy Title IX Coordinator, EEO Coordinator, and Human Resources Business Partners. The policies are published in the Caltech Catalog and on the follow - ing Caltech and JPL websites: JPL Human Resources, Equity and Title IX Office, and Student Affairs. Related Policies and Procedures: Procedures for Complaints of Sex- and Gender-Based Sexual Misconduct under Title IX Nondiscrimination and Equal Employment Opportunity Unlawful Harassment Procedures for Complaints of Unlawful Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation Violence Prevention General Information89 Historical SketchPROCEDURES FOR RESPONDING TO AND RESOLVING COMPLAINTS OF GENDER-BASED MISCONDUCT I. Introduction and Scope Caltech's Sex and Gender-based Misconduct Policy reflects Caltech's commitment to support and encourage individuals who have been sub - jected to prohibited conduct to come forward. Caltech takes all allega - tions of prohibited conduct seriously and responds appropriately Caltech will take prompt and appropriate action to address all reports of prohibited conduct in a fair and impartial manner. Complainants, respondents, and all other participants in the process will be treated with dignity, care, and respect. Caltech's policy and these procedures are intended to ensure that individuals accused of engaging in prohibited conduct are not pre - judged; that they have notice and a full and fair opportunity to respond to allegations before findings and conclusions are reached; and that decisions are based on the evidence gathered in a process that is fair to both complainants and respondents when an investigation is conducted. Caltech will conduct a fair, impartial, timely, and thorough investigation that provides all parties with appropriate due process. These Procedures are to be applied to address allegations of pro - hibited conduct that (a) fall within the scope, as set out in Section I, 2.0, of the Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy, and (b) fall within the definitions of sexual harassment, as defined by Title IX and the California Education Code and set out in Sections 15.0 or 16.0, respectively, of the Caltech Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy (Policy). All other prohibited conduct under the Policy is addressed under the Procedures for Unlawful Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation. The Title IX Coordinator determines whether these Procedures apply. Throughout these Procedures, any reference to a Caltech or JPL administrator is understood to include not only that administrator but also their designee. II. Retaliation Retaliation against any member of the Caltech community at any point in time for making a good-faith report of prohibited conduct or par - ticipating or refusing to participate in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing conducted by Caltech or a state or federal agency, is strictly prohibited. Retaliation is defined as overt or covert acts of reprisal, interference, discrimination, intimidation, or harassment against an individual or group for exercising their rights under Title IX or other federal and state laws. Threats of retaliatory action also constitute retaliation. Retaliation violates this policy and is unlawful. Caltech will maintain the confidentiality of persons involved in reports and complaints of prohibited conduct, except as required or allowed under the Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy, these procedures, the Unlawful Harassment Policy and related procedures, or federal or state law. The following actions do not constitute retaliation: the exercise of Institute Policies90 General Informationrights protected under applicable law; or charging an individual with a code of conduct violation for making a materially false statement in bad faith in the course of a resolution process. However, a determination that a respondent was or was not responsible for alleged prohibited conduct, alone, is not sufficient to conclude that any party made a materially false statement in bad faith. Allegations of retaliation that are alleged at the time of a formal complaint of sexual harassment, as defined in Policy Sections 15.0 and 16.0. will be addressed as part of that complaint. Complaints of retal - iation that are not alleged at the time of a sexual harassment complaint will be addressed under the Procedures for Complaints of Unlawful Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation. The Title IX Coordinator will have the ultimate discretion over which procedures apply to a claim of retaliation. III. Adviser or Support Person The complainant and respondent may have an adviser or support person (hereinafter, collectively, \"adviser\") of their choice (other than a witness) accompany and generally support them at any virtual or live meetings or phone calls at any point in the procedures discussed below. However, Caltech resolution processes, including the inves - tigation process, are not legal proceedings and the adviser may not speak or submit written statements on behalf of the individual they are advising (other than at the hearing as described below in Section XIII(D) (8)). Caltech will be responsible for communicating information to advis - ers, or scheduling meetings around advisers' availability, except to the extent required to comply with Section XIII(D)(8) of these Procedures. Advisers are required to sign and abide by Caltech's Adviser Policy and Confidentiality Agreement setting forth the parameters of their role. The role of the adviser is to (a) provide general support to a party participating in any step of the processes outlined below, (b) encourage the party whom the adviser supports to communicate for themself, and (c) respect the process and procedures. All communications, whether oral or written, will be between the Equity and Title IX Office staff mem - ber(s), investigator(s), or other appropriate participating administrator(s), or their designees, (\"Title IX process administrators\"), and the party only. The adviser may not speak during any meeting, including on behalf of the party whom they support, ask questions of the adminis - trator(s) or of the party whom they support, or otherwise interfere with or disrupt the meeting, conversation, or procedure. Nor may an adviser communicate on behalf of the party in emails or other correspondence with the Equity and Title IX Office. However, during meetings, the adviser may provide written notes or instructions to the party whom they support. All parties have the right to consult with an attorney, at their own expense, at any procedural step set forth below, if they wish to do so. An attorney may serve, but is not required to serve, as an adviser. Caltech is not required to identify or provide advisers or support per - sons to parties, except as provided below in Section XIII(D)(8). General Information91 Historical SketchIV. Timelines These procedures set forth reasonably prompt time frames for major procedural stages. The Title IX Coordinator, at their own discretion or upon the request of a party or witness, may extend a time frame for good cause, provid - ing prompt written notice to the parties of any delays or extensions and the reasons therefor. Good cause may include but is not limited to the absence of a party, a party's adviser, or a witness; concurrent law enforcement activity; the need for language assistance or accommodation of disabilities; the breadth and scope of the allegations, in terms of content and date, the number of potential witnesses, the amount of available, relevant doc - umentary evidence; the need to conduct a thorough, fair and accurate investigation; and office closures. The Title IX Coordinator shall not unreasonably deny a party's request for an extension of a deadline related to a complaint during periods of examinations or school closures. V. Initial Title IX Assessment Within 14 days of receiving a report of prohibited conduct, Caltech's Title IX Coordinator will make an initial assessment of the report to determine the following: 1. a reasonable assessment of any safety concerns posed to any member of the Caltech community or Caltech's campus; 2. whether the allegations on their face present a potential viola - tion of the Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy, and if so, whether they are covered under these procedures or under Caltech's Unlawful Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation procedures; or, if not, whether they should be addressed under a different Caltech policy and process; 3. whether and what supportive measures are warranted; and 4. whether emergency removal is warranted. The Title IX Coordinator or their designee will promptly reach out to each identifiable complainant or alleged victim of the report to inform them, as appropriate, of the receipt of the report, discuss the availabil - ity of supportive measures, consider their wishes with respect to sup - portive measures, inform them that supportive measures are available with or without the filing of a formal complaint, and explain to them the process for filing a formal complaint. Where a crime may have occurred, the Title IX Coordinator will provide the complainant/alleged victim notice of their right, but not the obligation, to report the matter to law enforcement and information on how Caltech can help facilitate such reporting. The Title IX Coordinator will also describe how Caltech responds to reports of prohibited conduct, as well as potential disci - plinary consequences. The Title IX Coordinator will also refer them to and help coordinate, if desired, support resources. Finally, the Title IX Coordinator will request for the complainant/alleged victim to meet with them to discuss options for responding to the report. The Title IX Coordinator may also meet with the respondent and other relevant individuals in order to make an initial assessment. The Institute Policies92 General Informationrespondent also will be offered the opportunity to request and receive supportive measures at this time. The complainant and the respondent will be provided with the fol - lowing: Information on their rights and options under the Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct or Unlawful Harassment policies and related procedures as appropriate, and copies of these docu - ments Written materials outlining information on campus support resources and services, including contact information and days and hours of availability, as well as information on coordination with law enforcement Information on the importance of and policy concerning evi- dence preservation Information on the policy against retaliation for filing a complaint or participating in a complaint process VI. Supportive Measures Supportive measures are non-disciplinary, nonpunitive individualized services offered as appropriate and reasonably available to the par - ties before or after the filing of a formal complaint or where no formal complaint has been made or no investigation has been undertaken. Supportive measures are available to parties regardless of whether they participate in a resolution process. They are designed to restore or preserve equal access to Caltech's education program or activity without unreasonably burdening the other party, including measures designed to protect the safety of all parties or Caltech's educational environment, or to deter prohibited conduct. Supportive measures may include counseling, academic accom - modations (e.g., extensions of deadlines, course-related adjustments), modifications of work or class schedules, campus escort services, mutual restrictions on contact between the parties, including in a vir - tual or electronic environment, changes in work or housing locations, leaves of absence, increased security and monitoring of certain areas of campus, referrals to campus and off-campus support resources, and other similar measures. Caltech will maintain as confidential any sup - portive measures provided to any party to the extent such confidential - ity does not impair Caltech's ability to provide the supportive measures (e.g., notifying appropriate administrators involved in academic accom - modations). The Title IX Coordinator will coordinate the effective imple - mentation of supportive measures. Supportive measures affecting faculty, postdoctoral scholars and staff, including employees at JPL, might include transfer of supervi - sory or evaluative responsibility regarding grading, supervision, tenure review, letters of recommendation, and/or changes to office assign - ments. Caltech will endeavor to minimize the burden on the party receiving supportive measures without unreasonably burdening the other party. If a complainant wishes to seek a temporary restraining order or similar judicial order, Caltech will help the complainant with that process. The imposition of supportive measures is not indicative of a determi - General Information93 Historical Sketchnation of responsibility or any other outcome. These measures may be modified at any time and may be kept in place after a final investigative decision is reached. All parties are expected to comply with any supportive measures that may be imposed. Failure to comply with supportive measures may be grounds for disciplinary action. A party may be subject to discipline under the appropriate Caltech policy for failure to comply with a sup - portive measure even if they are found not responsible for the underly - ing report of prohibited conduct. NOTE: The Institute may undertake remedies and systemic remedies set forth below in Section XIII(D)(9) (Potential Sanction, Remedies, and Systemic Remedies), as appropriate and consistent with the require - ments of Title IX and this Section VI, to safeguard a complainant's access to education, at any time. The complainant's engagement in a resolution process is not a prerequisite for such action by Caltech. VII. Emergency Removal The Title IX Coordinator will undertake an individualized safety and risk analysis for the purpose of determining whether the respondent, based on the alleged conduct, is an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual, justifying their removal. The Title IX Coordinator may consult with any individuals they consider per - tinent and appropriate to making the emergency removal determination. The safety and risk factors that the Title IX Coordinator will consider include but are not limited to the nature of the allegations, the alleged number and age of the complainant(s), the power differential between the respondent and complainant(s), whether the respondent is alleged to have used a weapon, violence, drugs, or alcohol to intimidate, harm, or control a complainant, and whether the allegations present a pattern of behavior or otherwise suggest a likelihood of repeated misconduct. Where the Title IX Coordinator has determined that emergency removal of a student respondent is appropriate, the respondent will be provided with notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision immediately following the removal. To challenge a removal decision by the Title IX Coordinator, the respondent must submit a written appeal to the associate vice president for human resources within seven (7) cal - endar days of receipt of notice. In deciding this appeal, the associate vice president for human resources may consult with any individuals they consider pertinent and appropriate to making the decision. The decision of the associate vice president for human resources is final. Caltech may place nonstudent employee respondents on adminis - trative leave while a complaint resolution process is pending. VIII. Complainant's Ability to Exercise Options With respect to allegations of prohibited conduct under the Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy, the Title IX Coordinator and deputy coordinators make every effort to respect the concerns and goals of complainants, as well as their capacity to make independent choices regarding resolution options for addressing their complaints under the Policy and these Procedures. Institute Policies94 General InformationIn instances where a complainant requests that their name not be used, that Caltech not pursue any action against the respondent, including an investigation, or that no disciplinary action be taken, Caltech will seriously consider the request but weigh the request against Caltech's responsibilities, including under applicable laws, to take action to provide a safe, nonthreatening, and nondiscriminatory environment for all community members, including the complainant. The Title IX Coordinator will discuss with the complainant the reasons for their requests and attempt to address the underlying concerns, such as taking steps to prevent retaliation. Where the complainant remains committed to the requests men - tioned above, the Title IX Coordinator will weigh the request against factors that may lead the Title IX Coordinator to take action on behalf of Caltech, which may be contrary to the wishes of the complainant, including potentially disclosing the complainant's name and/or pro - ceeding to an investigation, to protect the health and safety of the complainant and the Caltech community. The factors considered are within the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator and include, but are not limited to, the nature and seriousness of the alleged conduct, whether the allegations are contested, the involvement of multiple respondents, the existence of multiple or prior reports of misconduct against the respondent, whether there was a weapon, physical restraints, battery, or other violence involved, whether the use of alcohol or drugs to induce vulnerability to sexual activity without consent was allegedly involved, whether there is evidence of a pattern of conduct, the pres - ence of other circumstances that suggest there is a significant risk that the respondent will commit further acts of prohibited conduct, the age of a complainant, whether the respondent is a faculty or staff member with oversight of students, whether there is a power imbalance between the complainant and respondent, whether the complainant believes that the complainant will be less safe if the complainant's name is disclosed or an investigation is conducted, and whether Caltech is able to conduct a thorough investigation and obtain relevant evidence in the absence of the complainant's cooperation. If Caltech determines that it can honor the student's request for confidentiality, it shall still take reasonable steps to respond to the complaint, consistent with the request, to limit the effects of the alleged prohibited conduct and prevent its recurrence without initiating formal action against the alleged respondent or revealing the identity of the complainant. These steps may include increased monitoring, supervi - sion, or security at locations or activities where the alleged misconduct occurred; providing additional training and education materials for stu - dents and employees; or conducting climate surveys regarding sexual violence. The institution shall also take immediate steps to provide for the safety of the complainant while keeping the complainant's identity confidential as appropriate. These steps may include changing living arrangements or course schedules, assignments, or tests. The com - plainant shall be notified that the steps Caltech will take to respond to the complaint will be limited by the request for confidentiality. If Caltech determines that it must disclose the complainant's identity to the respondent or proceed with an investigation, it shall inform the General Information95 Historical Sketchcomplainant prior to making this disclosure or initiating the investiga - tion. The complainant is not required to participate in the ensuing pro - cess. Caltech shall also take immediate steps to provide for the safety of the complainant where appropriate. In the event the complainant requests that Caltech inform the respondent that the student asked Caltech not to investigate or seek discipline, Caltech shall honor this request. If the complaint includes allegations that may constitute a possible crime, the Title IX Coordinator will notify the complainant of their right to file a criminal complaint or to choose not to notify law enforcement. The Title IX Coordinator, depending on facts and circumstances, may also elect to file a formal complaint and initiate an investigation even if the complainant does not have standing to do so. All final determinations and decisions taken under this provision 10.0, except the complainant's decision to file a criminal complaint or to choose not to notify law enforcement, rest solely with the Title IX Coordinator. IX. Filing a Formal Complaint In order to exercise resolution options for addressing and resolv - ing complaints of alleged prohibited conduct covered under these Procedures, the complainant must file a formal complaint document with the Title IX Coordinator in person or by regular or electronic mail requesting that Caltech initiate a complaint resolution process. The document must contain the complainant's physical or digital signature or otherwise indicate that the complainant is the person filing the for - mal complaint. At the time of filing a formal complaint, a complainant must be par - ticipating in or attempting to participate in an education program or activity of Caltech. The term \"attempting to participate\" includes when a complainant has: (a) applied for admission; (b) graduated but intends to apply for a new program; (c) graduated but intends to participate in alumni programs and activities; (d) gone on leave but is still enrolled; (e) gone on leave but intends to re-apply after the leave; or (f) withdrawn due to alleged sexual harassment and expresses a desire to re-enroll if Caltech responds appropriately to the allegations. The term \"education program or activity\" includes buildings or other locations that are part of Caltech's operations, including remote learn - ing platforms; (b) locations, events, or circumstances, even if off-cam - pus, over which Caltech exercised substantial control over both the respondent and the context in which the alleged sexual harassment occurred; and (c) any building, even if off-campus, owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by Caltech. However, even if a complainant is not qualified to bring a formal complaint, the respondent is outside the jurisdiction of Caltech's pol - icy, or the alleged prohibited conduct took place outside of Caltech's educational programs and activities, if there is any reason to believe that the alleged prohibited conduct could contribute to a hostile edu - cational environment, interfere with a student's access to education, or otherwise compromise the safety of the Caltech community, Caltech Institute Policies96 General Informationwill still take prompt action, as warranted and appropriate, to provide for the safety and well-being of the individual reporting and the cam - pus community, including taking reasonable steps to stop and remedy the effects of the prohibited conduct and to prevent recurrence of the behavior. This may include the Title IX Coordinator's initiating a formal complaint under their own authority on Caltech's behalf. Where the Title IX Coordinator initiates activity under their own authority, as authorized under Policy Section 10.0 and reiterated above in Section VIII of these Procedures, the formal complaint requirements must still be met. X. Consolidation of Formal Complaints The Title IX Coordinator may consolidate formal complaints of allega - tions covered under these procedures against more than one respon - dent, or by more than one complainant against one or more respon - dents, or by one party against the other party, where the allegations arise out of the same facts or circumstances. XI. Notice of Allegations Upon receiving a formal complaint, within fourteen (14) calendar days, the Title IX Coordinator must provide written notice to the parties of the following, with sufficient time for the parties\u2014generally fourteen (14) calendar days\u2014 to prepare a response before any initial interview: 1. resolution processes set out below; 2. allegations, including sufficient details known at the time, includ - ing the identities of the parties involved in the incident, if known, the misconduct alleged, and the date and location of the alleged incident, if known; 3. alleged institute policy violations under review; 4. procedures that will be used; 5. statement that the respondent is presumed not responsible for the alleged misconduct (i.e., innocent) and that a determination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of an inves - tigation process or by an administrative resolution in which the respondent takes responsibility for the alleged misconduct; 6. that the parties may have an adviser of their choice, who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney, accompany them at any stage of the process; 7. that the parties may review and inspect evidence under an investigation process; and that knowingly making false state - ments or submitting false information is prohibited and may sub - ject the offending party to discipline 8. information regarding appropriate counseling and other support resources developed and maintained by the Institute 9. copies of the Policy and pertinent procedures Any new allegations that arise during the course of the investigation that could subject either party to new or additional sanctions shall be subject to these same notice requirements. General Information97 Historical SketchXII. Dismissal of a Formal Complaint Upon receiving a formal complaint, within fourteen (14) calendar days, the Title IX Coordinator must dismiss the complaint for resolution under these procedures if the conduct alleged does not constitute sexual harassment, as defined either under Title IX (Policy Section 15.0) or the CA Education Code (Policy Section 16.0). If the conduct alleged does not fall under either section, the Title IX Coordinator, if appropriate, will refer the allegations for resolution under other appropriate Caltech policies and procedures, including the Unlawful Harassment Policy and related procedures. The Title IX Coordinator may also dismiss a formal complaint or allegations therein if at any time during a resolution process a com - plainant notifies the Title IX Coordinator in writing that they would like to withdraw their complaint or certain allegations; if the respondent is no longer enrolled or employed at Caltech; or if specific circumstances prevent Caltech from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determi - nation as to the complaint or certain allegations. The Title IX Coordinator will promptly and simultaneously send written notice to the parties of any dismissal and the reason(s) for the dismissal. The parties may submit an appeal of any dismissal decision, in writ - ing, to the associate vice president of human resources, within seven (7) calendar days of receiving the dismissal decision. This appeal of a dismissal of a formal complaint, or of certain allega - tions therein, is limited to one or more of the following grounds: a pro - cedural irregularity that affected the dismissal decision; new evidence (including a new witness) that was not reasonably available at the time of the dismissal decision that could affect that decision; and the Title IX Coordinator, investigator(s), or decision maker(s) had a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally or the individual complainant or respondent that affected the dismissal decision. If a party submits an appeal of a dismissal, the other party will have the opportunity to submit a written response to the appeal within ten (10) calendar days of the filing of the appeal. The parties simultaneous - ly will be informed, in writing, of the outcome of the appeal. The appeal decision letter will state the rationale for the result. Appeal decisions are final. Even where dismissal of a formal complaint occurs, the Title IX Coordinator may still provide supportive measures to parties or take other appropriate action in response to alleged concerns. XIII. Resolution Options The outcomes of each of the three options set out below\u2014the rem - edy-based resolution, the administrative resolution, and the investi - gation, subject to any appeal process\u2014are considered final. In other words, once one option has concluded, a party may no longer exercise another option regarding the same alleged conduct. However, a party may elect to raise or pursue another option before the option currently being pursued has concluded. Institute Policies98 General InformationUnder any of the three options, remedies must be designed to restore or preserve equal access to Caltech's education program or activity. They may include actions that qualify as supportive measures, but unlike supportive measures, remedies may include actions that are disciplinary, punitive, or burden the other party. Any person designated by Caltech to facilitate any of the resolution processes set out below (e.g., Title IX Coordinator, investigators, deci - sion maker, administrators who determine sanctions and remedies, administrator hearing an appeal of an outcome of an investigation process) may not have a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally or an individual complainant or respondent. Parties will be provided an opportunity at appropriate junctures in a process to object to a person carrying out a facilitation role in the process for the consideration and decision of the Title IX Coordinator on the grounds of a conflict of interest or bias. Where an objection is made about the Title IX Coordinator, the decision as to their suitability will be made by the associate vice president for human resources. Any consideration of impartiality, or objections based on conflict of interest or bias, of those involved in Title IX processes must be reviewed with thoughtful consideration of individual circumstances. Determination of whether a conflict of interest or bias exists in a partic - ular instance will be a matter of judgment involving all the material facts of the situation. In addition, any person designated by Caltech to facilitate any of the resolution processes set out below (e.g., Title IX Coordinator, investi - gators, decision maker, administrators who determine sanctions and remedies, administrator hearing an appeal of an outcome of an investi - gation process) will receive training appropriate to their role. The Administrative Resolution process and the Remedy-Based Resolution process are available only at the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator under circumstances they deem appropriate. Civil law rem - edies may also be available to complainants. A. Administrative Resolution The Title IX Coordinator, with the voluntary written consent of the parties, may offer the opportunity to resolve the complaint by admin - istrative resolution. Administrative resolution (AR) provides an oppor - tunity for the respondent to accept responsibility for their alleged conduct and proceed to a resolution without a formal investigation. Complainants and respondents participating in this process may have an adviser of their choice accompany them when engaging in this reso - lution process, as set forth above in Section III. If the AR option is agreed to by a complainant, the Title IX Coordinator will meet with the respondent to review the allegations. The Title IX Coordinator will provide the respondent with information on the respondent's rights and options under the policy and these proce - dures. The Title IX Coordinator will also provide the respondent with written materials outlining information on campus support resources and services, including their contact information and days and hours of availability. General Information99 Historical SketchThe Title IX Coordinator will offer the respondent the opportunity to resolve the complaint by AR by accepting responsibility for the alleged conduct. It is the respondent's option and decision whether to do so. If the respondent elects to acknowledge that the alleged conduct occurred and takes responsibility for the alleged conduct, the respondent will sign a written acknowledgement, and the matter will be referred to the appropriate decision maker for a decision concerning sanctions and remedies that may be appropriate. Generally, for purposes of determining sanctions in connection with an AR, the decision maker shall be determined based upon the respondent's affiliation (the vice provost of research or administration for faculty, the assistant vice president for human resources for post - doctoral scholars and campus staff, or the deputy director for Human Resources at JPL for JPL employees). In the case of student respon - dents, the appropriate dean will serve as the decision maker. In determining sanctions and remedies, decision makers will consult with the Title IX Coordinator and may consult with any other individual they deem appropriate. The parties will both be notified simultaneously in writing of the resolution, including any sanctions and remedies. Within ten (10) cal - endar days of receiving this letter, either party may appeal in writing only on the grounds that the sanction is substantially disproportionate to the acknowledged prohibited conduct. Appeals shall be submitted and resolved by the following administrators based upon the respon - dent's affiliation: the provost for faculty, the associate vice president for human resources for postdoctoral scholars and campus staff, the vice president of student affairs for students, and the director for human resources at JPL for JPL employees. In assessing appeals, these administrators may consult with any individual they deem appropriate. Appeal decisions are final. An AR process will be concluded within a reasonably prompt time frame after the complaint has been made, generally forty-five (45) calendar days. The Title IX Coordinator will keep the parties informed of the status of the process. The Title IX Coordinator may delay the process temporarily or extend the time frame for good cause, provid - ing written notice to the parties of any delays or extensions and the reasons therefor. Good cause may include, but is not limited to the absence of a party or a party's adviser; the need for language assis - tance or accommodation of disabilities; the breadth and scope of the allegations and number of parties; and office closures. An AR is the final resolution of the allegations contained therein. B. Remedy-Based Resolution The RBR is not available to resolve allegations made by a student of Title IX-covered prohibited conduct set out in Section 15.0 of the Policy against a Caltech employee. A remedy-based resolution (RBR) is a mutual agreement entered into among Caltech and the parties to a formal complaint. Depending on the allegations and circumstances, a respondent agrees to under - take, or all parties agree to undertake, certain social, academic, and/ or administrative steps, on a certain timeline, as a means of resolv - Institute Policies100 General Information General Information.ing a complaint of prohibited conduct without an investigation and a finding regarding responsibility or discipline against a respondent. All parties must voluntarily agree to all the terms of the RBR as the com - plete and final resolution of the formal complaint(s). In other words, if an agreement is reached, the complainant cannot subsequently file a formal complaint for an investigation regarding the same alleged conduct, unless a respondent does not fulfill their agreed upon com - mitments under the RBR as determined by the Title IX Coordinator. Complainants and respondents participating in this process may have an adviser of their choice accompany them when engaging in this reso - lution process, as set forth above in Section III. Key aspects of an RBR include that it: is a voluntary process when available to resolve allegations; unlike an investigation process, there are no circumstances (e.g., safety of a minor, safety of a party or the community) under which Caltech can undertake this process against the wishes of a party focuses on non-disciplinary remedies to the concerns underlying the alleged prohibited conduct. For example, under an RBR, a respondent can agree to undertake a cou seling and/or education program to address behavioral issues. In an investigation process, a decision maker cannot compel counseling as part of the sanction; provides a measure of control to the complainant in crafting measures and remedies undertaken by the respondent, allowing the complainant to focus on remedying specific social, academic, or administrative concerns; leaves open to the parties the alternative option of pursuing an investigation at any time during the negotiation process, or if the parties ultimately cannot come to a mutually acceptable agreement or if a party fails to comply with any or all of their commitments under an executed RBR as determined by the Title IX Coordinator; provides both parties a final resolution of the complaint, if an agreement is reached; and does not involve an adjudication of the allegations and a potential finding of responsibility against the respondent. In cases in which the Title IX Coordinator determines an RBR may be appropriate, the Title IX Coordinator will discuss with a complainant potential elements of an RBR pertinent to their concerns and allega - tions to help them determine whether an RBR is an option they wish to pursue. If all parties to a formal complaint are agreeable to pursuing a resolution through the RBR process, and provide voluntary written consent to engage in the RBR process, the Title IX Coordinator will work with the parties to negotiate and craft the agreement. The parties do not engage directly with one another. The Title IX Coordinator, with the consent of the parties, may seek the assistance of academic and administrative leadership, as appropriate, to make possible and imple - ment elements of the agreement. There are certain situations, however, where the Title IX Coordinator may determine that the parties' ability to discuss and reach a resolution 101 Historical Sketch Institute Policiesof the concerns requires intervention and facilitation by a third-party mediator outside the Caltech community. If the parties agree to work with a mediator, the Title IX Coordinator will make the arrangements. The decision to use a third-party mediator is within the sole discretion of the Title IX Coordinator. Potential elements of an RBR agreement include, but are not lim - ited to, counseling or substance abuse treatment for a respondent; training for a respondent provided by the Title IX Coordinator and/or other resources; and other supportive measures, as described above in Section VI. An RBR process culminating in a signed agreement will be con - cluded within a reasonably prompt time frame after the complaint has been made, generally forty-five (45) calendar days. The Title IX Coordinator will keep the parties informed of the status of the process. The Title IX Coordinator may delay the process temporarily or extend the time frame for good cause, providing written notice to the parties of any delays or extensions and the reasons therefor. Good cause may include, but is not limited to the absence of a party or a party's adviser; the need for language assistance or accommodation of disabilities; the number of parties; and office closures. If the process does not result in a resolution within a reasonable amount of time, the Title IX Coordinator will terminate the process, and the parties may pursue the other resolution options. A remedy-based resolution is the final resolution of the allegations it addresses, unless a party fails to carry out their commitments under the agreement, as determined by the Title IX Coordinator. C. Facilitation of Administrative Resolution or Remedy-Based Resolution During Investigation Process At any time following the filing of a formal complaint, including during an investigation process, prior to reaching a final determination regarding responsibility, inclusive of any appeal process, the Title IX Coordinator may facilitate an administrative resolution (AR) or a reme - dy-based resolution (RBR), if determined to be appropriate, provided that the Title IX Coordinator: 1. Provides to the parties written notice disclosing the allegations, the requirements, and consequences of the AR or RBR process, including that: (a) completing either resolution precludes the par - ties from initiating or resuming a formal complaint arising from the same allegations; (b) at any time prior to completing the AR or RBR process, either party has the right to withdraw and initi - ate or resume the investigation process; and (c) notice of records that will be maintained or could be shared and with whom. 2. Obtains the parties' voluntary written consent to the AR or RBR process.102 General Information General InformationD. Investigation Process 1. Introduction This option provides both parties with an investigation and adjudica - tion of the allegations. The investigation and adjudication of alleged prohibited conduct under this section is not an adversarial process between the complainant, the respondent and the witnesses, but rather a process by which Caltech complies with its obligations under existing law. The complainant does not have the burden to prove, nor does the respondent have the burden to disprove, the allegations of prohibited conduct. If the decision maker determines that a preponderance of the evidence substantiates alleged prohibited conduct and a violation of the Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy, sanctions, remedies, or systemic remedies, as appropriate, will be imposed. The decisions made by the decision maker, subject to the resolution of any appeal, represent the final resolution of the formal complaint, whether or not a respondent is found responsible. Caltech's investigation will occur independently from any legal/crim - inal proceedings that may take place. Caltech may defer fact gathering for an appropriate time during a criminal investigation. The Title IX Coordinator will assign appropriate investigator(s) to carry out the investigation. The investigator(s) must be impartial and free of any conflict of interest. Generally, for complaints involving stu - dents, staff, or faculty, the Title IX Coordinator will refer the investiga - tion to the lead investigator and appropriate deputy Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator may appoint different investigator(s). All participants in an investigation will receive a fair and impartial process and be treated with dignity, care, and respect. Caltech's policy and investigation procedures are intended to ensure that individuals reported for prohibited conduct are not prejudged and are provided with adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding the alle - gations made against them. Respondents are presumed not responsi - ble for the alleged conduct until a determination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the investigation process. The purpose of the investigation is to gather the evidence relating to the complaint, and decisions are based on an objective evaluation of all relevant evidence, including both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence. Evidence may include statements from the parties and witnesses; documents relating to the complaint, such as texts, photographs, and emails; and physical evidence, such as clothing, rape kit evidence, and weapons. Credibility determinations may not be based on a person's status as a complainant, respondent, or witness. The investigation will be trauma-informed and impartial. Those involved in questioning parties and witnesses\u2014namely, the Title IX Coordinator and Title IX deputies, the investigators and the decision maker\u2014will receive training in conducting fair and trauma-informed investigations and hearings. The investigation will be treated as private to the extent possible. Caltech administrators will be informed on a need-to-know basis. 103 Historical Sketch Institute PoliciesCaltech will make reasonable and appropriate efforts to preserve the privacy of the parties and witnesses, and protect the confidentiality of information. With the exception of the hearing portion of the investiga - tion process, as set out below, no meetings or conversations that take place as part of the investigation process may be recorded by anyone. Investigation files, including the recording of the hearing, will be main - tained by the Equity and Title IX Office. Caltech does not tolerate retaliation and will take steps to prevent retaliation and strong responsive action if it occurs. All participants, including complainants, respondents, and witnesses, are protected against retaliation and will be advised to notify Caltech immediately if retaliation occurs. Any new allegations that arise during the course of the investigation that could subject either party to new or additional sanctions shall be subject to the notice requirements set out above in Sections V (Initial Title IX Assessment) and XI (Notice of Allegations). 2. Limitations on Questioning The investigators and decision maker will not ask parties or witnesses questions that are repetitive, irrelevant, or harassing. Consistent with federal and state law, the investigators and the decision maker will not ask questions or seek evidence of a complainant's prior sexual con - duct with anyone other than the respondent, except to the extent such questions and/or evidence are used to determine whether someone other than the respondent committed the conduct alleged by the com - plainant. Furthermore, evidence of a prior consensual sexual, romantic, or intimate relationship between the complainant and respondent does not by itself imply consent or preclude a finding of prohibited conduct. The investigators and decision maker shall not consider the existence of a dating relationship or prior or subsequent consensual sexual rela - tions between the parties unless the evidence is relevant to how the parties communicated consent in prior or subsequent consensual sex - ual relations. Where the investigators or decision maker allow consid - eration of evidence about a dating relationship or prior or subsequent consensual sexual relations between the parties, the mere fact that the parties engaged in other consensual sexual relations with one another is never sufficient, by itself, to establish that the conduct in question was consensual. Before allowing the consideration of any evidence described in this section, the investigators or decision maker shall pro - vide a written explanation to the parties as to why consideration of the evidence meets the requirements for consideration. The investigation, at any stage, will not require, allow, rely upon, or use questions or evidence that constitute or seek the disclosure of information protected under a legally recognized privilege (e.g., attor - ney-client, doctor-patient, clergy-penitent), unless the person holding such privilege has waived the privilege. Questions that seek information about any party's medical, psychological, and similar records are not permitted unless the party has given written consent. 104 General Information General Information3. Amnesty Concerning Student Policy Violations: Complainants and Witnesses The investigators will investigate any allegations that alcohol or drugs were involved in the incident. A student who participates as a complainant or witness in an investi - gation of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking will not be subject to disciplinary sanctions for a violation of Caltech's student conduct policies at or near the time of the incident, including but not limited to the Substance Abuse Policy, unless Caltech deter - mines that the violation was egregious, including but not limited to, an action that places the health or safety of any other person at risk or involves conduct that violates Caltech's policies prohibiting discrimi - nation, or other serious misconduct like plagiarism, cheating, research misconduct, or other forms of academic dishonesty. 4. Standard of Evidence All decisions made in the course of this investigation process will utilize the preponderance of evidence standard. A preponderance of evidence means that it is more likely than not that the alleged prohibited conduct occurred. Stated another way, it means that the likelihood the alleged prohibited conduct occurred is any amount over 50%. The decision maker will make a decision on the disputed facts and also decide whether the evidence makes it more likely than not that the alleged prohibited conduct occurred based on the evidence available at the time of the decision. When the decision maker is presented with two different but plausible versions of alleged prohibited conduct, credibility determinations may affect the outcome. 5. Identity of the Decision Maker The Title IX Coordinator shall have the discretion to determine which appropriately trained individual will serve as the decision maker in the investigation process. As set forth below, the decision maker conducts any hearing that takes place under these procedures. The parties will be notified of the identity of the decision maker before the hearing as well as the process for objecting to the identity of the decision maker on the basis of a conflict of interest or bias. 6. Determination of Sanctions, Remedies, and Systemic Remedies At the conclusion of the investigation process, if there is a finding of responsibility, the appropriate administrator will determine the appropri - ate sanctions, remedies, and systemic remedies. Generally, the appropriate administrator shall be determined based upon the respondent's affiliation (the vice provost for research or administration for faculty, the assistant vice president for human resources for postdoctoral scholars and campus staff, the deputy direc - tor for human resources at JPL for JPL employees, and the appropriate dean for student respondents). In determining sanctions, remedies, and systemic remedies, these administrators will consult with the Title IX Coordinator and may consult with any other individual they deem appropriate. 105 Historical Sketch Institute Policies7. Timeline Complaints will be investigated and resolved within a reasonably prompt time frame after the complaint has been made, generally 120 calendar days. The Title IX Coordinator will provide the parties written updates of the status of the investigation every thirty (30) days, including the date by which the parties shall be notified of the outcome of the investiga - tion and the deadlines and process for parties to appeal. The Title IX Coordinator may delay the investigation process temporarily or extend the time frame for good cause, providing prompt written notice to the parties of any delays or extensions and the reasons therefor. Good cause may include, but is not limited to the absence of a party, a party's adviser, or a witness; concurrent law enforcement activ - ity; the need for language assistance or accommodation of disabilities; the breadth and scope of the allegations, in terms of content and date, the number of potential witnesses, and the amount of available, rele - vant documentary evidence; the need to conduct a thorough, fair and accurate investigation; and office closures. The Title IX Coordinator shall not unreasonably deny a party's request for an extension of a deadline related to a complaint during periods of examinations or school closures. 8. Procedural Steps for Investigation a. The Title IX Coordinator initiates the investigation process with a notification sent to both parties. This initial notification will iden - tify the assigned investigator(s) and will notify the parties of their right to and process for objecting to either of the investigator(s) or to the Title IX Coordinator on the basis of conflict of interest or bias. b. The complainant and respondent may have an adviser of their choice, in accordance and subject to the requirements set out above in Section III of these Procedures and the Adviser Policy and Confidentiality Agreement. c. The Title IX Coordinator or associate vice president of human resources, as appropriate, will consider any objections by the parties on the basis of conflict or interest or bias and determine the Title IX Coordinator and investigator(s) for the process. d. After a reasonable amount of time to review the notice of allega - tions and applicable policies and procedures, the parties will be given equal opportunity to meet with the investigator(s). In those meetings, the investigator(s) will gather evidence about the alle - gations, including any documents or physical evidence. e. Throughout the process, the parties may suggest witnesses and documents to the investigator(s) as well as questions for the investigator(s) to ask the other party and any witnesses. The investigator(s) will determine whether the suggestions are relevant and appropriate. Caltech asks the parties to keep the investigation private but cannot and will not prohibit the parties from discussing the investigation with others in connection with identifying evidence for the investigator(s) to gather. 106 General Information The parties may not, however, engage in coercion, pressure, undue influence, or retaliation with respect to potential witness - es or other parties in the course of identifying evidence for the investigator(s). The parties may seek guidance from the Title IX Coordinator and the investigator(s) on avoiding these concerns. Communications between parties and witnesses deemed to have resulted from coercion, pressure, undue influence, or retal - iation may be discounted altogether by the decision maker or may be considered by the decision maker in making credibility determinations and weighing evidence deemed subject to the undue influence. f. The investigator(s) will interview relevant witnesses and gather other evidence related to the allegations, if any. Witnesses may also submit documents or written statements to the investiga - tor(s), to supplement their in-person or video interviews. g. In addition to providing information orally during meetings with the investigator(s), the parties may submit written statements and evidence to the investigator(s) that document their experi - ences. Written statements, however, may not wholly supplant live face-to-face or video interviews with the investigator(s). Live face-to-face or video meetings and questioning are important to enable the investigators to conduct a fair, thorough, and efficient investigation. While Caltech cannot compel any party or witness, to meet with the investigator(s), appropriate due process may require Caltech to discount any written statements, and even information provided orally, that the investigators cannot inquire about in an in-person or video meeting. h. The investigator(s) will prepare a draft investigation report iden - tifying the facts disputed by the parties for each allegation, as well as summarizing and identifying the relevant, related evidence gathered, including facts relevant to the credibility of parties or witnesses or items of evidence. The investigators will also provide appendices containing the evidence gathered. The complainant and respondent will be given equal opportunity to review and respond to the investigation report. The report will also be provided to the parties' advisers. All those receiving access to the report will be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement to protect the confidentiality of the material. The non-disclosure agreement will not prohibit the parties from dis - cussing the investigation with others in connection with identify - ing additional evidence for the investigator(s) to gather. Failure to comply with the nondisclosure agreement on the part of a party or their adviser may subject the appropriate party to discipline. If an adviser violates the nondisclosure agreement it will be grounds for excluding the adviser from further participation in the proceedings. The parties will have at least ten (10) calendar days to submit a written response to the report. The investigators will determine whether the parties' responses require any follow-up investigatory action or an opportunity for the other party to respond. 107 Historical Sketchi. The investigator(s) will finalize the investigation report. This final - ized investigation report will be provided to the parties and their advisers, and the decision maker at least thirty (30) calendar days before any hearing. j. Where the investigation addresses allegations that only fall within the Policy Section 16.0, setting out conduct prohibited by the California Education Code, Caltech will determine whether a hearing is necessary to determine whether that alleged prohibit - ed conduct more likely than not occurred. In making this deci - sion, Caltech will consider whether the parties elected to partic - ipate in the investigation, as well as the fact that each party had the opportunity to suggest questions for other parties and wit - nesses during the investigation. If Caltech determines a hearing is necessary, that hearing will not involve any cross-examination conducted directly by a party or a party's adviser. k. Prior to any hearing, the parties will be notified of the identity of the decision maker and will be given an opportunity to object to that individual on the basis of a conflict of interest or bias. l. At any hearing conducted under the investigation process, the decision maker will meet face-to-face, in person or via video, separately, with the parties, and others whom the decision maker deems appropriate, prior to deciding how to resolve the disputed facts, make credibility determinations, and determine whether the allegations and any policy violations are substantiat - ed by a preponderance of the evidence. Any hearing is private and closed to the public. Only the decision maker, the parties and their advisers, witnesses, appropriate administrators, and others determined by Caltech to be necessary to the hearing may attend. The decision-maker will determine an appropriate and reasonable scope and time frame for the hearing, as well as logistical processes for the hearing, such as for making objec - tions and submitting questions. m. The hearing will be conducted with the appropriate technology to allow the parties to virtually observe each other's meeting, and any witness meetings, with the decision maker while main - taining their physical separation. Caltech will grant the requet of any party that the entire hearing, including cross-examination, be held virtually. In making this request, the party does not need to provide a reason. In the absence of such a request. the Title IX Coordinator has the discretion to allow any party or witness to appear at the hearing virtually, with technology enabling partici - pants simultaneously to see and hear each other, as appropriate. Any requests for disability accommodations should be made to the Title IX Coordinator and Caltech's Accessibility Services Specialist. n. All of the evidence that was made available previously in the investigation report will be made available at the hearing to give each party equal opportunity to refer to such evidence during the hearing. o. Before and during the hearing, the parties may submit written questions for the lead investigator and decision maker to ask the Institute Policies108 General Informationother party and any witnesses with whom the decision maker is meeting (indirect cross-examination). The parties can submit written questions during the hearing through the appropriate technology while maintaining their physical separation. The deci - sion maker will facilitate the questioning and may consult with the lead investigator. The decision maker will have the discretion to exclude any question(s) that they determine inappropriate. At the hearing, the other party shall have the opportunity to note an objection in writing to a question posed. Neither the decision maker nor Caltech is obligated to respond to the objection but may consider it and must include it in the record. The deci - sion maker shall have the authority and obligation to discard or rephrase any question that the decision maker deems to be repetitive, irrelevant or harassing. In making these determina - tions, the decision maker is not bound by, but may take guid - ance from, the formal rules of evidence. p. The parties may not introduce evidence, including witness tes - timony, at the hearing that the party did not identify during the investigation and that was available at the time of the investiga - tion. However, the decision maker has the discretion to accept for good cause, or to exclude, such new evidence offered at the hearing. q. In addition, consistent with guidance issued by the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights, the following procedural steps in this paragraph (r) apply only at hearings adjudicating allegations of prohibited conducted covered under Title IX (Policy Section 15.0) and occurring, in whole or in part, on or after August 14, 2020: (i) each party's adviser (but not the parties themselves) may directly and orally ask the other party and any witnesses all relevant questions and follow-up questions, includ - ing those challenging credibility (direct cross-examination); (ii) before a party or witness answers an adviser's direct question, the decision maker must first determine whether the question is relevant and explain any decision to exclude a question as not relevant or otherwise inappropriate; and (iii) for the purpose of the hearing only, if a party does not have an adviser, Caltech will provide without fee or charge to that party an adviser of Caltech's choice who may be, but is not required to be, an attor - ney, to conduct direct cross-examination on behalf of that party. In conducting direct cross-examination of a party or witness, the adviser of a party may ask only those questions drafted by the party whom they are advising. The adviser may not ask questions their party has not drafted. The adviser, moreover, must maintain a calm and respectful tone throughout the direct cross-examination. An adviser may not make objections, state - ments, or arguments during the cross-examination or otherwise during the hearing. The decision maker may disqualify an advis - er who does not follow these rules. r. The decision maker will comply, and ensure others when allowed to ask questions comply, throughout the hearing with Section XIII(D)(2) (Limitations on Questioning) of these Procedures.109 Historical Sketchs. Caltech cannot compel either party, or any witness, to meet with the decision maker at the hearing. However, if a party or witness does not attend the hearing or, when required, refuses to submit to direct cross-examination at the hearing, the decision maker will not rely on any statement of that party or witness in reaching a determination regarding the respondent's responsibility. Police reports, medical reports and other documents and records may not be relied upon to the extent they contain statements of a party or witness who has not submitted to cross-examination. However, the term \"statements\" does not include, for example, evidence such as videos or photographs of the underlying inci - dent. The decision maker may consider texts or emails that in themselves constitute the alleged sexual harassment. The deci - sion maker will decide what evidence may be relied upon with respect to this paragraph (t). The decision maker cannot draw an inference about the determination regarding responsibility based solely on a party's or witness's absence from the hearing or refusal to answer direct cross-examination questions. This means, for example, that the decision maker may not make any decisions about a party's credibility based on their decision not to participate in a hearing or submit to cross-examination. The decision maker may re-evaluate the relevance of any question a party or witness refuses to answer after the hearing has con - cluded. If a party or witness submits to cross-examination by a par - ty's adviser but does not answer a question posed by the deci - sion maker, the decision maker may still rely on that person's statements. The decision maker may not draw any inference about the party's credibility in making the responsibility deter - mination based solely on a party's refusal to answer questions posed by the decision maker. t. Caltech will create an audio or audio-visual recording, or tran - script, only of the hearing and make it available to the parties upon request for their inspection and review. No party, adviser, or witness is permitted to make independent recordings of the hearing or any other meeting or conversation that takes place under the investigation process. u. The decision maker will resolve the disputed facts, make cred - ibility determinations and decide whether the allegations and any policy violations are substantiated by a preponderance of the evidence. In making these decisions, the decision maker will consider the final investigation report and appendices of evidence, the parties' responses to the draft investigation report, the information gathered in the hearing, and the decision mak - er's credibility assessments of those interviewed at the hearing, as appropriate. The potential conclusions the decision maker can reach include but are not limited to: a violation of Caltech's Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy occurred; inappro - priate behavior but no violation occurred; the complaint was not supported by the evidence; the complaint was brought without a reasonable good-faith basis. Institute Policies110 General Information After making these decisions, the decision maker will meet with the appropriate administrator who will determine any sanctions, remedies, and systemic remedies,in order to brief them on the process and factual findings and conclusions. That administrator will be identified and will determine any sanctions, remedies, and systemic remedies, if appropriate, in accordance with Section XIII(D)(5)(Identity of the Decision Maker), (6)(Determination of Sanctions, Remedies, and Systemic Remedies), and (9)(Potential Sanction, Remedies, and Systemic Remedies) of these Procedures. The decision maker will notify the parties simultaneously of all of these determinations in writing. The letter will include: identification of the allegations; a description of the procedural steps taken from the receipt of the formal complaint through the determination of responsibility, including any notifications to the parties, inte views with parties and witnesses, site visits, methods used to gather other evidence, and hearings held; findings of fact supporting the determination; conclusions regarding the application of the Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy and any other applicable Caltech policy to the facts; a statement, and rationale for, the result as to each allegation, including a determination regarding responsibility and any sanctions, remedies, and systemic remedies determined by the appropriate administrator; and procedures and permissible bases for the complainant and respondent to appeal. v. The determinations regarding responsibility and sanctions, reme - dies, and systemic remedies become final either on the date that the parties are provided the result of any appeal, or if an appeal is not filed, the date on which an appeal would no longer be considered timely. w. The Title IX Coordinator will be informed of the outcome of the investigation and any appeal in order to carry out their respon - sibilities to consult on and coordinate implementation of any sanctions, remedies, and systemic remedies, monitor outcomes, identify and address areas of needed education and training presented by the case, and assess and address effects on the campus climate. x. Exceptions to or modification of these procedures can be made at any time by the Title IX Coordinator, provost, deans or asso - ciate deans, associate vice president for human resources, or director for human resources at JPL in order to ensure these procedures promote fairness to both parties and compliance with the law. 9. Potential Sanctions, Remedies, and Systemic Remedies If a violation of Caltech's Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy has occurred, appropriate sanctions, remedies, and systemic remedies, 111 Historical Sketchas appropriate, will be imposed. The appropriate administrator may impose any one or more of the following: Sanctions Verbal warning; Training; Mandatory coaching; Mandatory substance abuse treatment; A formal written warning placed in the respondent's file; Exclusion from participation in certain activities for a specified period of time; Temporary or permanent exclusion from campus; Suspension of the right to accept new graduate students or postdoctoral scholars; Transfer of advisees; Removal from positions of administrative responsibility; Suspension from positions requiring supervision or interaction with students or other members of the Caltec community; Restricted access to Caltech premises; Restricted access to Caltech's educational programs or activities; Removal from Caltech housing; Removal from a supervisory position; Involuntary leave of absence/suspension; Expulsion; Termination of employment; Permanent separation from the Institute; Revocation of admission; Delay or revocation of degree. Remedies Access to counseling services and assistance in setting up initial appointment, both on and off campus; Imposition of \"No Contact Letter;\" where a no-contact directive is issued after a finding of responsibility has been made, it shall be unilateral and apply only against the party found responsible Rescheduling of exams and assignments, and reassignment of grading or other evaluative responsibilities (in conjunction with appropriate faculty and deans as necessary); Providing alternative course completion options (with the agreement of the appropriate faculty); Change in class schedule, including the ability to take an \"incomplete,\" drop a course without penalty, or transfer sections (with the agreement of the appropriate faculty); Change in work schedule or job assignment; Change in on-campus housing, when feasible; Arranging to dissolve a housing contract and prorating a refund in accordance with campus housing policies; Assistance from Caltech support staff in completing housing relocation; Institute Policies112 General Information Limiting an individual or organization's access to certain Caltech facilities or activities pending resolution of the matter; Voluntary leave of absence; Providing an escort to ensure safe movement between classes and activities; Providing medical services; Providing academic support services, such as tutoring; Any other remedy that can be tailored to the involved individuals to reasonably achieve the goals of this policy. Systemic Remedies Institute-wide, Division-wide, and/or Option-wide, or other team-based communication or outreach effort and training, as appropriate Addition of information to Equity and Title IX Office website, or other Institute website, as appropriate Conduct of appropriate climate survey to gather information pertinent to preventative outreach efforts If the respondent was found not to have violated Caltech's Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy, but the investigation concluded that they committed some other wrongful or improper act, appropriate cor - rective action will be taken. Effective corrective action may also require remedies for a complainant and/or systemic remedies for the broader Caltech community. Caltech will take appropriate measures to prevent the reoccurrence of any prohibited conduct, and to correct and prevent any discriminatory or retaliatory effects, as appropriate. In determining sanctions, remedies, and systemic remedies, as appropriate, the administrator will consult with the Title IX Coordinator and other persons they deem appropriate, to take steps to prevent recurrence of any harassment and to correct its discriminatory effects on the complainant and, if appropriate, others. NOTE: The Institute may undertake remedies and systemic reme - dies, as appropriate, to safeguard a complainant's access to education, at any time. The complainant's engagement in a resolution process is not a prerequisite for such Institute action. 10. Disclosure of Outcomes Outcomes of disciplinary proceedings may be disclosed consistent with applicable law, including FERPA, Title IX, and the Clery Act. Upon request, Caltech will disclose the outcomes of a disciplinary proceeding against a student who is the alleged perpetrator of any crime of sexual violence to the alleged victim. Outcomes of the investigation process will be disclosed on a need-to- know basis, as determined by the Title IX Coordinator, in order to effect sanctions and/or other remedies and systemic remedies. 11. Appeal Appeals may be submitted by either party. They must be in writing and submitted within ten (10) calendar days of notification of the decision to 113 Historical Sketchthe appropriate administrator (the provost for faculty, the associate vice president for human resources for postdoctoral scholars and campus staff, the vice president of student affairs for students, or, the director for human resources at JPL for JPL employee respondents). In assess - ing appeals, these administrators may consult with any individual they deem appropriate. The recipient of the appeal will notify the Title IX Coordinator and any other party in writing when an appeal is filed. Appeals of decisions resulting from the investigation process are lim - ited to one or more of the following grounds: a procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter; new evidence (including a new witness) that was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding responsibility was made and that could affect the outcome of the matter; the Title IX Coordinator, investigator(s), decision mak - er(s), or administrator who determined and imposed any sanctions or remedies had a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally or the individual complainant or respondent that affected the outcome of the matter; the sanctions or remedies are substantially disproportionate to the conduct for which the respondent was found responsible. If a party submits an appeal, the other party will have the opportu - nity to submit a written response to the appeal within ten (10) calendar days of the filing of the appeal. The parties simultaneously will be informed, in writing, of the outcome of the appeal. The appeal decision letter will state the rationale for the result. Appeal decisions are final. XIV. Further Complaints If the corrective action does not end the prohibited conduct, the com - plainant should immediately notify at campus the Title IX Coordinator, or a deputy Title IX Coordinator, the provost or a division chair, dean or associate dean, Employee and Organizational Development director; or at JPL, the Deputy Title IX Coordinator. In such cases, the complainant has the right to file another formal complaint based on new prohibited conduct.

Faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars, and students are required to comply with this policy and the related guidelines provided by the academic divisions and student organizations. 2.0 Scope 2.1 Prohibited Conduct The unlawful use, manufacture, distribution, cultivation, dispensation, possession, sale, purchase of, or offer to sell or purchase controlled substances* or alcohol on the Caltech campus or its off-site loca - tions, including the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (\"JPL\"), or as any part of its activities, is prohibited. Controlled substances include, but are not limited to, marijuana, heroin, cocaine, LSD, and amphetamines. Despite recent changes to California law, marijuana still is a controlled substance under federal law, and therefore the use, manufacture, dis - tribution, cultivation, dispensation, possession, sale, purchase of or offer to sell or purchase marijuana on the Caltech campus or its off-site locations, including JPL, or as any part of its activities, continues to be prohibited. The recreational use of nitrous oxide is also prohibited under this policy. In addition, every employee is prohibited from being under the influ - ence of controlled substances, alcohol, or any substance that may impair the employee's ability to perform their job duties safely or productively, or that may otherwise impair their senses, coordination, or judgment while on duty. Any employee reporting to work (or otherwise at work) under the influence of, or having present in their body, any prescribed drug, alcohol, or other substances or medication that may adversely affect the employee's ability to work in a safe, productive, or efficient manner, must advise their supervisor. Caltech may require an employee to submit to drug and alcohol testing consistent with Caltech policy and applicable federal and state law. Testing procedures that apply to JPL employees are available on the JPL Human Resources website. 2.2 Requirements for Employees and Students As a condition of continued enrollment, every student is required to comply with this policy. As a condition of employment, all Caltech employees (this includes faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars, and student employees), regardless of their location, are required to com - ply with this policy. A Caltech employee who violates this policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. A violation of this policy is likely to result in termination, even for a first offense. Similarly, all students, not just student employ - ees, should understand that disciplinary action including involuntary leave or expulsion from Caltech may be invoked for violation of this policy and that intoxication is never an excuse for misconduct. Caltech may contact a student's parents when a student under 21 violates this policy. If a student's behavior with respect to alcohol and drugs presents a danger to themselves or others, Caltech may inform the parents. 115 Historical SketchIn addition, pursuant to federal law, a student's eligibility for feder - al financial aid may be suspended if the student is convicted, under federal or state law, of any offense involving the possession or sale of illegal drugs. A faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholar, or student who is convicted (including a plea of nolo contendere [no contest]) of a criminal drug statute violation occurring in the workplace or on Caltech property must notify Caltech in writing within five (5) calendar days after the conviction. Campus employees should inform the assistant vice pres - ident of human resources, and students should inform their dean. JPL employees should inform the manager of employee relations. 2.3 Third Party Requirements Persons who are not employees of Caltech but who perform work at Caltech for its benefit (such as contractors and their employees, tem - porary employees provided by agencies, visitors engaged in joint proj - ects at Caltech, etc.), are required to comply with this policy. Violation of this policy is likely to result in being barred from the workplace even for a first offense. 3.0 Health Risks The use of any mind- or mood-altering substance, including alcohol, can lead to psychological dependence, which is defined as a need or craving for the substance and feelings of restlessness, tension, or anx - iety when the substance is not used. In addition, with many substanc - es, use can lead to physical tolerance, characterized by the need for increasing amounts of the substance to achieve the same effect, and/ or physical dependence, characterized by the onset of unpleasant or painful physiological symptoms when the substance is no longer being used. As tolerance and psychological or physical dependence develop, judgment becomes impaired, and the individual often does not realize they are losing control over the use of the substance and that they need help. It is impossible to predict accurately how an individual will react to a specific drug or to alcohol because effects vary depending on the person, environmental variables, the dosage and potency of the sub - stance, the method of taking the substance, the frequency of use, and whether the substance is taken in conjunction with other substances. Illegal drugs have particularly unpredictable effects due to variabili - ty in dosage and purity. Further, the overall potency of street drugs has increased dramatically over the past two decades, making users increasingly susceptible to negative effects. Alcohol acts as a depressant to the central nervous system and can cause serious short- and long-term damage. Short-term effects include nausea, vomiting, and ulcers; more chronic abuse can lead to brain, liver, kidney, and heart damage, and even to eventual death. Ingesting a large amount of alcohol at one time can lead to alcohol poisoning, coma, and death. Drugs such as LSD, amphetamines, marijuana, and alcohol alter emotion, cognition, perception, physiology, and behavior in a variety of ways. Health risks include but are not limited to depres - Institute Policies116 General Informationsion, apathy, hallucinations, paranoia, and impaired judgment, and all substances have an adverse effect on pregnancy and the fetus. When two or more substances are combined, the effect is often stronger than their additive sum. 4.0 Local, State, and Federal Legal Sanctions Local, state, and federal laws establish severe penalties for violations of drug and alcohol statutes. These sanctions, upon conviction, may range from a fine to life imprisonment. In the case of possession and distribu - tion of illegal drugs, these sanctions could include the seizure and sum - mary forfeiture of property, including vehicles. It is especially important to know that federal laws have established penalties for illegally distributing drugs to include life imprisonment and fines of up to $10,000,000. 4.1 Examples Unlawful possession of a narcotic drug is punishable by impris - onment in the state prison. The purchase, possession, or consumption of any alcoholic bev- erages (including beer and wine) by any person under the age of 21 is prohibited. It is illegal to provide alcohol to a person under the age of 21. Serving alcohol to an intoxicated person is prohibited. Selling any alcoholic beverages, except under the authority of a California Alcoholic Beverage Control License, is prohibited. It is a felony to induce another person to take various drugs and \"intoxicating agents\" with the intent of enabling oneself or the drugged person to commit a felony. The person who induced the other may be regarded as a principal in any crime committed. Any person found in a public place to be under the influence of an intoxicating liquor or drug and unable to care for their own safety, or who is interfering with the use of a public way, is guilty of disorderly conduct, which is a misdemeanor. It is illegal for a person to possess nitrous oxide (e.g. whippets) with the intent to inhale it for purpose of altering their mood or mental functioning. 5.0 Resources for Staff, Faculty, Postdoctoral Scholars and Students Caltech recognizes drug and alcohol abuse and dependency as treat - able conditions and offers faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars, and stu - dents support programs for individuals with substance use problems. Faculty, staff, and postdoctoral scholars are encouraged to seek assis - tance for drug- and alcohol-related problems through the Caltech Staff and Faculty Consultation Center (SFCC) at campus and the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) at JPL. Individuals can contact the SFCC by calling (626) 395-8360, and the EAP by calling (800) 367-7474. Students are encouraged to seek assistance from the Student Wellness Services (SWS) at (626) 395-8331. In addition, faculty, staff, postdoc - toral scholars, and students can seek confidential referral information through the Center for Inclusion & Diversity at (626) 395-3221.117 Historical SketchThe staff of the SFCC, the EAP , and the SWS will help employees and students to identify appropriate treatment resources and will refer them to counseling, treatment, or rehabilitation programs, as appropri - ate. Health insurance plans provide varying amounts of coverage for substance-abuse programs to address substance abuse and rehabil - itation. Individuals may contact their health providers or the Caltech Human Resources Benefits office at campus at (626) 395-6443, or JPL at (818) 354-4447, for plan details. Information obtained regarding a faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholar, or student during voluntary partici - pation in services at the SFCC, EAP , SWS, or any related program will be treated as strictly confidential, and no information, including whether or not an individual is receiving services, will be shared with third par - ties, except by written consent or as required by law. 6.0 Drug and Alcohol Awareness Program Caltech has established and will maintain a drug and alcohol aware - ness program to educate faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars, and stu - dents about: 1. Caltech's substance abuse policy; 2. the dangers of drugs and alcohol in a work and academic envi - ronment; faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholar, and student assis - tance programs; and 3. disciplinary action that may be imposed on faculty, staff, post - doctoral scholars, and students for violations of this policy. Caltech will distribute to all faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars, and students a copy of this policy on an annual basis. 7.0 Supervisor's Responsibilities If an employee is suspected of violating this policy, the employee's supervisor should consult with the director of employee and orga - nizational development (EOD) at campus or the Employee Relations Department of the Human Resources Directorate at JPL regarding appropriate actions, which may include an investigation and discipline up to and including termination of employment. If a supervisor believes an employee's behavior raises safety concerns for the employee or others, the supervisor must take immediate action, including calling EOD on campus or the Employee Relations Department of the Human Resources Directorate at JPL, to assess and address the situation and to remove the employee from the worksite if necessary. 8.0 Caltech Sanctions Caltech will impose sanctions for violations of or failure to comply with the requirements of this policy. These sanctions will be consistently enforced, and penalties will depend on the severity of the offenses. Penalties may include employment termination and student expulsion from Caltech, and referral to law enforcement for the most serious vio - lations of the law and this policy (e.g., the manufacture or distribution of banned substances). Disciplinary action may be invoked entirely Institute Policies118 General Informationapart from any civil or criminal penalties that the faculty, staff, postdoc - toral scholars, and students might incur. UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT 1.0 Policy It is the policy of Caltech to provide a work and academic environment free of unlawful harassment (\"harassment\"). Harassment is a form of misconduct that includes unwelcome physical, verbal or nonverbal conduct that results in a person feeling intimidated, threatened, humili - ated, or demeaned, and is likely to interfere with an individual's work or education, or adversely affects an individual's living conditions. Harassment in any form, based on any of the following protected char - acteristics and protected activities (\"protected characteristics\"), is unlawful and is strictly prohibited at all times, as are all forms of prohibited conduct set forth in the Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy, including sexu - al and gender-based harassment and sexual misconduct: Race (includes hair texture and protective hairstyle) Color Religion (includes religious dress and grooming practices) Sex/gender (includes pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, and/ or related medical conditions) Gender identity and gender expression Sexual orientation Marital status Medical condition (genetic characteristics, cancer, or a record or history of cancer) Military or veteran status National origin (includes language use and possession of a driver's license issued to persons unable to prove that their pres - ence in the United States is authorized under federal law) Ancestry Disability (mental and physical, including HIV/AIDS, cancer, and genetic characteristics) Genetic information Request for family care leave Request for leave for a serious health condition Request for pregnancy disability leave Domestic violence victim status Age (over 40) Criminal background (Fair Chance Act) Any other factor protected by federal, state, or local law Association with an individual who is in one of the foregoing pro- tected characteristics Harassment in the employment environment may include, but is not limited to, these examples: Verbal, physical, and visual conduct that creates an intimidating, offensive, or hostile working environment, or that interferes with 119 Historical Sketchwork performance, including conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual because of any protected characteristic Verbal statements, such as slurs, offensive jokes, insults, epithets, name calling, or teasing Visual or graphic images, such as offensive and/or sexually orient - ed posters, photographs, symbols, cartoons, drawings, computer displays, e-mails, text messages, objects, or digital and social media activity, including blogs, forums, chat rooms, social net - working sites, and other social media applications Physical conduct, including touching, physical assaults or threats, blocking someone's path or normal movement, gestures, and leer - ing Other forms of intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put- downs Interference with work performance Unwanted sexual advances, invitations, or comments Threats and demands to submit to sexual requests as a condition of continued employment or to avoid loss of employment benefits Offers of employment benefits in return for sexual favors Conversation about one's own or someone else's sex life, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender nonconformity, and/or gender identity Inappropriate conduct or comments consistently targeted at only one gender, race, or another protected characteristic Harassment in the educational setting also includes harassment based on protected characteristics that is contrary to the pursuit of inquiry and education. The following are examples of behaviors that may constitute harassment in the educational setting: An adviser tells a minority student not to take a certain course because the adviser says that other minority students have had difficulty in the course A disabled individual is not included in an off-site outing because of lack of mobility A faculty member assigns only menial tasks to a minority stu- dent worker while assigning more complex tasks to a Caucasian student worker who is at the same educational level. A student tells racially offensive jokes within a study group ses- sion with other students An individual is ostracized from group activities because of their national origin A student posts racist jokes to a house email list Complaints concerning sex and gender-based discrimination and harassment and sexual misconduct are governed by the Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy. Caltech is committed to educating the community in ways to prevent harassment. Caltech requires all employees, including those respon - sible for directing or supervising other Caltech employees or evaluat - ing the work of students, to regularly participate in training regarding harassment, and the prevention of harassment and other abusive con - duct, consistent with federal and state legal requirements. Institute Policies120 General Information2.0 Scope This policy applies to all members of the Caltech community, including at JPL (students, faculty, supervisory and nonsupervisory employees, postdoctoral scholars, volunteers, interns, vendors, contractors, per - sons performing services under contract with Caltech, visitors, and any other individuals regularly or temporarily employed, studying, living, visiting, or otherwise participating in Caltech's employment and educa - tion programs and activities). This policy applies to conduct occurring on Institute-controlled property, at Institute-sponsored events and in Institute employment and education programs and activities regardless of location. 3.0 Reporting Complaints and Concerns Caltech's ability to remedy harassment and maintain a harassment-free environment is limited if incidents are not reported. Anyone who wit - nesses, experiences, or is otherwise aware of conduct that they believe to be in violation of this policy, including retaliation, is urged to imme - diately report it, or to request any assistance and guidance, from the Equity and Title IX Office or one of the Equal Employment Opportunity coordinators listed below, at campus, or the Employee Relations Group at JPL. Reports may be made at any time. A delay should not discour - age anyone from reporting harassment. Delayed reporting is better than no reporting. Reports may be made in writing or orally. Members of the Caltech community are encouraged to err on the side of reporting any conduct they think may be harassment covered under this policy, regardless of where the incident occurred or who committed it. Even if Caltech does not have jurisdiction over the inci - dent or the perpetrator, Caltech will take reasonable action to remedy the effects of the harassment on the Caltech community and prevent any reoccurrence of the behavior. Any employee in a supervisory role, including faculty, must promptly report all alleged harassment, discrimination, gender-based miscon - duct, and retaliation, regardless of its alleged severity or frequency, to the Equity and Title IX Office at campus or Human Resources at JPL, which will provide guidance and advice. In addition, other employees qualifying as responsible employees under the Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy, Section II, 6.2, must promptly report any instance of prohibited conduct, as defined in Section III, 13.0, to the Equity and Title IX Office or the Deputy Title IX coordinator for JPL, as appropriate. If a member of the Caltech community would like support and guidance in filing a complaint, they may contact one of the Equal Employment Opportunity coordinators, the assistant vice president for equity and equity investigations in the Equity and Title IX Office, JPL's manager of employee relations, or the JPL section manager of talent management or Human Resources Business Partners at JPL. 121 Historical Sketch4.0 Anonymous Reporting Caltech provides the following resources for anonymous reporting: Campus Hotline (626) 395-8787 or (888) 395-8787 JPL Ethics Hotline (818) 354-9999 JPL Protective Services Division's Workplace Violence Hotline (818) 393-2851 For either Campus or JPL by submitting a compliance Hotline Contact Form If the reporting party wants to remain anonymous, they should not share any personally identifying information. If the reporting party does share such information, the Equity and Title IX Office will contact the reporting party with information about support resources and reporting options. If an investigation is pursued, the reporting party who identi - fied themselves will be notified. 5.0 Contacting Outside Agencies In addition, employees who believe they have been unlawfully harassed on the basis of a protected characteristic have the right to file a com - plaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which have the authority to remedy violations. Employees, students, and others participating in Caltech's educational programs and activities may file complaints with the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (415) 486-5555, ocr.sanfrancisco@ed.gov or (800) 421-3481 or OCR@ed.gov. Complaints may also be directed to the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education at https://bppe.ca.gov/. 6.0 Investigation of Complaints Caltech will conduct an appropriate, timely, and thorough investiga - tion into complaints within the scope of this policy to determine what occurred and take reasonable steps to remedy the effects of any harassment and prevent recurrence of the behavior. Caltech provides all parties with appropriate due process and reaches appropriate con - clusions based on the evidence collected. Caltech takes appropriate action, including disciplinary measures, when warranted. 7.0 Prohibition against Retaliation No one may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by this policy or the related procedures, or because the indi - vidual has made a report or complaint, testified, assisted, participated, or refused to participate in any manner in any action or process under this policy or the related procedures. Intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination, for the purpose of interfering with any right under this policy or the related procedures constitutes retaliation. The rights and privileges secured under this policy and the related procedures include Institute Policies122 General Informationbut are not limited to: (i) filing or assisting in the filing of a complaint or report of a suspected violation of this policy; (ii) opposing any act or practice made unlawful by any federal, state, or local laws requiring equal opportunity; (iii) participating, assisting, or otherwise cooperating in an investigation, compliance review, hearing, or any other activity related to a violation of this policy or administration of any federal, state, or local law requiring equal opportunity; and/or (iv) exercising any legal right protected by federal, state or local law requiring equal opportunity. Complaints of retaliation will be addressed under the Procedures for Complaints of Unlawful Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation. The following actions do not constitute retaliation: the exercise of rights protected under applicable law or Caltech's charging an indi - vidual with a policy violation for making a materially false statement in bad faith in the course of a resolution process. A determination that a respondent was responsible for alleged misconduct alone is not suffi - cient to conclude that any party made a materially false statement in bad faith. 8.0 Privacy A member of the Caltech community who wishes to report unlawful discrimination, harassment, or retaliation should do so as soon as pos - sible, although reports (hereinafter \"complaints\") may be made at any time. Complaints can be made orally or in writing. Complaints should be brought to the attention of one of the individuals designated in this Policy. Privacy generally means that information related to a report of harassment will only be shared with those individuals who have a \"need to know.\" The determination of who has a \"need to know\" is within the discretion of Caltech. These individuals are required to be discreet and respect the privacy of all individuals involved. No meetings or conversations that take place under this policy or the Procedures for Complaints of Unlawful Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation may be audio- or audio-visually recorded by anyone. 9.0 Confidential Resources Caltech offers members of the Caltech community the choice of seek - ing confidential counseling outside of Caltech's procedural mechanisms for resolving unlawful harassment complaints. These confidential coun - seling services are intended for the personal benefit of the individual and offer a setting where various courses of action can be explored. Members of the Caltech community may access the offices below for confidential support. Counselors and designated confidential advocates in these offices will listen and help identify options and next steps. Talking to any of these staff members does not constitute reporting an incident to Caltech. Confidentiality generally means that information shared by an indi - vidual with designated campus or community professionals cannot be revealed to any other individual without the express permission of the individual. These professionals are listed below. They are prohibited 123 Historical Sketchfrom breaking confidentiality unless there is an imminent threat of harm to self or others or as otherwise required or permitted by law. When a report involves suspected abuse of a minor under the age of 18, these confidential resources may be required by state law to notify child pro - tective services and/or local law enforcement. An individual who has experienced unlawful harassment and who first requests confidentiality may later decide to file a complaint with Caltech. The mental health professionals and other confidential resources listed below will provide the individual with assistance in fil - ing a complaint if the individual wishes to do so. Mental health professionals in the Student Wellness Services' Counseling Services and the Staff and Faculty Consultation Center pro - vide mental health counseling services to the campus community. The JPL Employee Assistance Program provides mental health counseling services to the JPL community. They will not report any information about an incident to Caltech, including the Title IX coordinator, unless requested by their client. They can be contacted 24 hours a day/7 days a week at: For students: (626) 395-8331 Student Wellness, Counseling Services (626) 395-5000 after hours Counseling Services may be contacted via Security For faculty, campus staff and postdoctoral scholars: (626) 395-8360 Staff & Faculty Consultation Center (626) 395-5000 after hours via Security For JPL employees: (800) 367-7474 Empathia identify yourself as a JPL employee https://www.mylifematters. com/ (Password: JPL) Other Confidential resources are: Caltech Center for Inclusion & Diversity (students): (626) 395-3221 or (626) 395-8108 Campus Hotline: (626) (888) 395-8787 JPL Ethics Hotline: (818) 354-9999 10.0 Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinators and Title IX Coordinator Caltech has designated Equal Opportunity coordinators who are responsible for assisting with and coordinating the education and com - pliance efforts relating to equal opportunity and nondiscrimination laws and Caltech policies. The following individuals have been designated as Equal Employment Opportunity coordinators (EEO coordinators): the provost is the coordinator for faculty, the assistant vice president for Institute Policies124 General Informationhuman resources is the coordinator for campus staff and volunteers, the associate deans of students are the coordinators for undergraduate students and interns, the dean of graduate studies is the coordinator for graduate students and interns, and the director for human resourc - es at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is the coordinator for employees, interns and volunteers assigned there. The assistant vice president for equity and equity investigations, who manages the Equity and Title IX Office, also has been designated as Caltech's Title IX coordinator. The contact number is (626) 395-3132, email: equity@caltech.edu, or visit the office in Room 205, Center for Student Services. 11.0 Informational Resources Information on unlawful harassment, as well as copies of Caltech's Nondiscrimination and Equal Employment Opportunity, Unlawful Harassment, Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct, and Violence Prevention policies, are available from Caltech's Title IX coordinator and deputy coordinators, Human Resources, Student Affairs and Deans offices, the Caltech Center for Inclusion & Diversity, resident associates, the Staff and Faculty Consultation Center, and Employee & Organizational Development at campus, and Employee Relations and the Human Resources Business Partners at JPL.

Caltech promotes measures aimed at reducing incidents of violence and the management of situations that may lead to violence. All members of the Caltech community shall cooperate to maintain a safe environment and shall comply with this policy. 2.0 Scope 2.1 Prohibited Conduct Caltech does not tolerate violence, threats of violence, child abuse, 125 Historical Sketchchild neglect, or stalking on any Institute premises or in any Institute activity or program. All weapons are banned from Institute premises and at Institute activities and programs as set forth below. 2.2 Reporting Violence Any individual who experiences or observes a threat or act of violence, or a weapon on Institute premises or at an Institute activity or program must immediately notify Campus Security or JPL Protective Services Division, or law enforcement. An individual at a non-campus or non- JPL location must immediately notify local law enforcement. Campus Security (626) 395-5000 JPL Protective Services Division (818) 354-3530 If an individual becomes aware of behavior that they find concerning, the individual should notify one of the following individuals or offices: Employee's supervisor/management Campus Human Resources \u2014 EOD (626) 395-8039 Dean of Students (626) 395-6351 Dean of Graduate Studies (626) 395-6346 Provost Office (626) 395-6320 Assistant Vice President for Equity and Equity Investigations, Title IX Coordinator (626) 395-3130 Campus Security (626) 395-5000 Caltech Hotline (anonymous) (626) 395-8787 or (888) 395-8787 JPL Human Resources (818) 354-4447 JPL Protective Services Division (818) 354-3530 JPL Workplace Violence Hotline (818) 393-2851 JPL Ethics Office (818) 354-6338 JPL Ethics Help Line (anonymous) (818) 354-9999 or (866) 405-7536 Caltech will handle all reports of violence in a confidential manner, with information released as determined to be appropriate by Caltech. Managers are required to immediately report any violation or suspect - ed violation of this policy to Caltech Security, JPL Protective Services Division, Human Resources, the deans or the provost, whether the violation is observed on Institute premises or at any Institute activity or program. Caltech policy prohibits retaliation against any faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholar, student, or third party who, in good faith, reports a violation or suspected violation of this policy. Caltech will not tolerate intentional false reporting of incidents. A good faith complaint that results in a finding of \"no violation\" is not considered a false report. However, when a complainant or third party is found to have fabricated allegations or to have given false informa - tion with malicious intent or in bad faith, they may be subject to disci - plinary action. Institute Policies126 General Information2.3 Reporting Child Abuse or Child Neglect Every member of the Caltech community who knows of or reasonably suspects child abuse or child neglect has a personal responsibility to report to Caltech Security or the JPL Protective Services Division immediately. Certain members of the community\u2014known as mandated report - ers\u2014have a legal responsibility to act. A mandated reporter is a Caltech employee who meets one of the following definitions: (a) holds a job recognized by the State of California as one that is legally required to report child abuse or neglect no matter where it occurs; or (b) engages in duties that bring them into contact with children on a regular basis or who supervises those whose duties bring them into contact with children on a regular basis, and thus are required to report child abuse or neglect occurring on Caltech premises or at an official activity of, or program conducted by, Caltech. All athletic coaches, including assistant coaches and graduate assistants involved in coach - ing, are mandated reporters under part (a) of the definition above and must report child abuse or neglect no matter where it occurs. Certain other professionals at Caltech, such as medical and mental health pro - fessionals, are also mandated reporters under part (a). Mandated reporters must report child abuse and neglect whenever, in their professional capacity or within the scope of their employment, they observe or reasonably suspect it. A mandated reporter should rea - sonably suspect child abuse or neglect whenever \"it is objectively rea - sonable ... to entertain such a suspicion, based upon facts that could cause a reasonable person in a like position, drawing, when appropri - ate, on his or her training and experience, to suspect child abuse or neglect.\" (Penal Code \u00a7 11166(a)). Mandated reporters have the additional responsibility to report immediately or as soon as practicably possible by telephone and to submit a written follow-up report within 36 hours of receiving infor - mation concerning the incident to the LA County Child Protection Hotline (800) 540-4000 (or from out of state (213) 639-4500) or to the Pasadena Police Department 911 (for emergencies) or (626) 744-4501 (for non-emergencies), or to another local police department. A Suspected Child Abuse Report (SCAR) can be completed online (where the initial report was made to the LA County Child Protection Hotline) at https://mandreptla.org. Mandated reporters will be provided the opportunity for training by Caltech and must sign an \"Employee Acknowledgement of mandated reporter status.\" 2.4 Definitions Acts of violence include any physical action, whether intentional or reck - less, that harms or threatens the safety of another individual at Caltech. A threat of violence includes any behavior that by its very nature could be interpreted by a reasonable person as intent to cause physical harm to another individual. Child means a person under the age of 18 years. Child abuse includes physical injury inflicted on a child by another person, serious endangerment of a child's physical or mental health 127 Historical Sketchdue to injury by act or omission, sexual exploitation of a child (including sexual intercourse between a child under 16 years of age and a person 21 years of age or older), lewd or lascivious acts, and child molestation; and unlawful corporal punishment. Child neglect includes negligent treatment or maltreatment of a child under circumstances indicating harm or threatened harm to the child's health or welfare. Stalking is a course of conduct directed at an individual that would cause a reasonable person to fear for his or safety or the safety of others, or suffer substantial emotional distress. Course of conduct means two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any action, meth - od, device, or means, follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person or interferes with the person's property. Reasonable person means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the victim. Stalking that is sex or gender-based should be reported and will be handled pursuant to the Sex-and Gender-Based Misconduct policy and applicable pro - cedures. Stalking that is not sex or gender-based is covered by this policy. Weapon is defined as a firearm, ammunition, BB or pellet gun, paint - ball gun, stun gun, compressed air gun, or any replica firearm, martial arts weapon, fireworks, explosives, dangerous or highly flammable chemicals, dirk, dagger, ice pick, or knife having a blade longer than 2 1/2 inches (except for a knife or ice pick used for food preparation or consumption or for a lawful use in or around a residence), razor with an unguarded blade, razor blade, or box cutter (except for a razor, razor blade or box cutter for lawful use in a residence), or any object when used in a manner or under a circumstance that potentially may or does result in an act of violence or threat of violence.

Student Affairs Policies130 Study and ResearchSection Two Areas of Study and Research Areas of Study and Research 131 Historical SketchAEROSPACE The Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory, the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Jet Propulsion, and the Firestone Flight Sciences Laboratory form the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories, widely known as GALCIT. In this complex are housed the solid mechanics, impact mechanics, and deployable space structures laboratories, the hyper - sonics and hydrodynamics facilities, the explosion dynamics and deto - nation physics laboratories, and the Joe and Edwina Charyk Laboratory of Bioinspired Design and Biopropulsion, the Center for Autonomous Systems and Technologies, as well as the various disciplines making up the broad field known as aerospace. Areas of Research Aerospace has evolved at Caltech from a field of basic research and engineering, primarily related to the development of the airplane, into a wide discipline encompassing a broad spectrum of basic as well as applied problems in fluid dynamics and mechanics of solids and materials and design and control of autonomous systems. Educational and research thrusts include the application of mechanics to various aspects of space exploration and to the study of biosystems and bio - propulsion. Research at GALCIT has traditionally pioneered exploration of areas that have anticipated subsequent technological demands. This tradition places a high premium on in-depth understanding of fields both closely and remotely related to the behavior of fluids, solids, combustion, materials, and structures, such as physics, applied and computational mathematics, dynamical systems, earthquake physics, atmospheric studies, materials science, micro- and optoelectronics, microfluidics, bioinspired design, biomedical devices, and even astro - physics. GALCIT students are known and sought after for their broad yet intense education and for their ability to deal with new and chal - lenging problems. Major areas of experimental, theoretical, and numerical research cur - rently pursued by aerospace students at Caltech are briefly described below. Mechanics of Lightweight Space Structures. Current efforts in the field of next-generation deployable space structures aim to increase reliability and also lower fabrication and assembly costs by moving toward structures that consist of only a small number of separate pieces able to undergo large elastic deformations. These elastic-stored-energy structures return to their original, unstressed configuration when they are released in orbit. The design of these structures requires accurate structural models that incorporate geometry change and contact effects in suf - ficient detail to capture the actual behavior that is observed in ground tests. Local and global instabilities are often observed during folding/deployment, and their effects can also be very important. Ultimately, validation against space-based experi - ments will be pursued for a selected number of structural con - figurations. In parallel to these studies, thermomechanical con - Aerospace 132 Study and Researchstitutive models for ultrathin composite materials for these novel deployable space structures are being developed. Extensive studies of the deployment, elastic, and viscoelastic stability of stratospheric balloons are also being conducted. Physics of Fluids. Fluid dynamics as a discipline is as much a part of physics as of engineering. Physics of fluids refers to research in areas closer to applied physics than to direct techni - cal applications. Present active research includes studies in gas dynamics and hypervelocity flows, diffraction and focusing of shock waves, detonation waves, shock-induced Rayleigh-Taylor and Richtmeyer-Meshkov instabilities, transient supersonic jets, the development of laser-scattering diagnostic techniques for fluid-flow measurements, the study of structures and mechanics in transition and turbulence, studies of two-phase flows and turbulent mixing, chemically reacting flows, and experimental manipulation and control of wall-bounded flows for improved flow characteristics, such as reduction of drag, noise, and struc - tural loading. Physics of Solids and Mechanics of Materials. Mechanics of materials research involves both the quasi-static and dynamic characterization of the mechanical behavior and failure of solids. In order to understand materials for applications in a wide range of structures germane to aerospace as well as other engineering disciplines, both the physical foundations of that behavior and the mathematical or numerical representation of such behavior needs to be understood. Accordingly, studies involve material response at both the macroscopic (continuum) scales and the micro- and nanoscales. Of interest are the typical engineering metals, multiphase (composite) materials, polymers and ceram - ics, thin film materials used in microelectronic and optoelectron - ic applications, soft tissue mechanics of materials, and active materials used in structural actuation and controls. Other areas of active research include the study of highly nonlinear dynamics in solids, multiscale acoustic metamaterials, the analysis and design of mechanical metamaterials for the extreme conditions in air and space applications, and nondestructive evaluation/ structural health monitoring of structures. Space Technology. The goal of industrial utilization and explo - ration of space requires that one addresses a wide range of engineering problems. Examples of research activities include lightweight structures for large aperture systems, in-space man - ufacturing, material and structural behavior in extreme tempera - ture and radiation environments, spacecraft shielding against hypervelocity impact threats, the mechanics of sample contain - ment for planetary protection, tion and control, and launch-vehicle performance and safety. Opportunities exist for research in collaboration with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Areas of Study and Research133 Historical Sketch Computational Solid Mechanics. Computational solid mechanics addresses phenomena ranging from the atomistic scale, e.g., nanostructured materials or nanoscale structures and devices, to the structural scale, e.g., fracture of aircraft or spacecraft components, modeling of large space structures or even dynamic fragmentation phenomena accompanying hypervelocity impact. It provides an indispensable tool for understanding the relation between structure and mechanical properties of materials, for predicting the efficiency of such industrial processes as machining and metal forming, and for assessing the safety of such structures as airplanes, space - craft, automobiles, and bridges. The goals and objectives of this activity are to provide a state-of-the-art environment for the development of numerical methods in solid mechanics, to provide the computational resources required for large-scale simulations in solid mechanics, and to serve as an instructional facility for advanced courses. Computational and Theoretical Fluid Dynamics. Many of the fluid dynamics phenomena studied experimentally at GALCIT are also being investigated by numerical simulation and by the - oretical analysis. Present active research areas in computational and theoretical techniques include direct numerical simulation, particle methods for flow simulation, new algorithms and sub - grid-scale models for compressible and incompressible flows, large-eddy simulation methods, flows with shocks and driven by shocks, analytical and computational techniques for turbulence structure diagnostics, analysis of turbulent mixing dynamics, high-explosive interactions with deformable boundaries, chem - ically reacting flows, and detailed chemical reaction kinetics in flames and detonations. Mechanics of Fracture. An active effort is being made to understand mechanisms in a wide range of fracture problems. Aspects that are studied include quasi-static and dynamic crack growth phenomena in brittle and plastically deforming solids, polymers and advanced composites, as well as fatigue and failure of adhesive bonds. Research areas adjunct to dynamic fracture studies are those of dynamic localization in metals and of failure in frictional interfaces. These include the study of shear rupture phenomena in both coherent and incoherent interfaces. The dynamic failure of modern composite and layered materials and the phenomenon of earthquake rupture growth along geo - logical faults have motivated these studies. Aeronautical Engineering and Propulsion. Research in the aeronautical engineering area includes studies of airplane trailing vortices and separated flows at high angles of attack. Research work in the propulsion area has centered on the fluid dynamic problems associated with combustion, solid propellant rocket motor instabilities, fluid dynamics and optimization of scramjets, and pulse detonation engines. Biomechanics of Fluids and Solids. The kinematics and dynamics of fluid flows in biological systems are studied in Aerospace 134 Study and Researchexperiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical analyses. These flows are often characterized by unsteady vortex dynam - ics, coupled fluid interactions with flexible material surfaces, non-Newtonian fluid behavior, and, in some cases, compressibil - ity. Areas of active research include animal swimming and flying, cardiovascular fluid dynamics and hemodynamics, the mechan - ics of morphing/active deformable surfaces for flow control, and biologically inspired design of engineering systems. Technical Fluid Mechanics. These areas are related to a variety of modern technological problems and, in addition, to the traditional aeronautical problems of drag, wing stall, and shear flow mixing. Additional areas of activity include bluff-body aerodynamics, flu - id-structure interaction, turbulent combustion, laminar diffusion flames and their instabilities, explosions, hydrodynamics and two- phase flows, interaction of vorticity with free-surface, cardiac flows, swimming and flying, and active and passive control of transition and turbulence. Acoustics problems studied include jet noise, com - bustion noise, and instabilities such as the generation of organ pipe oscillations in large burners of electric generating plants. Fluid Mechanics, Control, and Materials. The effects of boundary conditions on turbulence characteristics and general flow physics, scaling and controllability are investigated using interdisciplinary methods based on developments in materials science and control techniques. Experimental manipulation of canonical and simple model flows is used to probe fundamental issues of flow physics and control. Autonomous Systems and Technologies. Interdisciplinary research in the expanding area of autonomous systems involves, but are not limited to, drones, robots, and spacecraft for use in science, exploration, and transportation. The research addresses sensing, control, vision, machine learning, and other emerging areas. Advanced drone research, autonomous exploration, and swarm robotics will draw research from the full range of engi - neering at Caltech, the geological and planetary sciences divi - sion, and JPL. Physical Facilities The Graduate Aerospace Laboratories contain a diversity of experi - mental facilities in support of the programs described above. The Cann Laboratory is a teaching facility utilized for graduate and undergraduate experiments in fluid and solid mechanics. Low-speed wind tunnels include the John W. Lucas Adaptive Wall Tunnel, the Merrill Wind Tunnel, and special-purpose flow facilities. Smaller water channels and a tow tank for studies of wave motion and flow visualization are also available. For investigations of high-speed flows, there is a Ludwieg tube, a supersonic shear layer facility, a hypervelocity expansion tube, and the T5 shock tunnel for studying hypervelocity gas flows up to 7 km/s. Shock tubes and other special facilities are available for the study of extreme temperatures, shock waves, deflagrations, detona - tions acoustics, and combustion at variable pressure conditions. Areas of Study and Research135 Historical SketchThe Center for Autonomous Systems and Technologies (CAST) con - tains an 85-foot track for walking robots and a wholly enclosed 75,000 cubic foot aerodrome for drone testing which is the tallest of its kind. Environmental simulation is provided by a 100-square-foot wall com - prised of 1,296 fans capable of generating wind speeds of up to 44 mph, along with a side wall of an additional 324 fans, all of which can be individually controlled to create a nearly infinite variety of conditions. The solid and structural mechanics laboratories contain standard as well as special testing facilities for research related to aircraft, deploy - able space structures, and failure/fracture behavior of materials under static and dynamic loads, including three servo-hydraulic facilities, two of which operate on a \"tension/torsion'' mode, and a nanoindenter. A range of digital and film high-speed cameras offering recording at rates up to 100 million frames per second are available for the study of fast phenomena, such as wave propagation, hypervelocity impact, and the mechanics of static and dynamic fracture. Dynamic testing facilities include specialized electromagnetic loading devices (stored energy ~120 kJ), a drop weight tower, split Hopkinson bars (axial/torsional), and plate impact apparatus. Diagnostic devices include full-field inter - ferometric and high-speed temperature measurements, both for static and dynamic applications. Other specialized facilities include a Class One clean room area that houses microelectronic wafer inspection metrology tools, and the Small Particle Hypervelocity Impact Range (SPHIR) jointly operated with JPL, which is capable of launching micro - meteoroid surrogate particles at speeds up to 8 km/s. Facilities are available for scanning microscopy (AFM, STM) and electromechanical characterization of materials. Other assets include state-of-the-art electronic instrumentation and computer systems for real-time control of experiments, data acquisi - tion, processing, storage, and digital image processing. Computational facilities include powerful workstations, on-campus high-performance computing machines, and remote supercomputers such as those gen - erally available at NSF , NASA, and DOE centers. Graphics workstations are available to support research in computational fluid dynamics and solid mechanics . APPLIED AND COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS An interdisciplinary program of study in applied and computation - al mathematics that leads to the Ph.D. degree is offered by the Computing & Mathematical Sciences department. In addition to various basic and advanced courses taught by the applied and computational mathematics faculty, broad selections are available in mathematics, physics, engineering, and other areas. Students are expected to become proficient in some special physical or nonmathematical field. A subject minor in applied computation is offered jointly with the computer science option. In addition to the applied and computational mathematics faculty, professors from other disciplines such as mathematics, physics, engi - Applied and Computational Mathematics136 Study and Researchneering, and biology supervise research and offer courses of special interest. The applied and computational mathematics group has access to supercomputers and concurrent computers. The present graduate program is one leading mainly to the Ph.D. degree. The curriculum consists of two types of courses: those that survey the methods used in applied and computational mathematics, and those that have a special applied and computational mathemat - ics flavor and represent active research interests of the members of the faculty. Among the latter have been wave motion, perturbation theory, fluid mechanics, optimization, stochastic processes, wavelet analysis, signal processing, numerical analysis, computational elec - tromagnetism, computational fluid dynamics, mathematics of data science, probability, random matrix theory, applied algebraic geome - try and statistical inference, game and decision theoretic approaches to numerical approximation and learning, homogenization, multifidelity and analysis, and stochastic modeling, stochastic analysis , data assimilation, and inverse problems. Through study outside of applied and computational mathematics, each student is expected to become competent in some special physical or nonmathematical field. In this way, subjects for research appear naturally, and a broad educational program is provided. The group primarily interested in applied and computational math - ematics currently consists of approximately 25 students and eight professors. Also, each year many distinguished visitors come either to present lectures or remain in residence for large parts of the academic year. Areas of Research Research is particularly strong in theoretical and computational fluid mechanics, theoretical and computational materials science, compu - tational electromagnetism, numerical analysis, ordinary and partial dif - ferential equations, multi-scale analysis, geometric integration, integral equations, linear and nonlinear wave propagation, water waves, bifur - cation theory, perturbation and asymptotic methods, stability theory, variational methods, approximation theory, uncertainty quantification, randomized algorithms, continuous optimization, discrete optimization, statistical estimation, computational harmonic analysis, stochastic pro - cesses, signal and imaging processing, inverse problems, mathematical biology, large-scale scientific computing, mathematics of data science, and probability and random matrix theory, game and decision theoretic approaches to numerical approximation and learning, homogeniza - tion, multifidelity and multiscale analysis, and stochastic modeling and stochastic analysis, data assimilation, inverse problems, and related branches of analysis. APPLIED MECHANICS Areas of Research Advanced instruction and research leading to degrees of Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy in applied mechanics are offered in Areas of Study and Research137 Historical Sketchsuch fields as elasticity; plasticity; wave propagation in solid media; mechanics of quasi-static and dynamic fracture; dynamics and vibra - tions; finite element analysis; and stability, control, and system iden - tification of mechanical and structural systems. Research studies in these areas that illustrate current interests include linear and nonlinear random vibrations of uncertain dynamical systems; structural dynam - ics and control for earthquake and wind loads; linear and nonlinear problems in static and dynamic elasticity, plasticity, and viscoelasticity; computational mechanics; mechanics of of systems; and material instabilities and phase transformations in solids. Physical Facilities In addition to the regular facilities in the Division of Engineering and Applied Science, which include extensive computing facilities, cer - tain special facilities have been developed in connection with applied mechanics activities. The vibration laboratory is equipped with a good selection of modern laboratory apparatus and instrumentation for experimental research in shock and vibration. The earthquake engineer - ing research laboratory contains specialized equipment for vibration tests of buildings, dams, and other structures, and for the recording and analysis of strong-motion earthquakes. Solid mechanics laborato - ries contain extensive testing equipment for the study of fracture and structural failure. Excellent computing facilities are available through the campus computing network and in the specialized centers of various research groups. APPLIED PHYSICS The Applied Physics option was instituted in 1970 in order to provide an interdivisional program for undergraduate and graduate students at Caltech interested in the study of both pure and applied physics. The small size of Caltech, coupled with its strength in the basic sciences and engineering, has made it possible for faculty and students alike to pursue wide-ranging interests in the application of modern physics to the development of new technology. Research efforts in applied physics are driven by a fundamental understanding of the physical principles underlying applications and a strong motivation to use this knowledge to invent new experimental techniques, processes, devices and materials. Core and affiliate faculty spanning several divisions on campus participate in instruction and research leading to B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in applied physics. This program is designed for undergraduate and graduate students who wish to expand their training beyond the study of fundamental physics to include research and development of real-world applications. The training helps develop a solid foundation in physics through intro - ductory courses in classical physics, classical electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and mathematical physics. More advanced training is provided through coursework and research activities in solid state physics, electromagnetic wave propa - Applied Physics138 Study and Researchgation, optoelectronic materials and devices, transport phenomena in hydrodynamic and condensed matter systems, plasma physics, biologi - cal physics, semiconductor principles and devices, quantum electronics, and low-dimensional electronic systems. Students are encouraged early on to develop strong experimental skills for advanced laboratory work, including familiarity with numeri - cal computation for data and image analysis and software packages for instrument automation. There exist many learning opportunities along these lines, from courses in microfabrication and laboratory work to independent research opportunities with various research groups. Undergraduate students are encouraged to explore and will find numerous opportunities for developing their research interests into junior or senior thesis projects leading to publication. Physical Facilities Research in applied physics covers a broad spectrum of activities distributed across campus. Instructional and research activities of the core faculty are housed in the Thomas J. Watson, Sr. Laboratories of Applied Physics, a 40,000-square-foot building with state-of-the-art research laboratories, a central microfabrication facility, faculty and student offices, and a conference room and instructional classroom, all nestled around a beautiful courtyard with a fountain pool. Additional research laboratories and faculty and student offices are located in the Harry G. Steele Laboratory of Electrical Sciences, built in 1965 with funds from the Harry G. Steele Foundation and the National Science Foundation. The building, which is connected by an overhead bridge to the Watson Laboratories, conveniently also houses the Kavli Nanoscience Institute. ASTROPHYSICS Caltech is one of the world's preeminent centers of astronomical research. This is due to the combination of excellent human resources with premier observational facilities and computational infrastructure. Fundamental discoveries in astronomy and astrophysics are a part of Caltech's past, present, and future. Students from either the astronomy or the physics options are best prepared to undertake research with faculty in the Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics. Students from related options such as planetary science, computer science, applied physics, and electrical engineering are also welcome. Areas of Research Astronomy and astrophysics are synonymous at Caltech. Caltech sci - entists and students are involved in many frontier areas of research, and have been known to open new ones. Research techniques include observations, theory, numerical simulation, advanced data analysis, laboratory astrophysics, and detector development. Projects and groups often bridge these areas of inquiry. Topics of current research interest include: observational cosmology Areas of Study and Research139 Historical Sketchand the nature of dark matter and dark energy; studies of the cosmic microwave background; galaxy formation and evolution; quasars and other active galactic nuclei and radio sources; studies of the dynamics and com - position of galaxies and clusters; physics and evolution of the intergalactic medium; star and abundances; supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and other types of cosmic explosions and transient phenomena; neutron stars and black holes; accretion disks; digital sky surveys and astroinformatics; numerical general relativity; gravitational wave astronomy and many others. Research in planetary and solar system astronomy is often pursued in cooperation with groups in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences. New types of astronomical detectors and satellites, that can revolutionize various areas of astronomical research, are developed with groups in physics and colleagues at JPL. In addition to maintaining a leading numerical general relativity group, Caltech theorists also use high-performance computing facilities for simulations of supernova explosions, merging black holes, cosmic structure formation, etc. Caltech is leading the development of novel tools for knowledge discovery in massive and complex astronomical data sets, many obtained with Caltech facilities. History and Current Science at Observational Facilities Observational astronomy is pursued both from the ground-based sites and from space-based platforms. Caltech operates, or has access to an unprecedented, comprehensive set of observational facilities, spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Caltech is also playing a key role in opening a new window on the universe, the gravitational wave sky. Historically, Caltech's pioneering role in astronomy started with Palomar Observatory (about 190 km from campus), funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. The first telescope on the mountain was an 18-inch Schmidt telescope built by Fritz Zwicky and used to conduct pioneering sky surveys for supernovae, potential planetary hazard asteroids, etc. The 200-inch Hale Telescope, constructed through the 1930s and 1940s, has been used to make many historical, fundamental discoveries ever since its commissioning in 1948, including the dis - covery of quasars, and many studies of stellar populations, galaxies, intergalactic medium, etc., and it continues to produce excellent sci - ence. Novel detectors and instruments were developed there, e.g., the first astronomical CCDs and infrared detectors as well as pioneering advances in adaptive optics in addition to optical and infrared spec - troscopy. The 48-inch Samuel Oschin Telescope has made possible complete surveys of the northern sky, initially with photographic plates (including the historic POSS-I and POSS-II surveys), and now with large-format CCD array cameras. It is currently operating a uniquely wide field, high-cadence program, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). A much larger camera for this telescope, with a 47-square-degree field, started operation in 2018, as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The 60-inch telescope has been roboticized, and is used to monitor sources discovered by sky surveys. In the 1990s, funded mainly by the Keck Foundation, Caltech and Astrophysics140 Study and ResearchUniversity of California constructed two 10-m telescopes on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The W. M. Keck Observatory produced many recent dis - coveries in the fields of galaxy formation and evolution, intergalactic medium, extrasolar planets, cosmic gamma-ray bursts, etc. Caltech is a founding partner in the development of the Thirty-Meter Telescope (TMT), the first of the next generation of extremely large optical/infrared telescopes. At meter to centimeter wavelengths, Caltech operates the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) in a radio-quiet location about 400 km from Pasadena, near Big Pine, California. Its facilities include a 40-meter telescope, a growing 288 element long wavelength array which can image the entire sky every second, and a 6.1 meter tele - scope dedicated to observations of polarized radio emission from the galaxy. New radio and submm telescopes are in design and con - struction phases. From the 1980s until 2015, Caltech also operated the Caltech 10-m Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, and a series of millimeter interferometers, culminating in the 23-antenna Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) in the Inyo Mountains. These telescopes, currently being repurposed to new experiments, pioneered submm imaging and inter - ferometry and mm wave interferometry, now carried out by the interna - tional Atacama Large Millimeter/submm Array (ALMA). In Antarctica, Caltech's BICEP2 telescope, which measures the imprint of inflation's gravitational waves on the COSMIC microwave background, has been expanded and renamed the Keck Array. On the space observations front, Caltech hosts NASA's Spitzer Science Center (SSC) and IPAC, which are principal national archives for astronomy. Caltech scientists lead or actively participate in a num - ber of astrophysics missions, currently including the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the NuSTAR hard X-ray mission. Caltech and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) are also leading the development of the forthcoming SPHEREx mission, that will study the early stages of the universe, galaxy formation, and formation of planetary systems. There are numerous close connections with JPL, that designs and operates a number of NASA's scientific missions. Finally, Caltech astronomers are major users of NASA's astronomical satellites, the Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra, Fermi, Herschel, Planck, etc., ALMA and the NSF's Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA). Caltech is the headquarters for LIGO lab, which built and operates the world's most sensitive gravitational wave observatory, the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), which in 2015 made the historic first detection of gravitational waves from a black hole binary. Several other black hole mergers have been detected since then, as well as the first gravitational wave detection of a merger of two neutron starts in 2017. Numerous other discoveries are expected as the operations continue. Areas of Study and Research141 Historical SketchBIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOPHYSICS The Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics (BMB) option has been established as an interdisciplinary program, at the interface of biology, chemistry, and physics, that seeks to understand the chemistry of life. Thus, BMB students study the atomic structure and folding of biopoly - mers; their interactions with each other and with small molecules; and the roles of particular biopolymers and biopolymer assemblies in cellu - lar physiology. The basic building block of life is the cell; the intellectual focus of modern biochemistry and molecular biophysics is to under - stand how individual parts interact to give cells their wide spectrum of functions. In particular, biochemistry and molecular biophysics addresses the principles through which the individual components of cells combine in an orderly self-association to produce their form, their func - tion, and their dynamic behavior. Areas of Research General areas of research represented within the option include signal transduction, cell cycle, DNA and RNA structure and metabolism, control of gene transcription during development, protein folding, biogenesis and quality control, electron transport proteins and bioenergetics, biological catalysis, macromolecular structure, membrane proteins, and biotechnol - ogy and biomolecular engineering. More specific examples of biological phenomena currently under study include the transduction of signals received by cell surface receptors into an appropriate response, as in che - motaxis or transmission of signals across synapses in the nervous system; the replication of DNA; the biochemical networks that control initiation and termination of cell division; the controlled transcription of DNA sequences in the genome into RNA and the processing of this RNA into mRNA and the subsequent translation into protein; energetic principles and molecular mechanisms that underlie the biogenesis of nascent proteins and mainte - nance of protein homeostasis in the cell; the molecular mechanisms con - trolling the differentiation of precursor cells into specialized cells such as neurons, lymphocytes, and muscle cells; the mechanisms by which synap - tic transmission in the brain is regulated during thinking and the formation of memories; the processes, driven by fundamental principles of chemical bonding and molecular energetics, by which a given linear sequence of amino acids folds into a specific three-dimensional structure in the appro - priate cellular environment; how electrons move within a cell to accomplish the many redox reactions necessary for life; how light is harvested by pho - to-pigments and is perceived in vision; the function of integral membrane proteins in energy and signal transduction processes; and the mechanisms by which enzymes both efficiently and specifically catalyze biochemical interconversions. This fundamental understanding of the molecular basis of biological processes provides a powerful base for the development of applications in medicine, including biotechnology and rational drug design, and in the chemical industry, where nucleic acids, proteins, and their ana - logs are now being used in the development of chemical systems for novel applications, and where mutagenesis and selection systems are used to produce novel materials. Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics142 Study and ResearchBIOENGINEERING Bioengineering research at Caltech focuses on the application of engineering principles to the design, analysis, construction, and manipulation of biological systems, and on the discovery and appli - cation of new engineering principles inspired by the properties of biological systems.

BIOLOGY Recent dramatic progress in our understanding of the nature of life has revolutionized the science of biology. Applications of the methods, con - cepts, and approaches of modern mathematics, physics, chemistry, and information science are providing deep insight into basic biological prob - lems such as the manner in which genes and viruses replicate themselves; the control of gene expression in cells; the regulation of cellular activity; the mechanisms of growth and development; and the nature and interactions of nerve activity, brain function, and behavior. Qualified experimental and computational biologists will find opportunities for challenging work in basic research as well as in medicine and in biotechnology. Because of the eminent position of Caltech in both the physical and biological sciences, students at the Institute have an unusual opportu - nity to be introduced to modern biology. Areas of Research Research (and graduate work leading to the Ph.D. degree) is chiefly in the following fields: biochemistry, biophysics, cell biology, developmen - tal biology, genetics, genomics and computational biology, immunol - ogy, microbiology, molecular biology, neurobiology, structural biology, and systems biology. Biochemical methodology plays an important role in many of these fields, and there is extensive interaction with related programs in biochemistry within the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, including the biochemistry and molecular bio - physics option. The programs in cellular, molecular, and developmental biology are based upon approaches derived from biochemistry, biophysics, and genetics that offer new possibilities for expanded insight into Biology144 Study and Researchlong-standing problems. Neurobiology is a major area of emphasis within the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering. A com - prehensive program of research and instruction in neurobiology has been formulated to span from molecular and cellular neurobiology to the study of animal and human behavior, including the computational modeling of neural processes. A geobiology option is described in the geological and planetary sciences section. Physical Facilities The campus biological laboratories are housed in seven buildings: the William G. Kerckhoff Laboratories of the Biological Sciences, the Gordon A. Alles Laboratory for Molecular Biology, the Norman W. Church Laboratory for Chemical Biology, the Mabel and Arnold Beckman Laboratories of Behavioral Biology, the Braun Laboratories in Memory of Carl F and Winifred H Braun, the Beckman Institute, and the Broad Center for the Biological Sciences. They contain classrooms and undergraduate laboratories, as well as research laboratories where both undergraduate and graduate students work in collaboration with faculty members. Special facilities include rooms for the culturing of mutant types of Drosophila, a monoclonal antibody production facility, a fluorescence-activated cell sorter facility, scanning and transmission electron microscopes, a confocal microscope facility, a magnetic res - onance imaging center, a transgenic mouse facility, a high throughput sequencing and microarray analysis facility, and a protein expres - sion and purification center. About 50 miles from Pasadena, in Corona del Mar, is the William G. Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory. This laboratory provides facilities for research in cellular and molecular biology using marine animals, and for collecting and maintaining these animals. CHEMICAL ENGINEERING The chemical engineering faculty teach and conduct research on fundamental chemical, biological, and transport processes and their application in understanding, designing, and controlling a broad spectrum of complex chemical, biochemical, and environmental processes. The faculty and students utilize their analytical skills and laboratory resources to study diverse processes and to synthesize new materials. The combination of engineering principles, chemis - try, biology, physics, and mathematics that characterizes chemical engineering at Caltech enables students and faculty to contribute to the solution of a wide range of critical problems and to aid in creat - ing new areas of science and technology.

CHEMISTRY Caltech offers exciting opportunities for study and research at the frontiers of chemical science. With approximately 30 faculty, the chemistry program provides depth in the traditional areas of chemis - try\u2014organic and inorganic chemistry, chemical physics, theoretical chemistry, and chemical biology. Research areas include chemical synthesis and catalysis, chemical dynamics and reaction mech - anisms, biochemistry, bioinorganic, bioorganic, and biophysical chemistry, and materials chemistry. Chemical research at Caltech is also highly interdisciplinary, mirroring the increasing importance of molecular understanding in many fields of science. Active inter - actions exist between chemistry and other disciplines at Caltech, especially applied physics, biology, chemical engineering, environ - mental science, geological and planetary sciences, and materials science. Major initiatives are fostering broad collaborations in energy and environment, molecular medicine, and nanomaterials. Teaching is an important component of the chemistry option. Caltech has trained generations of chemists who have become leaders in academia, industry, and government, through undergraduate and graduate programs that are designed to encourage the greatest possi - ble amount of freedom, creativity, and flexibility. Areas of Research Caltech has a long and continuing reputation for excellence in funda - mental chemistry in molecular structure and the nature of chemical bonding. Much of the current research in chemistry is directed at establishing and manipulating the mechanisms of reactions of fun - damental chemical and biological significance. Programs in chemical physics emphasize studies of molecular dynamics and structure using techniques that include femtosecond lasers, molecular beams, ultra- high sensitivity spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry, while novel methods such as ultrafast electron diffraction and force-detected magnetic resonance are being developed and applied to systems of Areas of Study and Research147 Historical Sketchincreasing complexity. Interdisciplinary research includes the develop - ment of powerful approaches to fabricate, assemble, and utilize nano - meter-scale structures; spectroscopy and fundamental chemical mech - anisms of reactions in Earth and planetary atmospheres, star formation, and interstellar chemistry; the dynamics of phase transitions; and novel methods in mass spectrometry. Catalysis by transition metals represents a central area of research in the inorganic and organometallic areas. Current research interests include the uses of transition metal complexes as homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for polymer synthesis, solar energy conversion and storage, and methane and water oxidation. Reactions of molecules on surfaces are an important focus, especially on semiconductors. Research in bioorganic and bioinorganic chemistry includes the chem - ical basis of synaptic transmission by ion channels; investigations of molecular recognition and sequence-specific ligand binding to DNA; DNA-mediated charge transport; and design of artificial transcription activators. Chemical synthesis, a key part of much of the research described above, is the primary research goal of several groups, and includes projects aimed at the synthesis of complex organic molecules of importance in biology and human medicine. These efforts include development of new and synthetically useful chemical transformations mediated by novel organic and transition metal-based catalysts. The division has an exceptional program in polymer science, with emphasis on the development of strategies and methodologies for the synthesis of designed polymers using chemical- and biological-based approaches. The theoretical chemistry program ranges from fundamental studies of electron transfer to excited states and reaction dynamics of small molecules, to simulations of biological systems and materials. In these studies, theoretical techniques are being developed to provide detailed understanding of electron transfer processes, proton transfer reactions, energy randomization processes within molecules, and the dynamics of reacting systems. Computer simulations are addressing ever more complex systems, ranging from metals and superconductors to soft materials and biomolecules. Research in biochemistry and molecular biology within the chem - istry division exists within the larger framework of biochemical studies at Caltech, and includes crystallographic and spectroscopic analyses of macromolecule structures; studies on the design, folding, and stability of macromolecules; the mechanisms of enzyme catalysis and allosteric transitions; interactions proteins and nucleic acids; macromo - lecular assemblies mediating replication, transcription, and protein bio - synthesis; the mechanism and functional role of protein glycosylation; and mechanisms of ion and electron transport in biological membranes. Physical Facilities The laboratories of chemistry consist of eight units providing space for about 25 research groups, including 300 graduate students and post - doctoral research fellows. Crellin and Gates laboratories house several research groups, the divisional instrumentation facilities, and the divisional administrative offices. Synthetic research groups occupy the Arnold Chemistry148 Study and Researchand Mabel Beckman Laboratory of Chemical Synthesis and Church laboratories. The Braun Laboratories and the Broad Center for the Biological Sciences house biochemical groups and are shared with the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering. The Arthur Amos Noyes Laboratory of Chemical Physics is one of the major research facilities for chemical physics and inorganic chemistry and is adjoined by the Clifford S. and Ruth A. Mead Memorial Undergraduate Chemistry Laboratory. Chemistry groups recently joined several chemical engineer - ing colleagues in the new Warren and Katharine Schlinger Laboratory for Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. A number of resource centers serving researchers of the division are located in the Beckman Institute. CIVIL ENGINEERING Civil engineering includes the research, development, planning, design, and construction associated with the infrastructure of the built environment. Dealing with the function and safety of such facilities as buildings, bridges, pipelines, dams, power plants, and harbors, it is concerned with the protection of the public against nat - ural hazards such as earthquakes, winds, floods, landslides, water waves, and fires. Recent advances in technology, the escalation of urban problems, and the exploration of space have broadened the applications of civil engineering, increasing the scope of research. New problems have presented special challenges to the civil engineer well-trained in the fundamentals of their profession. For this reason, in the advanced study of civil engineering at the Institute, the application of fundamental scientific principles and mathematics is emphasized for the solution of engineering problems. Areas of Research Graduate work leading to advanced degrees lies chiefly in the follow - ing fields: structural engineering and structural dynamics; earthquake engineering; applied mechanics; geotechnical engineering; aerospace structures; and environmental engineering (see also environmental sci - ence and engineering). In the past few years, graduate students and members of the faculty have pursued a variety of research programs, including the analysis of structures subjected to earthquakes and other dynamic loadings; optimal performance-based structural design; sys - tem identification and control of structures; structural health monitoring; the use of finite element methods for structural analysis; seismic risk and structural reliability; earthquake early warning systems; mechanics of soil and other granular materials; and mechanics of space structures. Students whose interests are in environmental problems may enroll for graduate degrees in either civil engineering or environmental science and engineering. Physical Facilities Civil engineering activities are housed in two buildings: the Gates- Thomas Laboratory and the W. M. Keck Engineering Laboratories.. Areas of Study and Research149 Historical SketchExcellent computing facilities are available through the campus computing network and in the specialized computing centers of various research groups. Seismic instrumentation networks include the Southern California Seismic Network and the Community Seismic Network. COMPUTATION AND NEURAL SYSTEMS What does the brain compute? How does it do it? And why? Faculty and students in the CNS option study how information is acquired and processed by the brain. They are also interested in designing machines that are adaptable, intelligent, and autonomous. The uni - fying theme of the program is the study of the relationship between the physical structure of a computational system (synthetic or natu - ral hardware), the dynamics of its operation and its interaction with the environment, and the computations that it carries out. Areas of interest include coding and computation in networks of neu - rons, sensory systems (vision, audition, olfaction), learning and memory, control and motor behavior, and planning and decision making. Thus, CNS is an interdisciplinary option that benefits from, and integrates, multiple traditional areas of expertise: molecular, cellular, neural, and sys - tems biology, electrical and mechanical engineering, computer science, psychology, and cognition, applied mathematics, and physics. Faculty in the program belong to the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, Division of Engineering and Applied Science, Division of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy, and Division of the Humanities and Social Sciences. They have an interest in develop - ing conceptual frameworks and analytical approaches for tackling seemingly disparate problems that share a common deep structure at the computational level. Students in the program will partake of a wide-ranging curriculum that will promote a broad understanding of neurobiology, sensory psychology, cognitive science, computational hardware and software, and information theory. Areas of Research Areas of research include the neuron as a computational device; the theory of collective neural circuits for biological and machine compu - tations; algorithms and architectures that enable efficient fault-tolerant parallel and distributed computing; learning theory and systems, pat - tern recognition, information theory, and computational complexity; computational modeling and analysis of information processing in biochemical and neural networks; the design and use of synthetic mac - romolecules as computational devices; light and magnetic resonance imaging of cell lineages, cell migrations, and axonal connections in the forming nervous system; learning, plasticity, and memory; experi - mental and modeling studies of localization and recognition by sensory systems (vision, olfaction, audition) in insects and vertebrates on the basis of electrophysiology, psychophysics, and functional imaging techniques; multiunit recordings in behaving animals; neuroprosthetic devices and recording methods in animals and humans; imaging and stimulation of cortical areas in humans and other primates using func - Computation and Neural Systems150 Study and Researchtional MRI, TMS, and tDCS; decision making, attention, awareness, emotion, and consciousness in the primate brain using a combination of neurophysiological, psychophysical, and computer modeling tech - niques; cognitive psychology; and the study of evolution in natural and artificial systems. COMPUTER SCIENCE Computing is a ubiquitous tool in all areas of study and research at Caltech. Computer science focuses on the theory and technology of computation itself: it is the study of information, and of the structures that communicate, store, and procegs information. Whether these struc - tures are expressed in hardware and called machines, in software and called programs, or in nature or society, the fundamental concepts are similar. Students of the computer science option within the Computing & Mathematical Sciences department at Caltech do not specialize along traditional lines that divide hardware and software, systems and appli - cations, or theory and experiment. Rather, a unified approach to the design and analysis of computing structures is taken both in courses and in research. Managing the great complexity of useful systems requires a representation of computations amenable to both mathe - matical treatment and implementation. Whether the system is artificially designed (such as a multi-core processor), or naturally occurring (such as a molecule), the computer scientist formalizes the computation per - formed by the system and provides a systematic analysis of its require - ments and formal guarantees on its outcomes. Areas of Research Research and advanced courses leading to the Ph.D. degree in com - puter science are concentrated in the following areas: quantum and molecular computation; parallel and distributed computation; theory of computation; information theory; learning and economics; computer vision; computer graphics; discrete differential geometry; networking and power systems. Research projects frequently involve work in several of these areas, with both the - oretical and experimental aspects, as well as connections with such fields as mathematics, physics, biology, economics, and electrical engineering. Crosscutting themes include: Physical Implementation of Computations. Computations must ultimately be implemented in some physical medium (e.g., semi - conductor electronics, DNA self-assembly, quantum states of elementary particles, molecular electronics). Caltech has been a leader in the early development, engineering, and design of very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits. Beyond VLSI, efforts are under way to understand quantum, biomolecular, and molecular electronic substrates as possible media for future computing machines. As was the case with semiconductor elec - tronics, Caltech computing can draw on the world-class expertise of its biology, physics, and chemistry departments as it tackles Areas of Study and Research151 Historical Sketchthe many challenging opportunities that these new substrates present. Robust Modeling of Physical Systems. Caltech computer sci - ence has a unique focus in developing rigorous and robust models of the physical world. These models are mathematically and physi - cally sound, often derived from differential geometric principles, and serve as a basis for computer graphics and vision research, as well as the simulation of mechanical, optical, and biological sys - tems. Systematic Design. A key theme in the Caltech computer sci - ence option is the systematic design of systems at all levels. This theme shows up in the design of numerical algorithms for physical simulation and computer graphics, design of concurrent and distributed systems, abstractions for physical computing substrates, design of learning systems, design of programming languages, automated optimization of computations for both software and hardware implementation, as well as control and optimization of networks. The success of computer systems has allowed the building of systems of unprecedented scale and complexity. These systems can only be understood and managed if we carefully contain the complexity involved by systematically defin - ing and exploring their design space. Theory. A strong theoretical understanding is the necessary foundation for systematic design, analysis, and verification. The theory of computation focuses on deep mathematical problems, many of which have substantial technological impact. Theory in computer science at Caltech includes traditional areas such as complexity algorithms, theories of numerical computation, optimization, probability, and game theory. But theory is not relegated to a single group, and has strong connections to all disciplines represented at Caltech. Networks & Distributed Systems. Modern networks and dis - tributed systems are undoubtedly the most complex and critical pieces of infrastructure that the world has created. This includes communication networks as well as power networks, social networks, cloud computing, and more. The massive scale and exponential growth of such networks presents unique algo - rithmic, computational, and economic challenges. Research at Caltech approaches these challenges through a combination of rigorous design, systematic analysis, and interdisciplinary col - laboration. Machine Learning. In our increasingly data-rich world, it is more important than ever to develop principled approaches that can intelligently convert raw data into actionable knowl - edge. At Caltech, we take a broad and integrated view of research in data-driven intelligent systems. The Decision, Optimization and Learning group brings together researchers from machine learning, optimization, applied math, statistics, control, robotics, distributed systems and human-computer interaction to form an intellectual core pertaining fundamen - tal and applied research from statistical machine learning to Computer Science152 Study and Researchstatistical decision theory through optimization. Interdisciplinary Research. Computer simulations, modeling, and analysis are key enablers, allowing all fields of science to advance rapidly. Furthermore, insights into computational management of information helps us understand information processing issues in natural systems (from cells and neurons to financial markets and social networks) and build hypothetical models that advance our understanding of natural cognition. These relations provide many opportunities for scholars in computer science to work closely with colleagues throughout Caltech. The Information Science and Technology (IST) initia - tive facilitates and promotes such interdisciplinary research (see ist.caltech.edu). Physical Facilities The computer science option has excellent computing facilities ranging from high-performance workstations to multiprocessors and supercom - puters. The Computing & Mathematical Sciences department maintains a large computer lab open to students and offers a large collection of software for a wide range of applications. Students have easy access to state-of-the-art equipment. The Institute libraries maintain a large collection of journals in computer science and related fields. COMPUTING AND MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES Data-driven modeling is becoming increasingly critical in diverse application domains such as machine learning, vision, control sys - tems, biological and engineered networks, neuroscience, econom - ics, and privacy, as well as in many areas of the physical sciences, including high energy physics, earthquake modeling, astronomy, and exploration geophysics. There is enormous potential for research on data-intensive activity of this type, which is highlight - ed by the emergence of new fields such as \"Big Data,\" \"Decision Science,\" and \"Network Science.\" However, the theoretical founda - tions of these subjects remain underdeveloped, limiting our under - standing and development. The mission of the CMS graduate program is to address this need by exploring and developing the fundamental mathematical, computational, and economic tools necessary to advance data-intensive science and engineering. That is, we aim to forge the algorithmic foundations neces - sary to move from data, to information, to action. Key to this mission is a core focus on \"algorithmic thinking.\" Algorithms are not just the basis for advanced technology, they are intrinsic components of diverse fields such as biology, physics, and economics. Studying the structures and mechanisms that communicate, store, and process information from this viewpoint\u2014whether these structures are expressed in hardware and called machines, in software and called programs, in abstract notation and called mathematics, or in nature and society and called biological or Areas of Study and Research153 Historical Sketchsocial networks and markets\u2014is crucial to pushing scientific boundaries. Simply put, it is almost impossible to do research in any scientific or engineering discipline without the ability to think algorithmically. Because of the diversity of fields where algorithmic thinking is fun - damental, there are broad differences in how algorithms are formalized, applied, and studied across areas. Over the years, these differences have been codified and the \"language of algorithms\" is actually quite distinct across, e.g., computer science, applied math, and electrical engineering. However, a broad view of algorithmic thinking is crucial to scientific breakthrough; and the goal of this program is to train scholars to have an interdisciplinary, cross-cutting view of algorithms. Faculty and students in CMS are active in a broad array of research areas. Some of these include algorithms, complexity, algorithmic eco - nomics, feedback and control, inference and statistics, information sys - tems, machine learning, networked systems, vision, optimization, quan - tum information, scientific computing, and uncertainty quantification. CONTROL AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS Some of the most exciting interactions between mathematics and engi - neering are occurring in the area of analysis and control of uncertain, mul - tivariable, and nonlinear dynamical systems. While changing technology has made control and dynamical systems theory increasingly relevant to a much broader class of problems, the interdisciplinary nature of this area means that it no longer has a natural home exclusively or even pri - marily within any one of the traditional engineering disciplines. The CDS option, as part of the Computing & Mathematical Sciences department, is designed to meet the challenge of educating students both in the mathe - matical methods of control and dynamical systems theory and their appli - cations to problems in engineering and science. Faculty and students in CDS are active in a number of research areas. The primary theoretical areas of research include stochastic and nonlinear dynamical systems, multiscale modeling, optimal and decentralized con - trol, system identification and estimation theory, Bayesian modeling and analysis, uncertainty quantification, and communications and information theory. Active applications include networking and communication sys - tems, embedded systems and formal verification, robotics and autonomy, molecular and systems biology, integrative biology, human physiology, economic and financial systems, computing systems, physics of fluids, quantum mechanics, seismology and earthquake engineering, and space systems. ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING Electrical engineering at Caltech emphasizes both devices and sys - tems. Closely allied with computation and neural systems, applied physics, bioengineering, computer science, and control and dynamical systems, it offers students the opportunity for study and research, both theoretical and experimental, in a wide variety of subjects, including wireless systems, photonics, quantum information science, modern Electrical Engineering154 Study and Researchoptics, biophotonics, MEMS/NEMS, solid-state materials and devic - es, power electronics, energy systems, control theory, data science, nanoscale systems, signal processing, learning, data compression, and communications.

ENERGY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY The useful transformation of energy from one form to another drives the engine of civilization. Access to plentiful, inexpensive, and environmen - tally benign resources would free nations to pursue their greatest human and economic potential. In the modern era, the appetite for energy is convoluted, with a recognition of diminishing fossil fuel resources and of dramatic negative impacts on global climate. The interdisciplinary program in Energy Science and Technology (EST) aims to foster revolu - tionary methods of harnessing carbon-free energy sources while advanc - ing related technologies in carbon sequestration and further drawing connections to policy and economic considerations. The program brings together traditional topics in thermodynamics and kinetics with modern topics in biomolecular engineering, charge and mass transport, and pho - toelectrochemistry. Faculty and students in the EST program are drawn from a broad range of academic options, including materials science, chemistry, applied physics, chemical engineering, mechanical engineer - ing, and environmental science and engineering. Areas of emphasis reflect this breadth of disciplines and include photovoltaics, photoelec - trochemical cells, bio-fuels, fuel cells, batteries, thermoelectrics, hydro - gen generation and storage, and nuclear energy. ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING Research and teaching in the ESE program span the large scales of global climate variations, the local scales of urban air pollution, and the microscales of microbial ecosystems. Reflecting the interdisci - plinary nature of the ESE program, it unites scientists and engineers Areas of Study and Research159 Historical Sketchfrom Caltech's Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, Division of Engineering and Applied Science, and Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. Jointly they address, for example, how climate has varied in the past and how it may change in the future, how bio - geochemical cycles and chemical reactions control the composition of the atmosphere and local air quality as well as the Earth's global energy balance, and how more efficient and effective ways of producing bio - fuels or remediating toxic waste can be found. The methods employed in research projects include laboratory studies of fundamental chemical and biological processes; field studies of microbial ecology and of atmospheric chemistry; and computational and theoretical studies of chemical and physical processes on molecular to global scales. Students enter the ESE program with diverse backgrounds, from the basic sciences of physics, chemistry, and biology to applied sci - ence and engineering fields. The curriculum emphasizes interdisciplin - ary knowledge and is broad, yet it is flexible so that different back - grounds and focus areas can be accommodated. Areas of Research Atmospheric Chemistry and Air Pollution. Atmospheric chem - istry affects the composition of the atmosphere, properties of clouds, and local air quality. Research areas include cloud chemistry, aerosol chemistry and physics, trace gas photochem - istry, and emission sources and transport and reaction pathways of organic species. The methods employed include laboratory studies of aerosol formation and of chemical reactions in the atmosphere; field campaigns with aircraft operated by ESE fac - ulty; satellite missions carried out in collaboration with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory; and theoretical and modeling studies of tropospheric chemistry and the carbon cycle. Environmental Chemistry and Technology. Environmental chemistry and technology research in ESE addresses funda - mental questions in heterogeneous atmospheric chemistry (e.g., chemistry of clouds, fogs, and haze aerosols), in aquatic chem - istry, in oxidation and reduction chemistry and technology, in semiconductor photocatalysis, and in hydrogen production from sunlight via electrochemical water splitting. Dynamics of Climate. Climate dynamics research in ESE address - es fundamental questions about how Earth's climatic features are maintained, how they have varied in the past, and how they may change in the future. Research includes the large-scale dynamics of the atmosphere and oceans, the hydrologic cycle and how it responds to climate changes, monsoon dynamics, and the dynam - ics of the Southern Ocean, and climates of other planets. Methods employed include theoretical and modeling studies, analyses of observational data, and field campaigns to collect oceanographic data. Biogeochemistry and Climates of the Past. Biogeochemical research in ESE finds application at scales ranging from microbi - al ecosystems to the global carbon cycle. Current research inter - ests include the marine carbon cycle and its geochemical record Environmental Science and Engineering160 Study and Researchin organic matter and carbonate minerals; microbial recycling of nutrients and carbon; and development and use of geochemical proxies for understanding the ancient environment, including its climate. Environmental Microbiology. Microorganisms are the primary drivers of global biogeochemical cycles and represent the most abundant and diverse forms of life on Earth. They catalyze critical biological transformation processes such as nitrogen fixation, oceanic primary productivity, and methane cycling. Microbial ecosystem research within ESE is focused on under - standing microbial processes in terrestrial, marine, and extreme ecosystems. Research areas span a range of topics and field sites, including the study of lignocellulose degradation by termite gut microbiota, anaerobic cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur in microbial mats and sediments, and methane cycling in the ocean. Physical Facilities ESE laboratories and facilities are housed in the Linde + Robinson Laboratory for Global Environmental Science and in other nearby buildings of Caltech's Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences. The laboratories are equipped with a wide variety of state-of-the-art instruments. The Environmental Analysis Center (EAC) houses analytical instrumentation, for research that ranges from analyzing pol - lutants in groundwater to dating fossils. Its equipment includes instruments for electrochemistry, plasma emission mass spec - trophotometry, gas chromatography, high-performance trometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, total organ - ic carbon analysis, and electrophoresis and electrical particle size analysis. Scientists from across the Institute use the EAC for cutting-edge analytical studies. The Atmospheric Chemistry and Aerosol Laboratory is designed for studies of the photochemical reactions of gas - eous and particulate pollutants. In two reaction chambers (28 m3 each)\u2014the first of their kind when they were built\u2014the chemical reactions that produce urban smog and atmospheric particles are investigated under precisely controllable condi - tions. They have revealed how the particles that make up smog form in the atmosphere. Research results obtained with them have been instrumental in designing effective air quality poli - cies. They continue to be invaluable in studies of air pollution. The High-Precision Spectroscopy Laboratory is housed in a quiet room\u2014a room with specially designed acoustic and electromagnetic insulation. Acoustic foam blocks sound waves and copper cladding around the entire room blocks electro - magnetic waves. The noise-free environment allows us to achieve exquisite precision in laser measurements of radiative properties of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and atmospheric trace constituents: the properties of single molecules can be Areas of Study and Research161 Historical Sketchmeasured. The measurements are the basis for climate models and for planning satellite missions to measure the composition of the atmosphere from space. In the Laboratory for Atmospheric Chemical Physics, the interactions of light with molecules in the atmosphere are investigated to elucidate how pollution forms and to measure the atmospheric concentration of aerosols and greenhouse gases. Techniques are developed for the global monitoring of the atmosphere from mobile ground-based laboratories and from space-based instruments. In the Environmental Chemistry and Technology Laboratory, collimated sunlight from the Linde + Robinson solar telescope is focused into photolysis reactors, where artificial photosyn - thesis processes are developed to convert water and carbon dioxide into energetic fuels. Additionally, the chemical nature of the air-water interface is studied, and new technologies are developed for storing electric energy in novel lithium-air bat - teries and for treating water, for example, by photovoltaically powered electrolysis or ultrasonically induced cavitation. The Geochemistry Clean Room is designed for trace metal analysis in an entirely metal-free environment. It has air cleansed of almost all particles, to be able to measure with high precision tiny traces of metals and radioactive isotopes found in ocean water and embedded in corals and in stalag - mites. These measurements reveal information about how climate has varied in Earth's past and how carbon cycles between the biosphere, the atmosphere, and the oceans. The Clean Room is supported by a plasma mass spectrometry instrument room that contains two multi-collector instruments and a quadrapole instrument. The facility also contains a wet chemistry laboratory for the processing and analysis of envi - ronmental samples. The Biogeochemistry Laboratories provide capabilities for analyzing the structure, abundance, and isotopic composition of organic materials in environmental samples, ranging from organisms to sediments to rocks. Instrumentation includes gas chromatograph-mass spectrometers, isotope-ratio mass spec - trometers with capabilities for bulk and compound-specific analysis, a spectroscopic water isotope analyzer, and a com - bustion elemental analyzer. In the Environmental Microbiology Laboratories , the diversi - ty and metabolic activities of microorganisms from terrestrial and marine ecosystems are characterized through cultivation, microscopic imaging, metagenomics, and molecular and iso - topic analysis. Instrumentation includes anaerobic chambers, platforms for performing microfluidics-based analyses of the nucleic acid contents of environmental single cells, capillary sequencers, quantitative epifluorescence microscopes, (7f nanoSIMS 50L) available through the Center for Microanalysis. Fram High Performance Computing (HPC) Cluster. Fram is Environmental Science and Engineering162 Study and Researcha (HPC) Cluster composed of 314 HP SL390 computer nodes with 12 cores available per node. The cluster is connected with a low latency, high bandwidth network called InfiniBand. In addition to the traditional computer nodes, it also has 60 GPU based nodes with a total of 180 Nvidia M2090 GPUs. This filesystem can perform at around 9.5 GB/s. Fram is the latest of many clusters used for analysis and simulation of climate dynamics. Additionally, Caltech collaborates with the Naval Postgraduate School's Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely Piloted Aircraft Studies (Monterey, California) . This center operates research aircraft for atmo - sphere science studies, including a Twin Otter aircraft that carries state-of-the-art instruments to measure atmospheric aerosol and cloud properties in situ. Faculty, students, and staff in the ESE pro - gram also have access to the supercomputer facility of the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, where they carry out simula - tions of dynamical processes in the atmosphere and oceans and of chemical reactions and transport processes affecting atmospheric chemistry. GEOLOGICAL AND PLANETARY SCIENCES Students and faculty in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences study Earth and the planets to understand their origin, con - stitution, and development, and the effect of the resulting physical and chemical environments on the history of life and on humanity. The approach to these problems relies strongly on the basic sciences. Programs of study and research are pursued in environmental science and engineering, geobiology, geochemistry, geology, geophysics, and planetary science. The curriculum is flexible so that students with degrees in biology, chemistry, engineering, or physics may carry out graduate work within the division, and interdisciplinary studies are encouraged. Southern California provides an excellent natural laboratory for the study of geology, tectonics, and earthquakes. Current advances in understanding the dynamic motions of Earth's interior have opened new opportunities for the study of crustal motions and earthquakes. Historic records of seismic activity are put into long- term perspective by studies of surface and bedrock geology. The dynamics and geom - etry of crustal movements are studied on local, regional, and global scales in order to understand the evolution of continents, subduction zones, and mid-ocean ridges. The division maintains active field pro - grams in diverse areas in North America and throughout the world. The events that shaped Earth can be identified by studying the structure of rocks and their chemical and isotopic compositions. The absolute chronology of Earth and solar system history can be established by measurements of radioactive isotopes. These geo - logical events have been intimately associated with the origin and evolution of life on Earth. The field of geobiology uses both geological Areas of Study and Research163 Historical Sketchand genetic evidence to examine the impact of life on Earth and the impact of geological conditions on biology. The field of geochem - istry includes studies of radiogenic and stable isotopes, petrology, chemical oceanography, and atmospheric chemistry. These tools are applied to the origins of igneous and metamorphic rocks, evidence of past climate change, tracing anthropogenic influences on Earth, and the structure of planetary interiors. The comparative study of the other planets\u2014their atmospheres, surfaces, and internal structures\u2014is important in our understanding of Earth and its place in the cosmos. The early history of the solar system can be approached by studies of extraterrestrial materials, including lunar samples, interplanetary dust grains, and meteorites. Physical Facilities The division is housed in four adjacent buildings, which are well equipped for modern instruction and laboratory work. They contain several seminar rooms and a library as well as student and faculty offices. Numerous computers are distributed throughout the division, including a facility for geographic information systems and remote sensing. Rock and mineral collections and sample preparation areas are available. There are modern laboratories equipped with a scanning electron microscope and electron microprobe; a variety of plasma-source, gas-source, thermal emission, and mass multi-anvil, diamond anvil, and shock-wave facilities. Cooperation with other departments on campus provides access to additional instrumentation for sample preparation and analysis. Laboratories for molecular geobiology provide capabilities for culturing, manipulating, and studying a wide range of environmental microbes, including anaerobes. A sensitive magnetometer facility is designed for the study of both biomagnetism and paleomagnetics. The Seismological Laboratory, housed in the GPS division, oper - ates the Southern California Seismic Network jointly with the U.S. Geological Survey. The network records and analyzes real-time earthquake data from more than 380 seismic stations located across Southern California. Data from the network are available for research via the Southern California Earthquake Data Center. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA's lead center for planetary exploration, is located seven miles from campus and is administered by the Institute. Students and faculty participate in JPL activities through joint research, instrument development, mission operations, and data analysis. In addition, Caltech owns and operates several optical and radio observatories that are used partly for planetary research. Active programs of planetary studies are pursued at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, Palomar Mountain, and the Keck Telescopes and, in the near future, the Thirty-Meter Telescope project. Geological and Planetary Sciences164 Study and ResearchHISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE The program in history and philosophy of science is devoted to the study of the historical evolution and philosophical underpinnings of the physical and biological sciences. Work in history and philosophy of science may be pursued as an undergraduate option, a graduate minor, or on a course-by-course basis. Historical research in the program includes the origins of experimental practice, the social and institutional contexts of science, the origins and applications of quantitative methods, specific developments since antiquity in phys - ics, biology, and chemistry, as well as biographical and comparative studies. Philosophical research in the program deals with issues in causation, explanation, scientific inference, the foundations of proba - bility and decision theory, philosophy of mind, psychology and neuro - science, and scientific fraud and misconduct. HUMANITIES English at Caltech spans the major periods of American and British writing. Students can pursue interests ranging from Shakespeare and a survey of drama to romantic and modern poetry; from early fiction to the postmodern novel. History at Caltech examines the Western and non-Western past to understand the evolution of culture, science, institutions, and behavior. Courses span the medieval, Renaissance, and modern periods; the United States, Europe, and Asia; and special topics such as radicalism and demography. In certain courses, quantitative methods drawn from the social sciences are applied to historical studies. Philosophy is concerned with the most fundamental issues involving the nature of the world and of human knowledge, values, and judg - ment. At Caltech, particular emphasis is placed on philosophy of the natural and social sciences, scientific inference, and philosophy of mind, psychology and neuroscience. In addition to survey courses we offer courses on more focused topics, including causality, probability, quantum mechanics, space-time, free will, consciousness, and on ethi - cal questions raised by modern science and technology. Visual culture at Caltech encompasses the study of art history, film, media, and scientific images. Students work to gain visual literacy, and to understand both the history of images humans may have been looking at for hundreds or even thousands of years, and the prove - nance, location, and nature of the images we see now in our every day lives. Some visual culture classes make use of the resources of the Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; and other museums in the area. Courses in English, history, philosophy, and visual culture are given at both introductory and advanced levels. A variety of courses in music, writing, and in foreign languages, liter - ature, and culture are also available. Areas of Study and Research165 Historical SketchAreas of Research The English faculty, interested in new approaches to studying their sub - ject, engage in research into the relationships between literature and the pictorial arts, literature, and history, and the material production of literature. Research in history covers a wide range of historical fields and meth - odologies. Topics include an examination of the development of racial attitudes and behavior in the 19th-century United States; the history of the physical and biological sciences and of science in relationship to society; history and film; and political and economic development in early modern Europe. A number of faculty carry out research and teaching in the interre - lated subjects of science, ethics, and public policy. Research in philosophy includes work in philosophy of science and philosophy of mind, with particular research foci in philosophy of phys - ics, causation, probability and decision theory, and the philosophy of neuroscience and free will. Faculty research in visual culture focuses on a wide variety of time periods, geographic locations, and media forms but has in common a careful attention to the conditions under which objects are made, the ways in which they circulate, and the reactions they inspire in audi - ences. INFORMATION AND DATA SCIENCES The information and data sciences are concerned with the acquisi - tion, storage, communication, processing, and analysis of data. These intellectual activities have a long history, and Caltech has traditionally occupied a position of strength with faculty spread out across applied mathematics, electrical engineering, computer science, mathemat - ics, physics, astronomy, economics, and many others disciplines. In the last decade, there has been a rapid increase in the rate at which data are acquired, with the objective of extracting actionable knowl - edge\u2014in the form of scientific models and predictions, business decisions, and public policies. From a technological perspective, this rapid increase in the availability of data creates numerous challenges in acquisition, storage, and subsequent analysis. More fundamental - ly, humans cannot deal with such a volume of data directly, and it is increasingly essential that we automate the pipeline of information processing and analysis. All areas of human endeavor are affected: science, medicine, engineering, manufacturing, logistics, the media, entertainment. The range of scenarios that concern a scientist in this domain are very broad\u2014from situations in which the available data are nearly infinite (big data), to those in which the data are sparse and precious; from situations in which computation is, for all practical pur - poses, an infinite resource to those in which it is critical to respond rapidly and computation must thus be treated as a precious resource; from situations in which the data are all available at once to those in which they are presented as a stream. As such, the information and data sciences now draw not just upon traditional areas spanning computer science, applied mathematics, and Information and Data Sciences166 Study and Researchelectrical engineering\u2014signal processing, information and communica - tion theory, control and decision theory, probability and statistics, algo - rithms\u2014but also a range of new contemporary topics such as machine learning, network science, distributed systems, and neuroscience. The result is an area that is new, fundamentally different from related areas like computer science and statistics, and that is crucial to modern applications in the physical sciences, social sciences, and engineering. The Information and Data Sciences (IDS) option is unabashedly mathematical, focusing on the foundations of the information and data sciences, across its roots in probability, statistics, linear algebra, and signal processing. These fields all contribute crucial components of data science today. Further, it takes advantage of the interdisciplinary nature of Caltech by including a required set of application courses where students will learn about how data touches science and engi - neering broadly. The flexibility provided by this sequence allows stu - dents to see data science in action in biology, economics, chemistry, and beyond. In addition to a major, the IDS option offers a minor that focuses on the mathematical foundations of the information and data sciences but recognizes the fact that many students in other majors across campus have a need to supplement their options with practical training in data science. INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY Information science and technology (IST) is a multidivisional research area that includes participants from the biology, chemistry and chemi - cal engineering, engineering and applied science, humanities and social sciences, and physics, mathematics and astronomy divisions. Areas of emphasis include networking and distributed systems, neuromorphic engineering and sensory-based machines, quantum computation and communications, molecular electronics and biochemical computing, biological circuit design, information flow in economic and social systems, and mathematical foundations of information. Physical Facilities IST is mainly centered around the Annenberg Center for Information Science and Technology and the Moore Laboratory. Research centers associated with IST include the Lee Center for Advanced Networking, the Center for Neuromorphic Systems Engineering, the Center for Biological Circuit Design, the Center for the Mathematics of Information, the Center for the Physics of Information, and the Social and Information Science Laboratory. INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES PROGRAM Interdisciplinary studies offer an educational alternative for undergrad - uates whose goals cannot be satisfied with a normal undergraduate option. The student gathers a two-person faculty committee, represent - ing at least two divisions of the Institute, and chooses their own scho - Areas of Study and Research167 Historical Sketchlastic requirements under this committee's supervision. Approval must also be obtained from the Curriculum Committee, a standing commit - tee of the faculty. The interdisciplinary studies program has no facilities of its own. Areas of study and research may be selected from any part of the Institute. (For a complete description, see page 310 .) MATERIALS SCIENCE Materials scientists study relationships between the properties of materi - als and their internal structure, and how this structure can be controlled. Our multidisciplinary faculty, students, and postdoctoral scholars create new materials and take rigorous approaches to understand and control the properties of materials and their internal structure. From batteries and solar cells, to electronic devices and micro- and nano-, our department is at the forefront of scientific discovery and new technologies. Areas of Research The current areas of research by the materials science faculty include a broad range of materials, some far removed from their equilibrium ther - modynamic states. Examples of such materials include metallic glasses, thin films, two-dimensional solids, quantum materials, porous and archi - tected solids, energy-storage materials, nanostructured materials, and materials for photovoltaics and electronic devices. The physical charac - teristics of interest span a wide range of mechanical, thermodynamic, electrical, magnetic and electrochemical properties. Physical Facilities Research by the faculty, graduate students, and advanced undergrad - uates is conducted in the W. M. Keck Laboratory, the Harry G. Steele Laboratory, and frequently in the Kavli Nanoscience Institute (KNI) Laboratory, a core cleanroom facility dedicated to nanofabrication and characterization. The KNI Lab and its technical staff provide training and access to advanced instrumentation that support the nano- and microfabrication process from beginning to end. This includes resourc - es for electron and ion beam lithography; optical lithography; thin-film and chemical vapor deposition; metal and evaporation; dry etch - ing; various processing techniques; metrology including a spectroscop - ic ellipsometer; a suite of microscopes, such as focused ion beams (FIB), scanning electron microscopes (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy, and AFM. The KNI also manages a transmission elec - tron microscopy (TEM) facility which houses a 300-keV scanning TEM instrument with high resolution and analytical capabilities. Additional facilities for the characterization of materials include X-ray powder diffractometers with position-sensitive detectors. Material- preparation facilities include equipment for additive manufacturing, physical vapor deposition under ultra-high vacuum conditions, arc melting, induction melting, casting, rapid solidification, processing of ceramic powders, and high-energy ball milling. More specialized instru - ments include impedance spectrometers for transport and dielectric measurements, M\u00f6ssbauer spectrometers, differential scanning calo - Materials and differential thermal analyzers, thermogravimetric analyzers, and gas adsorption analyzers. In addition to the general-use equipment within materials science, a wide range of mechanical and microstructural characterization facil - ities are available elsewhere at Caltech including a scanning electron microscope with electron backscatter detectors, mechanical testing machines, nanoindenters, an in-situ mechanical deformation instru - ment, AFM, electrochemical instrumentation, and an electrical probe tester.

In addition to offices for the faculty and graduate students, there are classrooms, conference rooms, discussion areas, a lecture hall, and a lounge for informal gatherings of the students and staff. The mathematics collection is housed nearby in the Sherman Fairchild Library. Areas of Study and Research169 Historical SketchMECHANICAL ENGINEERING Mechanical engineering at Caltech explores the boundaries between traditional disciplines of science and engineering in order to develop a fundamental understanding of interdisciplinary challenges and create advanced technology to address contemporary problems. Mechanical engineering encompasses three broad areas: (1) mechanics of materials, (2) systems and control, and (3) thermal sciences and fluid dynamics. The educational program in mechanical engineering prepares students for research and professional practice in an era of rapidly advancing tech - nology. It combines a strong background in the basic and engineering sci - ences with anemphasis on addressing the critical technological challenges of the day. It strives to develop professional independence, creativity, lead - ership, and the capacity for continuing professional and intellectual growth. Areas of Research Mechanics of Materials.

A number of High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters are available, including both CPU- and GPU-based architectures. Kavli Nanoscience Institute (KNI) is utilized for micro- and nano-fabrication, testing, and characterization. MEDICAL ENGINEERING The Andrew and Peggy Cherng Department of Medical Engineering at Caltech focuses on the applications of micro-/nanoscale engineering sciences and technologies to the design, analysis, and implementation of diagnostic, therapeutic, and monitoring devices for translational medicine.

MICROBIOLOGY Microbiology recognizes that microbial inventions have profoundly shaped every aspect of the biosphere and geosphere throughout Earth's history. Many important molecular and cellular processes in eukaryotes are now known to have first arisen in bacteria and archaea, and microbial metabolic activities control numerous geochemical cycles. Microorganisms have served and will continue to serve as model systems in many areas of science, ranging from basic biology and biochemistry, to the understanding of physical principles governing biological systems, to emerging questions of robustness, stability, and design in complex networks. Interactions among microbes within com - munities, as well as interactions between microbial communities and their environments, are poorly understood. Yet studying these interac - tions is key to understanding fundamental relationships in nature, such as: 1.) the feedback loops connecting microbial activities in aquatic or terrestrial habitats with changes in composition of the atmosphere, hydrosphere and geosphere, and 2.) the symbiotic associations that sustain diverse forms of life today. For example, the interactions between a mammalian host and its microbiota are essential to the host's normal functioning and development, not merely the cause of infectious disease. Due to their metabolic versatility, microorganisms are Microbiology172 Study and Researchlikely to emerge as key engineering components for solving global soci - etal problems, ranging from human health, to energy, to providing clean water to more than one billion people who currently live without it. Caltech's version of microbiology is unique. Diverse faculty from four divisions (BBE, CCE, GPS, EAS) work together to train students in how to understand microbial systems at various spatial and temporal scales: from the molecular to the global, from the present to the past. This interdisciplinary training involves study of molecular and cellular biology, physiology, chemistry, ecology, and quantitative reasoning. NEUROBIOLOGY Understanding the brain remains one of the great intellectual chal - lenges for science. To grasp the function of this marvelous organ, one needs to investigate structures, mechanisms, and dynamics that span across many spatial and temporal scales. For example, when we hear a sound, our brain is sensitive to time delays of just a few microsec - onds, yet the memory of that sound can last a lifetime\u201411 orders of magnitude longer. The span is similar in the spatial domain. The sheer number of nerve cells in the brain, approximately 1,011, suggests a coarse-grained treatment that glosses over the details of the individual neurons, yet a single nerve cell and even a single molecule can play a decisive role. For example, activation of a single light receptor in our eye leads to a visual percept that can ultimately direct our behavior. Neurobiology at Caltech does, indeed, span this range. Our laboratories work on the molecular structure and function of channels and recep - tors; the integration of such molecules into signaling organelles like the synapse; the structure and function of single neurons; the integration of neurons of diverse types into circuits; and the collective function of these circuits in controlling behavior, perception, memory, action, cognition, and emotion. Another area of emphasis concerns the developmental mech - anisms by which these structures form: the differentiation of neurons in early life, the genetic mechanisms that guide their synaptic wiring plan, and how subsequent experience modifies these connections. There is also increasing interest in leveraging the basic neurobiological insights to an understanding of brain disorders. Finally, Caltech's traditional strength in engineering stimulates the development of new methods for brain science: from optical techniques to new twists of genetic engineering, to novel multi-electrode devices, to computational models and theories. To further explore the range of brain research at Caltech\u2014and enjoy some colorful pictures\u2014please visit the neurobiology option website. PHYSICS Areas of Research Students in physics will find opportunities for research in a number of areas where members of the faculty are currently active, including those listed below. Physics research at Caltech is often done in collabora - tion with scientists in the departments of applied physics, astrophysics, Areas of Study and Research173 Historical Sketchplanetary science, engineering, chemistry, biology, and other depart - ments, as well as with collaborators at other universities and labora - tories. Additional research programs and more detailed information can be found on the Caltech physics department website. Experimental Elementary Particle Physics. Activities in ele - mentary particle physics are aimed primarily at discovering new particles and interactions physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) complemented by precision measurements of SM pro - cesses. Experimental efforts employ hadronic colliders and elec - tron, muon, and neutrino beams at several international facilities. Current experiments include: ~ CMS searching for dark matter and other new particles and new symmetries up to the mass scale of several TeV at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN ~ the NOvA and DUNE long baseline experiments at Fermilab, studying the pattern of masses, mixing and CP violation in the neutrino sector ~ the Mu2e experiment, searching for physics beyond thE standard model in charged lepton flavor violation ~ a nascent effort to search for accelerator production of dark matter called LDMX ~ the long-running SuperCDMS effort to directly detect scatter - ing of galactic dark matter with normal matter. Theoretical Elementary Particle Physics. The particle theory group studies the unification of interactions based on string the - ory, the detailed properties of hadrons described by QCD, the quantum properties of black holes, the foundations of cosmolo - gy, including dark matter and dark energy, and other aspects of mathematical physics. Condensed-Matter Physics. Areas of interest include correlat - ed electron systems, topological quantum systems, phase transitions, atomic and excitonic Bose condensation, nano - mechanical and nanoelectronic high-temperature super - conductivity, graphene and carbon nanotube systems, quantum entanglement, dynamics of disordered systems, chaos, pattern formation, and systems far from equilibrium. Resources include numerous labs in the Caltech physics department, at the Kavli Nanoscience Institute at Caltech, and at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Quantum Optics and Information. Research on campus and at the Institute for Quantum Information at Caltech includes studies of the nature of quantum computation and quantum information, cavity quantum electrodynamics, algorithms and error correction techniques in quantum computation, and generally how quan - tum physics can be harnessed to improve the acquisition, trans - mission, and processing of information. Experimental Atomic/Molecular/Optical Physics. Experimental atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) research at Caltech focus - es on controlling and understanding complex quantum systems for a wide variety of scientific goals. Current experiments include Physics174 Study and Researchbuilding arrays of ultracold atoms to study quantum information, metrology, many-body physics, and simulation of condensed matter systems; precision measurements in cold and ultracold polar molecules to search for fundamental symmetry violations; engineering atom-light interactions in photonic crystals; quan - tum physics of mechanical devices, hybrid superconducting quantum circuits, and optomechanical sensors; neurophotonics and neuromolecular sensing; development of quantum networks and communication and addressing fundamental questions in quantum information. Many of these research strands are collaborative efforts supported by the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter. Nuclear Physics. The interests of the nuclear group focus on performing precision measurements to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. In particular, precision measure - ments of free neutron decay allow sensitive searches for new physics, while measurements of the neutron electric dipole moment may help explain the dominance of matter over anti - matter in the universe. Astrophysics. Research in this area covers a broad range of topics using observational tools covering the entire electromag - netic spectrum. ~ The high-energy astrophysics group at the Space Radiation Laboratory (SRL) uses X-ray and gamma-ray detectors aboard spacecraft and balloons to investigate energetic processes from compact astrophysical objects, including gamma-ray bursts from neutron-star and black-hole sys - tems, supernova and hypernova dynamics, and the devel - opment of stars and galaxies in the early universe. ~ The cosmic ray group at SRL uses data from a variety of spacecraft to study the composition of energetic particles arriving from the sun, the local interstellar medium, and beyond, in order to understand the origin and acceleration of energetic particles in space. ~ The millimeter/submillimeter astronomy group, with collab - orators at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, studies the solar system, star and planet formation, the interstellar medium, galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the epoch of reionization using data from the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) and other facilities. Future-oriented programs include the development of new superconducting detector technol - ogies and instruments for use at these wavelengths, also in collaboration with JPL, and an effort to move the currently idle CSO to a new, more sensitive site. ~ The Galactic compact objects astrophysics group stud - ies black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarf systems, including gravitational wave sources detectable by future space missions such as LISA. The group uses telescopes at Palomar, Kitt Peak and the Keck Observatory, as well as the radio telescopes of the NASA Deep Space Network. Theoretical Astrophysics. The TAPIR (Theoretical Astrophysics Areas of Study and Research175 Historical SketchIncluding Relativity) group carries out research on an ever-changing list of topics, including planets; stars, neutron stars, black holes and their interactions; gravitational-wave astrophysics; cosmology; the formation of stars and galaxies; and numerical and analytical general relativity. Cosmology. The observational cosmology group explores the structure and dynamics of the early universe using precise measurements of the cosmological microwave background radi - ation and large scale structures from detectors on the ground, on balloons, and on spacecraft. Efforts to directly detect dark matter are also under way. These experiments include an active program of detector development in collaboration with scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Theoretical studies seek to understand the large-scale structure of the universe, including the physical nature of dark matter and dark energy. Gravitational-wave Astronomy. Observations from the LIGO and LISA projects seek to use gravitational radiation to study a variety of astrophysical sources. Theoretical studies are aimed at developing sensitive data analysis techniques and calculating gravitational-wave signals from sources such as coalescing black holes and neutron stars. Physical Facilities The physics and astrophysics departments and laboratories are mainly housed in six buildings on campus: the Norman Bridge Laboratory, the Alfred P . Sloan Laboratory of Mathematics and Physics, the W. K. Kellogg Radiation Laboratory, the George W. Downs Laboratory of Physics, the C. C. Lauritsen Laboratory of High Energy Physics, and the Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics. Off-campus astro - nomical facilities include Palomar Observatory, the Keck Observatories, Owens Valley Radio Observatory, the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (currently idle), and the Laser Interferometer Gravitational- wave Observatory (LIGO). SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING COMMUNICATION The Engineering and Applied Science (EAS) Division offers a program of study in Scientific and Engineering Communication that prepares students to engage with a variety of audiences and effectively communicate scien - tific topics. In order for engineering graduates to excel in their chosen field, they need to develop oral, written, and media communication skills, and an ability to work with a variety of stakeholders including industry lead - ers, policymakers, and academics. Courses in Scientific and Engineering Communication (SEC) provide opportunities for students to experiment with a variety of communication genres and in diverse environments. The program is characterized by cross-disciplinary study and authentic practi - cal experiences in scientific communication and advocacy. Science and Engineering Communication176 Study and ResearchSOCIAL AND DECISION NEUROSCIENCE The Institute offers an interdisciplinary program of study in Social and Decision Neuroscience that prepares students to conduct research on the neurocomputational basis of decision-making and social interactions. In order to carry out cutting-edge research in this area, students need to acquire in-depth understanding of computational modeling, statistical methods, systems neuroscience, neural measuring methods such as fMRI, EEG or single unit recordings, as well as adequate understanding of relat - ed methods and results from the social sciences. The program is designed for students seeking faculty jobs in neuroscience, psychology, marketing, economics, political science or finance, or industry positions in the tech - nology, data science, and finance fields. Areas of Research This program is characterized by interdisciplinary research at the fron - tier of neuroscience, psychology, economics, and political science. Examples of research topics of interest include the following: Computational and neurobiological foundations of simple choice in animals and humans. Computational and neurobiological basis of economic and polit - ical decision making. Neurocomputational basis of emotion and the impact on cogni - tion and behavior. Neurobiological basis of social behavior in human and animal models. Neurobiological basis of moral judgment and decision-making. Applications of neuroscience to economics, finance, and politi - cal science. Physical Facilities Research is conducted in multiple laboratories spanning a wide range of experimental techniques\u2014from behavioral experiments to single unit neurophysiology. Researchers also have access to two state-of-the- art facilities: the Caltech Brain Imaging Center, which contains various human and animal brain scanners, and the Social Science Experimental Laboratory, which contains state-of-the-art facilities for conducting behavioral economic experiments of group and market interactions. SOCIAL SCIENCE PHILOSOPHY AND GOALS OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCE UNDERGRADUATE CORE The social science core curriculum initiates students in the study of how humans organize, decide, govern, and allocate their resources. It teaches students how to analyze and reason about individual behavior, markets, and other institutions. Our curriculum covers methods, as well as substance. The issues facing our students in the future will be different from those that are current, but the analytical principles and methodology needed to understand those problems will likely remain the same, albeit improved. Thus, the social science core curriculum Areas of Study and Research177 Historical Sketchprovides students with the knowledge and tools to, in the words of the catalog, \"navigate the societal, political, and economic factors that influence, and are influenced by, their work.\" The objectives of the social science core curriculum can be broken into three broad categories of courses: introductory courses that teach basic principles; methods courses that seek to transmit skills and ana - lytical tools; and courses exposing students to substantive ideas and problems in the social sciences. More concretely: \"Fundamental ideas and principles\" classes expose students to a broad and introductory overview of basic ideas in anthropology, economics, psychology, and political science. \"Methodology and analysis\" courses focus mainly on giving students the theoretical and empirical tools to analyze problems. They cover the theoretical modeling tools most commonly used in the social sciences, as well as statistical and econometric techniques that are needed to analyze data. \"Substantive problems in social science: Individuals, institutions, and markets\" courses expose students to an array of substantive questions in social science, from resource alloca - tion via markets and prices, the workings of political institutions, the consequences of poor governance, the psychological basis of human behavior, and an understanding of financial markets. SOCIAL SCIENCE GRADUATE PROGRAM The Caltech Ph.D. program in Social Science is highly interdisciplinary, integrating economics, political science, quantitative history, econo - metrics, and finance. It makes extensive use of mathematical model - ing, laboratory experiments, and econometric techniques. Research in the social sciences program at Caltech strongly emphasizes the under-standing and analysis of the relationships between individual incentives, collective behavior, political and economic institutions, and public policy. Areas of Research Experimental Economics and Experimental Political Science. Caltech social scientists were among the early pioneers in the field of laboratory experimentation and Caltech has maintained a strong leadership position and research presence in the field ever since. Examples of the kinds of laboratory studies the fac - ulty are engaged in include the behavior and design of auctions and market-like mechanisms, public goods provision and related topics in public economics, the economics of networks and matching, decision theory, inter-personal bargaining, behavioral economics, committee decision making, and electoral compe - tition. Many of our faculty engage in laboratory experimentation as part of their research agendas in economics and political sci - ence (Agranov, Camerer, Echenique, Nielsen, Palfrey, Plott, Saito, Shum, Sprenger). Considerable laboratory experimentation also focuses upon the workings of financial markets, and seeks to elucidate basic principles that underlie the pricing of assets, Social Science178 Study and Researchtrading, and information aggregation in these markets. Many of these experiments are conducted through the use of net- worked computers (see Facilities) in the William D. Hacker Social Science Experimental Laboratory (SSEL) and the Laboratory for Experimental Economics and Political Science (LEEPS). The real world provides another setting for experimental research outside the laboratory, and Caltech social scientists have conducted field experiments involving a wide variety of topics, ranging from decision making in organizations, social networks, and the behavior of different cultural groups ranging from college stu - dents, to urban Americans to African villagers. Economic Theory and Game Theory. Caltech has a strong research group in economic theory, which, together with rigor - ous training in statistics and econometrics forms the backbone of the core curriculum for the PhD program. Theoretical research at Caltech has played a key role in the design and practical implementation of new institutions that more efficiently allocate scarce resources and provide public goods. Some of this work has had important public policy applications. Prominent exam - ples include the design of FCC auctions to allocate the elec - tromagnetic spectrum for telecommunication, and the market for allocating and trading permits for pollution emissions in the Los Angeles basin. Much of this theoretical design research is complemented by experimental studies that provide a testbed for competing designs. There is an active group of faculty and graduate students working in the areas of the optimal design of contracts and markets (Cvitanic, Echenique, Plott), the economics of information (Pomatto, Palfrey, Pomatto, Saito, Tamuz) and matching Social Science and Research (Echenique). There are several active programs for inter-action between our theory faculty in the social sciences and the faculties of computer science and applied mathematics. This is formally organized around two interdisciplinary centers, the Lee Center for Advanced Networking and the Social and Information Science Laboratory (SISL), with the latter offering a bi-weekly seminar coordinated between the computer science department and the social sciences faculty and featuring speak - ers in eco-nomics, computer science, game theory and related disciplines. There are many informal connections that reinforce the formal connections, including research collaborations between faculty and graduate students in these different areas. Political Economy and Political Science. Caltech has a long tradition of strength in research that spans the boundary of the economics and political science disciplines. Research in politi - cal economy at Caltech continues to be a major strength of the program and provides a natural bridge that unites the faculty in economics, political science, and quantitative history. The focus of research in political economy and political science at Caltech Areas of Study and Research179 Historical Sketchemphasizes rigorous theoretical modeling drawing heavily upon techniques from economic theory and game theory, combined with empirical studies using highly sophisticated quantitative analyses of a wide variety of data sources: experimental, survey, field, voting, and historical data. Ongoing political economy research areas of the current faculty include: the interacting forces of bargaining, voting, and communication in commit-tees, legislatures, bureaucracies, and assemblies (Agranov, Gibilisco, Hirsch, Katz, Lopez-Moctezuma, Palfrey, Plott); the Voting Technology Project, a joint Caltech-MIT research venture, estab - lished in 2000 to evaluate and improve the performance and reliability of U.S. balloting technology, registration systems, elec - tion administration, redistricting, and election law (Alvarez, Katz); political forces affecting judicial behavior (Hirsch, Shum), strate - gic voting in multicandidate and multi-stage elections (Alvarez, Kiewiet, Palfrey, Plott), the politics of inequality and redistribution (Agranov, Palfrey) and several areas of comparative and interna - tional politics, including studies of the causes and consequenc - es of corruption, domestic unrest, and international conflict (Ensminger, Gibilisco, Lopez-Moctezuma). Financial Economics . Caltech has built a small but very active research group in finance. The researchers in this group are working on a range of topics in mathematical finance (Cvitanic), empirical studies of venture capital and entrepreneurship (Ewens), asset pricing (Cvitanic, Jin, Plott, Roll), dynamic con - tracting (Cvitanic), and behavioral finance (Camerer, Jin, Plott). There is a regular seminar series in finance that features dis - tinguished researchers from around the world. Caltech faculty outside the finance group itself are also engaged in empirical research in financial economics. These include experimental Areas of Study and Research studies of asset markets (Camerer, Palfrey, Plott), interest rate policy making by the Federal Open Market Committee (Lopez-Moctezuma), and online credit mar - kets (Xin). Behavioral Economics. Research in behavioral economics at Caltech overlaps all of the above groups. Laboratory experimental research discovers interesting behavioral anomalies and can also test theoretical models designed to account for such anomalies. On the theoretical side, much of the game-theoretic and deci - sion-theoretic research at Caltech is motivated by experimental observations, leading to extensions or modifications of standard models. These extensions in turn suggest experimental designs that are then implemented in the laboratory by our faculty and graduate students. Faculty research in political behavior (Alvarez, Katz, Kiewiet) and behavioral finance (Camerer, Jin, Plott) are complementary and add strength more generally to under-stand - ing social behavior. We also have on our faculty a small but very active group conducting research at the boundary of biology, psychology, and the social sciences (Adolphs, Camerer, Mobbs, Social Science180 Study and ResearchO'Doherty, Rangel). This group offers a separate PhD option focused on the behavioral neuroscience of decision making (see the catalog entry for \"Social and Decision Neuroscience\"). Utilizing fMRI brain-imaging, eye-tracking, and other biological measurement technologies, this group, often in collaboration with other social science faculty and graduate students, has begun to explore the neural foundations of decision making in individual choice, game theoretic, and market settings. Quantitative History. Just as with the theoretical, experimental, and empirical work using contemporary, historical research con - ducted at Caltech employs mathematical modeling and sophis - ticated statistical techniques to attack a wide range of historical questions. Historical research conducted at Caltech addresses questions that cut across economics, political science, politi - cal economy, and even finance, often combining archival work with state-of-the art statistical techniques. These include the development of capital and credit markets in Europe (Hoffman, Rosenthal), the evolution of wealth distribution from 1800 to the present (Rosenthal), the causes of recurrent financial crises in capitalist economies (Hoffman, Rosenthal), and the determinants of economic and technological growth. Applied microeconomics and econometrics. Empirical research in social science blends creative collection and analysis of field data with rigorous application of tools and methods from econometrics and statistics. We offer courses and supervise students in these areas. A number of faculty members special - ize in empirical work in a number of fields, including finance (Ewens, Jin, Xin), industrial organization (Shum, Xin), political economy (Alvarez, Gibilisco, Katz, Kiewiet, Lopez-Moctezuma, Sherman, Shum), and behavioral economics (Camerer, Jin). Methodological areas of specialization include econometrics (Sherman, Shum, Xin), causal inference (Alvarez, Katz, Sherman, Shum), machine learning (Alvarez, Katz, Xin), and Bayesian sta - tistics (Katz). Physical Facilities Caltech has two state-of-the-art onsite laboratories for experimental research in economics, political science, game theory, decision theory, and financial economics: The Laboratory for Experimental Economics and Political Science (LEEPS, established 1987) and The Hacker Social Science Experimental Laboratory (SSEL, established 1998). Areas of Study and Research181 Historical SketchSYSTEMS BIOLOGY Systems Biology seeks to understand how the parts of biological sys - tems are integrated to produce the amazing machines, cells, organisms and ecosystems that exist in our world. We seek to define general principles of biological systems. Part of the effort involves defining the relevant parts and measuring how they change in a quantitative and comprehensive fashion as they carry out their functions. This task is the domain of genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, functional genomics, bioinformatics and other aspects of Network Biology and Bioinformatics. Another related task is to understand the \"mecha - nisms,\" the precise structures and interactions of those parts that ulti - mately produce biological function. This task requires Computational Modeling of potential mechanisms, coupled with Quantitative tests of the predictions of models by cell biological, molecular biological, and biophysical techniques. One particularly stunning feature of organisms is their ability to develop from a single fertilized egg; thus, Systems Developmental Biology is an important third theme of our program. This theme involves the study of how organisms generate complexity of cell types in a defined spatial organization by a sequential, contingent, irre - versible cascade of molecular, cellular, and genomic processes. Our goal is to train students who can seamlessly integrate diverse quantitative and experimental methodology and can balance the tension between global understanding and mechanistic insight. This training involves study of biology, mathematics, quantitative reasoning, computational and data analysis tools, and the rich experimental meth - ods of the biological sciences. Systems BiologyUndergraduate Information182Section Three Information for Undergraduates Undergraduate Information Historical Sketch183The undergraduate program leads to a four-year Bachelor of Science degree. Admitted students matriculate in the fall term only. Caltech does not have a summer session or part-time program and cannot consider you if you already have a bachelor's degree from another college, university, or the equivalent. If you have matriculated at any college, university, or the equivalent in a program leading to any degree, you will be required to apply as a transfer student and should read the requirements in the sec - tion titled \"Transfer Admissions.''

HIGH SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS Students are expected to prepare for Caltech by successfully com - pleting the following curriculum: Four years of mathematics (including calculus) One year of physics One year of chemistry Three years of English (four years recommended) One year of U.S. history/government (waived for international students) Freshman AdmissionUndergraduate Information184Standardized Exams Applicants should note the following changes made to Caltech's stan - dardized exams policies: 1. Testing moratorium on both the requirement and consideration of SAT and/or ACT test scores. This change, made in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic and its continuing impact on access to these exams for students across the country and globe, will be in effect for all first-year students applying to Caltech for fall 2021, fall 2022, and fall 2023. 2. Elimination of the requirement for SAT Subject Tests: As of January 2020, Caltech eliminated the requirement for applicants to submit two SAT Subject Tests. These sections will not be considered in the application review process. This change is in effect for those students applying for the Caltech class that begins in the fall of 2021. 3. Duolingo English Test is now also an accepted exam to demon - strate English language proficiency: As of June 2020, Caltech added the Duolingo English Test as an accepted exam to demonstrate a student's English language proficiency. Duolingo English Test or TOEFL Internet Based Test (TOEFL IBT) scores are required of all international citizens unless 1) your native language is English, or 2) you have studied for two or more years in a school where English is the language of instruction. The latter must be completed prior to the application deadline. Essays The essays, which are required as a part of the application, are intend - ed to provide students the opportunity to communicate their interests, experiences, and background. Since Caltech is interested in learning about each applicant, the essays are viewed as an important part of the admission decision process. Evaluations Two teacher evaluations and a Secondary School Report are required. One evaluation must be from a math or science teacher, and one eval - uation from a humanities or social science teacher (see the instructions in the application). A Secondary School Report must be filled out by the applicant's high-school counselor or other school official. Additional Material Descriptions of research projects and hands-on science and engineer - ing experience are helpful, as is material that demonstrates experiences outside math and science. Additional material should be identified with name and date of birth. Acceptance Caltech is a National Association for College Admissions Counseling member and therefore agrees to comply with the candidate's reply date of May 1. Places in the entering class will not be held after May 1. Early Action applicants will be informed of their status in mid-December, and Regular Decision applicants will be informed by mid-March. Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch185Deferral of Entrance For reasons of travel or work, Caltech will consider requests from admitted students for a one-year deferral of entrance. Students who request a deferment must submit a written request stating the purpose of postponement. Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and College Credit Caltech encourages all prospective undergraduate applicants to pre - pare by challenging themselves with the most rigorous course of study available, including the Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) programs. However, college credit for AP or IB classes is not automatic. Course credit and/or placement in an accel - erated program is sometimes granted as deemed appropriate by the department faculty. The awarding of Caltech course credit takes place at the time of registration each fall. Biology Biology majors who have passed Bi 8 and Bi 9 are considered to have met the core requirement of Bi 1. Chemistry The student's qualifications for placing out of Ch 1 ab will only be deter - mined by the performance on a placement examination to be admin - istered in the summer prior to registration. Qualified students, with the instructor's consent, are allowed to substitute either Ch 8 or Ch/ChE 9 for the \"core\" chemistry laboratory requirement (Ch 3 a or Ch 3 x). English/Writing All incoming students (freshmen and transfers) will take a placement assessment to determine whether they are adequately prepared for the substantial writing component that is part of all freshman humanities courses. Most new students participate in a web-based version of this assessment, which is usually conducted in early June. A makeup assessment is held just before fall classes begin. Based on results of this writing assessment, students may be required to take Wr 1 or Wr 2 in the fall quarter. (Wr 1 and Wr 2 count for general Institute credit only.) After completing these courses, students may, at the discretion of humanities faculty, be required to go on to subsequent coursework in academic writing, such as Wr 3, Wr 4, or Wr 50, before or concurrently with freshman humanities coursework. During the first week of classes, students will be required to produce an in-class writing sample to con - firm the initial placement. Mathematics During the summer before the freshman year, entering freshmen are asked to take a diagnostic exam in basic calculus that will determine which students will be placed in a special section of Ma 1 a for those with less complete preparation, and later take Ma 1 d; and if they are interested in advanced placement, they may also take an examination Freshman AdmissionUndergraduate Information186to determine whether they will begin the mathematics core sequence at an advanced level. Normally, an entering freshman takes Ma 1 abc, Calculus of One and Several Variables and Linear Algebra. This course covers the calculus of functions of one and several variables; infinite series; vector algebra; basic and advanced linear algebra; derivatives of vector functions, multiple integrals, line and path integrals; and theorems of Green and Stokes. The course is divided into a lecture part and a recitation part that focuses mainly on problem-solving. Students in need of additional problem-solving practice may be advised to take Ma 8 (in addition to Ma 1 a) in the first quarter. Physics The required freshman physics course, Ph 1 abc, is considerably more rigorous than most advanced placement work, and entering freshmen are encouraged to take Ph 1. A test is administered during the summer to aid in the organization of Ph 1; students who have performed particularly well can discuss the possibilities for advanced placement with the phys - ics representative during orientation. A second test may then be required. Residency Expectation Undergraduate housing includes the eight houses (Avery, Blacker, Dabney, Fleming, Lloyd, Page, Ricketts, Ruddock), and the Bechtel Residence and Marks House and Braun House. First- and second-year students are required to live on campus. Requests for exceptions to this requirement should be submitted to the Office of Residential Experience, and must be approved by the Dean of Undergraduate Students and the Vice President for Student Affairs. New Student Orientation All freshmen, transfer, and exchange students are expected to attend the New Student Orientation as part of the regular registration proce - dure. Orientation takes place the week prior to the beginning of class - es. Faculty members, staff and upperclass student leaders participate help to introduce new students to the Caltech community. The orientation period provides an opportunity for new students to become acquaint - ed with the campus, the Honor System, and other aspects of life at Caltech. In addition, they will meet classmates, upperclass students, and faculty during this time ADMISSION TO UPPER CLASSES BY TRANSFER TRANSFER ADMISSIONS Caltech admits transfer students for the fall term only. We require a completed application, letters of recommendation, an official transcript from the last secondary school attended and all colleges or universities Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch187attended, descriptions of all college-level math and science courses, and completion of the Caltech Transfer Entrance Examinations. Please review the section titled \"Eligibility Criteria for Admission'' to determine whether you meet the eligibility requirements for transfer admissions consideration. Academic Preparation The following is a list of the Caltech core curriculum, taken by all Caltech students during their first two years. It is expected that transfer students will have had exposure to mathematics and science courses on a compa - rable level prior to entry to Caltech. Any of the following core courses that have not been covered by incoming transfer students must be taken upon matriculation to Caltech. There are no specific topics expected to have been covered in humanities and social science classes. An evaluation of each transfer student's written English is required prior to registration and may result in an additional course requirement. Freshman courses: Mathematics 1 abc Physics 1 abc Chemistry 1 ab Chemistry 3 a or 3 x Biology 1, 1 x, 8, or 9 Humanities and Social Science electives Menu science class (see page 240 ; can be taken freshman or soph - omore year) Sophomore courses: Physics 2 abc or Physics 12 abc Additional laboratory science Humanities and Social Science electives Note: Mathematics 3 is not required for the core curriculum, but may be required for a specific option.] Eligibility Criteria for Admission The Institute admits to its sophomore and junior classes a small num - ber of students who have excellent records at other institutions of collegiate rank and who perform satisfactorily on the Caltech Transfer Admissions Entrance Examinations. Students must have completed their secondary school education, and have subsequently enrolled at a college or university and earned credit, in order to be considered for transfer admission. Transfer students are not admitted to the senior year at Caltech. Students who have already completed a bachelor's degree in any subject are not eligible for transfer. Standardized Test Requirements Transfer applicants are not required to submit SAT scores. The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is required of transfer appli - Admission to Upper Classes by TransferUndergraduate Information188cants whose native language is not English and who have not school instruction in English for two years or more. The TOEFL should be taken no later than the February test date. Evaluation of Written English All entering transfer students will be required to undergo an evaluation of their written English prior to enrolling. Transfer Admissions Entrance Examinations All applicants are required to take Caltech Transfer Admissions Entrance Examinations in mathematics and physics. Further instruc - tions are included with the Caltech Transfer Application. Transfer of Credit The courses for which transfer applicants will receive credit, and the corresponding class standing, will be determined at the time of enroll - ment. The transfer applicant will submit course descriptions, syllabi, and final transcripts to the Registrar who will present the material to the faculty for evaluation. Faculty members review each course submitted for credit on an indi - vidual basis. It is sometimes not possible, therefore, to answer ques - tions regarding the acceptability of course work taken elsewhere. Before the student is admitted, transfer students will work through Admissions to obtain a pre-evaluation estimate. If the standard of work taken elsewhere is uncertain, additional examinations may be required before the question of credit is finally determined. Graduation Requirements Admitted transfer students must meet the following requirements in order to receive a Caltech Bachelor of Science degree. A Caltech undergraduate degree is based on a four-year res - idential experience (study abroad included) in which students have the time to explore their academic interests in a deep and rigorous way. Students who are admitted as transfer students or 3/2 students may be granted advanced standing and term credit for academic work accepted in transfer to Caltech. However, transfer and 3/2 students must enroll for a minimum of six terms at Caltech. Any exceptions must be approved by the dean of undergraduate students and the vice president for student affairs. Regardless of the amount of credit awarded upon matriculation, transfer students must spend at least two years (six terms) in residence at Caltech. Students must also earn at least 216 units at Caltech, not including courses taken to satisfy math and sci - ence core curriculum requirements. Students must take, or have taken the equivalent of, all core cur - riculum courses. Students must satisfy all of their chosen option's degree require - ments. Transfer students may choose from among all Caltech undergraduate options. Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch189Admissions Application Applications are available by September 1.

They must have completed a minimum of one year of calculus-based physics and mathematics (two years are recommended), including multivariable calculus and differential equations, and one year of chemistry. EXCHANGE PROGRAMS Exchange programs exist with Occidental College and Art Center College of Design, permitting Caltech students to receive credit for courses taken at these colleges. Students from these colleges also may receive credit for courses taken at the Institute. Tuition payments are not required, but the student may have to pay any special fees. The student must obtain approval from the instructor of the exchange course. Exchange courses taken by Caltech students must have prior approval by the student's option, by the division providing courses most similar to the proposed course, and by the registrar. Students wishing to take such courses should obtain the appropriate form at the Registrar's Office, get the required signatures as above, and return it to the registrar. Freshmen at Caltech ordinarily cannot partici - pate in this exchange. STUDY AWAY Study abroad or away allows students to experience life in other coun - tries and regions of the United States, and to gain a broader exposure to the sciences, engineering, economics/management, the social sci - ences, and humanities. Please see the Financial Aid section of this catalog for details on applying for and eligibility for financial aid related to study abroad or Study Away. Note that supplemental charges and travel should be list - ed by the student in their financial aid budget so that these amounts can be considered when funding is calculated. Additional information, including application procedures and exact deadline dates, is available from the Fellowships Advising and Study Abroad Office at www.fasa.caltech.edu. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO STUDY AWAY PROGRAM Our newest program is an exchange with the University of Chicago. Students will spend the fall term at the University of Chicago and live in a University of Chicago hall of residence in a single room. Students are required to take at least two classes (18 units) in classes that will Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch191fulfil option requirements. Students take a maximum of 4 classes and can take up to 2 classes in the humanities or social sciences. A number of Chicago's graduate schools will be visiting undergraduates to take class. This is restricted to one class total, which is part of the maximum of 4 classes. This requires a petition that is executed after a student is nominated to the exchange and accepted by the University of Chicago and within the timeframe designated by the University of Chicago. Information on which graduate schools allow this is available in the exchange application materials. A minimum GPA of 3.5 is required to apply. Eligible sophomores and juniors interested in either the fall or winter term should apply by the January deadline for the fall term of the next academic year. Further information, including application procedures, more about the University of Chicago exchange, and the exact deadline date, is avail - able from the Fellowships Advising and Study Abroad Office at www. fasa.caltech.edu. More information about the University of Chicago can be found at www.uchicago.edu. Students are required to attend the fall orientation for which a fee is charged, ~$400 to $500. The orientation takes place the week prior to the start of the fall quarter. Since the University of Chicago is on a quarter system, their fall term correponds closely to Caltech fall term dates. Please see the Financial Aid section for details on applying for and eligibility for financial aid related to study away. Students who receive financial aid should list supplemental charges and travel in their aid application. STUDY ABROAD CAMBRIDGE SCHOLARS PROGRAM The Caltech Cambridge Scholars Program offers qualified juniors and seniors the opportunity to spend the fall or winter term at the University of Cambridge in England. Students are hosted by and live in one of the Cambridge Colleges participating in the program. The participating colleges are Corpus Christi, Pembroke, St. Catharine's, and St. John's. Students pay Caltech room, board, tuition, and other standard Caltech fees for the term. There may be a small supplemental charge for room and tuition. The supplement varies yearly depending on prices and the exchange rate. Students are admitted into one Cambridge department in the biological sciences, physical sciences, computer sciences, mathematics, or engi - neering sciences to take classes within the tripos, i.e., subject, offered by that department. Students can only take courses in one tripos subject, but can usually take classes from more than one part of the tripos in that subject. Students will find more information on the tripos structure and Cambridge University in the Fellowships Advising and Study Abroad Office or at www.cam.ac.uk. During the term at Cambridge, students take the equivalent of at least 36 Caltech units, usually four Cambridge courses, but may take in some Study Abroad ProgramsUndergraduate Information192subjects. For their classes, students receive a minimum of 36 Caltech units that can be used to fulfill option requirements or to fulfill other Institute course requirements. Note that the final number of units and whether the units can be used to fulfill departmental requirements will be determined after faculty review upon a student's return to Caltech. Caltech students have the use of all Cambridge facilities and are matric - ulated into the university for the term. A minimum 3.6 GPA is required to apply. Eligible sophomores and juniors interested in either the fall or winter term should apply by the January deadline for the next academic year. Further information, including application procedures, and the exact dead - line date, is available from the Fellowships Advising and Study Abroad Office at www.fasa.caltech.edu.

COPENHAGEN SCHOLARS PROGRAM The Caltech Copenhagen Scholars Program offers qualified juniors and seniors the opportunity to spend the fall at the University of Copenhagen (UCPH) or the Danish Technical University (DTU), both universities in the Copenhagen metropolitan area. At UCPH students will find courses offered in the physical or life sciences and computer science. At DTU students can take courses in engineering, computer science, nanotechnology, applied physics, space sciences, and in a broad range of science subjects, e.g., chemistry, physics, and mathe - matics. Students must select UCPH or DTU as their admitting univer - sity and will take all courses in the sciences/applied sciences at that university. All students are required to take a Danish language class during the semester. Students live in a modern kollegiet (dormitory) with Danish students. There may be a supplemental charge for the room due to the ~15 weeks long semester. The supplement varies yearly depending on pric - es and the exchange rate. Students admitted to UCPH live in a UCPH kollegiet and students admitted to DTU live in a DTU kollegiet. There is no board plan, but each kollegiet has a well-equipped kitch - en, and students may cook for themselves or with the other students on the hall. In addition to the supplemental room charge, all students pay standard board and tuition, but should budget additional funds for food due to the length of the semester. Note that while students pay Caltech board fees, the board fee is used to spend on food while in Copenhagen. Students can cook in their kollegiet or eat out. Caltech fees are due by the normal fall due date. Both UCPH and DTU are on a semester system, and Caltech students attend from the last week of August to mid-December and are required to participate in the one-week orientation or advising period the last week of August. Students have a one-week vacation in mid-October, and many use this vacation week to travel in Denmark or Europe. Students take a maximum of 30 ECTS (European Credit Transfer System) and at least two classes (18 Caltech units) must get option credit of some type. All students take a class in the Danish language Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch193offered at UCPH. Students attending Copenhagen University are required to take a course in Danish culture and two Block 1 and one Block 2 class. Students attending DTU may elect to take a class from the Danish Culture series (monarchy, film, Vikings, etc.) if it fits their schedule and they do not exceed 30 ECTS. units combined with their DTU classes and Danish language class at UCPH. All upper-level undergraduate or beginning graduate-level courses at UCPH and DTU can be taught in English. Students admitted to DTU may take a class on the history of tech - nology, which may qualify for Humanities credit. DTU has a very intrigu - ing group of classes in management and in technology management. These can be taken for social science or option credit with the permis - sion of the option representative. Students receive a minimum of 36 Caltech units (many receive more units) that can be used for general or option credit or to fulfill other Institute course requirements. Note that the final number of units and whether the units can be used to fulfill departmental requirements will be determined after faculty review upon a student's return to Caltech. Students can enroll in an optional three-week-long Danish-language course in August at either UCPH or DTU depending on their admitting university. This course is not required, but as noted, all students are required to take Danish language during the fall semester for credit. Further information about the Copenhagen Scholars Program is available in the Fellowships Advising and Study Abroad Office and online at: www.fasa.caltech.edu. Go to dtu.dk or ku.dk for further infor - mation on DTU or UCPH. Please see the Financial Aid section for details on applying for and eligibility for financial aid related to study abroad.

Note that the winter and spring terms can only be attended in years that do not overlap with Caltech term dates and only with the permission of \u00c9cole Polytechnique and Caltech. In addition, seniors may not attend the spring term if they plan to graduate in June. The \u00c9cole Polytechnique, often referred to by the nickname \"L'X,\" is the foremost French grande \u00e9cole of engineering (according to French and international rankings). Founded in 1794 and initially located in the Latin Quarter in central Paris, it was moved to Palaiseau in 1976. It is one of the oldest and most prestigious engineering schools in the world, with a very selective entrance exam. As one of the world's fore - most establishments in science education, the \u00c9cole Polytechnique trains graduates who become outstanding scientists, engineers, researchers, managers, and politicians. At \u00c9cole Polytechnique, students can take courses in one academic area called an approndisement. The subjects are engineering, computer Study Abroad ProgramsUndergraduate Information194science as well as the sciences, e.g., chemistry, physics, environmental sciences (GPS students) and mathematics. Students can also take one class in the social sciences and humanities if their schedule permits. All students take a French language class. Classes are taught in French or English based on the instructor's preference. However, students must have very good ability in speaking, reading, and writing French before applying for this program. Students will continue to take French at their level while at \u00c9cole Polytechnique. \u00c9cole Polytechnique has different academic schedules depending on the year of study. Caltech students who study at \u00c9cole Polytechnique for the fall term can only select classes from the third year of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique curriculum, and all classes must be selected from this year's curriculum. Note that the second-year classes are not allowed, as this year goes from the fall through January and then has a second semester versus two terms. The third-year specialized curriculum has a schedule that corresponds closely to Caltech's three-term system, and students must take all classes from the third-year curriculum. These classes are equivalent to 100-level classes at Caltech. A minimum 3.3 GPA is required to apply. Eligible sophomores and juniors apply to study during their junior or senior year by the Caltech internal deadline, which is usually in January. Note that students must be nominated by Caltech in order to apply and cannot apply without going through the internal Caltech nomination process, which is run by the Fellowships Advising and Study Abroad Office. Only this office can provide the required nomination. Each year application specifics will be provided to sophomores and juniors in the fall. Students will be required to complete both Caltech Study Abroad Proposal and Forms and complete the \u00c9cole Polytechnique application forms as well as undergoing a formal assessment of French skills by Caltech's French instructor. Please see the Financial Aid section for details on applying for and eligibility for financial aid related to study abroad. Students who receive financial aid should list supplemental charges and travel in their aid application. EDINBURGH SCHOLARS PROGRAM The Caltech Edinburgh Scholars Program offers qualified juniors and seniors the opportunity to spend the fall at the University of Edinburgh. The University of Edinburgh is on a semester system, and Caltech stu - dents attend from mid-September to mid-December. All students are required to attend a weeklong orientation held the week before classes start. All students live in university dormitories or flats, which are within walking distance from the George Square (humanities and social scienc - es) and the King's Buildings (the science and engineering campus). The university operates a free shuttle bus from the George Square campus to the King's Buildings campus. Students pay Caltech room, board, tuition, and other standard Caltech fees for the term. There is usually a supplemental charge for housing due to the longer length of the term. The supplement varies yearly depending on prices and the exchange rate. Students are admitted into one of Edinburgh's academic depart - Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch195ments in the College of Science and Engineering (CSE). Note that stu - dents cannot be admitted into the economics department because that is in the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, but they can take 20 credits in that department. Students, whose option is BEM or eco - nomics, are allowed to take 40 credits in economics in order to fulfill BEM or economics option requirements if the student also takes 40 credits in the College of Science and Engineering. Students take a minimum of 60 Edinburgh credits per semester and a maximum of 80 credits, but no more than five courses. Students will take a minimum of two classes in the department is closest to their option and which will serve as the student's admitting department. The two required classes (18 Caltech units) varies from 20 to 40 Edinburgh credits based on whether the two classes are 10 or 20 credit classes each. Students can take all of their classes in their admitting depart - ment or can take classes in other CSE departments provided they meet requirements. Students can take 20 credits (one course) in the College of Arts Humanities and Social Sciences or up to two 40 cred - its in this college if they take 40 credits in the College of Science and Engineering. Note that 60 credits (4 classes) is the standard course load, but most Caltech students take 70 to 80 credits. Note that at least 36 Caltech units must be taken, i.e., 4 classes/60 credits. A minimum 3.0 GPA is required to apply. Eligible sophomores and juniors should apply by the January deadline for the fall semester at Edinburgh. Further information, including application procedures and exact deadline dates, is available from the Fellowships Advising and Study Abroad Office: fasa.caltech.edu.

Students who receive financial aid should list supplemental charges and travel in their aid application. LONDON SCHOLARS PROGRAM The Caltech London Scholars Programs offers qualified juniors and seniors the opportunity to spend a fall term at University College London, which is located in the lovely Bloomsbury area of London. University College London (UCL) is on a semester system, and Caltech students attend UCL's autumn semester from about the third week of September to mid-December. All students are required to attend an exchange student orientation the week before the semester begins. Students also attend a new student orientation the first week of the semester. All students live in a UCL dormitory, which is located a short walk or short bus ride from the academic buildings of the UCL campus. Students pay Caltech room, board, tuition, and other standard Caltech fees for the term. There is a supplemental charge for housing/board due to the longer length of the term. The supplement varies yearly depending on prices and the exchange rate. Students are admitted into one of UCL's academic departments in the physical, life, or engineering sciences and must take at least 50% of their classes in their Admitting Department. Usually the Admitting Department is in a subject area that most closely corresponds to the student's Caltech option, but there is some leeway in this provided the student Study Abroad ProgramsUndergraduate Information196has the background to be admitted to the department in question in the STEM subjects. Students cannot be admitted into humanities or social science departments. The remaining 50 percent of classes can either be taken in the Admitting Department, another department in the sciences or engineer - ing, or the humanities and social sciences with the exception of the English literature department, the the Slade School of Design, which do not admit visiting students, even those with majors in English literature or the arts. Note that there are ample opportunities to take literature courses from a number of departments that offer literature classes, e.g., Slavonic and East European studies, Classics, Scandinavian studies, European cultural studies, Hebrew and Jewish studies, French, etc. Note that these departments offer classes taught in translation and in the for - eign language. A typical UCL semester class is 15 UCL credits. Caltech students must take 60 UCL credits during their semester at UCL. This would be equivalent to 36 Caltech units unless a class is equivalent to a 12-unit Caltech class. UCL classes fulfill option credit, humanities or social science credit or general credit. Note that the final number of units and whether the units can be used to fulfill departmental requirements will be determined after faculty review upon a student's return to Caltech. Students are only allowed to take Year One classes in the econom - ics department. Students can take higher level economics classes in the School of Eastern European and Slavonic Studies. A minimum 3.3 GPA is required to apply and some departments such as Computer Science (3.9) or the Biological Sciences (3.5) require a higher GPA. Advice on this can be obtained from Caltech's study abroad office. Certain departments at UCL will not admit fall only exchange stu - dent. For this year the subjects include, mathematics, statistical scienc - es, physics, all engineering sciences except for mechanical engineer - ing, which does admit fall only students. Eligible sophomores and juniors apply by the January deadline for the fall semester at UCL. Further information, including application procedures and exact deadline dates, is available from the Fellowships Advising and Study Abroad Office. Please see the Financial Aid section for details on applying for and eligibility for financial aid related to study abroad. Students who receive financial aid should list supplemental charges and travel in their aid application. MELBOURNE SCHOLARS PROGRAM The Caltech Melbourne Scholars Programs offers qualified juniors and seniors the opportunity to spend the summer/fall (Semester 2) at the University of Melbourne, which is located in the vibrant city of Melbourne, Australia. Melbourne is on a semester system, and Caltech students attend Melbourne's second semester from the second week of July to the end of November. Since Melbourne is in the Southern Hemisphere, the university's first semester starts in July and crosses over both the Caltech winter and spring terms. Therefore, students attend Melbourne's second semester, which corresponds better to Caltech's Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch197fall semester. All students are required to attend an orientation that takes place at the University of Melbourne the week before the semester begins. Students live in a residence hall, which is located a short walk from the academic buildings of the campus. Halls of residence have either an apartment or suite setup and offer that vary by hall assigned such as a 15-meter outdoor swimming pool and lounge area, barbecue area, work - out gym (with plasma TV, cross trainers, free weights, treadmills, exercise bikes, etc.), caf\u00e9, lounge, computer lab, and laundry. Students share a suite or apartment with other students. Students pay Caltech room, board, tuition, and other standard Caltech fees for the term. There is a supplemental charge for housing/ board due to the longer length of the Melbourne semester. In some years there could be a supplemental tuition charge. The supplement varies yearly depending on prices and the exchange rate. Students take four classes at Melbourne. Each class is worth 12.5 Melbourne credit points. Of the four classes, students must take two classes related to their option at Caltech and may take up to two outside of their subject, including the humanities and social sciences. Students are eligible to take one class as a research class in an area related to their option. The Melbourne credit load would be equivalent to 36 to 45 Caltech units. Melbourne classes can be used to fulfill option credit, humanities or social science credit, or general credit requirements. Note that the final number of units and whether the units can be used to fulfill departmental requirements will be determined after faculty review upon a student's return to Caltech.

REGISTRATION REGULATIONS PROCEDURES Students must register on the dates specified in the academic cal - endar. Students are not registered until they have both enrolled in an approved list of courses, and are current with the Bursar's Office. All undergraduate students with an outstanding Bursar's bill balance of $300 or more and graduate students with a Bursar's bill balance of $1,500 or more will have a hold placed on their registration for the subsequent quarter the day before online registration opens. The hold will be released once students have paid their bill in full or worked out a satisfactory payment plan with the Bursar's Office. Any student who has not completed both parts of registration within one week after the first day of classes will be removed from the Institute rolls. A student on leave from, or not registered with, the Institute may not attend classes, live in Institute housing, participate in Institute programs, use Institute facilities, work on campus, or use student services such as Wellness Services, Center for Inclusion & Diversity, Careers, Advising, and Experiential Learning (CAEL), or the Hixon Writing Center during the leave, unless approved in writing by the Dean of Students or designee. The Institute can place a hold on a student's registration in a variety of circumstances including any failure to comply with Institute requirements. Students are required to maintain continuity of registration until the requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree are fulfilled, except in the case of an approved undergraduate student leave. Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch199CHANGES IN REGISTRATION All changes in registration must be reported to the Registrar's Office by the student prior to the published deadlines. A grade of F will be given in any course for which a student registers and which they do not either complete satisfactorily or drop. A course is considered dropped when a student drops the course in REGIS or notifies the Registrar's Office in writing. A student may not at any time withdraw from a course that is required for graduation in their option, without permission of the registrar. A student may not add a course after the last day for adding cours - es, or withdraw from a course after the last date for dropping courses, without the approval of the Undergraduate Academic Standards and Honors (UASH) Committee. In cases where the late addition of a course would have put the student in a position of overload by Add Day of the term concerned, the student must also obtain an approved retroactive overload from the dean or associate dean of undergraduate students. Registration for added courses is complete when a student registers for the course on REGIS or sends a written request to the Registrar's Office with the proper approvals. No credit will be given for a course for which a student has not properly registered. The responsibility for regis - tering or dropping courses (in REGIS or by direct communication with the Registrar's Office) is on the student. Failure to fulfill the responsibil - ity because of oversight or ignorance is not sufficient grounds to peti - tion for permission to drop or add courses after the deadline. Humanities Drop Policy Students who do not attend the first class of the term will be auto - matically dropped from the class. Students who notify the instructor in advance of their inability to attend the first class may remain enrolled in the class at the instructor's discretion. Academic Advisement Students will be assigned freshmen advisers, and later option advis - ers, who will guide students to resources about the curriculum, grad - uation requirements, and Institute policies and procedures. Through the academic advising experiences at Caltech, students will develop an educational plan for successfully achieving their goals and select courses each quarter to progress toward fulfilling that educational plan. Undergraduate students are required to meet with their adviser at least once a year. Failure to meet at least once prior to the start of spring term will result in a hold placed on the student's record which will pre - vent them from registering online. Summer Research or Summer Reading Qualified undergraduate students who are regular students at the Institute are permitted to engage in research or reading during the summer, but in order to receive academic credit the student must have the approval of their division and must complete the registration process for such summer work before June 1. Any requests to add research after June 1 must be submitted as a Late Add petition to the Undergraduate Academic Standards and Honors Committee (UASH) as Registration RegulationsUndergraduate Information200well as be approved by the Division Chair. An undergraduate may not receive payment for research carried out for academic credit. Students who are registered for summer research or reading will not be required to pay tuition for the units. A student may apply up to 18 units of sum - mer research per summer and 36 units in total toward Institute gradua - tion requirements. UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT LEAVES OF ABSENCE Voluntary Leaves Personal Leaves A student may request a voluntary leave of absence for personal rea - sons (personal leave) by submitting a written petition via completion of the undergraduate leave form. International students should consult with the International Student Programs Office regarding visa implica - tions prior to submitting the leave petition. The dean or designee may grant a personal leave provided (a) the student is in good standing, in other words does not have to meet spe - cial academic or disciplinary requirements as a result of reinstatement, (b) the leave is for one year or less, although special circumstances can be considered for a longer leave, and (c) the leave extends over a peri - od that includes at least one full term. A student on personal leave may not attend classes, live in Institute housing, participate in Institute programs, use Institute facilities, work on campus, or use student services such as the Health and Counseling Services, Center for Inclusion & Diversity, or the Hixon Writing Center during the leave, unless approved in writing by the dean or designee. Career Advising and Experiential Learning (CAEL) is, by default, open to all students who have not been permanently separated from the Institute, regardless of leave or registration status, unless otherwise revoked by the director of CAEL. A disciplinary proceeding brought against a student may continue during the period that a student is on a personal leave. The Institute reserves the right to impose discipline against a student on personal leave should circumstances warrant. A petition to return from a personal leave should be submitted six (6) weeks before the first day of the term for which the student intends to return. Medical Leave s If a student is unable to complete their coursework due to medical reasons, the student may petition for a medical leave of absence by submitting a written petition via completion of the undergraduate leave form. The dean or designee may grant a leave for medical reasons, provided the petition is recommended by the director of Health and Counseling Services or designee. International students should consult with the International Student Programs Office regarding visa implica - tions prior to submitting the medical leave petition. Medical leaves are expected to extend over a period that includes at Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch201least one full term, although special circumstances may be considered for approval of a shorter leave upon the recommendation of a student's treatment team. Students must provide documentation of the need for the leave by a licensed treatment provider. Students may be required to sign a release of information form authorizing their treatment provider to communicate relevant medical information to representatives within Health and Counseling Services and the Dean's Office to facilitate evaluation of the need for the leave and to determine appropriate conditions associated with the leave and establishing expectations for return from the leave. The Institute may impose conditions on return from a medical leave, which may include confirmation from the student's health care provider that the student is following the recommended course of treat - ment, the student's consent for the provider to discuss the student's condition or progress during the leave with Caltech officials, including representatives of Health and Counseling Services and the Dean's Office, and an independent evaluation of the student's readiness to return by a qualified medical professional. Certain conditions of return will be specified at the time of the leave approval. A petition to return from medical leave must be submitted six (6) weeks before the first day of the term for which the student intends to return. The return process includes an interview with the director of Health and Counseling Services and the submission of a complet - ed return from medical leave and provider recommendation forms. Students are expected to sign a release of information form authorizing their treatment providers to communicate with Caltech, including rep - resentatives of Health and Counseling Services and the Dean's Office to determine readiness to return and recommendations for reasonable accommodations. Final approval of the petition is the responsibility of the dean or designee. If the student is permitted to return from the leave, any conditions of return will be communicated to the student in writing. A student returning from a leave for medical reasons will maintain the same academic standing that they had previously and will be subject to the same academic requirements for maintaining academic progress unless an exception is granted\u2014i.e., if on academic pro - bation, the student will remain on probation upon return from leave. Additional information and resources regarding medical leave, including financial and transcript implications, can be found at deans.caltech. edu. While on Medical Leave It is the expectation that a student on medical leave will focus on receiving treatment to manage the condition(s) that precipitated the leave. A student on medical leave may not attend classes, live in Institute housing, participate in Institute programs, use Institute facil - ities, work on campus, or use student services such as Health and Counseling Services, Center for Inclusion & Diversity, or the Hixon Writing Center during the leave, unless approved in writing by the dean or designee. areer Advising and Experiential Learning (CAEL) is, by Registration RegulationsUndergraduate Information202default, open to all students who have not been permanently separated from the Institute, regardless of leave or registration status, unless oth - erwise revoked by the director of CAEL. Pregnancy Leave Consistent with Caltech policy and the requirements of Title IX, stu - dents who are unable to complete their coursework or other course of study for a period of time due to a pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions are eligible for a medical leave of absence. Students who are pregnant or who have recently given birth are also eligible for reasonable accommodations. A pregnant student who wishes to take a medical leave should sub - mit a completed petition to the Dean of Undergraduate Students Office after obtaining a recommendation from the director of Health and Counseling Services. Medical documentation from the student's treat - ing medical provider is required. The Institute also provides reasonable accommodations to pregnant students consistent with federal and state law. Reasonable accommo - dations may include allowing pregnant students to maintain a safe dis - tance from hazardous substances, allowing them to make up tests and assignments that are missed for pregnancy-related reasons or excusing of absences that are medically necessary. Bonding An enrolled student in good academic standing who chooses to take a leave of absence because of the birth of their child may request a bonding leave by submitting a completed petition form to the Dean of Undergraduate Students Office for approval. Involuntary Leave The dean or designee may determine that it is necessary to place a student on an involuntary leave in a variety of circumstances, including when a student demonstrates behavior that poses a threat to health or safety, causes significant disruption to the Caltech community, for the personal safety or welfare of the student involved, as an interim mea - sure, or as a result of a disciplinary action. The dean may impose an involuntary leave in appropriate circum - stances, such as where a student's behavior: (1) has, or threatens to, cause significant property damage; (2) significantly disrupts the Caltech community; (3) presents a substantial risk of harm to self or others; (4) indicates the student is unable or unwilling to carry out self-care obli - gations; or (5) violates a Caltech policy or the honor system. An invol - untary leave also may be imposed when that the student requires a level of care from the Institute community that exceeds the reasonable accommodations, resources and staffing that the Institute can reason - ably be expected to provide for the student's well-being. Emergency Leave If the dean determines that a student's continued presence is likely to pose a substantial risk to the safety and well-being of the student or Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch203others, the dean may place the student on an emergency interim leave before a final determination is made. The dean will consider relevant information, including relevant information provided by the student, if available within the timeframe needed to make a decision, before deciding on an emergency interim leave. An emergency interim leave will remain in effect until a final decision has been made. Review and Decision Process If the conduct has been the subject of an investigation or review under an Institute process or procedure, the dean will consider the findings and conclusions reached in that process. In other circumstances described above, in making an informed decision to place a student on involuntary leave, the dean will conduct an individualized assessment and consider relevant information including information provide in a timely manner by the student. The dean may consult with other Institute personnel, including but not limited to, security and residential life personnel, staff, faculty, and other individuals or departments. If appropriate and feasible, the dean may seek cooperation and involvement of parents or guardians of the student. Medical information, including medical information provided in a timely manner by the student, may be considered if the behavior is associated with a physical or mental condition. In appropriate cases, the dean may consult with the director of Health and Counseling Services, or designee, and/or require a physical or mental evaluation from a health professional if the dean believes such an evaluation is necessary in order to make an informed decision. Students are expected, if necessary, to sign a release of information to facilitate discussions between Caltech and the health professional conducting the evaluation. The dean will also consider whether relevant risk factors can be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level through reason - able accommodation. Appeal A decision by the dean to place a student on involuntary leave may be appealed in writing within 10 days to the vice president for student affairs (or designee). If the leave is imposed as a sanction resulting from a finding of responsibility under an Institute process any applicable lim - itations on grounds for appeal will apply. Written Decision The student will be advised in writing of the decision to impose an involuntary leave. The dean may stipulate conditions that must be met before the student may return. An involuntary leave may be a perma - nent separation from the Institute (i.e. expulsion); for a specific duration or until certain conditions have been met. If the involuntary leave is not a permanent separation, the student will be advised of the length of the leave and/or any conditions for return. Registration RegulationsUndergraduate Information204While on Leave A student on involuntary leave may not attend classes, live in Institute housing, participate in Institute programs, use Institute facilities, work on campus, or use student services such as Health and Counseling Services, Center for Inclusion & Diversity, or the Hixon Writing Center during the leave, unless approved in writing by the dean or designee. A student on interim involuntary leave may be permitted to remain in Caltech housing and have continued access to student services such as Health and Counseling Services until a final decision is made, if appropriate under the circumstances and as approved by the dean. Return from Leave A student on involuntary leave will not be allowed to return until the dean makes a fact-specific assessment of the circumstances, considers relevant risk factors, and concludes that the student does not pose a significant disruption to the functioning of the Institute community and/or does not pose a substantial risk to the health and safety of the student or others. The dean will consider relevant information, including informa - tion provided by the student. In cases where a student has a physical or mental condition associated with the behavior triggering the leave, the dean will also consider whether the relevant risks can be eliminated by a reasonable accommodation. The dean may consult with other Institute administrators, as appropriate, in making their decision. The student will be notified in writing of the dean's determination of whether the student will be permitted to return from a leave, will not be permitted to return from the leave, or will be permanently separated from the Institute. If the student is permitted to return from the leave, any conditions of return will be communicated to the student in writing. Withdrawal from the Institute Formal separation from the Institute is effected by filing a completed undergraduate leave form in the dean of students office to be forward - ed to the registrar and other appropriate offices. The effective date of a withdrawal is entered by the dean or designee. A student withdrawing from the Institute at any time during the term without filing a formal undergraduate leave form will not be considered withdrawn. In such a case, any grades reported by the instructors will be recorded on the official transcript, and the grade of F will be recorded for all other courses. A student who withdraws, or is absent for a term (or longer), without an approved undergraduate student leave must petition for reinstatement to return to the Institute. Return from involuntary leave requires approval through the dean of students office. Reinstatement rules are listed under scholastic requirements. If the withdrawal occurs after Add Day of any term, a W (standing for \"withdrawn\") will be recorded on the student's transcript for all courses in which the stu - dent is enrolled. A grade of W is not included in the computation of the student's grade-point average. The record will also indicate whether an undergraduate student leave was granted. Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch205SCHOLASTIC REQUIREMENTS All undergraduates are required to meet certain scholastic standards as outlined subsequently. ELIGIBILITY TO BE ENROLLED All undergraduate students must complete a minimum of 27 units per term with a grade-point average of at least 1.9 in order to be eligible to remain enrolled in classes. Freshmen are not held to the 1.9 GPA requirement during the first two terms when all courses are taken pass/ fail. A student may be excused from the 27-unit eligibility requirement if an underload petition has been approved, prior to Add Day, by the dean or associate dean of undergraduate students. Under exceptional circumstances the deans may waive the requirement that such a petition be approved prior to Add Day, but may do so only once during that stu - dent's career at Caltech. In addition, students must earn a total of 108 units per year; this averages to 36 units per term. The 108 unit require - ment may be waived in the case of an approved underload by Add Day, terms away, or having been academically ineligible in one of the past three terms. When a student is ineligible for the first time, students are to send a reinstatement petition to the dean or associate dean of undergraduate students. The dean may choose to reinstate them, in which case they will be on academic probation. Alternatively, the dean may direct them to petition the Undergraduate Academic Standards and Honors Committee (UASH) for reinstatement. UASH will either approve their petition for reinstatement and place them on academic probation, or require them to withdraw from the Institute for at least two terms. When a student becomes ineligible a second time, they will be required to withdraw from the Institute for at least two terms. Summer does not count as a term. A student who has been required to leave the Institute because of academic ineligibility may, after at least two terms of leave, petition the Undergraduate Academic Standards and Honors (UASH) Committee for reinstatement. The UASH Committee's decision regarding reinstatement will be based largely on whether or not such students have made good use of their time while away from the Institute. Useful activities include being gainfully employed, having an internship, engaging in a significant amount of volunteer work, or successfully com - pleting courses at another college or university. The Committee will also expect that students applying for reinstatement will have completed work in all Caltech classes in which they had received an E or I grade. Students who are ineligible to petition may request an exception to the above. To do so, they must first obtain permission from two of the following three individuals: the dean of undergraduate students, the chair of the UASH Committee, and the Registrar. Such requests require that a reinstatement petition be sent to the Registrar's Office at least three days prior to the next UASH Committee meeting's published deadline. When a student becomes ineligible a third time, they will not be allowed to continue to enroll at Caltech. Scholastic RequirementsUndergraduate Information206DEPARTMENTAL AND OPTION REGULATIONS Selection of Option By the middle of the third term, freshmen must notify the Registrar's Office of their selection of an option in engineering, humanities, social sciences, or science to be pursued in subsequent years. Upon the selection of an option, a freshman will be assigned an adviser in that option, whose approval must then be obtained for registration for the following year. Undergraduate students may request to add an approved minor to their program of study. The request for a minor must be approved by the option representatives of the student's option and proposed minor. A plan must be presented which meets the minimum requirements for both the option and the minor, but the option representatives may impose additional requirements as well. The approved request must be submit - ted to the registrar before the start of the senior year. Undergraduate students may be allowed to major in two options for the Bachelor of Science degree. In order to do so the student must present a rationale for the double option and a plan of study leading to completion of the degree in four years. The plan, and any substantive modifications, must be approved by a committee composed of the option representatives of the two options. The plan must meet the min - imum requirements for both options as set forth in this catalog, but the committee may impose additional requirements as well. The approved plan should be submitted to the registrar during the sophomore year, but in any case no later than the start of the senior year. The student will then be assigned an adviser by each option. Consult the registrar for appropriate procedures. Continuing in an Option Students whose grade-point averages are less than 1.9 at the end of an academic year in a specific group of subjects designated by their department or option may, at the discretion of their department, be refused permission to continue the work of that option. Such disbar - ment does not prevent the students from continuing in some other option or from taking additional courses to raise their average in their original option. Students without an option will fall under the direct jurisdiction of the dean of students. Students may remain without an option for no more than one year. Change of Option An undergraduate in good standing at the Institute shall be permitted to transfer into any option of their choice provided they have (a) a 1.9 GPA in subjects required for graduation in that option or in a specific group of subjects designated by that option or (b) permission of the option representative or committee. A change of option is effected by obtaining a Change of Option petition from the Registrar's Office. The completed petition must then be signed by the option representative for the new option (who will assign a new adviser), and filed with the Registrar's Office. Institute regulations require that a student who has made normal progress at the Institute be able to change options at any Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch207time up to the end of the sophomore year without penalty either as to time until graduation or as to excessive unit requirements in any term. Term Examinations Term examinations will be held in all subjects unless the instructor in charge of any subject shall arrange otherwise. No student will be exempt from these examinations. When conflicts exist in a student's schedule, it is the student's responsibility to report the conflict to the instructor in charge of one of the conflicting examinations and make arrangements for another time. Satisfactory Academic Progress Eligibility to register is determined by the student's record as of the first day of classes of the term in which registration is sought. A student will be declared ineligible to register if they have completed fewer than 27 units with a 1.9 grade point average in the previous term. Graduation Requirement To qualify for graduation a student must complete the prescribed work in one of the options with a passing grade in each required subject and with a grade-point average of 1.9. A grade of F in an elective course need not be made up, provided the student has received passing grades in enough other accepted units to satisfy the minimum total requirements of the option. A Caltech undergraduate degree is based on a four-year residential experience (study abroad included) in which students have the time to explore their academic interested in a deep and rigorous way. Students who are admitted as transfer students or 3/2 students may be granted advanced standing and term credit for academic work accepted in transfer to Caltech. However, transfers and 3/2 students must enroll for a minimum of six terms at Caltech. All other regularly admitted students must enroll for four years (12 terms). Any exceptions to the four year residence requirement must be approved by the dean of undergraduate students and the vice president for student affairs. Candidacy for the Bachelor's Degree Students must declare their candidacy for the degree of Bachelor of Science to the registrar on or before the first Monday of November preceding the date on which they expect to receive the degree. All subjects required for graduation, with the exception of those for which the candidate is registered during the last term of their study, must be completed and the grade recorded by the second Monday of May pre - ceding commencement. Graduation in the Normally Prescribed Time Any undergraduate student who fails to complete the requirements for graduation at the end of 12 terms must petition the Undergraduate Academic Standards and Honors Committee for approval to register for further work each term. Scholastic RequirementsUndergraduate Information208Excess of or Fewer Than Normal Units (Overloads and Underloads) An overload is defined as registration for more than 48 units for an undergraduate. This limit corresponds to five 9-unit classes plus a 3-unit non-academic class (PE, PVA, SA) or four 9-unit classes plus one 12-unit class. Classroom and laboratory courses are to be limited to 45 units for freshmen for the first two terms and the remaining three units should be used for frontier (\"pizza\") courses, PE, PVA, SA, or research. Students may take up to 51 units (inclusive) but it requires their adviser's approval for such an overload. To take more units than 51, students will need to petition the undergraduate dean, with the expectation that permission will be granted only in exceptional cases. This policy is aimed at having no effect on currently recommended courses of studies in all options, while putting a very high bar for taking 6 full-time classes simultaneously. A student who wishes to carry an overload in any term must obtain the approval of their adviser and the dean or associate dean of undergraduate students. Petitions for overloads must be submitted one week before the last day for adding classes in any term. An underload is registration for fewer than 36 units. Underload petitions for freshmen, sophomores, and juniors must be approved by the adviser and the dean or associate dean of undergraduate stu - dents. Seniors may take an underload by presenting for the Registrar's approval a senior underload petition and a course plan for graduation the following June that does not require an overload in any term. Completing fewer than 27 units without prior approval will result in inel - igibility; for more information on eligibility, see page 205 . Underloads during the first 12 terms will not result in a tuition reduction, only in a reduction in financial aid. After completing 12 terms, tuition will be charged per unit. The dean or disability services coordinator will eval - uate exceptions due to medical reasons. For more information about underloads and tuition, see pages 212-213. For more information about impact to aid, see page 229. ALLOWANCE AND TRANSFER OF CREDIT Transfer of Credit from Other Institutions Regularly enrolled students who want to obtain credit for college courses taken elsewhere should obtain the permission of the dean of students and have a copy of the transcript of their work sent to the Registrar's Office. The student should then obtain an Allowance of Credit form from the Registrar's Office and take this, with the transcript as well as any supporting class materials required by the option repre - sentative, to the representative of the option in which credit is desired. Pending approval by the option representative, credit will be granted when the Allowance of Credit form, with the appropriate signatures, is returned to the office. Allowance of Credit in the Humanities and Social Sciences In general, Caltech students should fulfill Caltech course require - Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch209ments by taking courses at Caltech. Students are expected to have a well-reasoned educational goal for taking classes elsewhere. The only exceptions are transfer students admitted to advanced standing. Credit for comparable work done at other institutions with similar academic standards is not granted automatically. Students who wish to take courses elsewhere (whether on leave, in the summer, or during the academic year) should consult, in advance, with the executive officer for the humanities or the executive officer for the social sciences, or their designees, to minimize any misunderstand - ing regarding the nature of credit they may receive. Upon completion of the course, the student must obtain an Allowance of Credit form from the registrar, obtain the signed approval of the executive officer, or their designee, for transfer credit, and return the completed form to the Registrar's Office. The executive officers are the final authority in the allowance of credit in HSS courses. Guidelines and specific information about allowance of credit are available from the Division of the Humanities and Social Sciences. Other Allowances of Credit Except for transfer credit and credit based on Caltech placement exams upon admission, credit will not be granted for Caltech courses in which the student is not officially enrolled, except in special circumstances by arrangement with the instructor. Such arrangements must be approved by the Curriculum Committee, and the student must petition the Committee before the work is undertaken. UNDERGRADUATE EXPENSES For freshmen and transfer students applying for admission, there is a $75 application fee. This fee is nonrefundable. Housing contracts must be submitted to the Housing Office by the date specified in the instructions accompanying the contract. EXPENSE SUMMARY 2021-2022 General: General deposit............................................. $100.001 Orientation fee............................................... $500.001 Tuition............................................................ $56,364.00 1This charge is made only once during residence at the Institute. Other: Student fees.................................................. $2,316.00 Room (contract price)..................................... $10,398.002 Board (5 days / week ).................................. $7,350.00 Books and supplies (est.).............................. $1,428.00 Personal expenses (est.)............................... $2,091.00 2 The housing/room rate is calculated based on the weighted average of all available undergrad - uate on-campus housing options. Undergraduate ExpensesUndergraduate Information210The tuition and fees charge for all students is payable in full before the first day of classes unless the student enrolls in the Direct Cost Three Payment Plan through the Bursar's Office. The fee to enroll in the plan is $25.00 per term. Enrollment in the Direct Cost Three Payment Plan must be completed by August 10, 2021. Fees are subject to change at the discretion of the Institute. Tuition for the baccalaureate degree is based on four years (12 terms) of residence regardless of unit load each term or if a student completes graduation requirements a term(s) early. The 12 term resi - dence requirement is separate from and in addition to any other degree requirements. Official study abroad programs listed in the Catalog fulfill one term of the 12 term requirement. Since a Caltech degree is based on a four-year residential require - ment, entering students should expect to be in residence and to be billed tuition for a full four years. Any exceptions must be approved by the dean of undergraduate students and the vice president for student affairs. In addition, aid may not be disbursed to a student to cover full tuition if they are no longer attending classes. REFUNDS AND FEES Refunds and Repayments For all students, the institutional charges, e.g., tuition and room and board, will be prorated according to the amount of time the student spent in academic attendance before withdrawing from the Institute before the end of the sixth week of the term. These prorated charges will be compared to the payments received on behalf of the student, and the Institute will determine whether the student is entitled to a refund or owes additional funds to Caltech. For students receiving funds from federal Title IV, from Caltech, and/ or from state programs, the Institute will follow federal and other appli - cable regulations to determine the amount of all program funds the student has earned at the time of withdrawal. In general, the amount of financial aid earned is based on the amount of time the student has spent in academic attendance. If the amount of aid disbursed to the student is greater than the amount the student has earned, unearned funds must be returned. If the amount the student was disbursed is less than the amount the student earned, the student will be eligible to receive a post-withdrawal disbursement. Determining the Student's Last Date of Attendance or Withdrawal Date The Office of the Registrar is responsible for obtaining requests for withdrawal from the undergraduate or graduate dean and for process - ing official withdrawals. In order to calculate the refund or repayment, Caltech will establish the student's withdrawal date. This date is one of the following: the date that the student began the withdrawal process pre - scribed by Caltech; the date the student otherwise provided official notification to Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch211the registrar (written or oral) of their intent to withdraw; the midpoint of the academic term if no official notification is provided; the date determined by the registrar if there are special circumstances (illness, accident, grievous personal loss); or the date the registrar determines the student has not returned from an approved student sabbatical or if the student does not qualify for a sabbatical. Academically Related Activities that Determine Academic Attendance The Institute may use the last date of attendance at an academically related activity as the student's withdrawal date. This may occur if a student begins the withdrawal process and then attends an academi - cally related activity after that date. Caltech considers an academically related activity to include the following: attendance at a lab attendance at a lecture completing a quiz and/or test participation in a study session academic counseling session academic advisement session turning in a class assignment Determining the Return of Federal Funds The Financial Aid Office and/or the Graduate Office will calculate the federal funds that must be returned to the appropriate federal accounts. If a student withdraws from the Institute prior to the first day of classes for the period of enrollment, Caltech will return 100 percent of the student's federal financial aid in accordance with federal proce - dures, as well as Caltech and/or state grants or aid. If a student withdraws any time after the first day of classes for the period of enrollment, the Institute will perform the following: Determine the percentage of the payment period that the student completed. If the student completed more than 60 percent of the period, they earned 100 percent of the aid for the period. If the student completed 60 percent or less, the percentage of the period completed is the percentage of aid earned. This percentage is determined by dividing the number of days attended in the period of enrollment by the total days in the period. Apply the earned percentage to the amount of aid actually disbursed and the amount that could have been disbursed (\"earned aid\"). Subtract earned aid from aid that was actually disbursed. This results in the amount of unearned aid to be returned. The Financial Aid Office and/or the Graduate Office (as appro - Undergraduate ExpensesUndergraduate Information212priate) will allocate the return of funds back to the student aid programs in the following order: 1. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program 2. Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan Program 3. Federal Perkins Loan Program 4. Federal Direct PLUS Loan Program 5. Federal Pell Grant Program 6. Federal SEOG Program 7. 7. Other Title IV programs Any remaining refund will be returned to the other state, institutional, or private student assistance utilized. Federal Work Study is not includ - ed in any of these calculations. Appeals on Refunds Any questions or problems related to refunds should be directed to the Bursar's Office. For further information on refunds and repayments, con - tact the Financial Aid Office, the Graduate Office, or the Bursar's Office. Underloads Students who register for less than 36 units (\"Underload\") will not receive a reduction of tuition. Full tuition will be charged to underloading students' accounts. Also, applicable financial aid will be reduced, in under - load situations. For specific information on underload requirements, and special circumstances where an underload may be granted, see page 208. Information regarding financial aid and underloads can be found on page 229, Part-Time Enrollments (Underloads.) For those undergraduate students who are eligible for underloading after completing 12 terms or by approved medical exception (page 208), the tuition will be charged as of Add Day at an AY2021-2022 rate of $522.00 per unit plus $772.00 for student fees per term, with a minimum ten unit charge of $5,992.00 per term. Dropping a Course Students who are not enrolled full-time as of the last day to add courses will have their aid revised. Generally, students enrolling less than three-fourths time will have an increased work award. Additional information is available in the Financial Aid Office. For more information about impact to aid, see page 229, Underloads and Financial Aid. Refund upon Withdrawal When a student, for whatever reason, withdraws from Caltech during an academic term, a refund of tuition as well as room and board, if applicable, is calculated. The amount of refund is determined by how much of the term has elapsed. If the student is a recipient of student financial assistance, that assistance, if applicable, will be reduced as a result of their withdrawal. Recent federal legislation determines the amount of refund for recipients of federal Title IV student assistance. It is the purpose of this section to inform students of the financial impli - cations of withdrawal. If the student is not a recipient of federal financial aid, the Institute's refund policy returns any refund of tuition or room and board first to the Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch213programs from which assistance has been received (i.e., scholarships, Caltech gift assistance). Any amount remaining will then be returned to the student. The non-Title IV portion will be distributed as appro - priate, first to outside agencies, as required, then to the Caltech grant, scholarship, or loan, depending on the composition of the aid package. These distributions will occur as credits to the appropriate aid funds and charge(s) to the student's Caltech account. If the student is the recipient of federal Title IV student assistance, any refund must then be applied first to the federal aid program(s) in the prescribed order listed on page 211. In the event that a student's disbursed financial aid exceeds the direct costs on the student's personal account, a credit balance will result. Withdrawal will result in the reversal or repayment of the result - ing credit balance. General Deposit Each new student is required at their first registration to make a gen - eral deposit of $100, to cover possible loss and/or damage of Institute property. Upon graduation or withdrawal from the Institute, any remain - ing balance of the deposit will be applied to the student's outstanding balance or refunded if there is no unpaid balance. Fees for Late Registration Registration is not complete until the student has enrolled in a program approved by their adviser and has paid tuition and other fees. A pen - alty fee of $50 is assessed for failure to register within five days of the scheduled dates. Fees for Late Payment A $50 late penalty may be charged by the Bursar's Office for failure to clear a past-due account at the beginning of instruction. Honor System Matters Monies owed to the Institute resulting from a disciplinary decision may be collected through the Bursar's Office, at the request of the dean of students. Special Fees Students taking the Summer Field Geology course (Ge 120 ab) should consult with the division about travel and subsistence arrangements and costs. Unpaid Bills All bills owed the Institute must be paid when due. Any student whose bills are past due may be refused registration for the following term. All undergraduate students with an outstanding bursar's bill balance of $300 or more will have a hold placed on their registration for the subsequent term the day before online registration opens. The hold will be released once students have paid their bill at the Bursar's Office. Diplomas will not be released until the bursar account is paid in full. Undergraduate ExpensesUndergraduate Information214Caltech ID Card Charges If an undergraduate student owes more than $300, the student's ID card will be deactivated and they will be unable to charge any new pur - chases. Cards will be reactivated once students have paid their bill in full at the Bursar's Office. FINANCIAL AID Caltech believes that qualified students who wish to attend the Institute should not be prevented from doing so for financial reasons. Although the Institute expects students and families to finance the cost of education to the fullest extent possible, the Institute will make every effort to assist those who need help, including those whose financial circumstances change during the year. Demonstrated financial need is the difference between the annual cost of attending Caltech and the amount the student and parents can reasonably be expected to contribute toward those costs. Costs include actual tuition, student fees, room and board, books and supplies, and per - sonal expenses. For U.S. citizens or eligible noncitizens who reside in the United States, Canada, Mexico, or Guam, costs include a travel allowance designed to (partially) offset the cost (airfare) of two round-trips from a student's home during the academic year. Caltech's estimate of a family's ability to contribute is determined annually in accordance with nationally established guidelines. Eligibility for each type of assistance varies, depending upon the source of funds. Assistance offered by Caltech includes federal, state, and insti - tutional grants, subsidized part-time jobs, and low-interest loans. U.S. cit - izens or eligible noncitizens (as defined in the Free Application for Federal Student Aid [FAFSA]) may apply for state and federally funded programs. International students may apply for institutionally funded programs. Students should not wait to be accepted for admission to Caltech before applying for financial aid. With the exception of international stu - dents, applications for admission are evaluated separately from requests for financial aid. Students with complete financial aid applications on file will be considered for all applicable types of need-based assistance. A renewal application must be submitted each year. In addition to direct financial assistance, information is available, upon request, about educa - tion payment plans and financial-planning resources. (For information on non-need-based scholarships and prizes, starting on page 230.) All students who believe they will need assistance to attend Caltech are encouraged to submit financial aid applications. The final day to complete a financial aid application or request a loan is one day after the beginning of the registration period for the term following your last term of enrollment for the year. Please use the table below to determine which deadline applies to you.

HOW TO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID Application Process for Caltech and Federal Financial Aid for Entering Students (U.S. Citizens and Eligible Noncitizens) Slightly different procedures and deadlines exist for each category of students applying for financial aid. Detailed descriptions of these pro - cedures and priority due dates for prospective and continuing students may be found on the Caltech Financial Aid Office website at finaid. caltech.edu . International Applicants If you are applying for admission as a freshman for the fall of 2022 and are not a citizen or permanent resident of the United States at the time of your application for admission, you will need to refer to the Caltech Financial Aid Office website at finaid.caltech.edu for instructions for applying for financial aid. International applicants who do not apply for financial aid by published deadlines, or who are denied aid for their first year at Caltech, are not eligible for need-based financial aid for any other academic period while they are undergraduates at the Institute (with the exception of citizens of Canada and Mexico). Those with financial aid offers will be eligible to apply for assistance in subsequent years. All eligible students must reapply for aid each year. International students are required to complete the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE. This online application collects family income and asset information from international students. Students will need to complete and submit the CSS PROFILE online at cssprofile.collegeboard.org/ after they have been admitted into Caltech. (Students can also visit EducationUSA Advising Centers at educationusa.state.gov/find-advising-center if you need assistance completing your CSS PROFILE.) Please refer to the complete applica - tion instructions provided on the Caltech Financial Aid Office website at finaid.caltech.edu. Financial AidUndergraduate Information216TYPES OF AID AVAILABLE There are three basic categories of financial aid that may be awarded. 1. Grants and scholarships represent \"gift aid,\" which does not need to be repaid. In general, a Caltech scholarship is awarded based on financial need. Caltech named and/or endowed scholarships are considered to be based on need and merit. If you qualify for a state or federal grant, this grant will be included in your financial aid package. 2. Federal Work-Study or Caltech Work-Study represents student employment funds that have been allocated for you to earn during the academic year. Summer Caltech Work-Study rep - resents funds that have been allocated for you to earn during the summer. While a work-study award is not a guarantee of employment, Caltech generally has more opportunities for stu - dent employment than it has students interested in working. 3. Low-interest educational loans: Students are generally offered Caltech/Institute loans. Students may be awarded Federal Direct Stafford Loans if they request them. CALTECH SCHOLARSHIPS Awarded to students with demonstrated financial need. Recipients are expected to be enrolled full-time. The named and/or endowed scholarships are also need-based, but many have a merit component. Recipients of named and/or endowed scholarships are often selected after their initial financial aid offer based on scholarship-specific eligi - bility. These scholarships are almost always used to replace some or all of the recipient's Caltech scholarship. The Financial Aid Office makes every attempt to renew these scholarships, contingent upon the recip - ients continuing to meet the specific eligibility criteria. FEDERAL GRANTS Federal Pell Grant Awarded to exceptionally needy undergraduate students who are seeking their first bachelor's degree. Amounts are set by the federal government based on need and enrollment status. In 2021-22, awards ranged from $650 to $6,495 for full-time students; awards for part-time students are set in proportion to their enrollment, i.e., three-quarter time, half-time, less than half-time. Recipients must be in good academic standing. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Awarded to undergraduates with demonstrated need who are seeking their first bachelor's degree. Priority goes to full-time Pell Grant recip - ients. Recipients must be in good academic standing. Awards cannot exceed $4,000 per year. STATE GRANTS Cal Grant A Provides tuition and fee assistance to undergraduate California resi - Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch217dents seeking their first bachelor's degree. Awarded on the basis of cumulative grade-point average and financial need. Qualifying students can receive up to $9,220, renewable for up to four years. Continuing Cal Grant recipients must maintain good academic standing in addition to financial need. They are not required to resubmit verification of their grade-point average for renewal. Cal Grant B Provides a living-allowance stipend and tuition/fee assistance to under - graduate California residents seeking their first bachelor's degree. Awards are based on cumulative grade-point average and high financial need. Recipients are generally from disadvantaged economic or educa - tional backgrounds. Awards for first-year students provide up to $1,648 for books and living expenses. When renewed or applied beyond the first year, awards also include tuition and fee assistance of up to $9,220. Continuing Cal Grant recipients must maintain good academic standing in addition to financial need. They are not required to resubmit verification of their grade-point averages for renewal. Other State Grants Other states, such as Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Rhode Island, may offer grant assistance to their residents who plan to attend Caltech. Students are encouraged to contact their respective state post-second - ary agencies for specific eligibility and renewal criteria EDUCATIONAL LOANS An educational loan is a serious financial obligation and must be repaid. You should carefully consider the repayment obligation before you accept educational loans. Loans can be an invaluable resource for many students and their families in financing a college education. Students can postpone paying a portion of their educational costs until they complete their education or leave school. The repayment period on most loans can extend up to 10 years after graduation or leaving school. Graduating with educational debt is a fairly common experience for students. At Caltech, however, the average educational indebtedness at graduation is significantly lower than the national average for students attending four-year private and public colleges. Over the last several years, the average for Caltech graduates has been among the lowest in the nation for four-year colleges. The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program This program offers eligible students and parents the opportunity to bor - row money directly from the federal government to help pay the cost of attendance at Caltech. The U.S. Department of Education makes loans, through Caltech, directly to students and/or parents. The Institute will use the loan(s) to pay your tuition/fees and other direct charges such as room and board, and give the student any remaining money for indirect costs. Students and/or parents make their repayments directly to the federal government. Financial AidUndergraduate Information218Direct loans include 1. The Federal Direct Stafford Loan Program; 2. The Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan Program; 3. The Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan Program; and 4. The Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program. Federal Direct Stafford Loan There are two types of Federal Direct Stafford Loans: subsidized and unsubsidized. The federal government pays the interest on subsidized loans while the borrower is enrolled at least half-time and during autho - rized periods of deferment. The interest on unsubsidized loans begins to accrue immediately upon disbursement and is generally capitalized (added to the amount borrowed) when the borrower is no longer enrolled at least half-time. Eligibility for subsidized Stafford Loans is based on financial need as demonstrated by the FAFSA. Students who do not demonstrate suf - ficient need or whose need is met may borrow unsubsidized Stafford Loans provided their total financial aid, including the Stafford Loan, does not exceed the total estimated cost of attendance. Dependent undergraduate students (excluding students whose parents cannot borrow Parent PLUS loans) may borrow Stafford Loan amounts not to exceed an annual total of $5,500 for first-year students, with no more than $3,500 in subsidized Stafford; $6,500 for second-year students, with no more than $4,500 in subsidized Stafford; and $7,500 for third- and fourth-year students, with no more than $5,500 in subsidized Stafford. Independent undergraduate students and dependent undergrad - uate students whose parents are unable to borrow Parent PLUS loans may borrow additional unsubsidized Stafford Loan amounts not to exceed an annual total of $9,500 for first-year students, with no more than $3,500 in subsidized Stafford; $10,500 for second-year students, with no more than $4,500 in subsidized Stafford; and $12,500 for third- and fourth-year students, with no more than $5,500 in subsidized Stafford. Graduate students may borrow Stafford Loan unsubsidized amounts not to exceed an annual total of $20,500. The maximum outstanding total subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford Loan debt is $31,000 for dependent undergraduate students, with no more than $23,000 in subsidized Stafford; $57,500 for independent undergraduate students (or for depen - dent undergraduate students whose parents do not qualify for PLUS loans), with no more than $23,000 of this aggregate amount in the form of subsidized loans; and $138,500 for graduate students (including loans for undergrad - uate study), with no more than $65,500 of this aggregate in the form of subsidized loans.

Direct Stafford Loans have a six-month grace period that starts the day after the borrower graduates, leaves school, or drops below half-time enrollment. Repayment begins when the grace period ends. Deferments are available for new borrowers during at least half-time enrollment at an eligible institution; during periods of academic study in approved graduate fellowship or rehabilitation pro - grams; and for periods of unemployment and economic hardship. Applications for Federal Direct Stafford Loans are available on the Caltech Financial Aid Office website. Complete information on Stafford Loan deferments and repayment options is also available from the Financial Aid Office. FEDERAL PARENT PLUS LOAN Parent PLUS loans are available to the parents or stepparents of depen - dent undergraduate students. These credit-based loans are not based on federal need or subsidized by the government, but students must file a FAFSA in order for their parents to qualify for a Parent PLUS loan.

There is no annual limit to the amount that can be borrowed through the Parent PLUS loan program. In general, parents may borrow the difference between the cost of the student's education and any other financial aid received. PLUS loans may also be used to pay for all or part of the expected family contribution. In addition to the interest, parents pay a loan fee.

Specifically, Parent PLUS loan bor - rowers may defer repayment while the dependent student on whose behalf the loan was obtained is enrolled on at least a half-time basis, and during the six-month period after the dependent student on whose behalf the loan was obtained ceases to be enrolled on at least a half- time basis. If a Parent PLUS loan borrower does not request a deferment, the first payment on the loan will be due within 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed. Applications for Federal Direct Parent PLUS loans are available on the Caltech Financial Aid Office website. Applications must be submitted to the Financial Aid Office for eligibility certification. Complete information 123 Financial Aid221Undergraduate Information222on Parent PLUS loan deferments and repayment options is also available from the Financial Aid Office. Federal Student Aid Ombudsman The Federal Student Aid Ombudsman works with student loan bor - rowers to informally resolve loan disputes and problems. The office of the ombudsman helps borrowers having problems with the following federal loans: direct loans (subsidized and unsubsidized Direct Stafford Loans, Direct PLUS loans, and Direct Consolidation Loans); Federal Family Education Loans (subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford Loans, FFEL PLUS loans, and FFEL Consolidation Loans); guaranteed student loans, SLS loans, and Federal Perkins Loans. If a student needs the assistance of the ombudsman in order to resolve disputes or prob - lems, they may contact the office at U.S. Department of Education, FSA Ombudsman Group, P .O. Box 1843, Monticello, KY 42633; (877) 557-2575; fax: (606) 396-4821; visit the website at studentaid.gov/feed - back-center/ to submit a complaint. Caltech Loans Generally, no interest is charged and no repayment of principal is required while a student maintains a continuous course of study at Caltech. Repayment on Caltech loans begins nine months after grad - uation, leaving school, or less than half-time enrollment. Caltech loans carry an annual interest rate of 5%. More specific information is pro - vided on the promissory note and the disclosure statement provided to students prior to disbursement of the loan. Other loans/emergency loans may be available to students regardless of their eligibility for financial aid. These loans are usually payable within the same academic year and are administered by the dean of students on a case-by-case basis. Additional information and applications may be obtained from the dean of students' office. The Dean's Office also has a no-interest, 30-day emergency-loan program. Maximum loans are $500. Additional information and applica - tions may be obtained from the Dean's Office. STUDENT EMPLOYMENT Work programs provide students with the opportunity to earn money to help with college expenses while gaining valuable job experience. Student employment opportunities are generally available to all Caltech students, even those who have not applied for financial aid or qualified for need-based aid. On campus employers are encouraged to post opportunities through Career Advising and Experiential Learning's plat - form. Please note that students may work no more than 16 hours per week (no more than 12 hours per week as undergraduate teaching assistants). Undergraduate TAs must be in good academic standing (eligible, and not on probation), and good disciplinary standing (not on disciplinary proba - tion) for the term in which they are serving as a TA, and must be approved by the undergraduate deans. First-year students may not work during fall term. Students can expect to earn at least the City of Pasadena minimum Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch223wage of $15 per hour. Compensation rates will vary based on the position, a student's skills, and previous work experience. Additional policies and procedures for teaching assistants, including undergraduates with teaching responsibilities are included in section 4, Teaching Assistantships. (See pages 354-355.) Federal Work-Study Awarded to domestic students who have demonstrated financial need through their submission of the FAFSA, this federally funded program pro - vides part-time employment to eligible students. Most Caltech students are awarded $2,500 in Federal Work-Study (FWS). Some students may be awarded less. Since entering students are not permitted to work on-campus in the fall term and can only work in the winter and spring terms, student employment awards for entering students are limited to $1,350 in their first year. Employment awards will increase to the standard student employment amount offered to continuing students after the first year. The maximum amount of FWS wages that a student may earn is determined by their financial need. Students have the option to move all or a portion of their loan or student employment from one program to the other at any time during the academic year. The final day to request to convert your loan into work or work into loan is one day after the beginning of the registration period for the term following your last term of enrollment for the year. Please use the following table to determine which deadline applies to you. Last Term of Enrollment in Academic Year 2021-22Hard Deadline Fall Term November 19, 2021 Winter Term February 25, 2022 Spring Term May 20, 2022 Please go to the work-study page on the Caltech Financial Aid Office website (finaid.caltech.edu/TypesofAid/workstudy) for additional information about student employment at Caltech. Caltech Work-Study The Caltech Work-Study Program is funded by the Institute and is designed to provide part-time employment for international students who have demonstrated financial need, and other students who do not qualify for the Federal Work-Study Program. The Caltech Work-Study Program is limited to on-campus employment or student employment positions at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The program's regulations parallel the Federal Work-Study Program's regulations. FINANCIAL AID WHEN STUDYING ABROAD/AWAY Caltech provides student financial aid (in the form of grants, schol - arships, and loans) to those undergraduates with demonstrated financial need who desire to participate in the Institute-sponsored University of Chicago Study Away Program, Caltech Cambridge Financial AidUndergraduate Information224Scholars Program, Caltech Copenhagen Scholars Program, Caltech Edinburgh Scholars Program, \u00c9cole Polytechnique Scholars Program, Caltech London Scholars Program, or Melbourne Scholars Program. Enrollment in a study-abroad program approved for credit by Caltech will be considered enrollment at the Institute, for the purpose of applying for and receiving federal student financial assis - tance. To be eligible for consideration in Caltech's study-abroad programs, students must be in good academic standing, as defined in the Caltech Catalog and as certified by the Institute's registrar. They must also meet the minimum GPA requirement as outlined in the information provided by the Fellowships Advising and Study Abroad Office. In addition, students selected to be Cambridge, Copenhagen, \u00c9cole Polytechnique, Melbourne, or University College London scholars will be provided a memo of understanding outlining the terms of their study-abroad participation. (For more information on Study Abroad, see pages 191-197.) Costs include but are not limited to tuition, fees, room, board, addi - tional meals not covered by a board contract, books, supplies, personal expenses, and a standard transportation allowance from the student's home to Caltech. Transportation expenses related to the student's travel between Caltech and the study-abroad institution are the responsibil - ity of the student; financial aid recipients may be offered interest-free Institute loans to cover study-abroad travel expenses. Students will have their expected family contribution and financial package calculated in the same manner as other students. Students studying abroad are subject to the standard Caltech policy of a maximum of 12 terms of eligibility for financial aid. University of Chicago Study Away Program, Cambridge, Copenhagen, University College London, \u00c9cole Polytechnique, University of Edinburgh, and Melbourne University candidates must meet all finan - cial aid priority deadlines and eligibility requirements to receive aid. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that all necessary documents are filed and complete with regard to their application for financial aid. University of Chicago Study Away Program participants and Cambridge, Copenhagen, University College London, \u00c9cole Polytechnique, University of Edinburgh, and University of Melbourne Scholars will continue to be considered for available federal, state, Caltech grant, scholarship, and loan funds. The Fellowships Advising and Study Abroad Office will make the necessary arrangements with the Bursar's Office to ensure that scholars who may be eligible for funds in excess of the direct charges to the Institute receive those funds prior to their departure. OTHER RESOURCES A number of both local and national organizations offer outside schol - arships to continuing students throughout the year, some of these regardless of need. Those relevant to undergraduate students will also be posted on the Caltech Financial Aid Office website. Such schol - arships can also often be found with the help of a search service. We recommend College Board Fund Finder ( bigfuture.collegeboard. org/scholarship-search Opportunities for Women ( college/ ); Scholarship Opportunities for Minority Students ( afforda - blecollegesonline.org/financial-aid-for-minorities/ ); and Scholarship Search by Sallie Mae ( salliemae.com/college-planning/tools/scholar - ship-search/?dtd_cell=SMPLSHDCOTDOBOOTOTHOTHRR010001 ). (For more information on scholarship services, go to finaid.org). You may also visit the Financial Aid website at finaid.caltech.edu/ TypesofAid/OS/list for a list of outside scholarships. Outside scholarships acquired by students are considered, by fed - eral regulation, to be a resource available during the academic year. Caltech's policy is to use outside scholarships to replace the student employment and/or loan components of the financial aid package. For entering students, we generally replace student employment first. For continuing students, loans are generally replaced first. Only if the total outside scholarships exceeds the student employment and/or loan that would have been included in your financial aid package will it be necessary to reduce Caltech scholarship. In general, a student's total financial aid, including outside assistance, cannot exceed their demon - strated financial need. Under no circumstances can a student's total financial aid, exceed their estimated cost of attendance. FINANCIAL AID DISBURSEMENT Most financial aid funds are credited directly to your student account and are applied first to institutional charges for the current term. Funds are credited no earlier than 10 days prior to the first day of the term. Aid that can be credited directly to your account will be credited when you have accepted or declined your awards on access.caltech; provided all required documents for the aid programs you have been awarded made satisfactory academic progress; enrolled in at least the minimum number of credits for the finan - cial aid programs you have been awarded; completed all necessary loan documents and, for first-time Direct Stafford Loan borrowers, completed the online Entrance Interview. If the disbursement of aid results in a credit balance, any aid award - ed in excess of institutional charges will be paid to the student as a refund. Refunds must be requested by the account holder. Requests may be made by e-mail, telephone, or in person at the Bursar's Office. Prior to receiving funds, it may be necessary to fill out and sign a refund form. Refunds can be obtained in cash or by check. A maximum refund of $500 cash per day can be received from the Bursar's Office cashier. Refund checks are requested by the Bursar's Office and issued by Accounts Payable. This usually takes five working days from the day of request. Outside scholarships are usually disbursed in the form of a check and must be handled according to the sponsor's specifications. If the funds are sent to the Financial Aid Office or the Bursar's Office, they will be credited to your account. Again, if the crediting of any outside scholarship results in a credit balance on your account, you Financial AidUndergraduate Information226may request that the credit balance be refunded to you. Federal reg - ulations allow Caltech to credit financial aid funds to your account for payment of tuition, fees, and room and board charges. You must give the Bursar's Office written authorization to keep a credit balance on your account from one term to the next term during the academic year. Federal guidelines prohibit keeping a credit balance from one academic year to the next. If you complete your financial aid file late in the term, resulting in the late disbursement of your financial aid funds, you may be subject to late fees assessed by the Bursar's Office. Cal Grant B stipend payments will be credited to your tuition account unless you contact the Financial Aid Office in person within the first three weeks of the term to make alternate arrangements. Again, if the crediting of any financial aid results in a credit balance on your account, you may request that the credit balance be refunded to you. In general, loans are disbursed in three installments, one at the begin - ning each term. For most Caltech students who are enrolled for the full academic year, this means that one-third of their loan(s) will be disbursed at the beginning of the fall term, another at the beginning of the winter term, and the final third at the beginning of the spring term. Students whose loan periods are for one term receive their entire disbursement at the beginning of that term. If you work through either the Federal Work-Study or the Caltech Work- Study program, you will be paid by check through the biweekly Caltech payroll system. Checks are normally distributed at your actual work site. Since financial aid is generally awarded on the assumption of full- time enrollment, it is possible that some or all of your aid will need to be adjusted if your enrollment status results in a reduction in your tuition for a term. If you withdraw or drop below half-time enrollment after the last day for adding classes for a term, you may be required to repay all or a portion of the aid that has already been credited to your account. You must inform the Financial Aid Office if you take a leave of absence or change your enrollment subsequent to receiving your financial aid. Cal Grant recipients who take a leave of absence are advised to contact the California Student Aid Commission (csac.ca.gov) and submit a form to remain eligible for the program. You have the right to cancel your loan(s) any time before disburse - ment and up to 14 days after disbursement. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS (SAP) Federal and state regulations governing student financial aid programs require the Institute to ensure that each student who is receiving finan - cial aid maintains Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) toward their degree. The SAP check occurs after grades are posted at the end of each term. Failure to meet the standards of satisfactory academic progress may disqualify a student from additional federal, state and institutional financial aid. A student can appeal their unsatisfactory academic prog - ress status and be placed on warning, probation or continued on pro - bation for financial aid purposes. Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch227Satisfactory Academic Progress Requirements Following the first two terms, which are taken on a pass-fail basis, freshmen will be ineligible to register if they failed to pass at least 27 units in the previous term. After the first two terms of study, all undergraduate students must complete a minimum of 27 units with a grade-point average of at least 1.9 in order to remain eligible to regis - ter for classes. In addition, students must earn an average of 36 units per term over the past three trailing terms (that is, a minimum of 108 units should be earned after three terms of enrollment each academic year). A student may be excused from the 27-unit eligibility requirement if the requisite petition has been approved, prior to Add Day, by the dean or associate dean of undergraduate students. Under exceptional circumstances the deans may waive the requirement that such a petition be approved prior to Add Day, but may do so only once during that stu - dent's career at Caltech. Following their first ineligibility, students are to meet with the dean or associate dean of undergraduate students. The dean may choose to reinstate them, in which case they will be on academic probation. Alternatively, the dean may direct them to petition the Undergraduate Academic Standards and Honors Committee (UASH) for reinstatement. UASH will either approve their petition for reinstatement and place them on academic probation, or require them to withdraw from the Institute for at least two terms. Students who fail a core course or who fail to suc - cessfully complete 36 units, even though they remain in good standing, are required to meet with one of the undergraduate deans before being allowed to register for classes in the subsequent term. Financial Aid Warning Students who are found not to be making satisfactory academic prog - ress at the end of an academic term will be placed on financial aid warn - ing. A student may continue to receive financial aid for one term while on financial aid warning status. Students should use this opportunity to re-establish SAP . Financial Aid Probation Students who fail to make satisfactory academic progress after their term of financial aid warning will be ineligible to register and ineligible for financial aid. Students may appeal this status as outlined in the Caltech Catalog . Ineligible freshmen must petition the UASH Committee for rein - statement if they wish to continue as students and continue to receive financial aid. The dean of students or associate dean may act on a peti - tion if it is the student's first ineligibility. Undergraduate students, except first- and second-term freshmen, may submit a petition to the UASH Committee for reinstatement, giving any reasons that may exist for their previous unsatisfactory work and stating any new conditions that may lead to better results. Each such petition will be considered on its merits. For the first such ineligibility, the petition may be acted on by the dean of undergraduate students, after consultation with the student and examination of the record. At the dean's discretion, such cases may be referred to the UASH Committee for action. All subse - quent reinstatements must be acted upon by the Committee. Financial AidUndergraduate Information228 Undergraduate InformationStudents who are reinstated as a result of their appeal/petition for reinstatement will be placed on financial aid probation and may receive financial aid for an additional academic term. Continued on Financial Aid Probation Students who fail to make satisfactory academic progress after a term on financial aid probation will be ineligible to register and ineligible for federal and state financial aid. These students may appeal this status as outlined above and in the Caltech Catalog . Students who are reinstated as a result of their appeal/petition for reinstatement will be continued on financial aid probation. These stu - dents will be ineligible for federal and state aid. They will continue to be eligible for up to three additional terms of institutional aid but their scholarship eligibility will be reduced in each term the student is contin - ued on financial aid probation. Financial Aid Suspension Students who fail to make satisfactory academic progress after being con - tinued on financial aid probation for three additional terms will be ineligible for federal, state and institutional financial aid , even if they are subsequent - ly reinstated by the UASH Committee, until such time as they make satis - factory academic progress. Maximum Time Frame for Receiving Aid A student has a limited time frame to complete all degree requirements and remain eligible for financial aid. As defined by federal regulations, the maximum time frame is 150 percent of the published program length for degree completion. To qualify for a Bachelor of Science degree, students must com - plete a minimum of 486 units 486 x 150% = 729 maximum attempt - ed units. An \"attempted\" unit is defined as any unit that a student remains enrolled in AFTER the Add Period, including units the student with - draws from each term. Units that a student is retroactively enrolled in after the Add Period are considered attempted units. CLASS LEVEL FOR FINANCIAL AID PURPOSES Undergraduate students are classified according to the number of units earned and the number of terms in residence at Caltech. Both these criteria must be satisfied for class-level eligibility. Students are regarded as freshmen until eligible for sophomore status, and as sophomores, juniors, or seniors if they meet the corresponding criteria set below. Units earned are defined as units completed with a passing grade.Historical Sketch229Classification Minimum Units Earned Minimum Terms in Residence Sophomore 108 3 Junior 216 6 Senior 324 9 PART-TIME ENROLLMENT (UNDERLOADS) The Institute will charge students for a minimum of 12 terms of full-time tuition, or the prorated equivalent based on their classification at the time they begin their enrollment, even if they complete their degree requirements early. Undergraduate students who underload in a term will be charged full-time tuition but their financial aid, including outside scholarships, will be adjusted as indicated below based on the actual number of units students are enrolled in as of Add Day. Students may NOT receive scholarship assistance for any term in which they are not enrolled at least half-time. Underloads and Financial Aid: The Impact of Less than Full-time Enrollment Any student who wishes to carry fewer than 36 units in any given term must petition for an underload. Underloads must be approved by the Dean or Associate Dean of Undergraduate Students. Underloads for graduating seniors must be approved by the Registrar. (See Caltech Catalog, page 212, for the underload policy.) The following information summarizes the impact of less than full- time enrollment on financial aid. See page 208 for the separate condi - tions regarding eligibility to be enrolled less than full-time. 3/4 Time Full-time enrollment is defined in the Caltech Catalog as 36 units. Students enrolling less than full-time, taking between 27 to 35 units, are considered enrolled 3/4 time. The impact to their financial aid is usually a reduction to their grant, in the same amount as the reduction in their tuition. Federal Pell Grant recipients will have their Federal Pell award reduced according to federal regulations. The Financial Aid Office will revise the student's budget to reflect the calculated per-unit tuition and then revise the student's aid (grant eligibility) to reflect the reduction in calculated need. 1/2 Time Half-time enrollment is defined as enrolling in 18 to 26 units. In this situation, the Financial Aid Office will revise the budget for financial aid purposes to reflect the calculated per-unit tuition and reduce the books and supplies allowance to 1/2 of the standard amount for that term. Federal Pell Grant recipients will have their Pell award reduced accord - ing to federal regulations. The Financial Aid Office will revise the stu - dent's budget to reflect the per-unit tuition and other reductions in edu - Financial AidUndergraduate Information230cation related costs and then revise the student's aid (grant eligibility) to reflect the reduction in calculated need. Students enrolled 1/2 time can also anticipate an increase in their work-study award for the term. Less than 1/2 Time Less than 1/2 time enrollment is defined as taking fewer than 18 units. Tuition is revised for financial aid purposes to reflect the calculated per-unit tuition and the books and supplies allowance is reduced to 1/4 of the standard allowance for that term. (As indicated in the Caltech Catalog , the minimum tuition charge is units per term.) The student's aid is revised based on the reduced education related costs. Federal Pell Grant recipients will have their Pell award reduced according to federal regulations. More importantly, the student/family becomes ineligible for scholarship/grant aid awarded by Caltech and for Federal Direct PLUS or Stafford loans for that term. The student will is only eligible for Caltech work-study and loan assistance. Please note: If the student is enrolled less than half time, the grace period on any student loan (Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Direct Stafford Loan and Caltech and Institute loans) will begin. Effect on Outside Scholarships In all of the above categories, the Financial Aid Office also checks to see if a student has an outside scholarship that requires continuous full- time enrollment. If a scholarship donor requires full time enrollment, the Financial Aid Office is required to return the scholarship money for that term to the donor. If this occurs, the student is encouraged to contact the donor directly to review and, possibly, appeal the agency's policy. Questions Students with questions regarding underloads should discuss their individual circumstances with a financial aid administrator. Contact the office Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., with any questions you have.

GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS, ALL OPTIONS To qualify for a Bachelor of Science degree at the Institute, students must obtain passing grades in each of the required courses listed below; must satisfy the additional requirements listed under the undergraduate options; must complete a minimum of 486 units; and must achieve a grade-point average of not less than 1.9. Students must also register for the appropriate number of units that results in normal progress toward a B.S. degree. The baccalaureate degree requires four years (12 terms) of residence regardless of unit load each term or the total units earned. The four-year residence requirement is separate from and in addition to any other degree requirements. Students who are admitted as transfer students or 3/2 students may be granted advanced standing and tuition credit for academic work accepted in transfer to Caltech. However, transfer and 3/2 students must enroll for a minimum of six terms at Caltech. Any exceptions must be approved by the dean of undergraduate students and the vice president for student affairs. Under normal circumstances the core and option requirements for the B.S. degree are those stated in the catalog published in the first year of a student's enrollment at Caltech. Faculty actions or decisions taken through the Faculty Board and the relevant faculty committees may occasionally result in changes to these requirements. In the event of exceptional circumstances, changes in an individual student's grad - uation requirements may be sought by petition to the relevant Faculty Representative(s) through procedures administered by the registrar. Questions should be addressed to the registrar. Students must register for the Institute requirements in the year speci - fied, unless they have previous credit. If for some reason they are not able to complete the requirements during the proper year, they must register at the earliest possible opportunity. (The Curriculum Committee may in unusual cases excuse undergraduate students from any of the following Institute or option requirements upon presentation of petitions.) The Institute unit system is described in the opening paragraphs of section five of this catalog. Graduation RequirementsUndergraduate Information240CORE INSTITUTE REQUIREMENTS, ALL OPTIONS A Caltech education requires not just the depth of an option, but also considerable breadth in basic science, humanities, and social science. Caltech's core curriculum prepares students for the interdisciplinary nature of contemporary research in science and technology. This encourages a culture of problem solving, collaboration, and communication while pro - viding valuable experience in all fields of science. Significant study in the humanities and social sciences is an important component of Caltech's core curriculum, giving alumni the ability to navigate the societal, political, and economic factors that influence, and are influenced by, their work. The following requirements are applicable to incoming freshmen for 2021-22. Some information for continuing students has been provided as footnotes, but guidance on special cases must be sought. Courses used to satisfy core requirements may not be used to satisfy option electives. Courses Units 1. Freshman Mathematics (Ma 1 abc) 27 2. Freshman Physics (Ph 1 abc) 27 3. Freshman Chemistry (Ch 1 ab) 15 4. Freshman Biology (Bi 1 or Bi 1 x)1 9 5. Menu Class (currently Ay 1, EE 1, ESE 1, Ge 1, or IST 4) 9 6. Freshman Chemistry Laboratory (Ch 3 a)2 6 7.

Additional Humanities and Social Sciences Courses 36 12. Physical Education 9 1 The biology core requirement can be met by either Bi 1 or Bi 1x. Alternatively, the requirement may be fulfilled by taking both Bi 8 and Bi 9. Nine units must be taken on grades. 2 This requirement can also be met by completing Ch 3 x, Ch 4 a, Ch 8, or Ch/ChE 9. 3 This requirement may be met either by taking a course approved by the student's option to satisfy this requirement, or by taking En/Wr 84. Menu Classes Menu classes are specifically designed for breadth. The intent of the menu class requirement is to introduce students to a subject that they did not plan to study. In many cases, it is the only class in that subject that they ever take; in other cases, they may decide to take more classes in that subject as a result. Students cannot take a menu class in a subject that they have already taken classes in or in their current option. This require - ment must be completed by the end of sophomore year. Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch241Introductory Laboratory Requirement All students are required to take at least 12 units of laboratory work in experimental science during their freshman and sophomore years. Ch 3 a (6 units) or Ch 3 x (6 units) shall be taken during the freshman year. The additional 6 units must be chosen from one of the following: APh/EE 9 ab (6 units), APh/EE 24 (9 units), Bi 1x (9 units but only if Bi 1x is not being used to satisfy the biology core requirement), Bi 10 (6 units), Ch 4 ab (9 units ), Ch 8 (9 units), Ch/ChE 9 (9 units), EE/ME 7 (6 units), Ge 116 (9 units), ME 8 (6 units), Ph 3 (6 units), Ph 5 (9 units), Ph 8 bc (6 units), or a more advanced laboratory. Computational laboratory courses may not be used to satisfy this requirement. Humanities and Social Sciences Requirements All students must complete satisfactorily 108 units in the Division of the Humanities and Social Sciences. Of these, 36 must be in the humanities (English, history, history and philosophy of science, humanities, music, philosophy, and visual culture) and 36 in the social sciences (anthropology, business economics and management, economics, law, political science, psychology, and social science), in each case divided equally between introductory and advanced courses. The remaining 36 may be drawn from humanities and social sciences, including HSS tutorial courses and 9 units of either Wr 1 or Wr 2. They may not include BEM 102. They may not include reading courses unless credit has been granted by petition to the humanities or social science faculty. Language courses may count toward the additional 36 unit requirement, with the exception of beginning, inter - mediate, and advanced classes in the student's native language. In gener - al, no more than 18 units of freshman humanities may be counted toward the 108-unit requirement. Entering freshmen are required to take two terms of freshman human - ities; that is, cross-listed humanities courses numbered 60 or below in the Catalog . These classes introduce students to the basic issues and methods in the disciplines of English, history, philosophy, and visual cul - ture. Successful completion of two terms of freshman humanities is a prerequisite for all humanities courses, except for foreign languages. It is not a prerequisite, however, for introductory social sciences. The freshman humanities classes may be taken in any two terms of the freshman year. To encourage breadth, students will have to take their two freshman humanities courses in different disciplines, the disciplines being English, history, philosophy, and visual culture. A student must take 18 units of advanced humanities courses as well. The classes that count as advanced humanities courses are those num - bered 90 or above in English, history, history and philosophy of science, humanities, music, philosophy, and visual culture. Language courses do not count toward the advanced humanities requirement, except for courses that are cross-listed or taught concurrently with one of the listed subjects, such as humanities or visual culture. Courses used to fulfill the advanced humanities requirement must be taken for grades. Courses taken on a pass/fail basis will not fulfill the requirement. Since writing is an important method for developing and sharing ideas, all freshman humanities courses and other humanities courses numbered above 90, with the exception of some foreign languages and courses, Graduation RequirementsUndergraduate Information242require at least 4,000 words of composition. Instructors give extensive feedback on written work and help students improve their prose. As enter - ing students may not be fully prepared for the writing in freshman human - ities, all freshmen and transfer students take a writing assessment before the beginning of the fall term. On the basis of this assessment, some students may be required to pass WR 1, 2, 3, 4 and/or 50 before entering either freshman or advanced humanities classes. Students are required to take two introductory social science courses and 18 units of related advanced undergraduate social science courses. Courses used to fulfill the advanced social science requirement must be taken for grades; courses taken on a pass/fail basis will not fulfill the requirement. The introductory social science courses must be drawn from the following list: either An 14 or An 15 or An 16, Ec 11, PS 12, or Psy 13. The 18 units of advanced undergraduate social science courses (num - bered 100 and above), in fields following at least one of their introductory courses, must be taken as indicated here: Introductory Course Following Course An 14, 15 or 16 advanced anthropology Ec 11 advanced economics or BEM (except BEM 102) PS 12 advanced political science Psy 13 advanced psychology For instance, a student who has taken An 14 and Ec 11 may use 18 units of advanced anthropology courses, or 18 units of advanced eco - nomics, or 9 units of advanced anthropology and 9 units of advanced economics to fulfill the advanced social science requirement. Included in the 12 humanities and social science courses, students must take at least 3 writing-intensive courses and these must be taken on grades. The graded advanced humanities courses count towards this total. A student can select another course from advanced human - ities or a social science course with writing content (specifically An/PS 127, Ec 105, Ec 129, Ec 130, Ec 140, PS 99 ab, PS 120, PS 123, or PS 141). These three writing-intensive courses should be spread out over the student's sophomore, junior, and senior years. Physical Education Requirement Before graduation, each undergraduate is required to successfully com - plete 9 units of physical education. This requirement may be satisfied entirely or in part by participation in intercollegiate athletics, or successful completion of physical education class course work. All grades are issued pass/fail. A maximum of 6 units per term may be applied toward gradua - tion requirements, with the total not to exceed 36 units. Participation as a bona fide member of an intercollegiate team for the period covered by the sport in a given term satisfies the requirement for that term. A broad program of instruction is provided each term. Late regis - tration is permitted during the first week of each term, provided there is space available and with permission of the instructor. Standards for Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch243evaluation of student performance will be clearly defined at the begin - ning of each course. Scientific Writing Requirement The scientific writing requirement can be satisfied by taking an appropriate course offered by any division, or by taking En/Wr 84. The course used to satisfy this requirement must be taken on grades. All options also require a three-unit course in oral communication. Some options combine these two requirements into one course. At the discretion of the option, the scientific writing requirement can be satisfied by three units of additional work associated with a senior thesis, focused on effective written scientific communication.

If a student chooses no electives except physical education and takes the minimum permissible labora - tory courses, the total unit requirement will usually be in the range of 39 to 45. First- and second-term freshmen will be limited to 45 units of classroom and laboratory courses. A total load\u2014including electives\u2014of more than 48 units per term is considered a heavy load. Loads of more than 51 units require approval by the dean of students. 1 This course is offered in each of the three terms. Students may also take Ch 3 x. 2 The additional 6 units must be chosen from one of the following: APh/EE 9 ab (6 units), APh/ EE 24 (9 units), Bi 10 (6 units), Ch 4 ab (9 units), Ch 8 (9 units), Ch/ChE 9 (9 units), EE/ME 7 (6 units), Ge 116 (9 units), ME 8 (6 units), Ph 3 (6 units), Ph 5 (9 units), Ph 8 bc (6 units) or a more advanced laboratory course. 3 Students must take a menu course in their freshman or sophomore year. These courses are offered third quarter only. It is also possible to take one of these courses as an elective. Menu courses currently include Ay 1, EE 1, ESE 1, Ge 1, or IST 4. 4 Three terms (9 units) of PE are required for the B.S. degree. Students need not elect to take the required PE in the freshman year. It may be taken in any three terms before graduation. OTHER FIRST-YEAR COURSES In addition to the required core classes described on the previous pages, freshmen are encouraged to participate in freshman seminar classes, frontier classes, research tutorials and other research oppor - tunities. Starting in the 2011-12 academic year, Caltech began offering a series of freshman seminars in which 10 to 15 freshmen and a faculty member explore in depth an exciting topic in the lab, around a table, or in the field. These courses cover a wide range of topics, including earthquakes, gravitational waves, and the science of music. Instructors may allow upperclassmen to enroll in these seminars after the conclu - sion of the pre-registration period for the upcoming term. See section on Freshmen Seminars for more information. Caltech also offers a series of \"frontier courses\" that involve a week - ly presentation by a faculty member on a topic of current research. These courses often meet at lunch time and serve pizza; hence, stu - Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch245dents refer to the courses as \"pizza courses.\" The frontier courses are an opportunity for students to meet the Caltech faculty and to hear about state-of-the-art research projects for the summer or academic year. There are a total of 10 frontier courses offered for freshmen in biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, geology and planetary sci - ences, engineering, computer science, chemical engineering, bioengi - neering, and electrical engineering. Currently there are three \"research tutorials\" for freshmen: one in physics, one in biology, and one in chemistry. These tutorials have many of the same features as the freshman seminars. In physics, the research tutorial includes approximately seven freshmen and extends over three academic terms plus the summer. The purpose is to demonstrate how research opportunities arise, are evaluated, and are tested, and how the ideas that survive develop in larger projects. In biology and chemistry, the tutorials are offered in the winter and spring quarters and involve small group discussions on special areas or problems in biology, bio - technology, and chemistry. More than 80 percent of Caltech students participate in research at some point in their academic career. Students may embark on research activities by registering for research credits with a faculty member, by working in a laboratory for pay during the summer or academic year, by completing a senior thesis, or by participating in Caltech's Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program. The SURF pro - gram is described on page 11. AEROSPACE MINOR (A e) The aerospace minor is intended to supplement one of Caltech's under - graduate degrees and is designed for students who wish to broaden their knowledge beyond their normal major or who may wish to pursue a graduate program involving aerospace or aeronautical engineering. Students completing the aerospace minor requirements will have the phrase \"minor in aerospace engineering\" added to their transcripts. Ae Minor Requirements 1. Complete Ae 105 abc. 2. Complete a second three-term 100-level Ae class, chosen from Ae 101 abc, 102 abc, 104 abc, 121 abc, Ae/Ge/ME 160 ab, or 27 units of selected Ae courses approved by the minor advis - er. All Ae courses to be applied to fulfill the aerospace minor requirements must be taken for grades, and students must maintain an average grade of B or higher for all courses with no individual grade lower than a C. Courses that are used to satisfy the aerospace minor cannot be used to satisfy course requirements in the major options. Courses taken as part of the aerospace minor are counted toward the total 486-unit Institute graduation requirements. A typical course sequence would be to take Ae 105 abc and the second Ae course in the senior year. Graduation RequirementsUndergraduate Information246APPLIED AND COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS (ACM) The undergraduate option in applied and computational mathematics with - in the Computing & Mathematical Sciences department seeks to address the interests of those students who want to combine their basic studies in mathematics with considerable involvement in applications. This program is designed to give students a thorough training in fundamental compu - tational and applied mathematics and to develop their research ability in a specific application field. The fields of application include a wide range of areas such as fluid mechanics, materials science, and mathematical biology, engineering applications, image processing, and mathematical finance. The training essential for future careers in applied mathematics in academia, national laboratories, or in industry is provided, especially when combined with graduate work, by successful completion of the require - ments for an undergraduate degree in applied and computational mathe - matics. Complete programs will be worked out with faculty advisers. ACM Double Majors Students interested in simultaneously pursuing a degree in a second option must fulfill all the requirements of the ACM option. Classes can - not be counted towards both options unless specifically required by both. To enroll in the program, the student should meet and discuss their plans with the option representative. In general, approval is contin - gent on good academic performance by the student and demonstrated ability for handling the heavier course load. ACM Option Requirements 1.

The option representative and/or undergraduate adviser will gladly assist students in choosing appropriate elective courses. Students ultimately interested in pursuing an advanced degree in applied physics or related fields are encouraged to complete a senior thesis project through APh 78 or APh 79. ASTROPHYSICS OPTION AND MINOR (A y) With the goal of understanding the physical processes that govern the universe, its constituents, and their origins and evolution, astronomy uses the apparatus and methodology of physics to gather and interpret data. Theoretical work and technology development round out astrophysics. In what follows, we use the terms \"astronomy\" and \"astrophysics\" inter - changeably. The astrophysics option is designed to give the student an understanding of the basic facts and concepts of astronomy today, to stimulate their interest in research, and to provide a basis for graduate work in astronomy/astrophysics. Undergraduate Information Students petitioning to double-major in Astrophysics and Physics must present a plan that has a minimum of 92 units that are solely counted as satisfying the Ay requirements, and a minimum of 92 units that are solely counted as satisfying the Ph requirements. Attention is called to the fact that any student whose grade-point average is less than 1.9 at the end of an academic year in the subjects listed in the Division of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy may, at the discretion of their department, be refused permission to continue the work in this option. Ay Option Requirements 1. Ay 20, 21, 101, 102, 30 or one term of Ay 141, Ay 31, Ma 2, Ma 3, Ph 2 abc or Ph 12 abc, Ph 125 ab, and Ph 106 abc. 2. Any three of Ph 3, Ph 5, Ph 6, Ph 7, or Ay 105. APh 23 and 24 taken as a pair may be substituted for one of these labs. 3. 63 additional units of Ay or Ph courses. Ph 127 a, Ph 136 bc and one of Ph 21, Ph 22, Ph 121 abc are strongly recommended. Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch2514. 27 additional units of science or engineering electives, of which 18 must be outside the Division of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy. ACM 95 ab is a popular choice. Core classes ( see pages 240-244) or other introductory-level courses such as CS 1 do not count toward fulfillment of this requirement. 5. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including the courses listed above. Courses satisfying requirements 1, 2, and 3 must be taken for grades unless they are pass/fail only.

Other courses may also be used. 3 Strongly recommended courses for Option Requirement 3. Other courses may be substituted. 4 Phys 125c is strongly recommended and can be counted towards Option Requirement 3. The sequence Ay 20, 21 constitutes a solid introduction to modern astrophysics, with more advanced courses (Ay 101, 102, plus Ay elec - tives) taken in the junior and senior years. The course schedule above is an example leading to excellent preparation for graduate study, but it is also possible to fulfill the option requirements with a more diverse set of electives across options, and even to take Ay 20, 21 junior year and Ay 101, 102 senior year. In either scenario, it is desirable for a student to gain as broad a background as possible in related fields of science and engi - neering. An ability to present one's work is vital to a successful career in any field. The oral communications requirement can be satisfied by presenting during a term of Ay 141, or with Ay 30. Ay 31 satisfies the written communication requirement. Students are encouraged (but not required) to undertake research leading to a senior thesis; credit for this work is provided through Ay 78. Non-thesis research credits may be earned through Ay 142 with a maximum of 9 units per term. Elective credit can be given for no more than 3 terms of Ay 142. Computational skills may be acquired through Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch253e.g. ACM 11, ACM 106, CS 2, CS 11, CS 21, CS 38, CS 121, CMS 155, Ph 20, Ph 21, Ph 121. Students are strongly advised to take advanced mathematical meth - ods in ACM95 and Ph 129, and an advanced statistical physics or ther - modynamics course such as Ph 127. Suggested Electives The student may elect any course offered in any division in a given term, provided that they have has the necessary prerequisites for that course. The following courses are useful to work in various fields of astronomy and astrophysics: ACM 95, ACM 106, APh 17, APh/EE 23/24, APh/EE 117, Ay 104, Ay 105, Ay 107, Ay 117, Ay 121-127, Ch 125 ab, EE 45, EE/Ae 157, Ge/Ay 11 c, Ge 103, Ge/Ch 128, Ge 131, Ge/Ay 132, 133, 137, Ge 141, Ma 4, Ma 112, ME 11, ME 12, Ph 20-22, Ph 77, 101, 121, 127, 129, 136, 137, 199, 236 (this is not necessarily a complete list). Ay Option Minor The Ay minor is expected to appeal to student interest in the field of astronomy that arises from overlap, not only with the most traditional area of physics, but with more recent and rapidly developing intersec - tions of astronomy with e.g. computer science, certain aspects of engi - neering, chemistry, planetary science, and perhaps some day biology. Ay minor coursework is designed to prepare the capable student to undertake cross-disciplinary research involving astronomy. A firm basis for this is established with sophomore level physics and astronomy requirements. Junior year courses sample from among the Ay major requirements and electives. Both traditional theory courses and more hands-on practical training courses are available, with one course of each type recommended for breadth. Senior year features research and written presentation of the research, with additional electives encour - aged. Courses taken in the minor option must be taken for grades (no P/F), except for Ay 142 which is offered as P/F only. Courses 100 and above can not be used to also satisfy requirements in the student's major option. Ay Option Minor Requirements 1. Basis in physics: either Ph 2ab or Ph12 ab (18 units) 2. Introductory Astronomy: any two of Ge/Ay 11c, Ay 20, or Ay 21 (18 units) 3. In-depth Astrophysics, Instrumentation, and Data: any two of: Ay 101, Ay 102, Ay 104, Ge/Ay 133, Ay 105, Ay/Ge 107, Ay 122 (18 units) 4. Research: both Ay 142 (9 units) and Ay 144 (3 units) = (12 units) Total units required: 66 Other courses of interest to students seeking Ay minor competency include Ay 119, Ay 198, Ay 141, Ph 2c/12c, Ph 101, EE 40, APh/EE 23. These do not contribute to credit for the minor, however. Course selection should be done in consultation with the Ay option Graduation RequirementsUndergraduate Information254representative, who can advise on an appropriate curriculum for a given student's goals. As a complement to the required Ay 142 enrollment, SURF research with the relevant Ay, Ph, or Pl.Sc. faculty member is encouraged. BIOENGINEERING OPTION (BE) BE Aims and Scope The undergraduate bioengineering option provides a foundation for graduate studies and career paths that require the application of engi - neering principles to the design, analysis, construction, and manipula - tion of biological systems, and in the discovery and application of new engineering principles inspired by the properties of biological systems. By graduation, students are expected to have learned basic laborato - ry and engineering methods used in a broad range of bioengineering sub-disciplines. Students will also have learned quantitative and analytic skills vital to experiments and system designs. Graduating students are expected to be able to critically evaluate and understand bioengineering literature, and be able to work in a team and communicate effectively. To accomplish these goals, students are expected to complete a series of required courses designed to introduce them to a representative range of bioengineering sub-disciplines, provide them with a solid quan - titative analysis foundation, and provide them with opportunities to work in teams through a number of project-oriented courses. Students will receive instruction in scientific communications through Bi/BE 24. Undergraduate research is encouraged both during the academic year and through participation in summer research programs. Students should present a plan for satisfying all degree requirements to their academic adviser by the end of the third term of the second year. Students with a grade-point average lower than 1.9 will not be allowed to continue in the option except with special permission from the option representative. BE Option Requirements 1.

Students are strongly encouraged to enroll in Bi 1x as freshmen; Bi 1x must be com - pleted by the sophomore year. Nine total units of BE 98 and BE 99 may be used in place of one of these courses (except Bi 1x) with the approval of the undergraduate option representative to ensure that the student's research project provides comparable experimental laboratory experience. BE 98 and BE 99 units used to satisfy this requirement may not also be counted toward the elective requirement. 3. Biology, chemistry, and physics: two terms out of three from Ph 2 abc (Ch 21 a may be used in place of Ph 2 b and Ch 21 c may be used in place of Ph 2 c); Bi 8; Bi 9; BE 25; Ch 41 a; Ch/Bi 110.

The option serves as a basis for graduate study in any field of biology or for admission to the study of medicine. Instruction is offered in the form of participation in the ongoing research programs of the division, as well as in formal course work. Course work emphasizes the more general and fundamental properties of living organisms, and areas of current research interest, rather than the traditional distinct fields with - in the life sciences. The division encourages undergraduate participation in its research program and believes that research participation should be a part of each student's program of study. Students may elect to prepare an undergraduate thesis (Bi 90). Research opportunities may be arranged with individual faculty members, or guidance may be obtained from a student's individual faculty adviser in the division or from the biology undergraduate student adviser. Graduation RequirementsUndergraduate Information258The requirements listed below for the biology option are minimal requirements. An adequate preparation for graduate work in biology will normally include additional elective research or course work in biology and/or advanced course work in other sciences or in mathematics. Flexibility to accommodate varied individual scientific interests, within the broad scope of biology, is achieved through the provision of elective courses, arrangements for individual research (Bi 22), and tutorial instruc - tion (Bi 23). In addition, arrangements may be made to take courses at neighboring institutions in fields of biology that are not represented in our curriculum. Premedical Program The undergraduate course for premedical students is essentially the same as that for biology students and is intended as a basis for later careers in research as well as in the practice of medicine. It differs in some respects from premedical curricula of other schools; however, it has been quite generally accepted as satisfying admission require - ments of medical schools. It is recommended that all students contemplating application to med - ical school consult with the premed adviser at Careers, Advising, and Experiential Learning or Professor David Chan in the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering. Bi Option Requirements The following required courses must all be taken on grades, with the exception of Bi 8 if taken in freshman year and Bi 22. Freshmen taking Bi 8 must maintain shadow grades that indicate satisfactory progress. 1. Bi 8, Bi 9, Bi 117, Bi 122, NB/Bi/CNS 150, and Ch 41 abc. 2. Ma 2, Ma 3, and any two terms of Ph 2 abc. This requirement can also be satisfied in part by successfully taking a \"reason - able\" replacement for any of these required courses. A \"rea - sonable\" replacement will be defined by: (1) Equally or more advanced quantitative coursework, e.g. Ch 21 a for Ph 2 b, Ch 21 c for Ph 2 c and; (2) Essentially similar scope of subject mat - ter as the course replaced, e.g. BE 25 for Ph 2 c. The Biology option representative will be empowered to make this determi - nation with aid of an advisory list which can be updated as rele - vant new courses are developed inside and outside of biology. 3. One advanced laboratory course (100- or 200-level), or Bi 21 with presentation, or three terms of undergraduate thesis (Bi 90 abc). 4. Two courses chosen from Ch/BI 110, 111, and/or BMB/Bi/Ch 170, 173 or Ch 145. 5. Scientific writing requirement met by taking Bi/BE 24 (six units), or by taking any other writing course such as En/Wr 84 (nine units) plus oral presentation at SURF Seminar Day or equivalent, with option representative approval. 6. A minimum of 8 courses of biology electives must be taken. To count as a biology elective, a course must satisfy the following: a. The course is not used to satisfy requirement 1-5. b. 100-level or above. c. The course must be a biology or a bioengineering course. d. At least two elective courses must be nine units each, and - must be taken for grades. Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch2597. e. A minimum total of four elective courses must be taken for grades. 8. Exceptions are as follow: a. Substantial lab research for credit (Bi 22) beyond the 12- unit minimum can be counted among the electives. b. Courses from other options with significant relevance to biology may be used as electives with permission from the biology option representative. 9. A minimum total of 170 units of biology must be taken and passed. Bi 1, Bi 2, Bi 10, and BE/Bi/CNS/NB 197 cannot be counted toward this total. Bioengineering courses used for elec - tives can be counted toward this total. 10. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including the courses listed above. Planning the Biology Course Schedule Most students interested in biology elect to take Bi8 and Bi9 in their first year, to open access to the widest range of biology electives. Bi 10 or Bi1x is not required for the biology option but is commonly taken by biology students to meet the Institute introductory labora - tory requirement. Prerequisites listed for individual biology courses are advisory, not compulsory. They indicate the kind of background that is assumed for the work level of the course. They may be waived if the instruc - tor gives explicit permission. BE 25 is strongly recommended for students interested in post - graduate work in biology, as physical chemistry is required by most graduate programs. Additional courses of potential interest to biology majors include Ge 11 b, BE 159, BE/APh 161, BE/ChE 163, BMB/Ch 178 and advanced geobiology courses. Undergraduates are generally welcome to take 200-level courses with the instructor's permission or strong preparation, unless other - wise indicated.

It is designed for students who wish to broaden their studies beyond their major to include biology. Students completing the biology minor requirements will have the phrase \"minor in biology\" added to their transcripts. 1. Biology fundamentals. Bi 8 and Bi 9. 2. Intermediate Biology. Any two of the following classes: Bi 122; Bi 117; and NB/Bi/CNS 150; and Ch 41 a. Advanced Biology. 36 units of advanced biology electives (100- or 200-level) that are not applied to the above requirements and are not simultaneously used for fulfilling a requirement of the student's major option, approved by their assigned biology adviser or the option repre - sentative. Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch263BUSINESS, ECONOMICS, AND MANAGEMENT OPTION (BEM) The goal of the business, economics, and management (BEM) option is to provide students with the analytical tools to operate successfully in a modern business environment and to prepare students interested in pursuing graduate studies in related fields. The emphasis is on entre - preneurship, finance, and strategy, in free-market, competitive, and stra - tegic situations. Today's business environment is complex, and therefore required courses in this option are highly analytical. Students often pair the BEM option as a double major with a science or engineering option. The BEM option also serves as a standalone major for students interested in careers in the financial industry, consulting, or entrepreneurial ventures. Expected learning outcomes from completing the BEM option include: a strong background in economic theory and econometrics; an understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects of finance, risk management, business strategy, and developing new ventures; an ability to analyze business problems using qualitative and quantitative methods; an ability to analyze financial and business data; an ability to write and communicate effectively; and an understanding of the broader impacts of business and man- agement on society in general. Note: The official source on requirements for graduation is the Caltech catalog from the year in which a student began studies at Caltech. Please see the catalog online, from this and previous years, for infor - mation regarding the applicable option requirements. BEM Option Requirements It is highly recommended to take a statistics/econometrics course, as well as BEM 102 and BEM 103 before other BEM courses. 1. Ec 11, Ec 122, Ma 3 or ACM/EE/IDS 116, and PS/Ec 172. 2. BEM 102 and BEM 103. 3. Three courses out of BEM 104, BEM 105, BEM 110, or BEM 117. 4. Writing/oral presentation courses: a scientific writing requirement course, and a three-unit course in oral communication, offered by any division (some options combine these two requirements into one course, that can be taken to satisfy this requirement), or En/Wr 84. The course used to satisfy this requirement must be taken on grades. 5. Five courses, to be chosen from the menu (may be taken pass/ fail): any BEM courses (excluding the ones listed under 1 and 2 above), ACM 113, ACM/EE/IDS 116 (if not taken under require - ment 1), An/PS 127, CS/Ec 149, Ec/ACM/CS 112, Ec 105, 121 ab, 129, 130, 135, Ec/PS 160 abc, Ge/ESE 118, Ma 112a and Ma/ACM/IDS 140ab.

This is accomplished through a mixture of interdisciplinary classes that expose students to almost every field of science (chemistry, physics, mathematics, and biology). The inherently computational nature of chemical engineering shines through courses' active use ofcomputational software such as Python, Matlab, and Mathematica for modelling and data analysis. At the same time, classes and independent projects also focus on systematic analysis and problem solving, incorporating social, economic, environmental, and of course, technical constraints to tackle the open-ended challenges of today and tomorrow with new and creative solutions. The option's curriculum begins in students' second year and contin - ues through their third year with fundamental studies in mass transfer, thermodynamics, reactor design, and chemical kinetics. Upon building a common, foundational toolkit, chemical engineers then specialize in one of five different tracks: (biomolecular, sustainability, process, materials, or computational) to advance studies in specific realms of chemical engi - neering. The option also offers exposure to design elements through three distinct lab courses that entail hands-on, open-ended projects relevant to current research so students can innovatively apply chemical engineering concepts. In their fourth year, students can also pursue a senior thesis to explore research topics under the mentorship of a chemical engineering professor and gain experience in proposing a research plan, applying rel - evant lab techniques, and presenting results through an oral presentation and a written thesis. More information on the option requirements and individual tracks can be found on: https://www.cce.caltech.edu/under - graduate/undergraduate-chemical-engineering . The option's breadth enables its students to take on a wide variety of fields upon graduation, such as the manufacturing of both organic products (polymers, films, hydrocarbon fuels, and pharmaceuticals) and inorganic products (semiconductors and ceramics), as well as the develop - ment of sustainabletechnologies (energy efficiency, pollution management, climate mitigation, biofuels) and novel biotechnologies (enzyme engineer - ing, cell culturing, foodmanufacturing), in both industrial, consulting, and academic settings. Freshmen normally take the core courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology (Ma 1 abc, Ph 1 abc, Ch1 ab, and Bi 1), as well as general chemistry laboratory (Ch3a [or Ch 3x]). Graduation RequirementsUndergraduate Information266Sophomores take ordinary differential equations (Ma 2), wave physics (Ph 2a), and organic chemistry laboratory (Ch/ChE 9). They also take the second-year organic chemistry course Ch 41 abc, and the basic chemical engineering courses (ChE 15, ChE 62, and ChE 63 ab). The third-year applied and computational mathematics course (ACM 95 ab) may be taken in the junior or sophomore years. Undergraduate research is emphasized, and students are encouraged, even in the freshman year, to participate in research with the faculty. In order to obtain a basic intellectual background, all students take courses in the fundamentals of chemical engineering through the junior year. During the junior and senior years, students diversify into one of five tracks (bio - molecular, environmental, materials, process systems or computational), where they pursue concentrated study in their chosen area of chemical engineering. An optional senior thesis provides an opportunity to pursue independent research and design in lieu of one of the senior laboratories. Attention is called to the fact that any student whose gradepoint aver - age is less than 1.9 at the end of an academic year in the subjects listed under the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering may, at the discretion of the faculty in this division, be refused permission to continue the work in this option. ChE Option Requirements 1.

CHEMISTRY OPTION AND MINOR (C h) The objective of the undergraduate option in chemistry is to produce graduates articulate in the fundamental concepts of the molecular sci - ences through a combination of coursework and laboratory experienc - es. The chemistry program at Caltech provides depth in the traditional areas of chemistry\u2014organic and inorganic chemistry, chemical physics, theoretical chemistry, chemical biology, and biochemistry. Breadth in the program is found within the advanced coursework offerings and the specialized interests of the faculty, which may include topics such as: chemical synthesis and catalysis, chemical dynamics and reaction mechanisms, biochemistry, bioinorganic, bioorganic, and biophysical chemistry, and materials chemistry. Chemical research at Caltech is highly interdisciplinary, reflecting the increasing importance of molec - ular understanding to many fields of science. Major initiatives are fos - tering broad collaborations in energy and environment, molecular med - icine, and nanomaterials. The outcome of the undergraduate program in chemistry is to prepare students for advanced graduate study and ultimately careers in teaching and research at colleges and universities, in research for government and industry, in the operation and control of Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch269manufacturing processes, and in management and development posi - tions in the chemical industry. A first-year general chemistry course is taken by all freshman students. The emphasis is on fundamental principles and their use in systematizing descriptive chemistry. Ch 1 ab must be passed to satisfy the Institute chemistry requirement. The student's qualifications for placing out of Ch 1 ab will only be determined by the performance on a placement examina - tion to be administered in the summer prior to registration. The one-term required laboratory course (Ch 3 a or 3 x) presents basic principles and techniques of synthesis and analysis and develops the laboratory skills and precision that are fundamental to experimental chemistry. Qualified students, with the consent of the instructor and the option representa - tive, are allowed to substitute either Ch 4 a, Ch 8, or Ch/ChE 9 for the core requirement of Ch 3 a. Freshmen intending to major in chemistry are encouraged to take Ch 10 abc, which provides an introduction to research activities and opportunities in chemistry for undergraduates. Beyond the freshman year, each student in the chemistry option, in consultation with their adviser, selects a suitable course of study under the supervision of the division. The requirements of the option are listed below. A student wishing to deviate from these requirements should submit an alternate curriculum, with justifications, for consideration by their adviser and the Chemistry Curriculum and Undergraduate Studies Committee. The chemistry option representative should be consulted for the future sched - uling of courses not offered during the current academic year. Undergraduates in the option must also take chemistry courses below the 100 level for a letter grade with the exception of the following courses, which are only offered on a pass/fail basis: Ch 1, Ch 3 a, Ch 90, and, if taken during the first or second terms of the freshman year, Ch 4 ab, Ch 21 ab, and Ch 41 ab. Ch Senior Thesis Students attempting a senior thesis in the chemistry option must complete the following requirements. 1. Three terms (27 units) of Ch 82 are to be completed during the junior and/or senior year of study; continued work from research experiences prior to the commencement of the senior thesis is encouraged. 2. At the time of registering for the first term of Ch 82, the candi - date will submit a short (five- page ) proposal delineating their project for approval by the research mentor and the Chemistry Curriculum and Undergraduate Studies Committee (CUSC). 3. The candidate will present a short progress report (maximum of five pages) at the end of each of the first two terms of Ch 82, describing the current status of the research work and any results obtained. Upon evidence of satisfactory effort, the stu - dent will be allowed to continue their senior thesis. 4. A thesis of approximately 20 pages (excluding figures and ref - erences) will be presented to the mentor and the CUSC at the end of the third term of Ch 82. An oral thesis defense will be arranged by the CUSC. The thesis must be approved by both the research mentor and the CUSC. Graduation RequirementsUndergraduate Information2705. Upon approval by the research mentor and the CUSC, the Ch 91 requirement for graduation may be satisfied by the written thesis and the progress reports from the first two quarters of Ch 82. If the thesis is being completed during the spring quarter of the senior year, a draft of the thesis is to be submitted by Add Day. Ch Double Majors For students simultaneously pursuing a degree in a second option, cours - es taken as required courses for that option can also be counted as chem - istry electives (requirement 3, below) where appropriate. However, courses that count toward the electives requirement in the other option cannot simultaneously be counted toward satisfying the elective requirement in chemistry. The courses listed below would constitute a common core for many students in the option. Any student of the chemistry option whose grade-point average is less than 1.9 will be admitted to the option for the following year only with the special permission of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. Ch Option Requirements 1. Ch 14, Ch or Ch 41abc, Ch 90, Ma 2, and Ph 2a. Ma 3 is recommended but not required. Students may make the following substitutions: For Ch14 12c, ChE/Ch 164 or Ph 127a). 100-level courses used in sub - stitution for these option requirements may not also be counted towards the five terms of advanced electives. 2. A minimum of five terms of laboratory work chosen from Ch 4ab, Ch One non-chemistry laboratory course may be used, chosen from MS 90, Ph 6 and Ph 7. One term of research, either 10 c (if taken freshman or sophomore year) or one term of Ch 82 (Senior Thesis), if taken for grades as the third and final term, may count for one of the five electives. 3. A minimum of five terms of advanced chemistry electives (which must total at least 45 units) taken for a letter grade from chemistry course offerings at the 100 and 200 level, includ - ing cross-listed offerings, but excluding Ch 180 and Ch 280. Students may petition to substitute up to but no more than one 100-level elective from another option, if the substituted course has substantial chemistry content. Ch 101 cannot be used to meet the five term requirement but can be used to meet the 45 unit requirement for advanced electives. 4. Passing grades must be earned in the courses that constitute the approved program of study, including those listed above. None of the courses satisfying option requirements may be taken pass/fail. The chemistry option strongly encourages students to engage in academic year research, and up to 27 units each of Ch 80 and Ch 82 can count toward the 486-unit requirement.

Several represen - tative programs, including sets of possible electives, are shown below. These may well approximate choices by students who intend to do graduate work in conventional areas of chemistry.

It is designed for students who wish to broad - en their studies beyond their major to include chemistry. Students Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch273completing the chemistry minor requirements will have the phrase \"minor in chemistry\" added to their transcripts. 1. 18 units of organic chemistry, taken from Ch 41 abc. 2. 18 units of physical chemistry, taken from Ch 21 abc (or substi - tute as specified for the major). 3. 27 units of advanced chemistry electives numbered Ch 102 or above, approved by their designated chemistry adviser or the option representative. 4. 9 or more units of a chemistry laboratory course from Ch4ab, Ch 5 ab, Ch 6 ab, Ch7 or Ch15. No substitutions are allowed. All courses to be applied to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for grades. Courses taken as part of the chemistry minor are counted toward the total 486 units needed for Institute graduation requirements. To enroll in the program, the student should meet and discuss their plans with the option representative. In general, approv - al is contingent on good academic performance by the student and demonstrated ability for handling the heavier course load. Courses that are used to satisfy the Chemistry minor requirements cannot be used to satisfy course requirements in another major. COMPUTATION AND NEURAL SYSTEMS OPTION (CNS) Aims and Scope The undergraduate CNS option provides a foundation in math, physics, biology and computer science to prepare students for interdisciplinary graduate studies in neuroscience and career paths that involve compu - tational applications inspired by properties of biological systems, such as artificial intelligence and computer vision. By graduation, students will have acquired knowledge in neurobiology, computation principles across differ - ent systems, methods used in modern neuroscience research, as well as the ability to critically evaluate and understand neuroscience literature, and be able to work in a team and communicate effectively. To accomplish these goals, students are expected to complete a series of math and physics courses to establish solid quantitative skills. Then, they are expected to take two groups of courses, of which one has a biology focus, while the other has a CS focus. Through these courses, students are exposed to different sub-disciplines of neuroscience while also acquiring the quantitative skills needed in graduate research and industry jobs. Students will receive instruction in scientific communications through SEC 10 and SEC 11, SEC 12, SEC 13, or Bi/BE 24.

The option introduces students to the mathematical and engineer - ing foundations of the discipline. It provides considerable flexibility in course selection, together with a capstone project giving an opportu - nity for independent work in an area of the student's choice. Individual programs will be worked out in consultation with faculty advisers (the materials at cms.caltech.edu/academics/ugrad_cs may be helpful for this purpose). Any student in the computer science option whose grade-point average is less than 1.9 at the end of the academic year in the subjects listed in the option requirements may be refused permission to contin - ue work in the option. CS Double Majors Students interested in simultaneously pursuing a degree in a second option must fulfill all the requirements of the computer science option. Specific courses that are explicitly required by both options only need to be taken once. For example, if both options require CS 38, then it can count for both. However, elective courses cannot be double count - ed. For example, requirement 4 must be fulfilled using courses that are not simultaneously used for fulfilling a requirement of the second option. To enroll in the program, the student should meet and discuss their plans with the option representative. In general, approval is contin - gent on good academic performance by the student and demonstrated ability for handling the heavier course load. CS Option Requirements 1. CS fundamentals. CS 1 or CS 1X; CS 2; CS 3; CS 4. 2. Intermediate CS. CS 21; CS 24; CS 38. 3. CS Project Sequence. One of the following: a. An undergraduate thesis (CS 80abc) supervised by a CS faculty member. b.

CS Minor The computer science minor is intended to supplement one of Caltech's undergraduate degrees and is designed for students who wish to broaden their knowledge beyond their normal major or who may wish to pursue a graduate program involving computer science. Students completing the computer science minor requirements will have the phrase \"minor in computer science\" added to their transcripts. CS Minor Requirements 1. CS fundamentals. CS 1 or CS 1X; CS 2; CS 3. 2. Mathematical fundamentals. Ma 2; Ma 3; Ma/CS 6a or Ma 121a. 3. Intermediate CS. CS 21; CS 24; CS 38. 4. Advanced CS. 9 CS units numbered 114 or above that are not Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch279applied to the above requirements and are not simultaneously used for fulfilling a requirement of the student's major option. Pass/fail grading cannot be elected for courses taken to satisfy option requirements. Courses taken as part of the computer science minor are counted toward the total 486 units needed for Institute graduation requirements. To enroll in the program, the student should meet and discuss their plans with the option representative. In general, approval is contingent on good aca - demic performance by the student and demonstrated ability for handling the heavier course load. CONTROL AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS MINOR Control and dynamical systems (CDS) may be pursued as a minor con - centration by undergraduates who are taking degrees in science, math - ematics, or engineering. The CDS minor is intended to supplement one of Caltech's normal undergraduate degrees and is designed for stu - dents who wish to broaden their knowledge beyond their normal major or who may wish to pursue a graduate program involving control or dynamical systems. Students completing the minor requirements below in CDS will have the phrase \"minor in control and dynamical systems\" added to their transcripts and their graduating degree materials. CDS Minor Requirements Complete CDS 110 or CDS 131 and CDS 231 or CDS 232 Complete nine additional units in CDS courses, chosen from CDS 110, CDS 112, CDS 131, CDS 141, CDS 232, CDS 233, CDS 242, CDS 243, CDS 244. Complete a three-term senior thesis approved by the CDS fac - ulty. All CDS courses to be applied to fulfill the CDS minor requirements must be taken for grades, and students must obtain a grade of B or higher. The senior thesis requirement may be satisfied by completing a three-term senior thesis in the student's major option but on CDS subject matter, with the approval of the thesis topic by the CDS option representative, or by taking CDS 90 abc. Courses that are used to satisfy the CDS minor cannot be used to satisfy course requirements in the major options, with the exception that CDS 110 may be used in EAS options where this is part of their requirements (e.g., ChE, EE, ME) and the senior thesis requirement may be used to satisfy requirements for major options that require a senior thesis. Courses taken as part of the CDS minor are counted toward the total 486 units needed for Institute graduation requirements. A typical course sequence would be to take either CDS 110 or CDS 232 in the junior year, followed by the remaining courses and the senior thesis in the senior year. Alternatively, it is possible to take all require - ments in the senior year. In addition to the requirements above, CS 1 and CS 2 are highly recommended. Graduation RequirementsUndergraduate Information280ECONOMICS OPTION (E c) The economics option provides students with an understanding of the basic principles underlying the functioning of economic institutions. It offers a modern quantitative approach seldom available at the under - graduate level. The emphasis on economic principles and modern methodology provides students with an excellent preparation for gradu - ate study in economics, as well as for professional work in the fields of business, law, economics, and government. The option is sufficiently flexible so that students can combine their pursuit of economics with studies in engineering, mathematics, or science. The core of the option consists of an economic theory component, a data analysis component, an applied microeconomic component, and a macroeconomic/growth component. Students are strongly encouraged t supplement this core with additional electives in economics, political science, and mathematics. Expected learning outcomes from completing the economics option include: a proficiency in applying economic models to understand eco - nomic institutions; a proficiency in analyzing field and experimental data to prove causal relationships between economic variables, to test eco - nomic theories, and to predict economic outcomes; an understanding of the causes of regional and global long-term economic growth as well as the causes and consequences of economic crises throughout history; an understanding of the role of market prices in allocating resources and affecting the distribution of wealth; an appreciation of strategic behavior and asymmetric informa - tion in economic and social interactions; and an appreciation of the role of technological change and politics in shaping economic policies. Note: The official source on requirements for graduation is the Caltech catalog from the year in which a student began studies at Caltech. Please see the catalog online, from this and previous years, for infor - mation regarding the applicable option requirements. Ec Option Requirements 1. Ec 11. 2. Theory: Ec 121 ab and PS/Ec 172. 3. Data analysis: Ec 122. 4. Applied microeconomics: one of Ec 105 or Ec 135. 5. Macroeconomics and growth: one of Ec 129, 130, or Ec 140. 6. Ma 3. 7. 45 additional units of advanced economics and social science courses. (Courses that are used to fulfill the Institute advanced social science requirement [courses numbered 100 and above] will also count toward this requirement.) Students may also take class - es from the following list in partial fulfillment of this requirement: any BEM course except BEM 102; ACM 113 and ACM/EE/IDS 116. 8. 45 additional units of advanced science, social science, math - ematics, and engineering courses. The requirement cannot be Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch281satisfied by any course with a number less than 100. 9.

Graduation RequirementsUndergraduate Information282ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING OPTION (EE) The objective of the undergraduate program in Electrical Engineering at Caltech is to produce graduates who will attain careers and higher edu - cation that ultimately lead to leadership roles in academia, industry, and government in areas of rapidly advancing interdisciplinary technology related to telecommunications, solid-state, robotics, information, com - puter and electrical systems. The program prepares its students for either graduate study, entre - preneurial careers, or research and development work in government or industrial laboratories. It inspires them to undertake careers and pro - fessional practices that provide an opportunity to address the pressing technological needs of society. It accomplishes this by building on the core curriculum to provide a broad and rigorous exposure to the funda - mentals (e.g., math, science, and principles of engineering) of electrical engineering. EE's other program objectives are multiple. The program strives to maintain a balance between classroom lectures and laboratory and design experience, and it emphasizes the problem formulation, sys - tem-design, and solving skills that are essential to any engineering dis - cipline. The program is also intended to develop in each student self-re - liance, creativity, teamwork ability, professional ethics, communication skills, and an appreciation of the importance of contemporary issues and lifelong intellectual growth. For interested students, there are opportuni - ties to conduct research with a faculty member. Students electing this option normally choose to take the introductory seminar EE 2 as a freshman-year elective. The formal study of electri - cal engineering begins in the sophomore year with courses such as, Deterministic Analysis of Systems and Circuits, EE 44; Introduction to Digital Logic and Embedded Systems EE/CS 10ab; semiconductor sen - sors and actuators, EE 40; the theory and laboratory practice of analog circuits, EE 45; and then a course on feedback control systems, EE 113 or CDS 110. The junior year features the fundamentals of signals and systems and digital signal processing, EE 111; random variables and stochastic processes, ACM/EE/IDS 116; electromagnetic engineering, EE 151; and an analog electronics laboratory, EE 90. In the senior year, the student will be asked to demonstrate their ability to formulate and carry out a design project through independent research or either a senior thesis, EE 80 abc, or two courses selected from the senior project design laboratory, EE 91 ab, and CS/EE/ME 75 c. In addition, the stu - dent throughout their studies and especially in the senior year, will have a significant opportunity to take elective courses that will allow them to explore earlier topics in depth, or to investigate topics that have not been covered previously. (See the \"suggested electives\" section, page 286.) A student whose interests lie in the electrical sciences but who wishes to pursue a broader course of studies than that allowed by the require - ments of the electrical engineering option may elect the engineering and applied science option. Attention is called to the fact that any student who has a grade-point average less than 1.9 at the end of the academic year in the subjects listed under electrical engineering may be refused permission to continue work in this option. Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch283EE Double Majors The electrical engineering option allows interested students to declare electrical engineering as one of the majors in a double major pursuit. To enroll in the program, the student should meet and discuss their plans with the option representative. In general, approval is contingent on good academic performance by the student and demonstrated ability for handling the heavier course load. For students simultaneously pur - suing a degree in a second option, courses taken as required courses for that option can also be counted as EE electives where appropriate. However, courses that count toward the electives requirement in the other option cannot be simultaneously counted toward satisfying the elective requirement in EE. To qualify for an EE degree, the student would need to complete all option requirements. EE Option Requirements 1. EE 55, Ma 2, Ph 2 abc. Ph 12 abc can replace Ph 2 abc. 2. EE 2, SEC 10, one of SEC 11-13, EE/CS 10ab, EE 40, 44, 45, 90, 111 and ACM/EE/IDS 116. 3. ACM 95ab. 4. EE 151 or EE/CS/IDS 160. 5. EE 91 or this requirement can be waived if a student completes EE 80 abc. 6. In addition to the above courses, 72 units selected from any EE course numbered over 100. 7. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including courses listed above. Courses used to satisfy requirements 1 through 6 must be taken for grades, unless they are only offered pass/fail.

ENGINEERING AND APPLIED SCIENCE OPTION (EAS) The engineering and applied science (EAS) option offers students the opportunity for study in a wide variety of challenging areas of science and technology by allowing each student to design a custom - ized course of study that has breadth, depth, and rigor similar to the options listed above. The aim of the EAS option is to prepare students for research and professional practice in an era of rapidly advancing interdisciplinary technology. The program builds on the core curriculum to combine individual depth of experience and competence in a particular cho - sen engineering specialty, and a strong background in the basic and engineering sciences, with laboratory and design, culminating in a capstone design experience. It strives to develop professional inde - pendence, creativity, leadership, and the capacity for continuing pro - fessional and intellectual growth. The first year of the four-year course of study leading to a Bachelor of Science degree is common for all students of the Institute, although freshman elective subjects are available as an introduction to various aspects of engineering and applied science. At the end of the first year, students who elect the EAS option are assigned advisers as close to their expressed field of interest as possible, and together with their advisers they develop programs of study for the next three years. Beyond the Institute-wide requirements of physics, mathematics, and humanities, the EAS option requires one year of applied and computational mathematics and a prescribed number of units selected from a wide variety of engineering and applied science courses. Engineering design (synthesis), as distinct from analysis, is considered an essential part of every engineer's capability. Advisers will expect students to select a sufficient number of courses that place emphasis on design. Any student in the EAS option whose grade-point average is less than 1.9 at the end of the academic year in the subjects listed in the option requirements may be refused permission to continue to work in the EAS option. EAS Option Requirements Students who have elected the EAS option must either choose one of the approved areas of concentration (see item 7 below), or by the end of the third term of the sophomore year submit a written proposed Graduation RequirementsUndergraduate Information288customized course of study and obtain approval for it from the EAS option representative. The course of study must include each of the following elements: 1. Fulfillment of core requirements in differential equations (Ma2 or equivalent); Probability and Statistics (Ma 3, Ge/ ESE 118 or equivalent); Waves (Ph2a, Ph12a or equivalent), Mechanics (Ph 2b, Ph 12b, Ch 21a or equivalent); Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics (Ph 2c, Ph 12c, ChE 63, ME 11, Ch 21c or equivalent); 2. Demonstration of computer programming competency by taking CS 1, or by taking an approved alternative course, or by passing a placement exam administered by the computer science option by first term of sophomore year. a. 27 units of advanced EAS courses with the prefixes Ae, ACM, AM, APh, CE, CS, CDS, EE, ESE, MS, or ME; and b. 27 additional units of either advanced EAS courses or advanced science courses offered by the BBE, CCE, GPS, or PMA divisions. 3. a. 9 units of laboratory courses taken from the following list: APh 77 bc, Ae/APh 104 bc, CE 180, CS/CNS 171,174, EE 45, 53, EE 90, EE 91, MS 90, MS 125, ME 72 ab, ME 50 ab, ME 90 bc; and b. 9 units of additional laboratory courses either from the list in 3a or from EAS courses with the word \"laboratory\" in the title, but excluding those courses for which freshman laboratory credit is allowed. 4. ACM 95 ab or Ma 108 abc or Ma 109 abc. None of these course sequences may be taken pass/fail. 5. SEC 10 or equivalent; one of SEC 11, SEC 12, or SEC 13 or equivalent. 6. Courses used to satisfy requirements 1-5 above must also sat - isfy a depth requirement, which must be met by a customized schedule of requirements that is rigorous, has both breadth and depth, and that includes a senior thesis or capstone design proj - ect, such as, but not restricted to, EE 80 abc, CS 80 abc, ME 90 abc, or two terms ofEE 91 ab. The student must submit a written proposal justifying their course selections, and obtain the approval of, the EAS option representative by the end of the third term of the sophomore year. 7. At least 117 units of EAS courses not including those used to satisfy requirements 4, 5, and 6 above. 8. The customized schedule of requirements described in 7 shall include a major design experience. 9. Passing grades must be earned in at least 486 units, including those listed in requirements 1-8 above. ENGLISH OPTION AND MINOR (E n) The option in english provides students with a broad and intensive edu - cation in the rich traditions of literature in english from the middle ages to the present day, with a particular emphasis on british and american Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch289writing. The english faculty expects undergraduate option students to become familiar with a range of literary forms, genres, and styles of expression; to understand how authors and texts can be shaped by historical contexts; to appreciate differences in literary expression across time periods and national traditions; to develop critical reading skills through analysis and interpretation of literary texts; and to become effec - tive writers in matters of style, organization, and interpretive argument. During the senior year, and typically in the first two terms, English option students enroll in En 99 ab (Senior Tutorial for English Majors) with a faculty member chosen by mutual agreement. The Senior Tutorial intro - duces students to advanced methods in literary research and analysis and provides an important means for assessing the progress of English option students in the rigorous study of literary texts and contexts. Students research, write, and revise a 25-30 page paper on a topic in British or American literature; En 99 a is primarily a research term, and En 99 b is primarily a writing term. Both terms involve regular tutorial con - sultation with the faculty instructor. English option students should begin considering a senior thesis topic in the third term of their junior year in consultation with the option representative or option adviser. In addition to the Senior Tutorial, the English option requires nine courses, which must include at least one course in each of the follow - ing areas: British literature, American literature, and literature before 1850. All English option students are assigned an adviser who will help select courses best suited to their needs and interests, including where appropriate a limited number of courses in related fields such as history, visual culture, and literature other than British and American. Students should consult their option adviser in advance of registration for each term. All courses counted toward the option must be taken for grades except for a freshman humanities course in English when taken in the first two quarters of the freshman year. Most students pursue English as a second option. The emphasis on writing and on critical reading helps students develop communication skills that can enhance their careers as scientists, engineers, and medical pro - fessionals. The English option also provides excellent preparation for those seeking careers in law, business, and administration, and in any field that involves extensive communication. En Option Requirements 1. En 99 ab. 2. 81 additional units of English courses numbered 99 and above. 27 of these units must include one course in British literature, one course in American literature, and one course in literature before 1850 (En 103, 110, 113, 118, 121, 122, 125, 127, 129, 188, 189, 190, and En/H 193, 197). Courses cannot be counted twice in meeting these distribution requirements. Up to nine units of freshman humanities in English (courses cross-listed Hum/En numbered 60 or below) and/or up to nine units of En 98 may be substituted for up to 18 of the remaining 54 English units. Students may also substitute courses in foreign literature (in the original or in translation) and/or, with authorization of the adviser, related humanities courses numbered above 99, for up Graduation RequirementsUndergraduate Information290to 18 of the remaining 54 English units. 3. 54 additional units of science, mathematics, and engineering courses. This requirement cannot be satisfied by courses listed as satisfying the introductory laboratory requirement or by a course with a number less than 10. 4. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including the courses listed above. Courses used to complete the English option under categories 1 and 2 above may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another option or minor. However, these courses may be used to satisfy core Institute requirements in the humanities. English Minor Requirements The English minor is designed for students who want to pursue concen - trated study in English and/or American literature, without the extensive course work and the senior thesis required by the English option. English minors must take 72 units of English courses. These units may include one freshman humanities course; they may also include one direct - ed reading course (En 98). Students wishing to do a minor in English must declare a minor with the English option representative. All courses to be counted toward the option in English must be taken for grades except for a freshman humanities course in English when taken in the first two quar - ters of the freshman year. Students completing the English minor require - ments will have the phrase \"minor in English\" added to their transcripts. 1. 72 units of English courses numbered 99 or above. 2. Nine units of freshman humanities in English (courses cross-listed Hum/En numbered 60 or below) may be substitute for any nine of the 72 units required for the minor. 3. Nine units of En 98 may be substituted for any nine of the 72 units required for the minor. Courses used to complete the English minor may not be used to sat - isfy the requirements of another option or minor. However, these courses may be used to satisfy core Institute requirements in the humanities. ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING OPTION AND MINOR (ESE) The ESE major is intended to train students in the environmental sci - ences, to pursue careers in academia, the public sector, or the private sector. The major can be pursued along two tracks: environmental phys - ics and environmental chemistry. These tracks have separate course requirements and emphases, but at their hearts provide fundamental training in core scientific disciplines, with specialization in applications to the environmental and climate sciences. The two tracks share a sopho - more year that continues the Core Curriculum's training in mathematics and physics. Each track requires a laboratory component and training in data analysis and statistics. All ESE majors must take three broad-based classes (ESE 101, 102, and 103 ) providing introductions to atmospheric and oceanic physics as well as marine and terrestrial biogeochemistry. Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch291 Graduation RequirementsThe physics and chemistry tracks initially parallel their respective majors in the core disciplines. However, there are fewer required classes in the ESE major to enable students to design a curriculum that emphasizes the environmental sciences, after training in a core discipline. A total of 212 units are required for the major, leaving approximately nine classes of free choice outside the major and the core. Requirements for all ESE Majors, regardless of 'Track' Ma 2.

It is designed for students who wish to broaden their studies beyond their major to include environmental science and engineering. Students completing the ESE minor requirements will have the phrase \"minor in environmental science and engineering\" added to their transcripts.Historical Sketch293ESE Minor Requirements 1. Complete 27 units of ESE 1, 101, 102, or 103 2. Complete 27 additional units of ESE courses (which may include up to 18 units of research under ESE 90, including the required written report). Except for research courses, all ESE courses to be applied to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for grades, and students must maintain a minimum grade average of B- in this ESE coursework. Courses that are used to satisfy the ESE minor requirements cannot be used to satisfy course requirements in the major. GEOLOGICAL AND PLANETARY SCIENCES (GPS) (Geology, Geobiology, Geochemistry, Geophysics, Planetary Science) The aim of this undergraduate program is to provide thorough training in the geological and planetary sciences and, wherever possible, to inte - grate these studies with courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology taken during the student's earlier years at the Institute. Active involvement in research, particularly during the summer, is encouraged. For geologists, field work is important because it provides firsthand expe - rience with geological phenomena that can never be satisfactorily grasped or understood solely from classroom or laboratory treatment. Options are offered in geology, geobiology, geochemistry, geophysics, and planetary science. Electives permit students to follow lines of special interest in relat - ed scientific and engineering fields. Those who do well in the basic scienc - es and at the same time have a compelling curiosity about the earth and the other planets are likely to find their niche in these options, especially if they enjoy grappling with complex problems involving many variables. Most students majoring in the earth and planetary sciences now pursue further training at the graduate level. Under the geobiology option, a student can be associated with either the biology or the GPS division. This association formally will only affect which course the students elect to satisfy the Institute-wide oral presenta - tion requirement; all other geobiology option requirements are independent of GPS or biology affiliation. In practice, however, we expect that students' affiliation with one division or another will significantly shape their choice of elective courses. For students beginning their junior year, it is possible to complete the requirements for geochemistry, geophysics, and planetary science options within two years, but there are benefits from starting with the Ge 11 sequence in the sophomore year. Because Ge 120 ab may not be offered every year, students in the geology option may also need to take Ge 106 and Ge 120 a in winter and spring term of their sophomore year in order to prepare for Ge 120 b the following summer. GPS Double Majors For students simultaneously pursuing a degree in a second option, cours - es taken as required courses for that option can also be counted as Ge electives where appropriate. However, courses that count toward the elec - tives requirement in the other option cannot simultaneously be counted toward satisfying the elective requirement in GPS.

HISTORY OPTION AND MINOR (H) Students who choose the history option will learn how to do history\u2014 how to think critically about past societies and their development, how to read evidence closely, and how to express arguments in writing. With the guidance of a faculty adviser in history, students taking the option will explore the range of human experience in the realms of politics, cul - ture, religion, and economics, as well as science and technology. They will learn both to challenge and revise existing historical narratives and Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch301question their own ideas and assumptions about the past. Students will develop the writing skills that will enable them to use historical sources to make effective arguments, and they will receive extensive feedback on their writing from their adviser and from other faculty members. The history option thus provides science and engineering students with an important supplement to the scientific training and technical skills they acquire in other courses and options. It will help them to understand the world of human beings and human behavior outside of science with which they will interact and which their scientific work will affect; to set themselves and their work as scientists and engineers in this wider context; and to communicate what they are doing to a wider public as well as to their colleagues. In addition, it offers excellent preparation for careers in business, administration, law, journalism, or public affairs, as well as a solid foundation for graduate work in history. History majors must take at least 99 units of history courses (which may include a freshman humanities course in history) during their four years as undergraduates. Of these, 27 must be in the senior tutorial (H 99 abc). All courses to be counted toward the history option must be taken for grades except for a freshman humanities course in his - tory when taken in the first two quarters of the freshman year. History majors may also choose to take one term of H 98, an individual pro - gram of directed reading that will allow students to explore areas of history not covered by regular courses. Each history major will choose an area of concentration in consul - tation with their adviser and the history option representative. These areas might include, but are not restricted to, fields such as ancient his - tory, medieval Europe, early-modern Europe, modern Europe, Russian history, American history pre- 1865, American history post-1865, ear - ly-modern history of science, modern history of science, or economic history. A student must take 63 units of courses in this area; 27 of these units must be in the senior tutorial H 99 abc. In the senior tutorial, students will have the opportunity over the course of three terms to explore in depth an historical subject of partic - ular interest to them, while working one-on-one with a member of the history faculty. They will learn how to carry out historical research, in libraries as well as on-line, and engage critically with both primary and secondary historical sources. Finally, they will learn, under the direct supervision of their faculty mentor, to organize and to write an exten - sive research paper, of at least 30 pages, that makes an original, clear and persuasive scholarly argument. In H 99a, students will carry out general research in their area of interest, and identify the specific topic on which they wish to write. In H 99b they will learn to frame a research question, carry out independently the necessary research to answer it, and generate an outline of their paper. In H 99c they will write and revise their paper in response to feedback from their faculty mentor. Each student must take the remaining 36 units of history required by the option in areas other than the area of concentration, again defined in consultation with their adviser and the history option representative. These areas may include not only fields within the discipline of history proper, but also useful cognate fields such as economics, political sci - ence, anthropology, law, English, or a foreign language. Graduation RequirementsUndergraduate Information302A student considering the history option when they come to Caltech will be well advised to take a freshman humanities course in history (courses cross-listed Hum/H numbered 60 or below). In the sophomore year, the student should take upper-level history courses, but this is also a good time to pursue the study of English or philosophy, to begin or continue a foreign language, and to do introductory work in the social sciences. A student will normally make a commitment to an area of con - centration early in the junior year. At the beginning of the senior year, a history major will enroll in H 99 abc with a faculty member in their area of concentration. H Option Requirements 1. H 99 abc. 2. 72 additional units of history courses numbered 99 or above. Up to nine units of freshman humanities in history (courses cross-listed Hum/H numbered 60 or below) and/or up to nine units of H 98 may be substituted for up to 18 of these units. 3. 63 of the total history units, including H 99 abc, must be in an area of concentration, as defined in consultation with the stu - dent's adviser and the history option representative. 4. 36 of the total history units must be in an area or areas other than the area of concentration, as defined in consultation with the student's adviser and the history option representative. H 99 abc may not be used to fulfill this requirement. 5. 54 additional units of science, mathematics, and engineering courses. This requirement cannot be satisfied by courses listed as satisfying the introductory laboratory requirement or by menu courses. 6. Three units of oral communication. En/Wr 84 satisfies this requirement, as do oral communication courses offered by other options. 7. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including the courses listed above. Courses used to complete the history option under categories 1, 2, or 3 above may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another option or minor. H Minor Requirements The history minor is designed for students who want to pursue concen - trated study in history without the extensive course work and the senior thesis required by the history option. History minors must take 72 units of history courses. These units may include one freshman humanities course; they may also include one directed reading course (H 98). All courses to be counted toward the history minor must be taken for grades except for a freshman humanities course in history when taken in the first two quarters of the freshman year. Students wishing to do a minor in history must declare a minor with the history option representative. Students completing the history minor requirements will have the phrase \"minor in history\" added to their transcripts. 1. 72 units of history courses numbered 99 or above. 2. Nine units of freshman humanities in history (courses cross listed Undergraduate InformationHistorical Sketch303Hum/H numbered 60 or below) may be substituted for 3. any nine of the 72 units required for the minor. 4. Nine units of H 98 may be substituted for any nine of the 72 5. units required for the minor. Students cannot use history minor requirements to satisfy a different option or minor. HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE OPTION AND MINOR (HPS) The history and philosophy of science option (HPS) provides students the opportunity to explore the historical evolution of the sciences and the phil - osophical perspectives that inform them, as well as the dynamics between science, technology, and other human endeavors. HPS courses in history help students learn about the origins of experi - mental practice; the social and institutional contexts of science; the origins and applications of quantitative methods; specific developments since antiquity in physics, biology, chemistry, geography and cartography, medi - cine; and biographical and comparative studies in these fields. HPS cours - es in philosophy deal with issues in causation and explanation; the foun - dations of probability and statistical inference; and philosophical problems in particular fields such as biology, mathematics, medicine, neuroscience, and physics. In their coursework, students receive regular feedback from the faculty on their research, writing, and presentation skills. They have the opportunity to carry out independent research, especially in their thesis work, and present their findings in a seminar setting. This option thus aims to give students a broad, basic understanding of how science is practiced and how that practice has changed over time. Students learn to address questions such as: To what extent was the scientific revolution revolutionary? What is a scientific explanation and how do scientists go about constructing and justifying one? How have conceptions of scientific experimentation changed? What are the ethical issues raised by experimentation with human or animal subjects? How has relativity theory changed our conceptions of space and time? The option is designed to complement the regular science curriculum at Caltech, offering students the opportunity to enlarge upon, and to contextualize, the strong technical skills they acquire in other courses and options. Because of its emphasis on essay writing and formulating complex philosophical and historical arguments, our curriculum provides training in writing and communication skills that are increasingly vital today. The HPS option provides excellent preparation for students going into law, business, medicine, science journalism and public affairs, and it also prepares stu - dents for graduate work in the history and/or philosophy of science. HPS Option Requirements 1. Hum/H/HPS 18; HPS quarter). (HPS 102 b fulfills the Institute science writing require - ment.) 2. One advanced course in the history of science, chosen from HPS/H offerings with a course number of 98 or higher; one advanced course in philosophy of science, chosen from HPS/ Graduation RequirementsUndergraduate Information304Pl offerings with a course number of 98 or higher; and any four courses in HPS. (No more than 9 units of HPS 98 may be count - ed towards the HPS major.) 3. 45 units of courses in science, mathematics, and engineering. This requirement cannot be satisfied by courses listed as satis - fying the introductory laboratory requirement or by a course with a number less than 10. 4. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including all courses used to satisfy the above requirements. Courses used to complete the history and philosophy of science option under categories 1, 2, or 3 above may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another option or minor. We recommend that students intending to follow the HPS option take Hum/H/HPS 18, Introduction to History of Science, as one of their freshman humanities courses. Students making the decision to follow this option in their sophomore year should take Hum/H/HPS 18 and HPS/Pl 120, Introduction to Philosophy of Science, as early as possi - ble in that year. Students may also enter the option in their junior year if they can complete the option's requirements in time for graduation. Please also note the following: Not all required courses are offered each term; students should consult the current catalog to determine which terms required courses are being offered, and should construct their course plan for the year accordingly. We encourage students to choose their advanced social science electives from among courses that will enlarge their perspective on topics related to HPS (for example, Ec 118, Ec/SS 128, Ec 129, Ec 130, PSY 101, PSY 115, PSY 125, PSY 130, PS 120, PS 121, PS 122, An 22). HPS 102ab, the Senior Research Seminar, may be taken in any two consecutive terms in the Senior year. Students should coordinate with their HPS adviser in determining their course schedule. HPS Typical Course Schedule First Year It is recommended that students intending to follow the HPS option take Hum/H/HPS 18 as one of their freshman humanities courses.

Students should coordinate with their HPS adviser in determining their course schedule. HPS Minor Requirements The minor in HPS is designed for students who want to pursue con - centrated study in the field without the extensive course work and the senior thesis required by the HPS option. HPS minors must complete 72 units of HPS courses. Freshman Humanities courses other than Hum/H/HPS 18 may not be counted towards an HPS minor. Students wishing to do a minor in HPS must declare a minor with the HPS option representative. Those completing Graduation RequirementsUndergraduate Information306the HPS minor requirements will have the phrase \"minor in History and Philosophy of Science\" added to their transcripts. 5. 72 units of HPS courses numbered 99 or above. 6. 9 units of HPS 98 may be substituted for any 9 of the 72 unit required for the minor. 7. 9 units of Hum/H/HPS 18 may be substituted for any 9 of the 72 units required for the minor. Students cannot use HPS minor requirements to satisfy a different option or minor. INFORMATION AND DATA SCIENCES (IDS) The information and data sciences are concerned with the acquisi - tion, storage, communication, processing, and analysis of data. These intellectual activities have a long history, and Caltech has traditionally occupied a position of strength with faculty spread out across applied mathematics, electrical engineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, astronomy, economics, and many others disciplines. In the last decade, there has been a rapid increase in the rate at which data are acquired with the objective of extracting actionable knowledge\u2014in the form of scientific models and predictions, business decisions, and pub - lic policies. From a technological perspective, this rapid increase in the availability of data creates numerous challenges in acquisition, storage, and subsequent analysis. More fundamentally, humans cannot deal with such a volume of data directly, and it is increasingly essential that we automate the pipeline of information processing and analysis. All areas of human endeavor are affected: science, medicine, engineering, manufacturing, logistics, the media, entertainment. The range of sce - narios that concern a scientist in this domain are very broad\u2014from sit - uations in which the available data are nearly infinite (big data), to those in which the data are sparse and precious; from situations in which computation is, for all practical purposes, an infinite resource to those in which it is critical to respond rapidly and computation must thus be treated as a precious resource; from situations in which the data are all available at once to those in which they are presented as a stream. As such, the information and data sciences now draw not just upon traditional areas spanning computer science, applied mathematics, and electrical engineering\u2014signal processing, information and communica - tion theory, control and decision theory, probability and statistics, algo - rithms\u2014but also a range of new contemporary topics such as machine learning, network science, distributed systems, and neuroscience. The result is an area that is new, fundamentally different that related areas like computer science and statistics, and that is crucial to modern applications in the physical sciences, social sciences, and engineering. The Information and Data Sciences (IDS) option is unabashedly mathematical, focusing on the foundations of the information and data sciences, across its roots in probability, statistics, linear algebra, and signal processing. These fields all contribute crucial components of data science today. Further, it takes advantage of the interdisciplinary nature of Caltech by including a required set of application courses where students will learn about how data touches science and engi -Historical Sketch307neering broadly. The flexibility provided by this sequence allows stu - dents to see data science in action in biology, economics, chemistry, and beyond. In addition to a major, the IDS option offers a minor that focuses on the mathematical foundations of the information and data sciences but recognizes the fact that many students in other majors across campus have a need to supplement their options with practical training in data science. IDS Option Requirements 1. Computer Science Fundamentals. CS 1 or CS 1X; CS 2; CS 21 or Ma/CS 6c; and CS 38. 2. Mathematical Fundamentals. Ma 2; Ma 3 or Ma/ACM/IDS 140a; Ma 108a; and Ma/CS 6ab or Ma 121ab. The analytical tracks of Ma1bc are strongly recommended. 3.

Courses used to fulfill this requirement may not also be used to fill the any requirement above. Courses used to fulfill requirements in the \"Applications of Data Science\" and \"Advanced Electives\" requirements cannot be used to fulfill the institute humanities and social sciences requirements. Units used to fulfill the Institute Core requirements do not count toward any of the option requirements. Pass/fail grading cannot be elected for Graduation RequirementsUndergraduate Information308courses taken to satisfy option requirements. Passing grades must be earned in total of 486 units, including all courses used to satisfy the above requirements. IDS Double Majors Students interested in simultaneously pursuing a degree in a second option must fulfill all the requirements of the Information and Data Sciences option. Courses may be used to simultaneously fulfill require - ments in both options. However, it is required that students have at least 54 units of \"Advanced Electives\" and 18 units of \"Applications of Data Science\" that are not simultaneously used for fulfilling a require - ment of the second option, i.e., the requirements of the Advanced Electives and the Applications of Data Science sections must be fulfilled using courses that are not simultaneously used for fulfilling a requirement of the second option. Any proposal to replace these courses must be discussed with the option administrator. To enroll in the program, the student should meet and discuss their plans with the option representative. In general, approval is contingent on good aca - demic performance by the student and demonstrated ability for han - dling the heavier course load.

Courses used to fulfill this requirement may not also be used to fill the any requirement above. Courses used to fulfill requirements in the \"Applications of Data Science\" and \"Advanced Electives\" requirements cannot be used to fulfill (i) a requirement for another major or minor; or (ii) the institute humanities and social sciences requirements. Any replacement of these courses must be discussed with the option administrator. Pass/fail grading cannot be elected for courses taken to satisfy option requirements. Courses taken as part of the data science minor are count - ed toward the total 486 units needed for Institute graduation requirements. Typical course schedule A typical course sequence is to take CS 1 during freshman year; Ma/CS 6a, Ma 3, CS2 and CS38 during sophomore ACM/EE/IDS 116, ACM/ IDS 104, CMS/CS/CNS/EE/IDS 155, and IDS/ACM/CS 157 during junior year; and EE/IDS 111 and the elective courses during senior year. INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES PROGRAM (ISP) The Interdisciplinary Studies Program (ISP) is an undergraduate option that allows the student to create their own scholastic requirements, under faculty supervision, and to pursue positive educational goals that Historical Sketch311cannot be achieved in any of the other available options. A student's program may include regular Caltech courses, research courses, cours - es at other schools, and interdisciplinary study courses (item 5, next page). In scope and depth, the program must be comparable to a nor - mal undergraduate program, but it need not include all of the specific courses or groups of courses listed in the formulated Institute option requirements for undergraduates. The Curriculum Committee, a standing committee of the faculty, has overall responsibility for the program. In addition, each student has their own committee of at least two advisers, two of whom must be professorial faculty. Application material may be obtained at the dean of undergraduate students' office or website. ISP Administrative Procedures and Guidelines 1. An interested student must recruit at least two professorial faculty members representing at least two different degree-granting options to serve as the ISP faculty committee. Each member of the faculty committee must provide a letter that includes: a. Faculty name and department/division, and the discipline they \"represent\" within the proposed ISP . b. Faculty's assessment of the student's ISP proposal, including the proposed degree title, as it relates to that faculty's discipline. c. Faculty assessment of whether the student could choose an existing degree-granting option with some acceptable accommodations, rather than create an ISP . That is, does this ISP enable something that could not be accomplished in a single option or major/minor combination. 2. Send the ISP proposal (cover sheet, proposed curriculum, and the aforementioned letters from professorial faculty advisers to the dean of undergraduate students for review and approval. 3. The dean of undergraduate students sends the ISP petition to the Curriculum Committee for review and final approval. This contract includes the agreed-upon content of the student's program and the methods for ascertaining satisfactory progress for those parts of the student's program that are not standard Institute courses. This contract may of course be amended, but any amendments must be approved by the committee of two and the Curriculum Committee. Copies of each student's contract and of all amendments thereto, along with all ISP records for each student and their transcript, are kept in the permanent files of the Registrar's Office. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units. 4. The progress of each student in the ISP is monitored each quarter by the registrar, and any deviations from the terms of the contract are reported to the chair of the Curriculum Committee. Standards for acceptable progress and for satisfactory completion of the terms of the contract are the responsibility of the Curriculum Committee. When the Committee is satisfied that the terms of the contract have been fulfilled by the student, it recommends the stu - dent to the faculty for graduation. 5. A plan of study may include special ISP courses to accommodate Graduation RequirementsUndergraduate Information312individual programs of study or special research that falls outside ordinary course offerings. In order that credit be received for an ISP course, a written course contract specifying the work to be accom - plished, time schedule for progress reports and completed work, units of credit, and form of grading must be agreed upon by the instructor, the student, and the committee of two, and submitted to the registrar prior to initiating the work in the course. ISP courses are recorded on the student's transcript in the same manner as are other Caltech courses. 6. ISPs are intended for multiyear programs. Accordingly, the Curriculum Committee urges students contemplating an ISP to submit their petition during their second year and will not normally consider such petitions any later than the first term of the student's third year. MATERIALS SCIENCE OPTION (MS) The aim of the Materials Science option is to prepare students for research, professional practice, or advanced study in a rapidly advanc - ing interdisciplinary field, focusing on the relationships between the properties of materials and their internal structure and how this struc - ture can be controlled. The program builds on the core curriculum to develop analytical competence and use it for individualized research, culminating in a one-year senior thesis. Materials Science students develop professional independence, creativity, leadership, and the skills for continuing professional and intellectual growth. The first year of the four-year course of study leading to a Bachelor of Science degree is common for all students of the Institute, although freshman elective subjects are available as an introduction to various aspects of engineering and applied science. At the end of the first year, students who elect the Materials Science option are assigned advisers appro - priate for their expressed field of interest. Together with their advisers, they develop programs of study for the next three years. Beyond the Institute-wide requirements of physics, mathematics, and humanities, the Materials Science option requires one year of applied and compu - tational mathematics and a prescribed number of units selected from a wide variety of courses in science and engineering. An undergraduate thesis is an essential part of the academic program. Any student in the Materials Science option whose grade-point average is less than 1.9 at the end of the academic year in the subjects listed in the option requirements may be refused permission to continue to work in the Materials Science option. MS Option Requirements 1. Fulfillment of extended core requirements in Differential Equations (Ma 2 or equivalent); Probability and Statistics (Ma 3, Ge/ ESE 118 or equivalent); Waves (Ph 2 a, Ph 12 a or equivalent), Quantum Mechanics (Ph 2 b, Ph 12 b, Ch 21 a or equivalent); Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics (Ph 2 c, Ph 12 c or equivalent).

Math students go well beyond the basics to study the structures of algebra, analysis and geometry, as well as the rudiments of combinatorics and set theory. Students learn to write coherent and complete proofs of various assertions, to work out non-trivial examples and to use computational tools. The schedule of courses in the undergraduate mathematics option is flexible. It enables students to adapt their programs to their needs and mathematical interests and gives them the opportunity to become familiar with creative mathematics early in their careers. Some students go to use their background in mathematics as an entry to other fields, such as physics, computer science, statistics, economics, business, finance, medicine and law.Historical Sketch315Freshmen considering majoring in mathematics should be aware that the department strongly recommends taking the analytical track of Ma 1 bc. Any student whose grade-point average is less than 1.9 at the end of the academic year, in the subjects under mathematics and applied and computational mathematics may be refused permis - sion to continue work in the mathematics options. Ma Option Requirements 1. Ma 2. 2. Ma 3 or Ma 140 a. 3. Ph 2 bc or Ph 12 bc 4. Ma 5 abc, Ma 10, Ma 108 abc, Ma 109 abc. 5. Ma/CS 6 a or Ma 121 a. 6.

Courses in other options with high mathe - matical content may be used to fulfill this requirement with the approval of the undergraduate option representative for mathe - matics. Of these 45 units, at most 18 can be from courses other than Caltech Ma courses. 8. Math majors must take two quarters (18 units) of a single course, chosen from the Ma course listings with numbers between 110 and 190, inclusive. In years where one of these courses is given as a one-term course only, it cannot be used to satisfy this requirement. These two quarters may include courses taken to satisfy requirements 2, 5, 6 or 7. 9. Requirements 1- 6 may not be taken pass/fail unless completed during fall or winter of freshman year or when the course is only offered as pass/fail. 10. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including the courses listed above.

MECHANICAL ENGINEERING OPTION (ME) The objective of the undergraduate program in Mechanical Engineering at Caltech is to produce graduates who will attain careers and higher education that ultimately lead to leadership roles in academia, industry, and government in areas of rapidly advancing interdisciplinary technol - ogy related to fluid, solid, thermal, and mechanical systems. The program prepares students for graduate school and profes - sional practice and inspires them to undertake careers that provide an opportunity to address the pressing technological needs of society. Specifically, the program builds on Caltech's core curriculum to com - bine individual depth of experience and competence in a particular chosen mechanical engineering specialty with a strong background in the basic and engineering sciences. It maintains a balance between classroom lectures and laboratory and design experience, and empha - sizes the problem-formulation and solving skills that are essential to any engineering discipline. The program also strives to develop in each student self-reliance, creativity, leadership, professional ethics, and the capacity for continuing professional and intellectual growth. For Historical Sketch317interested students, there are opportunities to conduct research with a faculty member. The outcome of the undergraduate program is to prepare the stu - dent to build on a fundamental education in physics, mathematics, chemistry, and biology and to apply those principles to the solution of open-ended engineering problems; to design, analyze, measure, and evaluate fluid, thermal, and mechanical systems; to work effectively as part of a team; to communicate effectively; to apply ethical consider - ations; and to understand the broader impacts of engineering develop - ments, including societal, cultural and environmental concerns. Mechanical engineering is the branch of engineering that is generally concerned with understanding forces and motion, and their application to solving problems of interest to society. The field includes aspects of thermodynamics, fluid and solid mechanics, mechanisms, materials, and energy conversion and transfer, and involves the application of physics, mathematics, chemistry, and increasingly, biology and com - puter science. Importantly, the field also emphasizes the process of formulation, design, optimization, manufacture, and control of new sys - tems and devices. Technical developments in the last decade have established the importance of interdisciplinary engineering and science, and as a result, new technical disciplines within mechanical engineering have emerged. These new areas build on an understanding of the fundamental behav - ior of physical systems; however, the focus of this work is at the inter - faces between traditional disciplines. Examples of the new disciplines include micro- and nano-mechanical systems, simulation and synthe - sis, integrated complex distributed systems, and biological engineering. Mechanical engineers can be found in many fields, including auto - motive, aerospace, materials processing and development, power pro - duction, consumer products, robotics and automation, semiconductor processing, and instrumentation. Mechanical engineering can also be the starting point for careers in bioengineering, environmental and aero - nautical engineering, finance, and business management. The Mechanical Engineering Option is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, 111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, MD 21202-4012, (410) 347-7700. At the end of the first year, students who elect the Mechanical Engineering Option are assigned advisers as close to their expressed field of interest as possible, and together they develop programs of study for the next three years. A student whose interests relate to mechanical engineering, but who wishes to pursue a broader course of study than that allowed by the requirements below, may elect the Engineering and Applied Science Option. Attention is called to the fact that any student whose grade-point average is less than 1.9 at the end of the academic year in the required courses listed below may be refused permission to continue work in this option.

PHILOSOPHY OPTION AND MINOR (PI) The philosophy option provides students with a broad education in philosophy that is designed to complement the scientific curriculum at Caltech. Philosophy majors will be expected to learn about some of the major figures and movements in the history of philosophy, and to learn about contemporary philosophical debates. The philosophy option also aims to provide students with new perspectives on the material they learn in their science courses, and to enable them to bring their techni - cal skills and scientific learning to traditional problems in philosophy. Graduation RequirementsUndergraduate Information320The philosophy curriculum will help students to acquire the basic tools of philosophical analysis: the ability to read and interpret philosophical texts; the ability to identify strengths and weaknesses of philosophical arguments; the ability to develop well-reasoned defenses of philosophi - cal positions; and the ability to anticipate objections to one's own views. In addition, the philosophy option will train students to express them - selves clearly and concisely in both writing and speaking. These critical thinking and communication skills provide an excellent foundation for any intellectual endeavor, and are critical to those pursuing careers in fields such as law, business, medicine, and scientific research. The courses in the philosophy option concentrate in four major areas: philosophy of science; philosophy of mind, brain, and behavior; history of philosophy; and ethics. In their coursework, students will have the opportunity to discuss and debate philosophical issues in small groups, and will learn how to offer and receive constructive criticism. They will also receive detailed feedback on their persua - sive writing from several different members of the philosophy faculty. In their senior thesis, philosophy majors will have the opportunity to pursue more intensive research in one particular area of philosophy, and to sustain an argument on a larger scale, while working one-on- one with a member of the philosophy faculty. This will provide inter - ested students with a solid foundation for graduate work in philosophy and related fields. Philosophy majors must take at least 99 units of philosophy courses during their four years as undergraduates. These must include 18 units of Pl 90 ab, to be taken in any two consecutive terms in the senior year. The 99 units may include nine units of freshman humanities in philoso - phy (courses cross-listed Hum/Pl numbered 60 or below), nine units of Pl 98, and up to 18 units of study in related disciplines. Depending on their interests, philosophy majors may be required by the option representative or their advisers to take up to 18 units in one or more related areas. For example, students writing on political philosophy or phi - losophy of neuroscience will be expected to have the appropriate political science or neuroscience background. Students whose primary interest lies in the philosophy of science\u2014particularly in the philosophy of specific sciences such as physics or biology\u2014will have their intellectual interests best served by taking classes in both the history and philosophy of sci - ence. Such students are encouraged to pursue the HPS option; or, if they choose the philosophy option, they may be required to take some history of science courses as part of their 99-unit requirement. Students considering the philosophy option will be well advised to take a freshman humanities course in philosophy. From the sophomore year onward, they should plan on taking one philosophy course per term, cul - minating in two terms of Pl 90 ab in the senior year. Students in Pl 90 ab work with a faculty adviser to write a 10,000- to 12,000-word paper on a topic of mutual interest. Senior theses are expected to be of a high stan - dard and to form the basis of students' applications to graduate study in philosophy, should they so desire. With the exception of Pl 98 and courses taken during the first two quarters of the freshman year, all courses to be counted toward the philosophy option must be taken for grades unless special permission is granted by the option representative.Historical Sketch321PI Option Requirements 1. Pl 90 ab. 2. 63 units of advanced philosophy courses, numbered 99 or above. Up to nine units of freshman humanities in philosophy (courses cross-listed Hum/Pl numbered 60 or below) and/or up to nine units of Pl 98 may be substituted for up to 18 of these advanced units. 3. 18 units of advanced philosophy courses numbered 99 or above, or advanced non-philosophy courses that are closely related to the student's area(s) of philosophical interest. (Students wishing to count non-philosophy courses toward their option require - ments must obtain prior approval from the philosophy option representative or their adviser. Students will normally not be per - mitted to satisfy this requirement with core courses.) 4. 54 units of science, mathematics, and engineering courses in addition to the core. This requirement cannot be satisfied by core or menu courses, or by courses listed as satisfying the introductory laboratory requirement. Students are strongly encouraged to choose their additional courses in areas that complement their philosophy studies. 5. Three units of oral communication. En 84 satisfies this require - ment, as do oral communication courses offered by other options. 6. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including the courses listed above. Courses used to complete the philosophy option under categories 1, 2, or 3 above may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another option or minor. PI Minor Requirements The minor in philosophy is designed for students who want to pursue concentrated study in philosophy without the extensive course work and the senior thesis required by the philosophy option. Philosophy minors must complete 72 units of philosophy courses. Students wishing to do a minor in philosophy must declare a minor with the philosophy option representative. Students completing the philos - ophy minor requirements will have the phrase \"minor in philosophy\" added to their transcripts. With the exception of Pl 98 and courses taken during the first two semesters of freshman year, all courses to be counted toward the philosophy option or minor must be taken for grades unless special permission is granted by the option representative. 1. 72 units of philosophy courses numbered 99 or above. 2. Nine units of Pl 98 may be substituted for any nine units of the 72 required for the minor. 3. Nine units of freshman humanities in philosophy (courses cross-listed Hum/Pl numbered 60 or below) may be substituted for any nine units of the 72 required for the minor. Courses used to complete the philosophy minor may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another option or minor. Graduation RequirementsUndergraduate Information322PHYSICS OPTION (P h) The physics option offers instruction in the fundamentals of modern physics and provides a foundation for graduate study, which is gener - ally necessary for a career in basic research. The physics program also forms an excellent basis for future work in a variety of applied fields. An intensive version of the sophomore physics course (waves, quan - tum mechanics, and statistical mechanics) is offered for those planning further study in physics and the required junior-level courses give a thorough treatment of fundamental principles. Elective courses taken during the junior and senior years allow students to explore their par - ticular interest. Some electives offer broad surveys, while others con - centrate on particular fields of current research. A choice of laboratory course is offered at several levels. Students interested in concentrating their studies in one specific area of physics should refer to the under - graduate physics website for course schedule recommendations. Students are encouraged to become active participants in research on campus, both during the summer and during the school year. Academic credit for physics work done outside of the classroom can be awarded in a variety of ways. Students must maintain a grade-point average of 1.9 or better each year in the subjects listed under this division to remain in the physics option. Ph Option Requirements The first five requirements should be completed by the end of the second year. In planning a program, note that Ph 6 and Ph 7 are each offered only once per year, in the second and third terms, respectively. The pass/fail option cannot be exercised for any courses used for these requirements with the exception of courses that do not offer grades. 1. Ph 3.1 2. Ma 2 and Ma 3. 3. Ph 12 abc. 4. Ph 6. 5.

Ph Required Electives 1. 90 units of Advanced Physics Electives, in addition to the above, Historical Sketch323include any of the following: any Ph, APh, or Ay, course num - bered 100 or above, or any of Ph 5, Ph 22, Ph 78, Ph 79, ACM 95, ACM 101, APh/EE 23, Ma 5, Ma 108, or up to 10 units for Ay 20 - 21. Nine units towards the 90 unit requirement will be given for taking three terms of Ph 77. Students are encouraged to take ACM 95 or the quarter of Ph 129 that covers analysis as part of this requirement. The pass/fail option cannot be exer - cised for any courses used for this requirement with the excep - tion of ACM 95 and courses that do not offer grades. Not more than 36 units of Ph courses numbered 200 or above taken on a pass/fail basis may apply toward this requirement. No more than 18 units of Ph 171-172 may apply toward this requirement with - out permission from the Undergraduate Option Representative. Additionally, Ph 171-172 may only apply toward this requirement if taken in increments of six units or more and a written summa - ry (2-4 pages in length) of the work completed is submitted to the Undergraduate Option Representative within 2 weeks of the beginning of the subsequent quarter. Students may also petition the Undergraduate Option Representative to request that cours - es from other options with suitable physics content apply toward this requirement. 2. Nine units of science and engineering electives outside of Ph, Ay, APh, Ma, and ACM. These units are in addition to the required Core science electives. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including the courses listed above.

The option emphasizes formal tools like game theory, social choice theory, and formal political theory along with quantitative methodologies to test those theories. In addition, the option encourages original research. The design of the political science option ensures that students will be well suited to pursue careers in government or the private sector, as well as to pursue graduate work in political sci - ence, law, or public policy. Students who complete the political science option can expect the following learning outcomes: an understanding of and ability to use the theoretical tools of social choice and game theory as applied to politics; an understanding and knowledge of how to apply quantitative methods to study politics; the ability to present complex theoretical and quantitative material in research reports and presentations; and the skills necessary to pursue graduate education and careers in law, government, politics, or public policy. Note: The official source on requirements for graduation is the Caltech cat - alog from the year in which a student began studies at Caltech. Please see Historical Sketch325the catalog online, from this and previous years, for information regarding the applicable option requirements. PS Option Requirements 1. PS 12, PS 132, Ec 122. 2.

STRUCTURAL MECHANICS MINOR (SM) This minor is intended to supplement one of Caltech's undergrad - uate degrees and is designed for students who wish to broaden their knowledge beyond their normal major, especially for those who wish to join the structural engineering profession after graduation or pur - sue a graduate degree in structural mechanics or structural engineering. Students completing the structural mechanics minor requirements will have the phrase \"minor in structural mechanics\" added to their aca - demic transcripts. SM Minor Requirements The student must complete 54 units of classes selected from Ae/AM/ CE 102 abc, AM/CE 151, Ae/CE 221, Ae/CE 165ab and CE 160 ab, and obtain a grade of B- or higher. Courses taken as part of the struc - tural mechanics minor are counted toward the total 486-unit Institute graduation requirement. VISUAL CULTURE MINOR (VC) The minor in Visual Culture provides students with an intensive educa - tion in visual histories and theories. Visual Culture minor students will become familiar with a range of visual forms, from the traditional fine arts to film and digital media, as well as with histories and theories of vision and visuality. Students will also learn essential skills of visual and media literacy through both close formal analysis of objects and contextualized readings that emphasize differences across history and geography. Visual Culture courses emphasize writing and critical read - ing of both written texts and images, including through practice-based courses taught by artists in residence, in order to help students to develop communication skills that can enhance their careers as scien - tists, engineers, and medical professionals. The Visual Culture minor also provides excellent preparation for those seeking careers in any field that involves extensive written, oral, and/or visual communication. Visual Culture Minor Requirements Visual Culture minors must take 72 units of Visual Culture courses. These units may include one freshman humanities course; they may also include one directed reading course (VC 90). Students wishing to do a minor in Visual Culture must declare a minor with the Visual Culture option representative. All courses to be counted toward the minor in Visual Culture must be taken for grades with the exception of: a) one directed reading course, and b) a freshman humanities course in Historical Sketch327Visual Culture when taken in the first two quarters of the freshman year. Students completing the Visual Culture minor requirements will have the phrase \"minor in Visual Culture\" added to their transcripts. 1. 72 units of Visual Culture courses numbered 99 or above. 2. Nine units of freshman humanities in Visual Culture (courses cross-listed Hum/VC numbered 60 or below) may be substituted for any nine of the 72 units required for the minor. 3. Nine units of VC 90 [directed reading] may be substituted for any nine of the 72 units required for the minor. Courses used to complete the Visual Culture minor may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another option or minor. However, these courses may be used to satisfy core Institute requirements in the humanities. Graduation Requirements328 Graduate InformationSection Four Information for Graduate Students 329 Historical Sketch Graduate Policies and ProceduresThe Institute offers graduate degrees of Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy, and in special cases the degree of Engineer. The Institute is organized into six academic divisions: Biology and Biological Engineering; Chemistry and Chemical Engineering; Engineering and Applied Science; Geological and Planetary Sciences; the Humanities and Social Sciences; and Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy. Graduate work at the Institute is further organized into graduate options, which are supervised by those professors whose interests and research are closely related to the area of the option, within the admin - istrative jurisdiction of one or more of the divisions. A faculty member serves as the representative for an option. The option representative provides consultation on academic programs, degree requirements, financial aid, etc., and provides general supervi - sion to graduate students in the option. The Committee on Graduate Studies, which includes the option representatives, elected members of the faculty at large, and graduate students appointed by the Graduate Student Council, exercises supervision over the scholastic require - ments established by the faculty for all advanced degrees, provides policy guidance to the dean of graduate studies, and certifies all candi - dates for graduate degrees to the faculty for their approval. A list of the option representatives for the current academic year can be found at registrar.caltech.edu/current-students/option-reps. GRADUATE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ADMISSION TO GRADUATE STANDING Application An application for admission should be completed online through the Graduate Office at gradoffice.caltech.edu/admissions. Admission is granted once a year to a limited number of students who show promise for scholarship and research at the highest level. Completed applications are due between December 1 and January 1, for enrollment at the begin - ning of the fall term of the following year. Applicants will automatically be considered for financial aid; no additional application is required. To be admitted to graduate standing, an applicant must have received a bachelor's degree, or the equivalent, representing the completion of an undergraduate course in science or engineering related to one of the options offered by the Institute. Applicants must, moreover, have attained a scholastic record and provide recommendations to indicate the ability to pursue, with distinction, advanced study and research. The graduate program thrives on exceptional individuals from a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences, and we highly encourage applications from members of groups underrepresented in science and engineering. Graduate admission is covered by Caltech's Nondiscrimination Policy. For more information on this policy, please refer to page 63. Applicants should refer to the Graduate Office website for additional requirements, a list of supporting documents, and option-specific appli - cation deadlines. 330 Graduate InformationInternational Students In order to be admitted for graduate study, students from non-En - glish-speaking countries are expected to read, write, and speak English and comprehend the spoken language. Although not required for admission, for applicants whose native language is not English or have not received a degree from a university or college where English is the primary language of instruction, it is important to demonstrate a strong capability in English prior to admission to Caltech. This can be done by self-reporting scores from the Educational Testing Service (TOEFL), Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE Academic), the Cambridge Examinations and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), or other services that provide a certified English-language pro - ficiency examination. All international students are evaluated upon arrival at Caltech and, if it is determined that additional instruction in English is needed, they will be assigned to an English as a Second Language (ESL) course. To be a candidate for an advanced degree, the student must have clear self-ex - pression in both oral and written English. VISITING STUDENT APPOINTMENTS A limited number of visiting student appointments are made each year. Visiting student status is restricted to students who hold a bachelor's degree and are current graduate students at another institution. The invitation process requires sponsorship by a Caltech faculty member, and requests should be made directly to the Graduate Office, following the visiting student instructions on the Graduate Office website. The dean of graduate studies may limit the number of visiting students in any given year. Visiting students are subject to the Honor System (see page 20) and other Institute policies and are under the purview of the dean of graduate studies. Visiting students are categorized into two main classifications. Special Students Special Students enroll as full-time students (36 units), in a research course and/or coursework numbered 100 or higher, which may be transferred to their home institution. Special Student appointments are allowed for one year, renewable each year up to a maximum of three years. Special Students will not be considered to be working toward a Caltech degree, and courses taken under this program cannot be used to fulfill the requirements for a Caltech degree, nor does registration count toward the minimum residency requirement for an advanced degree. Special Students are eligible for the same privileges as regular - ly enrolled graduate students, and will be billed for tuition and fees. Short-term Special Students that do not need academic credit must still enroll in a research class for a minimum number of units and will be billed tuition and fees based on the level of enrollment and the length of stay. For those students who receive a Caltech stipend, tui - tion remission will be charged to the faculty hosts' supporting grant to cover the tuition and fees assessment. Special Students who do not 331 Historical Sketchreceive a Caltech stipend will be billed a reduced tuition and fees rate. (For current rates, see the expense summary on page 342.) Visiting Student Researchers The Visiting Student Researcher status is limited to short-term vis - its of one month to one year and is not renewable. Visiting Student Researchers are not eligible to enroll in a research course and/or coursework, and will not receive academic credit from Caltech, but will receive a Caltech identification card. Visiting Student Researchers are also required to provide proof of health insurance and any required medical and immunization records for the duration of the visit. Students in this status are not eligible to receive a salary through the Institute payroll, and are not eligible for Caltech privileges that are extended to enrolled students. They may be reimbursed for research-related expenses only, but it is the Caltech faculty host's responsibility to ensure that the supporting grant can be used for such purposes and that there are no restrictions on spending. Students receiving a salary through the Institute payroll and/or requiring a transcript to transfer academic credit must be appointed as Special Students. Exchange Programs Some academic options have formal exchange programs that they have arranged with other institutions. Exchange students must have a visiting student appointment, and the type of appointment will depend upon the terms of the agreement for the particular exchange program. These programs are administered by the option, and requests should be made directly to the Graduate Office following the same procedure for visiting students. GRADUATE RESIDENCE One term of residence shall consist of one term's work of not fewer than 36 units of advanced work in which a passing grade is recorded. Advanced work is defined as study or research in courses whose des - ignated course number is 100 or above. If fewer than 36 units are suc - cessfully carried, the residence will be regarded as short by the same ratio, but the completion of a greater number of units in any one term will not be regarded as increasing the residence. In general, the resi - dency requirements are as follows: for Master of Science, a minimum of three terms of enrollment; for the degree of Engineer, a minimum of eight terms of enrollment; and for Doctor of Philosophy, a minimum of 12 terms of enrollment. REGISTRATION Graduate students are required to register for each term, including summer, whether they are taking classes, conducting research, doing independent reading, writing a thesis, or utilizing any other academic service or campus facility. A graduate student must be registered for a minimum of 36 research and/or course units to be classified as a full-time student, and may not enroll in excess of 36 research units. A graduate student who registers Graduate Policies and Procedures332 Graduate Informationfor less than 36 total units, or who undertakes activities related to the Institute aggregating more than 62 hours per week (in class, research, and teaching assistantship units), must receive approval in advance from the dean of graduate studies. A petition for this purpose may be obtained from the Graduate Office website and must carry the recom - mendation of the option representative of the student's major option before submission. Graduate students register during a two-week period each quarter. A late registration fee of $50 is assessed for failure to register on time. Graduate students with a Bursar's bill balance of $1,500 or more may have a hold placed on their registration for the subsequent term the day before online registration opens. The hold will be released once students have paid their bill or worked out a satisfactory payment plan with the Bursar's Office. Before registering, students should consult with their adviser. An adviser is assigned to each entering graduate student by the option representative. In most options, a new adviser is assigned when the student begins research. Only members of the professorial faculty may serve as advisers. With the approval of the dean of graduate studies, any graduate student whose work is not satisfactory may be refused registration at the beginning of any term by the division in which the student is doing their major work. See the section on Satisfactory Academic Progress for more information. In registering for research, students should indicate the name of the instructor in charge, and should consult with the instructor to determine the number of units to which the proposed work corresponds. At the end of the term, the instructor in charge may decrease the number of units for which credit is given if the instructor feels that the progress of the research does not justify the original amount. Students will not receive credit for courses unless they are properly registered. Students themselves are responsible for making certain that all grades to which they are entitled have been properly recorded. Please note that graduate students who enroll in courses numbered below 100 will not receive credit for those courses unless the course(s) is specified in the requirements for a graduate degree as stipulated in the Caltech Catalog . All changes in registration must be reported to the Registrar's Office by the student. Such changes are governed by the last dates for add - ing or dropping courses as shown on the Academic Calendar on pages 4 and 5. A student may not withdraw from or add a course after the last date for dropping or adding courses without the option's consent, written approval from the instructor of the relevant course, and the approval of the dean of graduate studies. If the withdrawal occurs after Add Day of any term, a W (standing for \"withdrawn\") will be recorded on the student's transcript for all courses in which the student is enrolled. A grade of W is not included in the computation of the student's grade-point average. General Administrative Requirements Graduate students are required to have continuity in registration, main - tain full-time status, make satisfactory progress, and be in residence 333 Historical Sketchuntil all requirements for a degree are fulfilled. This means that students must either be registered, enrolled or on an approved leave from the Institute. Reduced duty status maintains registration for a student who cannot carry a full load due to a medical condition, disability or pregnan - cy. Registration is required for the term in which the thesis defense is undertaken, with the exception of the first week of each term. Approval of the dean is required for any student seeking to enroll for a subse - quent term beyond the defense during the academic year. Once the degree is conferred, further enrollment as a graduate student is not permitted. Detached duty status maintains registration for a student doing research at an external location, such as a national laboratory or anoth - er academic institution, for an extended period. Students are entitled to at least two weeks' annual vacation (in addition to Institute holidays), and they should arrange their vacation schedules with their research advisers early in each academic year. Any questions should be referred to the graduate studies Office. GRADUATE STUDENT LEAVES OF ABSENCE Petitions for Leave Petition forms for leaves may be obtained from the Graduate Office website and must, before submission to the dean, carry the acknowl - edgment of the student's option representative and, where appro - priate, the thesis adviser. Petitions for medical leave must carry the recommendation of the executive director of student wellness services or their designee. In case of a lapse in status, readmission must be sought before academic work may be resumed or requirements for the degree completed. While on Leave A student on a personal, medical or involuntary leave may not attend classes, live in Institute housing, participate in Institute programs, use Institute facilities, work on campus, or use student resources such as Student Wellness Services and Center for Diversity. Career Advising and Experiential Learning (CAEL) is, by default, open to all students who have not been permanently separated from the Institute, regard - less of leave or registration status, unless otherwise revoked by the director of CAEL. Voluntary Leave Personal Leave A student may request a voluntary leave of absence for personal reasons by submitting a personal (non-medical) leave petition to the Graduate Office for approval. International students should consult with the International Student Programs (ISP) office regarding visa impli - cations prior to submitting the leave petition. The dean may grant a personal leave provided (a) the student is making satisfactory academic Graduate Policies and Procedures334 Graduate Informationprogress as determined by the student's adviser, (b) the leave is for one year or less, although special circumstances can be considered for a longer leave, and (c) the leave extends over a period that includes at least one full term. A petition to return from a personal leave should be submitted six (6) weeks before the first day of the term for which the student intends to return. Return from a personal leave is subject to the approval of the dean and the student having an approved adviser and ongoing fund - ing to support the student's research. If a student does not anticipate having an adviser upon return, they will need to work with the option representative to arrange for funding and a new adviser in advance of the return. Return will only be granted once an adviser and funding are in place. Medical Leave If a student is unable to complete their coursework or other course of study due to medical reasons, the student may petition for a med - ical leave of absence by submitting a medical leave petition to the Graduate Office for approval. The petition for medical leave must be recommended by the executive director of Student Wellness Services or their designee. International students should consult with the International Student Programs office regarding visa implications prior to submitting the medical leave petition. Medical leaves are expected to extend over a period that includes at least one full term, although special circumstances may be considered for approval of a shorter leave upon the recommendation of a student's treatment team. Students must provide documentation of the need for the leave by a licensed treatment provider. Students may be required to sign a release of information form authorizing their treatment provider to communicate relevant medical information to representatives within Student Wellness Services and the Graduate Office to facilitate evaluation of the need for the leave and to determine appropriate conditions associated with the leave and establishing expectations for return from the leave. The Institute may impose conditions on return from a medical leave, which may include confirmation from the student's health care provider that the student is following the recommended course of treatment, the student's consent for the provider to discuss the student's condition or progress during the leave with Caltech officials, including represen - tatives of Student Wellness Services and the Graduate Office, and an independent evaluation of the student's readiness to return by a qual - ified medical professional. Any conditions of return will be specified at the time of the leave approval. A petition to return from medical leave must be submitted six (6) weeks before the anticipated term for which the student intends to return. The return process includes an interview with the director of Student Wellness Services or their designee and the submission of a completed return from medical leave petition and provider recommen - dation. Students are expected to sign a release of information form authorizing their treatment providers to communicate with Caltech, including representatives of Student Wellness Services and the 335 Historical SketchGraduate Office to determine readiness to return and any recommen - dations for reasonable accommodations. Return from a medical leave of absence is subject to the final approval of the dean. If the student is permitted to return from the leave, any conditions of return will be com - municated to the student in writing. A student returning from a leave for medical reasons will maintain the same academic standing that they had prior to the leave and will be subject to the same academic requirements for maintaining academic progress. Additional information and resources regarding medical leave, including financial and transcript implications, can be found at www. gradoffice.caltech.edu/current/LeavePolicy. Pregnancy Consistent with Caltech policy, the requirements of Title IX, and Section 66281.7 of the California Education Code, students who are unable to complete their coursework or other course of study for a period of time due to a pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions are eligible for a pregnancy leave of absence. Students who are pregnant or who have recently given birth are also eligible for reasonable accom - modations. Students are not required to take a leave of absence, withdraw, or limit their graduate studies because of pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions. However, students who are disabled due to pregnancy, child - birth and related medical conditions are eligible to take a pregnancy leave of absence. The Institute provides up to six (6) weeks of pay to students during a pregnancy leave of absence; an additional 6 weeks of pay is available through family bonding leave (see following section). A pregnant student who wishes to take a pregnancy leave should submit a pregnancy leave petition to the Graduate Office. Medical documentation from the student's treating health care provider may be required. A student who chooses to take a leave of absence because they are pregnant or have recently given birth shall be allowed an additional period commensurate with the length of the leave, but not to exceed 12 additional months, to prepare for and take preliminary and qualifying examinations and an equal extension of time toward the normative time to degree while in candidacy for a graduate degree, unless a longer extension is medically necessary. An enrolled student in good academic standing who chooses to take a leave of absence because they are pregnant or have recently given birth shall return to their program in good academic standing following an approved leave period of up to one academic year, subject to the administrative requirements described above, unless there is a medical reason for a longer leave, in which case standing in the graduate pro - gram shall be maintained during that period of the leave. The Institute also provides reasonable accommodations to pregnant students consistent with federal and state law. Reasonable accommo - dations may include allowing pregnant students to maintain a safe dis - tance from hazardous substances, allowing them to make up tests and assignments that are missed for pregnancy-related reasons or excusing of absences that are medically necessary. Graduate Policies and Procedures336 Graduate InformationBonding Students may take six (6) weeks of family bonding leave with pay. An enrolled student in good academic standing who chooses to take a leave of absence because of the recent birth or adoption of his or her child may request a bonding leave by submitting a bonding leave peti - tion to the Graduate Office for approval. Bonding leave is in addition to pregnancy leave, providing eligible students with a combined total of up to 12 weeks of paid leave. Students returning from an approved bonding leave shall return to his or her program in good academic standing following the leave, subject to the administrative requirements described above. Dependent Care Leave Graduate students may take an unpaid leave for the purpose of full- time dependent care due to child care, school closings, and other dependent needs that require students to take a break from their studies. Students planning on taking this leave should first schedule a meeting with one of the graduate deans. Under this leave, students are eligible to retain existing benefits, including health and dental. If in Caltech housing, students may remain for up to one term while on dependent care leave. Please note that students with dependent care needs may instead request a reduced course load by submitting an underload petition. Involuntary Leave The dean or designee may determine that it is necessary to place a student on an involuntary leave in a variety of circumstances, including when a student demonstrates behavior that poses a threat to health or safety, causes significant disruption to the Caltech community, for the personal safety or welfare of the student involved, as an interim measure, or as a result of a disciplinary action. The dean may impose an involuntary leave in appropriate circumstances, such as where a student's behavior: (1) has, or threatens to, cause significant property damage; (2) significantly disrupts the Caltech community; (3) presents a substantial risk of harm to self or others; (4) indicates the student is unable or unwilling to carry out self-care obligations; or (5) violates a Caltech policy or the honor system. An involuntary leave also may be imposed when the student requires a level of care from the Institute community that exceeds the reasonable accommodations, resources and staffing that the Institute can reasonably be expected to provide for the student's well-being. Review and Decision Process If the conduct has been the subject of an investigation or review under an Institute process or procedure, the dean will consider the findings and conclusions reached in that process. In other circumstances described above, in making an informed decision to place a student on involuntary leave, the dean will conduct an individualized assessment and consider relevant information including information provided in a timely manner by the student. 337 Historical SketchThe dean may consult with other Institute personnel, including but not limited to Security and Residential Life personnel, faculty, staff and other individuals or departments. If appropriate and feasible, the dean may seek cooperation and involvement of parents or guardians of the student. Medical information, including medical information provided in a timely manner by the student, may be considered if the behavior is associated with a physical or mental condition. In appropriate cases, the dean may consult with the executive director of Student Wellness Services or their designee and/or require a physical or mental evalua - tion from a health professional if the dean believes such an evaluation is necessary in order to make an informed decision. Students are expected, if necessary, to sign a release of information to facilitate discussions between Caltech and the health professional conducting the evaluation. The dean will also consider whether relevant risk factors can be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level through reason - able accommodation. Written Decision The student will be advised in writing of the decision to impose an involuntary leave. The dean may stipulate conditions that must be met before the student may return. An involuntary leave may be a perma - nent separation from the Institute (i.e. expulsion); for a specific dura - tion; or until certain conditions have been met. If the involuntary leave is not a permanent separation, the student will be advised of the length of the leave and/or any conditions for return. Emergency Leave If the dean determines that a student's continued presence is likely to pose a substantial risk to the safety and well-being of the student or others, the dean may place the student on an emergency interim leave before a final determination is made. The dean will make reasonable attempts to meet with the student and consider relevant information provided by the student, if available within the timeframe needed to make a decision, before deciding on an emergency interim leave. An emergency interim leave will remain in effect until a final decision has been made. Return from Leave A student on involuntary leave will not be allowed to return until the dean makes a fact-specific assessment of the circumstances, consid - ers relevant risk factors, and concludes that the student does not pose a significant disruption to the functioning of the Institute community and/or does not pose a substantial risk to the health and safety of the student or others. The dean will consider relevant information, including information provided by the student. In cases where a student has a physical or mental condition associated with the behavior triggering the leave, the dean will also consider whether the relevant risks can be eliminated by a reasonable accommodation. The dean may consult with other Institute administrators, as appropriate, in making their deci - Graduate Policies and Procedures338 Graduate Informationsion. The student will be notified in writing of the dean's determination of whether the student will be permitted to return from a leave, will not be permitted to return from the leave, or will be permanently separated from the Institute. If the student is permitted to return from the leave, any conditions of return will be communicated to the student in writing. Appeal If a decision by the dean to place a student on involuntary leave is imposed as a sanction resulting from a finding of responsibility under an Institute process or procedure, appeal rights and limitations, such as limitations on grounds for appeal, are governed by the applicable Institute process or procedure. In all other cases, a decision by the dean to place a student on involuntary leave may be appealed in writ - ing within 10 days to the vice president for student affairs (or designee). GUIDELINES FOR GRADUATE STUDENT ADVISING The relationship between a faculty adviser and graduate student should be founded on mutual respect and open communication. Advisers and students should discuss the nature of their working relationship early and continue this discussion throughout their period of collaboration to ensure mutually understood and compatible expectations. These discussions should be frequent and open, and should include not only work, research goals, and performance reviews, but also change of sta - tus, time for personal and family responsibilities, time off, and concerns about academic or work situations. Both the student and adviser have the obligation to initiate meetings as necessary to ensure the success of the relationship. After achieving candidacy, each Ph.D. student should be assigned a thesis advising committee consisting of a minimum of three professorial faculty members. This committee typically meets at least once a year beginning after candidacy or the fourth year of graduate study. The graduate student-faculty adviser relationship should be guided by norms of fairness and professionalism. Both faculty and graduate students should avoid relationships that conflict with their respective roles and duties at Caltech. Both are bound by the prevailing policies prohibiting discrimination and harassment (Nondiscrimination Policy, page 63; Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct, page 67, and Unlawful Harassment, page 118). Concerns relating to academic or work situations should be raised promptly between the persons directly involved, and handled informally if possible. Both students and advisers have the responsibility to raise and address concerns and conflicts promptly, honestly, and in a manner that conforms with academic integrity and professionalism. Caltech policy requires that students' concerns be addressed fairly and promptly, and prohibits retaliation or discrimination against students for appropriately voicing or raising a concern. If a problem remains unresolved or if direct discussion is not possible, a student can seek assistance from division officers (e.g., option representatives) or the graduate deans. At any time, a student may request that discussions remain confidential. For more details about sources of assistance, consult the graduate option regulations 339 Historical Sketch(starting on page 344) and the Student Problem Resolution Process (page 42). PART-TIME PROGRAMS Part-time graduate study programs at the Institute are for master's seeking graduate students who cannot devote full time to their studies and such students are subject to the following rules: Degree Programs Applicants for the part-time master's program must submit a regular application form accmpanied by a detailed plan for meet - ing the course requirements for the degree. Any research work done for academic credit shall be supervised by a Caltech faculty member. In general, students admitted to the part-time program are required to take at least 27 units of graduate course work and/or research each term. The part-time program is limited to two years of academic resi - dence. Any option at the Institute retains the right to not participate in the program or to accept it under more stringent conditions. Non-degree Programs Caltech employees, both campus and JPL, are eligible to apply to take one or more graduate courses for credit. Participants in this program will not be considered to be working toward a Caltech degree, in con - trast to the part-time program for graduate degrees described above, and courses taken under this program cannot be used to fulfill the requirements for a Caltech degree. At least one month prior to the start of the term, the employee should have an initial discussion with the option representative of the option in which the course is to be taken. Application should be made to the Graduate Office by completing the special form provided for this purpose, and providing a transcript of academic work and a letter of recommendation. The employee must meet the prerequisites for the course, and must obtain the written permission of the instructor. The decision on admission to take each course will be made by the course instructor and the option representative, with final approval by the dean of graduate studies. Taking an additional course at a later time will require full reapplication. It is the employee's responsibility to arrange a revised work schedule with the appropriate supervisor and approval of the employee's supervisor is required. Part-time non-degree students are subject to the Honor System (see page 20) and are under the purview of the dean of graduate studies. They may take only courses numbered 100 or higher and research courses are excluded from the program. For courses in which a letter grade is offered, these students may not register to receive a pass/ fail grade in the course, nor can credit for the course be obtained by examination. The option may limit the number of non-degree students admitted to any one course. Graduate Policies and Procedures340 Graduate InformationRESPONSIBLE CONDUCT OF RESEARCH Caltech researchers are expected to adhere to the highest professional standards in the conduct of research. Faculty members are charged by the Institute with the responsibility to safeguard the basic principles of research integrity, academic freedom, and public interest. Students are expected to also follow these same principles. When government funds are involved in the support of research, investigators are required to take specific steps to adhere to all rules and regulations of the govern - ment and sponsoring agencies. Students are required to have specific training in research ethics and integrity as well as conform to standards established by research supervisors or their laboratories. There are two situations in which this is mandated by federal law. National Institutes of Health Students that are funded through NIH grants, work with human or vertebrate animal subjects, or are required as part of their academ - ic option's curriculum, have to meet a NIH requirement for training in specified areas as described in the Caltech Guide to Sponsored Research. In order to meet the NIH requirement, Caltech requires that all trainees supported by NIH funds take Biology course 252 \"Responsible Conduct of Research.\" National Science Foundation Training in Responsible Conduct of Research is also required of stu - dents funded on NSF awards, including the GRFP program. In order to satisfy the NSF mandate, Caltech requires that students supported from NSF funds as described above shall take the online course on Research Ethics Education (CITI). If a student can document having passed a similar, qualifying pro - gram at another institution, Caltech may accept that in lieu of complet - ing Caltech's program. You must submit documentation in the form of a transcript or certificate to the Graduate Office to receive credit for previous work. A passing grade in Bi 252 is an acceptable alternative to passing the CITI online Responsible Conduct of Research course. CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND COMMITMENT OF GRADUATE STUDENTS The Institute has a long-standing philosophy that all graduate students should be given the opportunity to be completely focused on graduate studies and research. This is one of the unique aspects of Caltech's graduate school and a key factor in the high level of productivity and accomplishment by our graduate students. To enable this, the faculty and Institute provide financial aid in the form of fellowships, tuition scholarships, graduate teaching, and research assistantships. The stipend and salary levels for students are modest but sufficient for economical students to live debt-free during their graduate studies. The financial support provided by the Institute and the requirements for continuous enrollment also enable almost all students to complete the degree programs in a timely manner.341 Historical SketchIn turn, the Institute expects that graduate students should be 100 percent committed to graduate studies while enrolled in a graduate program. Graduate students are expected to be continuously enrolled full-time, year-round, until they complete their degree program. In addi - tion, graduate students should not accept employment, start or run a business, or engage in any activity inside or outside of the Institute that creates a conflict of commitment with their full-time, degree-seeking status. Exceptions There are some very limited exceptions to this policy. The Institute encourages extracurricular activities that provide service to the com - munity and do not impact the student's academic progress or full-time status. The Institute also recognizes that some students desire to gain experience as instructors or work in an educational or research setting outside of Caltech. Outside Employment Students must have the approval of their adviser, the option represen - tative, and the dean of graduate studies in order to engage in any out - side employment activities. Once permission is granted, students may engage in employment of up to one day per week (8 hours) for a limit - ed-duration for these purposes (see Financial Assistance, page 354). Students must declare to the dean of graduate studies all external funding, including fellowships, awards, or employment, part- or full-time, which supports their academic activities/research. The Institute may adjust Institute financial aid allocated accordingly to maintain the stipend within the Institute guidelines and to recover tuition from outside sources whenever possible. A student's financial aid and/or Institute salary may be reduced if the income is significant, and in the case of long-term, unreported employment activities, the student may be asked to repay financial aid. Students may not hold a position of line responsibility in an outside enterprise for pay or profit. International students on a visa are further required to consult with the office of International Student Programs to determine eligibility. Students must provide official documentation of the financial award or salary, as well as submit a request to the Graduate Office before accepting any employment. Permission to engage in outside employ - ment is contingent on the student maintaining satisfactory academic progress as determined by the dean of graduate studies in consultation with the adviser and option representative. Non-Paid Activities Students must have the approval of their adviser, the option repre - sentative, and the dean of graduate studies in order to engage in or continue in any outside activities wherein the time committed to those activities may impact the student's progress toward completion of degree requirements. Graduate Policies and Procedures342 Graduate InformationLeave of Absence Students who work full-time off campus in a commercial organization are expected to take a personal leave of absence. They will not be enrolled during this time, and the \"clock\" will stop on their graduate career. Taking a leave of absence in order to work requires the endorse - ment of the adviser and permission of the dean of graduate studies. A leave of absence is always required when the job is not directly related to thesis research. Students who need to stop their studies to address health issues should take a medical leave of absence, which requires the endorsement of Student Wellness Services as well as the permis - sion of the dean of graduate studies. Detached Duty In some cases, a student may be engaged in research at an external laboratory or research institute under the supervision of a Caltech faculty adviser, and conducting research that is directly related to their degree program. Another situation is that a student may be invited to be a visiting researcher at another university, or the student may need to be working with a faculty member who has left Caltech and is working at another institution. Students may go on detached duty rather than on leave of absence if the adviser and dean of graduate studies approve and there is documen - tation of a research program integral to their thesis project and appropriate mentoring. Students on detached duty should have completed their res - idency requirements and advanced to candidacy prior to moving to the host institution. The student should submit the documentation and a petition form to the Graduate Office. Students on detached duty are still enrolled as full- time students but are in residence at another location. They may be paid by Caltech or through another organization. It is the student's responsibility to continue to be in good standing, and registered and in full-time status while on detached duty. Detached duty petitions are usually valid for a lim - ited time, less than one year, and may be renewed upon request. Consulting and Other Entrepreneurial Activities Graduate students are sometimes approached to perform paid consulting or are inspired to be entrepreneurs. In these cases, students have to be exceptionally careful not to create conflicts of commitment or conflicts of interest through these activities. Students considering these activities should familiarize themselves with the Caltech policies on conflict of interest, outside employment or business activity, and the Caltech ethics handbook. Students may not engage in any consulting activities that inter - fere with their primary graduate student activities of learning and research. Scrupulous care must be taken to ensure that Caltech's name and its let - terhead are used neither directly in any correspondence between the stu - dent and the company the student wishes to consult for, nor in any reports that student may submit to the company. Of particular concern are students consulting or accepting employ - ment from a company in which their adviser or other Caltech faculty member is directing a student's research and has a significant interest 343 Historical Sketchor is a paid consultant. In such cases, the division chair must approve any student involvement in the activities performed for the company. The student must submit a written disclosure, and a conflict manage - ment plan will be put in place. Graduate students should not enter into any consulting or employment agreement with intellectual property encumbrances or confidentiality provi - sions that are in conflict with the student's commitments to Caltech or that may compromise academic progress. Please refer to the Graduate Office website for the complete policy and regulations regarding conflicts of commitment and interest. If there are any questions about the propriety of any outside activity or agreements, this should be discussed with the Graduate Office and, if necessary, the Office of Research Compliance and the Office of the General Counsel. WORKING AT SPECIAL LABORATORIES Students who desire to take advantage of the unique opportunities available at one of the special laboratories (e.g., JPL) for Ph.D. thesis work may be allowed to do so provided that they maintain good con - tact with academic life on campus, the laboratory involved commits financial support for the duration of the thesis research, and all Caltech graduate thesis research carried out at a special laboratory is under the supervision of Caltech faculty members. A student's request to carry out thesis work at a special laboratory should be formally endorsed by the appropriate committee of his or her option and by the special laboratory, on a petition submitted through the option representative to the dean of graduate studies. The special laboratory should recognize its commitment of special equipment or any other resources required for the thesis work. Approval by the spe - cial laboratory should also indicate that the thesis topic is a sensible one, and that it is not likely to be preempted by the laboratory. A student may take similar advantage of unique opportunities at a corporate or governmental research and development facility under the same conditions, providing that there exists a formal written agreement between the R&D facility and the student's thesis adviser, and that advance written approval is obtained from the dean of graduate stud - ies. Such training may in some cases involve full-time employment at the laboratory for a limited period of time for the purpose of engaging in the essential data collection that is integral to a student's thesis. Typically, such students who are not in a local laboratory are placed on detached duty status. Employment by a special laboratory of a graduate student for work not connected with the thesis should be regarded as equivalent to other outside employment. EXCHANGE PROGRAM WITH SCRIPPS INSTITUTION OF OCEANOGRAPHY An exchange program with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), University of California, San Diego, permits Caltech graduate students to enroll in and receive credit for graduate courses offered by SIO. Arrangements should be made through the student's major Graduate Policies and Procedures344 Graduate Informationoption and the Graduate Office. The student must obtain the advance approval of the instructors of courses to be taken at SIO. In some cases, arrangements may be made for the student to be temporarily in full-time residence at SIO. Thesis research done partly at SIO may be arranged directly by the student's option and the staff of the appropriate research laboratories at SIO, without the necessity of enrolling for SIO courses designated for research; in this case the student will continue to be under the supervision of the Caltech thesis adviser and will enroll for Caltech research units. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATE DEGREES DEGREE OF MASTER OF SCIENCE The Master of Science degree is a professional degree designed to prepare a student for teaching, for further graduate studies, or for more advanced work in industry. Detailed requirements are based primarily on professional studies, and the program should be planned in consultation with the faculty in the appropriate discipline. Under normal circumstances, the requirements for the master's degree can be completed in one academic year. Students must declare candidacy for the master's degree no later than the academic year in which the final degree requirements have been met or upon separation from the Institute. Students who are pursuing a doctoral degree and obtain a Master's along the way, must declare candidacy for the Master's no later than two weeks prior to conferral of the Ph.D. A student who enters the Institute holding a master's degree from another institution will not normally be awarded a second master's degree in the same field. A student will not be awarded two master's degrees from the Institute. Special regulations for the master's degree are listed under each graduate option. Several options do not offer a master's degree except in special circumstances. Residence and Units of Graduate Work Required At least one academic year of residence at the Institute and a minimum of 135 units of graduate work at the Institute subsequent to the bacca - laureate degree are required for the master's degree. Included in these units are at least 27 units of free electives or of required studies in the humanities numbered 100 or above. Advanced courses taken while enrolled as a Caltech undergraduate student in excess of the bache - lor's degree requirements may be counted toward the master's degree requirements with the approval of the academic option representative and the dean of graduate studies. To qualify for a master's degree, a student must complete the work indicated in the section on special regulations for their option with a grade-point average for the approved Master's candidacy courses of at least 1.9.345 Historical Sketch Graduate Degree RequirementsIn special cases, with the approval of the instructor, option represen - tative, and the dean of graduate studies, courses taken elsewhere before enrollment at the Institute may be offered in place of specifically required courses. An examination may be required to determine the acceptability of such courses. Course credit, if granted, shall not count toward the 135- unit and residency requirements. Admission to M.S. Candidacy By the third term of the academic year in which the student expects to receive the degree, candidates should have completed a plan of study in Regis, which must have the approval of the option representative and, in some cases, of the research adviser. This approved plan of study will constitute requirements for the degree. Any modifications to the plan of study must be approved by the option representative no later than two weeks before the degree is to be conferred. Some options require a thesis or research report in addition to course require - ments. The thesis or research report must be approved by the research adviser and option representative no later than two weeks before the degree is to be conferred. For additional information and option-spe - cific requirements, please refer to the section \"Special Regulations for Graduate Options.\" Joint B.S./M.S. Degree In exceptional cases, undergraduate students may be eligible to pur - sue a joint B.S./M.S. program of study to be completed within the four years (12 terms) of the undergraduate program. Students should con - tact the graduate option representative to find out if the joint B.S./M.S. degree is offered in a particular option. If so, students must follow the normal procedures for admission to the graduate program. Students admitted to the joint B.S./M.S. degree must complete a minimum of 486 units for the B.S. program and an additional 135 units for the M.S. program with no overlapping of courses. In addition, a written plan of study must be submitted to the Registrar's Office for approval no later than the fall term of the senior year. The plan of study should provide detail of the courses that are proposed to satisfy each degree require - ment within the 12 terms of the B.S. program and once approved shall constitute the requirements for the degree. Any changes to the plan require written approval by the Registrar. If not completed within the four years, students will be removed from the joint program and they, and all their courses, will be attached to the B.S. program. Students enrolled in the joint B.S./M.S. degree will be considered undergraduate students and will not be eligible for graduate financial aid, graduate housing, or other graduate student privileges. ENGINEER'S DEGREE Engineer's degrees are awarded in exceptional circumstances. The work for an engineer's degree must consist of advanced studies and research in the field appropriate to the degree desired. It must conform to the special requirements established for that degree and should be planned in con - sultation with the members of the faculty concerned. Students who have been admitted to the terminal master's degree and wish to pursue further 346 Graduate Informationstudies leading toward either the engineer's or the Ph.D. degree must file a petition (and in some cases must file a new application) to continue graduate work toward the desired degree. Students who have received an engineer's degree will not be admitted for the Ph.D. Residence At least eight terms of graduate residence subsequent to a Bachelor's degree equivalent to that given by the Institute are required for an engineer's degree. Of these, at least three terms must be at Caltech. It must be understood that these are minimum requirements, and students must often count on spending a somewhat longer time on graduate work. To qualify for an engineer's degree, a student must complete the work prescribed by the supervising committee with a grade-point average of at least 1.9. Research work and the preparation of a thesis must constitute no fewer than 55 units. More than 55 units may be required by certain options, and the student should determine the particular requirements of their option when establishing a program. Admission to Candidacy Before the midpoint of the first term of the academic year in which the student expects to receive the degree, they must complete a proposed plan of study and, in consultation with the chair of the appropriate division, will select a committee comprised of at least three members of the professorial faculty to supervise the student's work and to certify its satisfactory completion. The student should consult with this com - mittee in planning the details of their work. The plan of study shall then constitute the requirements for the degree. Any modifications must be approved by the option representative at least two weeks before the degree is conferred. The student will be admitted to candidacy for the degree when the supervising committee certifies (a) that all the special requirements for the desired degree have been met, with the exception that cer - tain courses of not more than two terms in length may be taken after admission to candidacy; (b) that the thesis research has been satisfac - torily started and can be finished at the expected date; (c) that the can - didate demonstrates competence in oral and written English. Admission to candidacy should be obtained by the midpoint of the term in which the degree is to be granted, but no later than the aca - demic year in which the final degree requirements have been met or upon separation from the Institute. Thesis At least two weeks before the degree is to be conferred, each student is required to submit a thesis in accordance with the regulations that govern the preparation of doctoral dissertations. These regulations may be obtained from the Graduate Office website. The use of \"classified'' research as thesis material for any degree will not be permitted. Exceptions to this rule can be made only under spe - cial circumstances, and then only when approval is given by the dean of graduate studies before the research is undertaken.347 Historical SketchExamination At the discretion of the option in which the degree is desired, a final examination may be required. This examination would be conducted by a committee appointed by the candidate's supervising committee. DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) is conferred by the Institute pri - marily in recognition of breadth of scholarship, depth of research, and the power to investigate problems independently and efficiently, rather than for the completion of definite courses of study through a stated period of res - idence. The work for the degree must consist of research and the prepa - ration of a thesis describing it, and of systematic studies of an advanced character, primarily in science or engineering. In addition, the candidate must have clear self-expression in both oral and written English. Subject to the general supervision of the Committee on Graduate Study, the student's work for the Ph.D. degree is specifically directed by the division in which they have chosen the major subject. Each student should consult with their division concerning special divisional and option requirements. Admission With the approval of the dean of graduate studies, students are admit - ted to graduate standing by the option in which they choose their major work toward the Ph.D. degree. In some cases, applicants for the Ph.D. may be required to complete requirements for the M.S. degree first; however, this is not a general prerequisite for the Ph.D. Students who have received an Engineer's degree will not be admitted for the Ph.D. degree. A student who holds a Ph.D. or the equivalent from another institu - tion will not normally be admitted to graduate standing at Caltech to pursue a second Ph.D. degree. A student will not normally be awarded two Ph.D. degrees from the Institute. Minor Programs of Study The Institute does not require a minor for the Ph.D. degree, but the individual options may have minor requirements as part of their require - ments for the major. A student may undertake a minor program of study in most options as specified in this catalog under the section \"Special Regulations of Graduate Options.\" Completion of a minor program of study is recog - nized on the diploma by the statement \"...and by additional studies constituting a minor in [name of option].\" A minor program of study should be at a level of study in the minor substantially beyond that typically acquired by students as part of their major requirements. Most options require 45 units or more, including at least one 200-level course and a coherent program of the supporting 100-level courses. The faculty of the minor option may approve a pro - posed minor program on the basis of overall class performance and/or by an oral examination. Detailed requirements for minor options are listed under the individu - Graduate Degree Requirements348 Graduate Informational options. Students cannot use courses required by their major option in fulfillment of the minor requirement. Residence At least three academic years (12 terms) of residence subsequent to a baccalaureate degree equivalent to that given by the Institute are required for the Ph.D. Of this, at least one year (4 terms) must be in residence at the Institute. It should be understood that these are minimum requirements, and students must usually count on spending a somewhat longer time in residence. A student whose undergraduate work has been insufficient in amount or too narrowly specialized, or whose preparation in their special field is inadequate, should plan upon spending increased time in work for the degree. However, no student will be allowed to continue work toward the Ph.D. degree for more than six academic years (24 terms) of graduate residence, without a petition approved by the dean of graduate studies. This petition must include a plan and schedule for completion, agreed upon and signed by the student, the thesis adviser, and the option representative. Registration Continuity of registration must be maintained until all requirements for the Ph.D. have been completed, with the exception of authorized leaves. Registration is typically required for the term in which the thesis defense is undertaken. Thesis Advisers and Committee Chairs The thesis adviser must be a professorial faculty member, defined as professor, associate professor, or assistant professor on a full-time, tenure-track appointment at Caltech. Research faculty and emeritus faculty can supervise research, but the official thesis adviser must be a member of the professorial faculty. Expectations for the relationship between graduate students and faculty advisers are discussed under Guidelines for Graduate Student Advising (page 338). Progress through the graduate program is monitored in part by the candidacy, thesis advisory, and thesis examination committees detailed in the following sections. Each committee has a chair who is respon - sible for running the meeting, summarizing the outcome, and working with the graduate student and adviser as appropriate. The chair of each committee is a professorial faculty member distinct from the adviser. Admission to Candidacy On the recommendation of the option concerned, the dean of graduate studies will admit a student to candidacy for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy after the student has been admitted to work toward the Ph.D. and has been in residence at least one term; has initiated a program of study approved by the major option and, if needed, by the minor option; has demonstrated, by written or oral examination, a comprehensive grasp of the major and minor subjects and of subjects fundamental to them; has displayed the ability for clear self-expression in both oral and written English; and has shown ability in carrying on research in a sub -349 Historical Sketchject approved by the option concerned. Option regulations concerning admission to candidacy are given in a later section. Depending upon option regulations, candidates will either be assigned a candidacy committee by the option representative or must independently select appropriate members to serve on the candidacy committee. A candidacy committee consists of a minimum of three members, two of whom must be professorial faculty. Emeritus faculty, research faculty, JPL staff and external scholars may serve on the can - didacy committee, with approval of the option representative and the dean of graduate studies in advance of the candidacy examination. The student should ensure that all members of the committee are available during the examination period and that they are willing to provide timely and appropriate feedback. A student not admitted to candidacy by the end of the third year or twelfth term of graduate residence at the Institute must petition the dean of graduate studies for permission to register for further work. Candidacy (and permission to register) may be withdrawn by formal action of the option from a student whose research is not satisfactory, or for other compelling reasons. However, the option must petition through its division chair to the dean of graduate studies before taking such action. Thesis Advisory Committee Each Ph.D. student is assigned a Thesis Advisory Committee consisting of a minimum of three professorial faculty members. Emeritus faculty, research faculty, JPL staff and external scholars may serve on the thesis examination committee with approval of the option representative and the dean of graduate studies. Following candidacy, or by the fourth year of graduate study, a student will have an annual meeting as specified by the option with either the thesis advisory committee, the committee chair, or the option representative (if not the advisor), to discuss progress towards completing the thesis and future plans. Thesis Examination Each Ph.D. candidate shall undergo broad oral examination on the major subject, the scope of the thesis, and its significance in relation to the major subject. The thesis examination, subject to the approval of the dean of graduate studies, may be taken after admission to candidacy whenever the candidate is prepared; however, it must take place at least three weeks before the degree is to be conferred. The thesis examination may be written in part, and may be subdivided into parts or given all at one time at the discretion of the options con - cerned. The student must declare their intent to defend by completing the examination notification in Regis not less than two weeks before the date of the examination. A thesis examination committee consists of four members, with a minimum of three professorial faculty. Emeritus faculty, research faculty, JPL staff and external scholars may serve on the thesis examination committee with approval of the option representative and the dean of graduate studies in advance of the thesis examination. Graduate Degree Requirements350 Graduate InformationThesis At least two weeks before the final oral examination, the candidate should provide a draft copy of a completed thesis to the Graduate Office for proofreading and to the members of the thesis examination committee. The date of the examination and the composition of the thesis examination committee should be posted in Regis at least two weeks before the final defense is scheduled. In general, registration is required for the term in which the thesis defense is undertaken. Approval of the dean of graduate studies is required for any student seeking to enroll for subsequent terms following the thesis defense. A student not receiving Caltech funding, may petition the dean of graduate studies for a tuition waiver if the student schedules the examination by the third Friday of the term in which the examination will be taken. The last date to upload the final, corrected thesis is the fifth week of the succeeding term if the candidate defended their thesis during the previous summer or the fall or winter terms; or two weeks before the degree is to be conferred if the candidate defended their thesis during the month of May. It is required that all Ph.D. candidates submit an electronic copy of their dissertation, which the Caltech Library will then archive and make available online as part of the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD), an international organization that allows researchers to globally search a database of electronic theses and dissertations. For special option regulations concerning theses or the exam composition, see specific graduate options. Before uploading the final, corrected thesis, it is the candidate's respon - sibility to obtain approval of the thesis by the option representative and all members of the thesis examination committee. With the approval of the option concerned, a portion of the thesis may consist of one or more articles published jointly by the candidate and members of the Institute staff or other coauthors. In any case, however, a substantial portion of the thesis must be the candidate's own exposition of their own work. The use of \"classified'' research as thesis material for any degree is not permitted. Exceptions to this rule can be made only under special circum - stances, and then only when approval is given by the dean of graduate studies before the research is undertaken. Regulations and directions for the preparation of theses may be obtained from the Graduate Office website, and should be followed care - fully by the candidate. Thesis templates are also available on the Library website, as is information regarding thesis deposits, embargo policies and copyright issues. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS In order to continue in a degree program and to receive financial aid at Caltech, graduate students must maintain satisfactory academic prog - ress toward completion of their degree. Continuity of registration must be maintained until all requirements for the degree being sought have been completed, with the exception of authorized sabbaticals. The Master of Science degree requires at least three terms of residence at the Institute and a minimum of 135 units of graduate work with a grade- point average of at least 1.9. A master's degree cannot take more than two years without a petition approved by the dean of graduate studies.351 Historical SketchThe Engineer's degree must consist of advanced studies and research in the field appropriate to the degree desired. At least eight terms of grad - uate residence are required with a minimum 1.9 overall grade-point aver - age. The Engineer's degree cannot take more than 12 terms to complete without a petition approved by the dean of graduate studies. For the Doctor of Philosophy, at least 12 terms of residence are required, but the necessary study and research typically can be complet - ed in six years or less. The work for the degree consists of research and the preparation of a thesis describing it, and of systematic studies of an advanced character, primarily in science or engineering. The requirements for each degree include special regulations estab - lished by each option and detailed in the Institute Catalog for the year of initial registration. Many options require a C grade or better in particular courses or groups of courses. Hence, a limited number of courses may be repeated while still maintaining a status of satisfactory academic progress and would count toward the 36-unit-per-term requirement. A full- time graduate student must register for (and complete) 36 units per term, including the summer term. Approval of the dean of graduate studies is required before dropping any course that brings a student below 36 units. The treatment of incomplete grades and withdrawals is specified on pages 30-34. Satisfactory academic progress is checked each academic term by the Graduate Office. The special regulations for the options typically include the completion of specific courses, oral and/or written examinations, petitions, research requirements, etc., by specific times. Satisfactory academic progress is judged by the options against these regulations, and revocation of permis - sion to register may be recommended by the option to the dean of gradu - ate studies prior to or in response to the student's petition for admission to candidacy. Further, even after admission to candidacy, the candidacy (and permission to register) may be withdrawn by formal action of an option for a student whose research is not satisfactory, or for other compelling reasons. However, the option must petition through its division chair to the dean of graduate studies before taking such action. A decision to revoke or withdraw permission to register may be appealed in writing within ten days to the vice president for student affairs or designee. A Ph.D. student who has not been admitted to candidacy by the beginning of the fourth year (12 terms) must petition the dean of graduate studies for permission to register for further work. In addition, no Ph.D. student will be allowed to register for more than 24 terms without a peti - tion approved by the dean of graduate studies. This petition must include a plan and schedule for completion, agreed upon and signed by the student, the Thesis Advisory Committee chair, and the option representative. GRADUATE EXPENSES The tuition and fees charge for all students registering for graduate work is currently $58,467.00 per academic year, payable at the beginning of each term, fall (9/27/2021), winter (1/3/2022), and spring (3/28/2022). Graduate students who cannot devote full time to their studies are allowed to register only under special circumstances. Students desiring permission Graduate Expenses352 Graduate Informationto register for fewer than 36 units must therefore petition the dean of grad - uate studies for an underload. The payment of tuition by graduate students is required (a) without ref - erence to the character of the work by the student, which may consist of research, independent reading, or writing a thesis or other dissertation, as well as attendance at regular classes; (b) without reference to the number of terms in which the student has already been in residence; and (c) with - out reference to the status of the student as an appointee of the Institute, except that members of the academic staff of rank of instructor or higher are not required to pay tuition. Unpaid Bills All bills owed the Institute must be paid when due. Any student whose bills are past due may be refused registration for the following term. All gradu - ate students with an outstanding bursar's bill balance of $1,500.00 or more will have a hold placed on their registration for the subsequent term the day before online registration opens. Diplomas will not be released until the bursar's account is paid in full. Caltech ID Card Charges If a graduate student owes more than $1,500.00, the student's charging privileges will be suspended. Charging privileges will be reactivated once students have paid their bill in full with the Bursar's Office. EXPENSE SUMMARY 2021-2022 General: Tuition and fees $58,467.00 Other: General Deposit $100 Books and supplies (approx.) $1,428.00 Contact Bursar's Office for audit fee.

A penalty fee of $50 is assessed for failure to register within five days of the scheduled dates. Honor System Matters Monies owed to the Institute resulting from a disciplinary matter may be collected through the Bursar's Office, at the request of the dean of graduate studies. Housing Facilities The Catalina Central complex provides approximately 152 single rooms in four-bedroom furnished units. Another, Catalina North, has 156 sin - gle rooms in two-bedroom furnished units, and Catalina South has 78 single rooms in two-bedroom furnished units, and 29 one-bedroom fur - nished units. These apartments are also available to married or coupled students. Rates for housing vary, depending upon the accommodations and services provided. A contract is required to live in these houses for the academic year. Complete information can be obtained at www.housing.caltech.edu. There is one Residential Life Coordinator (RLC) and four Resident Associates (RAs) in the Catalina Complex. An RLC is a specially trained full-time university employee, specializing in college student develop - ment, community building, counseling, and crisis intervention. The RLC supervises the RAs on programming and overall student wellness. The RLC also assists Housing with the management and daily operations of the complex. There are also Catalina Community Associates (student volunteers) who work with the RLC and RAs on programming and com - munity building in the Catalinas. The Institute also owns a limited number of apartments and sin - gle-family houses that are available for rental, on a lease basis, to sin - gle or married/partnered graduate students or graduate students with families. Because of limited availability, there is a waiting list for these properties. For additional information and application, go to housing. caltech.edu. Students preferring to live in non-Institute housing typically pay approximately $1,000 to $1,300 per month/each, in rent for a shared apartment, and somewhat more for a private apartment. Please note that the Institute cannot make negotiations for individual housing off campus. Dining Facilities Graduate students are granted the privilege of joining the Athenaeum (faculty club), which affords the possibility of contact with fellow graduate students and with others using the Athenaeum, including the Associates of Caltech, distinguished visitors, and members of the professional staffs of the Huntington Library and the Caltech. The Chandler Dining Hall, located on the campus, is open Monday Graduate Expenses354 Graduate Informationthrough Friday. Breakfast, lunch, and snacks are served cafeteria style. Caf\u00e9 at Broad is open for lunch, Monday through Friday. Health Services Health services available to graduate students are explained in section one of this Catalog. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Caltech offers in each of its options a number of fellowships, tuition schol - arships, and graduate assistantships. In general, tuition scholarships may be for full or partial tuition charges; assistantships provide stipends; and fellowships often provide both tuition scholarship awards and stipends. Graduate assistants are eligible for tuition awards. Appointments to fellow - ships, scholarships, and assistantships are decided yearly by the student's academic option. Graduate students receiving any form of financial award from the Institute are required to report to the dean of graduate studies any finan - cial aid from other sources. With prior written approval from the dean of graduate studies, students may be allowed to accept outside employment if the time commitment does not interfere with their graduate studies. The number of hours per week spent on outside employment must be reported to the dean of graduate studies. GRADUATE ASSISTANTSHIPS Graduate assistants help with teaching, laboratory work, or perform research of a character that affords useful academic experience while permitting a full academic schedule of courses. The specific research and teaching obligations of graduate assistants are agreed upon with the adviser. Caltech graduate students often receive a combination of teaching and research assistantships; however, the total work commitment cannot exceed 20 hours per week during the academic year. Summer appoint - ments can be greater, with assignments up to 40 hours per week. A grad - uate student who undertakes activities related to the Institute aggregating more than 62 hours per week (in class, research assistantship, and teach - ing assistantship hours) must petition the dean of graduate studies. Graduate assistant stipends are based on four quarters paid monthly throughout the year. Students are also entitled to two weeks of annual vacation and Institute holidays. Students should prearrange their vaca - tion schedule with their adviser. When necessary, graduate assistants may arrange for medical leave, pregnancy leave, bonding leave, or per - sonal leave. Any questions should be referred to the dean of graduate studies. Teaching Assistantships A full teaching assistantship usually requires 20 hours per week to be devoted to teaching and to the related activities of class preparation, grading, and consulting with students. In general, teaching obligations are confined to the 12 weeks of the academic terms, excluding summer. 355 Historical SketchA student may not be a teaching assistant for a course in which they are enrolled. Only teaching assistants with good oral English and who have fulfilled the Institute English proficiency requirement are permitted to teach sections. All teaching assistants, including undergraduate students with teaching responsibilities, are required to attend teaching-assistant training before payment can be processed. Training sessions are conducted by the Center for Teaching, Learning, and Outreach (CTLO) and occur in the first week of the fall term, typically during orientation, and at least once per term. Teaching assistants must familiarize themselves with Caltech's policy on harassment (see page 118) and follow other policies related to teach - ing discussed in the required training. Classes should foster academic achievement in a \"hassle-free\" environment. Teaching assistants should not attempt to date a student in their class, and should disqualify them - selves from teaching a section in which a spouse or current partner is enrolled. Please see the Graduate Studies Office for additional policies informa - tion at www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/financialsupport/assistantships . Research Assistantships Research assistantships typically are 20 hours per week during the aca - demic year, but can be as much as 40 hours per week during the summer. The specific duties are decided upon by the adviser. Graduate Scholarships, Fellowships, and Research Funds The Institute awards endowed fellowships and scholarships for tuition and/ or stipends to graduate students of exceptional ability. Students are also strongly encouraged to apply for scholarships and fellowships from federal and private agencies and organizations to support their graduate studies. Loans Several types of loans are available to graduate students. To qualify for any of these, a student must demonstrate financial need and must maintain satisfactory academic progress in the course of study for which they are enrolled. Application forms and further information are available from the Financial Aid Office. Refund and Repayment Policy Caltech has established an equitable refund policy for students who find it necessary to withdraw or take a sabbatical from the Institute. Students who officially withdraw or take a sabbatical from the Institute during an academic term may receive a tuition refund (see page 355). Students living in Caltech housing may also be eligible for a partial refund from the Housing Office. When granting refunds to financial aid recipients or graduate assistants, it is Caltech's policy to return the refund, in most cases, to the original account.

The programs are designed to provide intense education in the foundations of the aeronau - tical and space sciences, with emphasis on research and analytical, com - putational, and experimental methods. Entering graduate students should have a thorough background in undergraduate mathematics, physics, and engineering science. In working toward a degree in aerospace, a student may pursue major study in one of the following areas: physics of fluids, physics of solids and mechanics of materials, structural mechanics, space technology, compu - tational solid mechanics, computational and theoretical fluid dynamics, aeronautical engineering and propulsion, biomechanics of fluids and sol - ids, technical fluid mechanics, control of aerospace systems and materials. While research and course work in the aerospace option at the Institute cover a very broad range of subjects, a choice of one of the above fields allows students to focus their activities while taking advantage of the flexibility offered by the breadth of interests of the Graduate aerospace Laboratories (GALCIT). In consultation with his or her adviser, a student will design a program of study in one of the above fields, consisting of the fundamental courses described in the regulations for the separate degrees listed below, and of electives selected from the list of aerospace-related courses. This will ensure that the graduating student will be well-qualified for a career in aerospace and related fields. Examinations, Committees, and Student Responsibilities To help students achieve satisfactory progress in their academic pursuits, the aerospace faculty provides for the following committee and individual support. Upon beginning the first year of the aerospace program, each student is assigned a faculty (course) adviser whose research field matches the interests of the student as described in the student's statement of purpose in his or her admissions application. The first-year adviser will guide the student in choosing a set of courses appropriate to the students' interests while ensuring the first-year academic requirements (see below) are met. Students wishing to pursue studies leading to the Ph.D. must select and be accepted by a research adviser by the end of the spring term of the first year of residence and are required to pass a qualifying exam - ination in the first term of the second year. Having passed the qualifying examination, the student pursues research under the supervision of the research adviser until they are ready to enter candidacy for the Ph.D. At Special Regulations364 Graduate Informationthis point, a four-member Candidacy Examination Committee that includes the student's research adviser is assembled and administers a Candidacy Examination to ensure the student has the appropriate knowledge and tools to successfully complete his or her chosen research activities. The Candidacy Committee is chaired by a faculty member other than the research adviser. The Candidacy Examination should be administered by the start of the second term of the third year of residence, but in any case, must be successfully completed by the end of that year in order to comply with Institute requirements. Conferral of the Ph.D. degree is contingent on satisfactorily passing the thesis examination before a committee consisting of four examiners, which may, but does not need to, have the same membership as the Candidacy Committee. Students may find further information concerning special option requirements and the requisite option forms on the GALCIT website. AE Master's Degrees Master's Degree in Aeronautics and Master's Degree in Space Engineering The master's degree program in aeronautics or space engineering is a one-year program that provides advanced training in the areas of aero - nautics or space engineering beyond that covered in a four-year under - graduate program. The program consists of a set of five core courses (see details below). There is no research requirement, nor is a thesis required to obtain the degree. The courses required for the master's degree must be completed in one year. Admission Students whose highest qualification is a baccalaureate degree equiva - lent to that given by the Institute are eligible to seek admission to work toward the master's degree. Students are asked to submit course tran - scripts and letters of recommendation as well as evidence of English language proficiency as detailed in the graduate application. The GRE exam is not required and submitted scores will not be considered for the 2021 admissions process in Aerospace. It should be noted that the graduate program at GALCIT is primarily focused on Ph.D.-level research and so priority in admission is given to those who plan to ulti - mately perform Ph.D.-level research. Course Requirements A program of study consists of courses totaling at least 135 units; of these, at least 81 units must be chosen from one of the following cur - ricular tracks: Aeronautics track Two 27-unit course sequences chosen mechanics (Ae/APh/CE/ME 101 abc) Solid/structural mechanics (Ae/AM/CE/ME 102abc) Autonomy and control (CDS 131, Ae 103ab), 27 units Experimental methods (Ae 104abc), 27 units.365 Historical SketchSpace Engineering track One 27-unit course sequence chosen from: Fluid mechanics (Ae/APh/CE/ME 101abc) Solid mechanics (Ae/AM/CE/ME 102abc) Autonomy and control (CDS 131, Ae 103ab), 27 units Space engineering (Ae 105abc), 27 units. aerospace students in either the Aeronautics or Space Engineering track are required to enroll in a sequence of mathematics courses totaling 27 units appropriate to the student's chosen track and selected in coor - dination with their first-year advisers. Examples of appropriate courses include ACM/IDS 104, ACM 100ab, ACM 101ab, etc. Finally, all first-year students are required to enroll in aerospace Engineering Seminar (3 units Ae 150abc). A grade of C or higher must be achieved in all the required classes unless they are only offered pass/fail, in which case a pass must be achieved in each class. For both the Aeronautics and Space Engineering master's degrees, the remaining 27 units are elective and are to be chosen from courses at Caltech that support the broader goals of the respective programs, subject to the approval of the student's adviser. Students must have a proposed program of courses approved by their adviser prior to registration for the first term of work toward the degree. Admission to More Advanced Degrees Students who successfully complete the requirements for the master's degree and who wish to pursue the more advanced degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) must file a petition to continue work toward the desired degree. All students working for the Ph.D. degree are expected to register for and attend the advanced seminar (Ae 208 abc) for a peri - od of at least two years. AE Degree of Doctor of Philosophy Admission Students with a baccalaureate degree equivalent to that given by the Institute are eligible to seek admission to work toward the degree of doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) in aeronautics or space engineering. Students are asked to submit course transcripts and letters of recommendation as well as evidence of English language proficiency as detailed in the graduate application. The GRE exam is not required and submitted scores will not be considered for the 2021 admissions process in Aerospace. Course Requirements The course requirements for the first year of the Ph.D. degree are identical to those of the master's degree. Students admitted to graduate study for the Ph.D. degree must complete in their first year a course of study that would qualify them for the master's degree described above. The student may elect to receive the master's degree at the end of their first year after completion of these courses. Special Regulations366 Graduate Information Research Adviser Students wishing to pursue studies leading to the Ph.D. must select and be accepted by a research adviser preferably by the end of their third quarter but no later than the end of their first year of study and prior to tak - ing the qualifying examination described below. Qualifying Examination After the first year of graduate study, the student must pass a qualifying examination. The objective of the qualifying examination is to determine if the student is properly prepared and qualified to pursue problems typical of Ph.D.-level research by demonstrating fundamental under - standing of the first year courses in the topic area of the exam. The exam also evaluates effective oral communication of technical material as a skill that is required for professional development. The exam will cover the following subjects: Aeronautics track Two areas chosen from: Fluid mechanics Solid/structural mechanics Autonomy and control Mathematics Space Engineering track One area chosen from: Fluid mechanics Solid/structural mechanics Autonomy and control Mathematics The material covered in these examinations is at the same general level and breadth as covered in the corresponding first-year courses. The examinations are typically offered during one week in the first half of the fall term, in the second year of graduate residence at the Institute. A student is examined orally on all topics. In the event of an unsatisfactory performance, the examining faculty members may permit a repeat examination in the appropriate topics. The repeat examination must be scheduled prior to finals week of the winter term and must be completed before the end of the spring term of the same year. Graduate Teaching Assignment Duties GALCIT provides opportunities to students to improve their teaching and communication skills that are valuable in many contexts. Ph.D. students are required to perform a minimum of 18 term hours of Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) duties within the aerospace Department during their terms of residence. GTA duties will be assigned after the first year in residence and will be based on courses a student has completed. Candidacy367 Historical SketchTo be recommended for candidacy for the Ph.D. in aerospace, the applicant must have satisfactorily completed at least 135 units of graduate work equivalent to the above Master of Science program; pass, with a grade of C or better, 27 units of graduate-level mathematics courses beyond ACM 95/100, and ACM/IDS 104; complete (with a grade of C or better, or Pass) at least 45 units of aerospace courses numbered Ae 200 or higher, or Ae/ME 118, Ae/ME 120, EE/Ae 157, Ae 159, Ae/Ge/ME 160 and Ae/CE 165ab, excluding research and seminars; and complete three units of the advanced seminar Ae 208. A proposed program conforming to the above regulations must be approved by the student's adviser and the option representative prior to add day of the first term of work toward the degree. In addition to fulfilling these course requirements, the applicant must pass a candidacy examination in the third year of residence at the Institute. This exam should be administered by the start of the second quarter of the third year of residency. This examination aims at determining whether the student is successful in integrating formal course work into a mature understanding of fundamental engineering concepts, and at demonstrating his or her professional competence in applying these concepts to the problems being addressed in the course of their Ph.D. research. Minor No minor is required for the Ph.D. degree. Students are, however, encouraged to take advanced courses appropriate to their particular interests or pursue a minor in consultation with their adviser. Foreign Languages The student is encouraged to discuss with his or her adviser the desir - ability of studying foreign languages, but there is no formal foreign lan - guage requirement for the Ph.D. Thesis and Final Examination Prior to graduation, each candidate is required to give a seminar pre - senting the results of his or her thesis research. For final examination and thesis completion, see also the general degree requirements and the section on Examinations, Committees, and Student Responsibilities regarding aerospace starting on page 363. A description of the Institute requirements for conferral of a Ph.D. are given on page 347. Subject Minor A student majoring in a field other than aerospace may, with the approval of the option representative, elect aerospace as a subject minor. A minimum of 54 units in subjects acceptable to the aerospace faculty is required. Problem and Grievance Resolution within aerospace Special Regulations368 Graduate InformationStudents may pursue several avenues for redress concerning per - sonal and academic problems that may arise during their residency, as outlined by the Student Problem Resolution Process described earlier in the catalog. Should a student not wish to discuss the rel - evant issues with their adviser, the option representative and/or the director are always available to meet with the student. In addition, two other resources are available, one at the student and one at the faculty level. A student representative is elected annually by the aerospace graduate students at or after the Information Session, which is part of Ae 150. In the event that the student representative has completed his or her Ph.D. studies before the election date and left the Institute, the student organizer for Ae 150 may be his or her replacement. A faculty member chosen by the aerospace faculty to provide support for the students is available for student contact. The names of the current student and faculty support persons are avail - able in the aerospace office. Educational Exchange Program with \u00c9cole Polytechnique An educational exchange program is offered by the aerospace option with \u00c9cole Polytechnique (EP). In this exchange program, students selected for participation from Caltech will enroll for one year at EP . Correspondingly, students selected for the program from EP will enroll for one year at Caltech. To be eligible to participate, aerospace students must have completed one full year of study (for Caltech students this is equivalent to the requirements for the M.S. degree) and agree that they will spend one full year at EP . First year (G1) graduate students enrolled in Caltech's doctoral aerospace program will be apprised of the opportunity to participate in an edu - cational exchange program at the master's level at EP . A maximum of two student(s) will be selected by the aerospace faculty from the pool of students who express interest in this program. Caltech stu - dents will follow their first (master's) year at Caltech, and their sec - ond year in the second-year master's (M2) program at EP . Caltech students must fulfill the requirements of their first-year program and receive their Caltech M.S. diploma prior to proceeding to EP . Caltech students must register at Caltech during the year spent at \u00c9cole Polytechnique and enroll in the special topics course Ae 240 - Educational exchange at \u00c9cole Polytechnique. This ensures that they maintain their standing as enrolled graduate students at Caltech. It is implied that classes taken at one institution cannot duplicate classes already taken at the other institution. The expec - tation is that Caltech students will return to Caltech after completing the EP program and continue with their doctoral studies at Caltech. Caltech students should be prepared to take the qualifying exams in the fall term when they return from EP . Caltech students participat - ing in the Caltech/EP educational exchange program will be consid - ered to be on detached duty from Caltech while at EP . A detached duty agreement will be executed for each student that spells out the terms and requirements for the detached duty.369 Historical SketchAPPLIED AND COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS (ACM) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program Caltech's Computing & Mathematical Sciences department offers an interdisciplinary program of graduate study in applied and computational mathematics leading to the Ph.D. degree. This program is designed to give students a thorough training in fundamental computational and applied mathematics and to develop their research ability in a specific application field. The fields of application include a wide range of areas such as fluid mechanics, materials science, and mathematical biology, engineering applications, image processing, and mathematical finance. The training essential for future careers in applied mathematics in academia, national laboratories, or in industry is provided by completion of the requirements for a Ph.D. degree in applied and computational mathematics. The research areas and interests of the applied and computational mathematics faculty cover a broad spectrum, including nonlinear dynam - ics, computational biology, numerical analysis and scientific computing, computational and theoretical fluid mechanics, theoretical materials sci - ence, multiscale computations and homogenization theory, computational methods for electromagnetics and acoustics, statistics, signal and image processing, probability theory and stochastic analysis, and dynamical systems and geometric mechanics. As reflected by the faculty research activities, there is a strong emphasis on computational methods for solving challenging problems arising from engineering and scientific applications. Reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the program, several different groups, in addition to the applied and computational mathematics faculty, contribute to the teaching and supervision of research. Students in applied and computational mathematics are expected to combine their basic mathematical studies with deep involvement in some field of application. Basic general courses are listed specifically under applied and computa - tional mathematics, and these are to be supplemented, according to the student's interest, from the whole range of Institute courses in specific areas of physics, biology, engineering, etc. A regular colloquium provides the opportunity for visitors, faculty, and students to discuss current research. Admission Each new graduate student admitted to work for the Ph.D. in applied and computational mathematics is given an informal interview on Thursday or Friday of the week preceding the beginning of instruction for the fall term. The purpose of this interview is to ascertain the preparation of the student and assist them in mapping out a course of study. The work of the student during the first year will usually include some independent reading and/or research. Course Requirements. All ACM students are required to take a total of 18 nine-unit courses at the graduate level (or the equivalent of 162 units) during their graduate study at Caltech. Among these 18 courses, the following core courses, Special Regulations370 Graduate Informationtypically taken during the student's first year of study, are required: ACM/IDS 101 ab, ACM 105, CMS/ACM/IDS 107, Ma 108 abc ACM/EE 106 ab, CMS 117, and an application elective course. The application elective course in the first year is selected, with the recommendation of the student's adviser, from among a wide range of courses offered by an outside option within the Institute. In addition, CMS 290 is required for all first year ACM graduate students during each term (fall/winter/ spring). In the second and third years, students are expected to take graduate-level courses appropriate to their chosen research area. The remaining courses towards the 162 unit requirement would normally include graduate-level ACM or CMS courses such as CMS/ACM/EE 122, ACM 201, 210, ACM/IDS 216, ACM/IDS 217, etc., as deemed appropriate to the student's research program, and which must be selected in consultation with the student's research adviser. Students who have already taken some of the required courses may use them to satisfy the course requirements, even though the units may not be used to satisfy the total unit requirement for the Ph.D. degree. ACM Master's Degree Students are not admitted to work toward the master's degree. The master's degree may be awarded to an ACM student only in excep - tional circumstances. Of the 135 units of graduate work required by Institute regulations, at least 81 units of advanced graduate work should be in applied mathematics. ACM Degree of Doctor of Philosophy The Preliminary Examination. Toward the end of the first year, all incoming students must take a preliminary examination administered by the faculty. Its purpose is to ensure a solid and broad knowledge in applied and computational mathematics, and in the event of a deficiency, to direct the students to necessary course and reading. The Candidacy Examination To be recommended for candidacy for the Ph.D. degree in applied and computational mathematics, all students must, in addition to meeting the general Institute requirements and passing the preliminary exam - ination, pass a candidacy examination administered by a committee that consists of at least four faculty, is approved by the option repre - sentative, and is chaired by the student's research adviser. The exam - ination will ascertain the student's breadth and depth of preparation for research in the chosen area. The examination must be taken within the first three years of residence. Advising and Thesis Supervision Upon passing the preliminary examination, the student is required to choose a thesis supervisor who assumes the major responsibility in supervising the Ph.D. thesis. At the same time, an advising committee consisting of three faculty members is formed to help oversee the advis - ing process. This committee should be formed no later than the third 371 Historical Sketchyear of graduate study. The student's supervisor is part of this commit - tee, but does not chair the committee. The student is encouraged to meet with the committee members informally for advice or suggestions. Joint supervision between two faculty members is also possible, as is seeking a thesis adviser outside the core applied and computational mathematics option, although in this case it is mandatory that an applied mathematics faculty member be nominated as a co-adviser. Should a disagreement of any kind occur between the student and his or her supervisor as regards the timely completion of the thesis, the student is encouraged to direct his or her concerns to the committee chair. If this is not workable, the student should feel free to consult with the option representative, the executive officer, or an applied and computational mathematics faculty member of the student's choice. If the student's concerns cannot be resolved through consultation with these individuals, the student is encouraged to pursue resolution of his or her concerns through other channels as outlined in Student Problem Resolution Process on page 42. Final Examination The final oral examination is held within four weeks after the submis - sion of the thesis. The examination covers the thesis and related areas. ACM Subject Minor The group of courses must differ markedly from the major subject of study, and must include 54 units of advanced courses in applied math - ematics and must not be simultaneously used for fulfilling a requirement of the second option. The qualifying courses exclude ACM95/100, although some flexibility is allowed depending upon the option of origin. The student must pass an oral examination whose subject is directly related to the material covered in the qualifying courses. This oral exam - ination will be waived if the student has received a grade of A in every course. APPLIED MECHANICS (AM) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program Applied mechanics (AM) research and study are offered through the Department of Mechanical and Civil Engineering (MCE). The degrees of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) and Master of Science (M.S.) are offered. In general, students who intend to work full-time toward the Ph.D. degree as a final degree objective are admitted to the Applied Mechanics Graduate Program. The M.S. degree is typically only award - ed to students who pursue the Ph.D. degree in applied mechanics at Caltech and who do not already have an M.S. degree in applied mechanics. The aim of the graduate program in applied mechanics at Caltech is to prepare students for research and professional practice in an era of rapidly advancing interdisciplinary technology. The program combines individual depth of experience and competence in a particular chosen major spe - Special Regulations372 Graduate Informationcialty, with a strong background in the basic and engineering sciences. It strives to develop professional independence, creativity, leadership, and the capacity for continuing professional and intellectual growth. AM Preparation for the Graduate Program Entering graduate students are expected to have a thorough back - ground in undergraduate mathematics, physics, and engineering. While a strong undergraduate program in applied mechanics should provide a suitable preparation, students who have not specialized in applied mechanics as undergraduates may also be admitted for graduate study. For example, an outstanding four-year undergraduate program in mathematics and sciences may provide a suitable background as well. The qualifications of each applicant will be considered individually, and, after being enrolled, the student will arrange his or her program in con - sultation with a member of the faculty. AM Master's Degree The degree of Master of Science in applied mechanics is only award - ed to students who do not already have an M.S. degree in applied mechanics. The degree will be awarded upon request by students who have fulfilled the requirements. Only in exceptional cases is there admission to the M.S. program as the final degree objective. A minimum of 138 units of courses numbered 100 or above, which meet the required master's program listed below, must be passed with a grade of at least C for completion of the master's degree in applied mechanics. All units must be taken for grades, except for courses offered only on a pass/fail basis. The M.S. degree in applied mechanics is typically completed within the first two years of residency at Caltech. Each student's program must be approved by the adviser and option representative in mechanical and civil engineering before registering for the course. Required Master's Program a) Graduate applied mechanics core (45 units). These units should provide a solid base for the student's engineering interest. The courses should be selected from the Core AM subjects listed under the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy Description and Requirements section. b) Mathematics, engineering, and research electives, except seminar courses (63 units). Research up to a maximum of 27 units. c) Free electives (27 units). Any course with a number of 100 or greater, may be selected, except that research units and seminar courses can not be included. d) Graduate Engineering Seminar, AM/CE/ME 150 abc (3 units). AM Degree of Doctor of Philosophy The Ph.D. degree in applied mechanics is focused on research. Study and research programs for the Ph.D. degree are individually planned to fit the 373 Historical Sketchinterests and background of the student. A comprehensive research proj - ect resulting in an original contribution to the field, which is documented by a thesis, is required. Institute requirements for the Ph.D. degree are described in the section on degree requirements. A minimum of three academic years in residence as a graduate student are required by the Institute, and two or more additional years are usually needed for prepara - tion of the thesis. Advising and Thesis Supervision An interim adviser is appointed for each student upon admission to a graduate degree in applied mechanics. The interim adviser will serve as the primary mentor until the student finds a research adviser. It is the responsibility of the student to find an academic and research adviser within three terms of graduate residence at Caltech. In consul - tation with the adviser, the student must form a Ph.D. Thesis Advisory Committee within four terms of graduate residence at Caltech. This committee shall consist of at least three members of the Caltech pro - fessorial faculty, with at least two members from the faculty in mechan - ical and civil engineering. The committee shall meet as requested by the student. Further, the committee shall meet annually to review prog - ress and to approve the registration of the student beyond the fifth year of graduate residence at Caltech. The adviser and the Thesis Advisory Committee provide the majority of mentoring to the student. In addition, the Option Representative and other members of the faculty are always available to provide advice and mentoring on any aspect of research, progress toward the Ph.D., future careers, and other aspects of life in graduate school and as a professional scientist. Admission to Candidacy To be recommended for candidacy for the Ph.D. degree in applied mechanics, the student must, in addition to meeting the general Institute requirements, do the following: Obtain the agreement of a professorial faculty member to serve as his or her academic and research adviser before the end of the third term of graduate residence at Caltech. In consultation with the adviser, the student must form a Ph.D. Thesis Advisory Committee before the end of the fourth term. This committee shall consist of at least three members of the Caltech professori - al faculty, with at least two members from the faculty in mechan - ical and civil engineering. Pass both subject and research components of the oral candi - dacy examination before the end of the eighth term of graduate academic residence at Caltech. If the student has chosen a subject minor, an examination on the subject of that program may be included at the request of the discipline offering the subject minor. Complete a minimum of 195 units of courses numbered 101 or above, that fulfill the required Ph.D. program listed below. All units must be taken for grades and passed with a grade of at least a C, except for courses offered only on a pass/fail basis. Special Regulations374 Graduate InformationThe course work towards the Ph.D. degree in applied mechan - ics is typically completed within the first three years of residen - cy at Caltech. The faculty will evaluate the student's research progress, class performance, adviser's input, and oral candidacy exam results to determine whether a student will be admitted to or be able to maintain candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Required Ph.D. Program a) Applied Mechanics Core Subject (45 units): Course work in core subjects selected from the list below; pass with a grade of at AM/CE/ME 252, ME/Ge/Ae 266ab. The student may petition the mechanical and civil engineering option representative to accept alternate subjects or areas. These changes should retain core applied mechanics knowledge, should not be a sub-specialty of one of the listed areas, and should represent sufficient breadth. The approval is not automatic; such petitions are submitted rarely and many have been denied in the past. The petition must be submitted to the option representative and approved before the student registers for the course. b) Electives or Minor (63 units): Additional engineering or science courses with course number 101 or above, except seminar or research courses. Pass with a grade of at least C, courses that are approved by the Thesis Advisory Committee. These courses are intended to provide further depth and incorporate breadth. These units can be used to satisfy a minor require - ment in another option. c) Advanced mathematics or applied mathematics (27 units): Pass with a grade of at least C, chosen in consultation with adviser from the following list: ACM 101 or higher, CDS 232, Ma 108 or higher, Ph 129. The requirement in mathematics is in addition to the requirements above. d) Graduate engineering seminar (6 units): Six terms of AM/CE/ME 150 abc, within 12 terms or, 3 years, in residence at Caltech. e) Research (54 units): Successfully complete at least 54 units of research and demonstrate satisfactory research progress. Registration Beyond the Sixth Year of Graduate Residence The annual approval of the Ph.D. Thesis Advisory Committee is nec - essary for registration beyond the twenty-fourth academic term of graduate residence at Caltech. Thesis and Final Examination The thesis examination will be given after the thesis has been formally completed. This examination will be a defense of the doctoral thesis 375 Historical Sketchand a test of the candidate's knowledge in the specialized field of research. The format of the examination can be chosen from the fol - lowing two options, by the student, in consultation with their research adviser: (i) a public seminar presented by the candidate, with an open question period, followed by a private examination by the Examining Committee or (ii) a private presentation to the Examining Committee followed by the examination, with a public seminar on another date. The Examining Committee shall consist of a minimum of four voting members, three of whom must be Caltech faculty; two members must be from MCE. The Thesis Defense Committee shall be chaired by a committee member who is an MCE Caltech professorial faculty mem - ber and not the student's adviser. AM Subject Minor A student majoring in another branch of engineering or another division of the Institute may, with the approval of the faculty in the Department of Mechanical and Civil Engineering and the faculty in his or her major field, elect applied mechanics as a subject minor. The program of courses must differ markedly from the major subject of study or research, and must consist of at least 54 units of advanced courses (101 or above) approved by the faculty in mechanical and civil engi - neering. APPLIED PHYSICS (AP h) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program Applied physics is a broad field of study that lies at the intersection of physics and many other fields of science and engineering. The applied physics option at Caltech is accordingly a highly multidisciplinary pro - gram that is designed to train students in a broad spectrum of physics and engineering fields at an advanced level. Moreover, it is our goal to cultivate abilities in our graduates to apply this knowledge throughout their lives so as to make technological and scientific breakthroughs at the edge of current knowledge. APh Preparation for the Graduate Program Students admitted for graduate study can enter from a broad range of disciplines, but are expected to have a rigorous background in under - graduate mathematics, physics, and engineering. An outstanding four- year undergraduate program in mathematics and sciences may provide a suitable background as well. The qualifications of each applicant will be considered individually. After enrollment, the student will arrange a course of study and research in consultation with members of the fac - ulty and the applied physics option representative. APh Description of the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) To receive the doctoral degree in applied physics students must demon - strate the ability to formulate and execute an original program of scientific study. As part of this, a doctoral candidate is expected to develop a deep Special Regulations376 Graduate Informationunderstanding in a chosen field of specialization; to develop tools with which to assess problems outside one's field of specialization; to develop rigor and strength in the physical sciences for self-education beyond for - mal training; and to develop skills to become a productive member of the community of scholars. All students wishing to enter the program must complete a series of preparatory courses, followed by an oral candidacy exam in which the student describes their proposed topic of research and is examined on their knowledge of course subject matter. Upon passing the candidacy examination, students work towards completion of a thesis in consultation with their research adviser. The doctoral degree is awarded upon approval of a written thesis by a faculty committee, and successful defense of the thesis in a final oral examination. There is no separate mas - ter's program in applied physics. However, with the approval of the stu - dent's adviser and the applied physics option representative, the degree of Master of Science in Applied Physics may be awarded after the fulfillment of the course requirements described below. APh Advising and Thesis Supervision An interim adviser is appointed for each student upon admission to the graduate program in applied physics. Typically, this person is the applied physics option representative. In consultation with the interim adviser the student will determine a course schedule and identify a faculty research adviser. This most often occurs within the first six months of graduate residence. The faculty adviser is the student's primary mentor and the student will work in the adviser's research group to formulate and execute a plan of study leading to the thesis. In consultation with their research adviser, the student will also form a Ph.D. Thesis Advisory Committee. This four-member committee should include the student's adviser and at least three members of the Caltech professorial faculty from either the applied physics or physics options. The Thesis Advisory Committee will conduct the qualifying examination and also approve the thesis and conduct the thesis defense. The membership of this committee may change between the time of the qualifying exam and the final defense. APh Requirements for Candidacy to the Ph.D. Degree To be recommended for candidacy for the Ph.D. degree in applied phys - ics, a student must demonstrate mastery in the following five areas of pure and applied physics: Classical Physics: Mechanics and Electromagnetism Quantum Mechanics Mathematical Methods Statistical Physics and Thermodynamics Biophysics, Optical Physics, Hydrodynamics, Plasma Physics, or Solid- State Physics A. Graduate Coursework toward Candidacy In partial fulfillment of the \"mastery\" requirement a student must suc - cessfully complete a minimum of 108 units of courses numbered 101 or above from the course schedule. In addition, 4 units of APh 110ab must also be completed. All courses must be passed with a grade of at least 377 Historical Sketcha C, except for courses offered only on a pass/fail basis. Students must also complete the degree progress report online upon completion of their courses. Note: Any given class can only be used for one requirement category. Total Units 1.

Total Units Faculty Presentation Seminar for 1st Year Graduate Students 4 APh 110 a (2 units) APh 110 b (2 units) In addition to work in the classroom, students must complete a mini - mum of 27 units of laboratory or reading research through APh 200. Total Units Applied Physics Research APh 200 27 Students entering the program with advanced preparation may choose either to substitute more advanced courses in the topical areas shown or demonstrate competency by successfully passing both the midterm and final examinations. In such cases, students may petition the Applied Physics option representative to accept alternate subjects or areas. These changes should retain core applied physics knowledge, and maintain sufficient breadth. All such petitions must be submitted to the option representative and approved before the student registers for the course. Coursework towards the Ph.D. degree in Applied Physics is normally completed within the first two years of graduate residency. B. Candidacy Examination To fulfill the requirements for candidacy all students must pass an oral examination after completing their coursework. This examination must be taken before the beginning of the student's third year in residence. Students will be expected to deliver a half-hour oral presentation giving a prospectus on their proposed thesis research. Following questions on the research prospectus, a more open-ended set of questions will be posed to the student by the committee members to test general proficiency in the five areas of pure and applied physics listed above. Students who fail the oral examination on their first attempt will be given additional guidelines for further study and an opportunity to retake the examination a second and final time if the committee so recommends. Students who fail the oral examination a second time cannot continue with doctoral studies leading to the Ph.D. Upon rec - ommendation of the examining committee, however, a student may be granted a master's degree. Annual approval of the applied physics option representative is necessary for registration beyond the third year of graduate residence if the student has not completed the candidacy examination.379 Historical SketchStudents who fulfill the requirements above will be recommended for candidacy to the doctoral program and a master's degree (if applicable) in applied physics. APh Ph.D. Thesis Requirements The candidate is to provide a draft copy of the completed thesis to the members of the examining committee (typically the same as the thesis committee) at least two weeks before the final oral examination. The date of the examination and the composition of the examining committee will not be approved by the dean of graduate studies until the thesis is sub - mitted in completed form, i.e., ready for review by the dean, the members of the thesis committee, and the Graduate Office proofreader. Registration is required for the term in which the thesis defense is taken, but is not normally allowed beyond the last date of the term. For more information, please see the section entitled \"Information for Graduate Students\" in the Caltech Catalog . APh Ph.D. Final Examination The candidate shall undergo a final broad oral examination (thesis defense) in the field, to include the subspecialty represented by the thesis and the significance of its findings to the field. This oral exam - ination will be administered at least two weeks after the doctoral thesis has been presented in final form so that the examining committee has sufficient time to review its content. This examination must be taken at least three weeks prior to the date on which the degree will be officially conferred. APh Registration Beyond the Sixth Year of Graduate Residence The annual approval of the student's Thesis Advisory Committee is necessary for registration beyond the twenty-fourth academic term of graduate residence at Caltech. APh Subject Minor Graduate students majoring in other fields may elect a minor in applied physics. In addition to general Institute requirements, the student must complete, with a grade of C or higher, 81 units of courses in applied physics above the 100 level, excluding APh 200. The minor is also sub - ject to the following conditions: Students cannot use courses required by their major option in ful - fillment of this requirement. Students interested in a minor must receive prior approval from the option representative in applied physics, who will review and approve the proposed course of study. It is recommended that this course of study include advanced courses spanning different subfields of applied physics. Special Regulations380 Graduate InformationASTROPHYSICS (A y) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program The primary aim of the graduate astrophysics program at Caltech is to prepare students for creative and productive careers in astrophysical research and a variety of other challenging vocations. The astrophys - ics program emphasizes independent research by graduate students, who are free to pursue study in virtually any area of astrophysics. The opportunity exists to take advantage of the many observational facili - ties owned and operated by Caltech (see page 134). Ay Admission Incoming students should have a strong background in physics, and although a good preparation in astronomy is helpful, this is not required for admission to the graduate program. The GRE tests (general and advanced subject) are not required and scores will not be considered for admission. Ay Master's Degree While the option does not offer a master's degree program in itself, students who fulfill the general Institute requirements for such a degree, and the specific option requirements (see below), can receive a mas - ter's degree, either en route to a final Ph.D. degree if admitted to candi - dacy, or as a terminal degree if the Ph.D. requirements are not met. The choice of astronomy and other science elective courses must be approved by the option representative. At least 54 units of the 135 units must be selected from Ay 121-127, with at least 36 units earned with a grade of B- or better. The courses Ph 106, Ph 125, and Ph 129 may be required of those students whose previous training in some of these subjects proves to be insufficient. At least 27 units of advanced courses in fields other than astronomy are required. Ay Degree of Doctor of Philosophy Astrophysics Program The student's proposed overall program of study must be approved by the option representative during the first year. The following are required of all students for candidacy: Ay 121, Ay 123, Ay 124, Ay 125, Ay 126, and Ay 127. The student should take these courses in the first year. Students must also take at least one term of Ay 122 unless exempted. Also required are research and reading projects. Credit for this work will be given under Ay 142 and Ay 143. The above courses must be passed with a grade of B- or better. Electives Program The first two years of graduate study should include at least four courses (36 units) of additional electives relevant to astrophysics, with six courses (54 units) required of theory students. The electives requirement may be reduced for students who need to take Ph 106, Ph 125 or Ph 129 in order to make up for gaps in preparation at the undergraduate level. Suggested elective courses include, but are not limited to: Ph 101, Ph 105, Ph/Aph 118 a, Ph 127 b, Ph 135, Ph 136ab, Ph 236, Ph 237. 381 Historical SketchFor theory students, Ph 136 a and Ph 136 b are required, and in addi - tion to Ph, electives in applied mathematics should be considered. For students in observation and experiment, Ph 136 a and Ph 136 b are strongly recommended, and in any case at least one of the four advanced course electives must be in Ph, while the complement may be from other options such as electrical engineering, applied mechan - ics, computer science, planetary science (geophysics or geochemistry). Seminar courses and research practicum courses do not count as sat - isfying the requirement for pedagogical elective coursework; however, students are encouraged to take these types of courses during second year. No more than 18 of the elective units may be taken P/F; all oth - ers must be passed with a grade of C or better. In the third year and above, students are welcome to enroll in additional advanced astrono - my and physics courses. Other Requirements An ability to explain concepts and to verbally present one's work is vital to a successful career in research and/or teaching. To this end, all graduate students in astrophysics are required to serve as teaching assistants during their second year, and to make oral presentations as part of the course Ay 141, 3 terms of which must be taken every year by all students beginning in their second year. Graduate students for whom English is a second language may be required to demonstrate fluency in oral and written English at the time of their candidacy exam. The examining committee will arrange for an evaluation if this is deemed necessary. Admission to Candidacy To be recommended for candidacy for the Ph.D. degree in astrophys - ics, a student must, in addition to meeting the general Institute require - ments: complete satisfactorily 36 units of research (Ay 142) or reading (Ay 143); pass satisfactorily, or by special examination, the required astrophysics courses (see above); pass a general oral examination (see below); pass a thesis-related examination (see below); complete the physics course requirement (see above); satisfy a teaching requirement (generally two terms as a GTA); fulfill the language requirement if applicable (see above); and be accepted for thesis research by a member of the faculty. In fall of their second year, all students are required to take a general oral qualifying examination. Students will be examined on the sub - stance and status of, as well as their performance on, a research proj - ect, which should be started not later than the summer following the first year. They will further be examined on their broad understanding of current topics in, and fundamentals of, astrophysics. Both of these aspects of the examination are intended to evaluate the candidate's aptitude for a research career in astrophysics. In addition, at the discre - tion of the executive officer, students who have not done well in one, or Special Regulations382 Graduate Informationat most two, areas covered in the Ay 12x course series during their first year will be retested in these areas during the examination. Students must pass all of the aspects of this examination, as judged by the fac - ulty committee conducting it, in order to continue in the Ph.D. program. Students who do not meet the minimum grade requirements in the Ay 121-127 series, or who do not pass the general candidacy examina - tion described above, will not be able to continue in the Ph.D. program. They may receive a terminal master's degree, provided that they fulfill the requirements for it (see above). Advising and Thesis Supervision By the summer of their first year, students should be spending most of their time on research. During their first two years, students are free to work with any faculty they wish, on one or more projects. However, by the summer of their second year at the latest, they should have defined a thesis project and been accepted by a faculty research adviser for that project (in cases where the thesis involves multiple projects, a sec - ond faculty adviser may supervise part of the research, but one must be selected as primary adviser). An oral candidacy exam dealing with the student's proposed thesis research should be completed before the end of the third year. The date and time of the exam are the responsi - bility of the student to arrange. The candidacy committee is approved by the option representative in consultation with the student's adviser and a list of suggested members provided by the student. This com - mittee becomes the student's Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC) and will stand until the final oral thesis defense, and be charged with ensur - ing that satisfactory progress toward the Ph.D. is being made. If the candidate does not pass the oral candidacy exam, then the candidacy committee may at its discretion offer the candidate a second oral examination. This examination must be successfully completed by the end of the third term of the third year. After the oral candidacy exam, the adviser and the student togeth - er have primary responsibility for the student's progress and career development. To ensure that these remain on course, both student and adviser must submit annual progress reports to the executive officer (or in the case of a conflict of interest, to the astrophysics option represen - tative or the division chair), and meet (\"check-in\") with the committee members at least once per year. If at any stage the student, the adviser, or the executive officer feels that there are serious problems devel - oping, they may consult in confidence with the astrophysics option representative, the executive officer, or the division chair. They may also request a meeting of the committee or seek the advice or help of other faculty members. Students may also consult with the PMA director of student programming or seek confidential advice and help from the Student Wellness Services. Final Examination (Ph.D. Oral Thesis Defense) A final draft of the thesis must be submitted to the registrar at least six weeks before the commencement at which the degree is to be con - ferred. At least two weeks after submission of the thesis, the student will be examined orally on the scope of the thesis and its relation to current research in astrophysics. The examination will be conducted 383 Historical Sketchby a committee selected in the same way as thecandidacy committee and is nominally the thesis advisory committee. The oral thesis defense should occur before the end of the fifth year. Typical Timeline Year 1: Ay 121, Ay 123-127; at least two advanced physics courses; reading and independent study. Begin research. Year 2: Early fall\u2014general oral qualifying examination. Fulfill teaching requirement. Complete 36 units of physics (54 for theorists); a term of Ay 122 if applicable; optional advanced astronomy courses. Ay 141. Research projects; select thesis and adviser.

Ay Subject Minor The program for a subject minor in astrophysics must be approved by the option representative in both options before admission to candida - cy in the home option. In addition to general Institute requirements, the student pursuing a graduate subject minor in astronomy must complete with a grade of C or better, 45 units in advanced courses in astronomy. BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOPHYSICS (BMB) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program An integrated approach to graduate study in biochemistry and molec - ular biophysics has been organized primarily by the Divisions of Biology and Biological Engineering (BBE) and Chemistry and Chemical Engineering (CCE). The curriculum is designed to provide a broad background in biochemistry and biophysics of macromolecules and molecular assemblies, in addition to an appropriate depth of knowledge in the field selected for the Ph.D. thesis research. BMB Admission The option in Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics is open to stu - dents with undergraduate degrees in biochemistry, biology, chemistry, biophysics, physics, engineering, and related areas. Applicants whose native language is not English may submit results of the TOEFL exam and, after admission, are required to satisfy the English language requirements of the Institute. BMB Master's Degree Students are not admitted to work toward the M.S. degree. An M.S. degree may be awarded only in special circumstances, provided Special Regulations384 Graduate InformationInstitute requirements are met, and is typically conferred as a terminal degree after the end of the second year of residence. BMB Degree of Doctor of Philosophy The option eepresentative will counsel and oversee the student's prog - ress upon admission to the graduate program. During the first year of graduate study, students are required to participate in the BMB 202 seminar course and BMB 174. Additionally, as noted below, the option offers a series of courses that will expose the student to contemporary issues in biochemistry and molecular biophysics, and to the tools and methods that are essential for research in this area. Research advis - ers are normally selected at the end of spring quarter of the first year. Students are required to take five additional advanced courses of nine or more units that are appropriate for their particular research interests (as determined by the option representative). Teaching All students are to serve as teaching assistants for two quarters with the first in the first year of residence and the second by the end of the fourth year. In addition to serving an educational purpose, funds for the TA assignments are a component of the stipend. Outside factors, such as previous TA positions prior to starting the Ph.D. program, may be considered as satisfying the requirement upon approval by the option representative. Laboratory Rotations In consultation with the Option Representative and individual profes - sors, students will choose three laboratories to do one term research projects during their first year of residence. These laboratory rotations are designed to provide students with an introduction to different areas of biochemistry and molecular biophysics along with identifying a lab for thesis research. It is possible to waive the third rotation with permission given by petitioning the Option Representative. Admission to Candidacy By the end of the sixth term of residency, the student will take an oral examination to assess mastery of the field of biochemistry and to evaluate research progress. As part of this examination, each student will submit a written research report summarizing the progress in their research, and an original research proposal in a field outside the student's chosen field of research. A candidacy examination committee of four to five faculty (including the advisor) will be assembled by the student in consultation with their advisor and approved by the option representative. The chair of the committee should be identified at this time and should be a member of the BMB option who is not the thesis advisor. In addition to satisfac - tory completion of the candidacy exam, admission to candidacy requires satisfactory completion of BMB 174 and five additional advanced courses of nine or more units (numbered 100 or above). Upon admission to can - didacy, the faculty committee will become the thesis advisory committee. Students are required to meet annually with their thesis advisory commit - tee to evaluate research progress. This committee will also serve as the 385 Historical SketchPh.D. thesis examination committee. A fifth member may be added at this time. After candidacy, a student will meet annually with the thesis commit - tee to assess progress. Thesis and Final Examination Thesis research will be carried out under the direction of one or more fac - ulty members in the BMB option. The thesis defense will consist of a the - sis seminar, followed by an examination by the Ph.D. thesis committee. BIOENGINEERING (BE) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program Bioengineering research at Caltech focuses on the application of engi - neering principles to the design, analysis, construction, and manipula - tion of biological systems, and on the discovery and application of new engineering principles inspired by the properties of biological systems. Areas of research emphasis include: biodevices, bioimaging, bioin - spired design, biomechanics, biomedical engineering, cell and tissue engineering, molecular programming, synthetic biology, and systems biology. The goal of the doctoral program is to prepare students to become leading scientists and engineers in academia and industry. The graduate program aims to educate students to be highly competent in their chosen area of research, but also provide them with a broad knowledge foundation in bioengineering. By graduation, students are expected to have a working knowledge of bioengineering in general and an in-depth knowledge of their chosen area, have independently planned and conducted research experiments in their chosen area, and successfully defended their thesis work in an open forum. BE Master's Degree Students are not admitted to work toward the M.S. degree. In special circumstances, the M.S. degree may be awarded, provided Institute requirements are met. BE Degree of Doctor of Philosophy In addition to satisfying the general Institute requirements, candidates for a Ph.D. in bioengineering at Caltech must satisfy the following requirements: Course Requirements Coursework requirements provide maximum flexibility in building on undergraduate training and complementing the research activities of each student. To assist in the selection of a research area, to foster interactions within the entering class, and to discuss ethical guidelines for scientific research, students participate in three required discussion courses in their first year: current research topics in Caltech bioengi - neering labs (BE 267, first term); Reading the Bioengineering Literature (BE 201, second term); Responsible Conduct of Research (Bi 252, first term). Graduate students must take BE 201 again in their second year. Special Regulations386 Graduate InformationIn addition to the required courses, students must take at least six electives (one-quarter courses totaling at least 54 units; grade of B or higher in each course) selected in consultation with the student's advis - er and the option representative. Two of these courses must be Bi/ CNS/NB 195 and BE/Bi 103 a, unless the option representative deems the student's past course work to have covered the topics of those courses and waives the requirement. Waived courses do not count toward the requirement of six electives. To maximize the opportunity for research during the early stages of the graduate career, coursework may be spread over the first and second years. Electives are listed below. Other courses may count as electives at the discretion of the option representative. Bioimaging and biomedical devices electives: AM/CE 151 ab, APh 109, APh/EE 130, APh/EE 132, 189 ab, Bi/BE 177, Bi/BE 227, EE/APh 131, EE/BE/MedE 185, EE/MedE 187, Ph 106 Ph/APh/EE/BE 118 abc. Biomechanics and bioinspired design electives: Ae/APh/CE/ME 101 abc, Ae/AM/CE/ME 102 abc, Ae/BE 242, BE/Bi/MedE 106, BE 159, ChE 103 abc, ChE 151 ab, ChE/Ch 164, ChE 174, MedE/ BE/Ae 243, Ph 127 abc.

Biology electives: BE 150, Bi/Ch 110, Bi/Ch 111, Bi 114, Bi 115, Bi 117, Bi 118, Bi 122, Bi/BE 129, Bi 145 ab, BE 153, BE 159, BE/ APh 161, Bi/CNS 150. Math electives: ACM 100 ab, ACM/EE/IDS 116, ACM/ESE 118, AM 125 abc, ChE 105, CDS 110, CDS 140. Research The flexibility of the coursework requirements enables research to be the primary activity from the very first term in residence. Students are encouraged to do two or more research rotations during the first year to sample research activities in multiple labs before selecting a Ph.D. adviser. Rotations are arranged by contacting individual faculty. Adviser Selection Each student must select a Ph.D. adviser by the end of the spring term of the first academic year. Advisers may be any Caltech faculty mem - ber working in an area related to bioengineering. First Year Conversation Before the end of the spring term of the first year in residence, each student meets with a faculty committee for a discussion of first-year progress and second-year plans. The committee must be composed of three faculty, plus the Ph.D. adviser(s), including a minimum of two bioengineering faculty. The student will give a brief presentation on research progress and future plans, as well as discuss fundamentals related to the research area.387 Historical SketchAdmission to Candidacy By the end of the spring term of the second year in residence, each stu - dent must complete the coursework requirement, prepare a candidacy report, and pass an oral candidacy exam. The report should be brief, describing research progress to date and outlining plans for the remaining doctoral research. The candidacy report should be submitted to the com - mittee members one week before the oral exam. The committee must be composed of three faculty, plus the adviser(s), including a minimum of two bioengineering faculty. The oral candidacy exam will include presentation of research progress, presentation of a proposed outline for the thesis, and questioning on fundamentals related to the research area. Students that complete the coursework requirement, prepare a candidacy report, and pass the oral candidacy exam will be recommended for candidacy. Students that are not admitted to candidacy by the end of the second year in residence will not be permitted to register in subsequent terms except with special permission from the option representative. Thesis Advisory Committee Meetings Once a student has been admitted to candidacy, each doctoral student will select a Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC). The committee must be composed of three faculty, plus the adviser(s), including a minimum of two bioengineering faculty. This committee should meet at least once each year for the remainder of the student's time at Caltech. Thesis Examination A final oral examination will be given after the thesis has been formally completed. The exam will consist of a public research presentation followed by a private defense with an exam committee. The committee must be composed of three faculty, plus the adviser(s), including a min - imum of two Bioengineering faculty. The thesis examination will be a defense of the doctoral thesis and a test of the candidate's knowledge in his or her specialized field of research. BE Subject Minor A student may, with the approval of the bioengineering graduate option representative, elect a subject minor in bioengineering. Such a program shall consist of 45 units of upper division course work in bioengineering, with each course passed with a grade of C or better. Courses used to satisfy course requirements in the student's major option may not be used to satisfy the minor requirements. Approval of each program must be obtained from the bioengineering graduate option representative. BIOLOGY (B i) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program Graduate students in biology come with very diverse undergraduate preparation\u2014majors in physics, chemistry, mathematics, or psychology, as well as in biology and its various branches. The aims of the graduate program are to provide, for each student, individual depth of experience Special Regulations388 Graduate Informationand competence in a particular chosen major specialty; perception of the nature and logic of biology as a whole; sufficient strength in basic science to allow continued self-education after formal training has been completed and thus to keep in the forefront of changing fields; and the motivation to serve his or her field productively through a long career. In accordance with these aims, the graduate study program in biol - ogy includes the following parts: (a) the major program, which is to provide the student with early and intense original research experience in a self-selected subject of biology, supplemented with advanced course work and independent study in this subject; and (b) a program of course work designed to provide well-rounded and integrated train - ing in biology and the appropriate basic sciences, which is adjusted to special interests and needs. An individual program will be recom - mended to each student in a meeting with the student's advisory com - mittee (see below). The Division of Biology and Biological Engineering does not encourage applications from students who have pursued undergraduate study in biology at the Institute, because the broader perspective to be gained from graduate study in a different setting is considered to be essential for the full development of each student's potential. Exceptions to this policy may be considered by the faculty of the division if there are circumstances that indicate that it would be in the best interests of a student to pursue graduate study at the Institute. Bi Admission Applicants are expected to meet the following minimal requirements: mathematics through calculus, general physics, organic chemistry, physical chemistry (or the equivalent), and elementary biology. Students with deficient preparation in one or more of these categories may be admitted but required to remedy their deficiencies in the first years of graduate training, with no graduate credit being granted for such reme - dial study. This will usually involve taking courses in the categories in which the student has deficiencies. In certain instances, however, defi - ciencies may be corrected by examinations following independent or supervised study apart from formal courses. Furthermore, the program in biology is diverse, and in particular fields such as psychobiology and experimental psychology, or in interdisciplinary programs, other kinds of undergraduate preparation may be substituted for the general requirements listed above. When feasible, visits to the campus for personal interviews will be arranged before a final decision for admission is made. The GRE tests (general and advanced subject) are not required and scores will not be considered for admission. Bi Master's Degree The biology option does not admit students for work toward the M.S. degree. In special circumstances the M.S. degree may be awarded, provided Institute requirements are met. In general, the degree is not conferred until the end of the second year of residence. The degree does not designate any of the disciplines of the division, but is an M.S. in biology. The 135 units required by the Institute must include any two courses from the series Bi 250 abcd and Bi 252.389 Historical SketchBi Degree of Doctor of Philosophy Major Subjects of Specialization A student may pursue major work leading to the doctoral degree in any of the following subjects: biophysics, cellular biology, develop - mental biology, genetics, immunology, microbiology, molecular biology and biochemistry, and systems biology. At graduation, a student may choose whether the degree is to be awarded in biology or in the select - ed major subject. Students who choose to work in Neurobiology may also qualify for a Ph.D. in Biology but are encouraged to enroll in the Neurobiology option. Initial Advisory Meeting At the start of the first year of study, incoming students meet with the option representative or faculty member(s) specified by the option rep - resentative. The purpose of this meeting is to assist the student in orga - nizing laboratory rotations, and to discuss what additional course work is desirable in light of the student's past record. Rotations The major initial responsibility of each student is to explore the var - ious research possibilities available at Caltech before settling into a laboratory for their thesis research. Students are free to rotate in any laboratory at Caltech, not just those in the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering. First-year students should carry out a minimum of two laboratory rotations; three rotations are recommended. It is gen - erally expected that rotations will last a full academic quarter; however, exceptions can be granted with the advance permission of the profes - sor. Choice of laboratory should be made by the end of June of the first year except in extraordinary circumstances. Any exception should be discussed with the option representative. Formal Classes During the first year of graduate studies, students are required to take Responsible Conduct of Research (Bi 252) and at least two courses from the series (Bi 250 abcd) that covers the breadth of fields represent - ed in biology at Caltech. During each year that they are matriculated in the Ph.D. program, students are required to take Bi 251 abc (Biolunch). Students will be required to present their thesis research in Biolunch during their second and fourth years of study. In addition to these fixed requirements, during their time at Caltech students must take three additional 100-series or 200-series courses (9 or more units each; grade of B or higher in each course), at least one of which must focus on mathematical or statistical methods relevant to biology . Teaching All students are to serve as teaching assistants for one quarter per year they are in residence, up through the third year. Special Regulations390 Graduate InformationAdmission to Candidacy During winter quarter of the second year, a student is to set up a thesis proposal examining committee and prepare a proposal focused on the research project that they expect to pursue for their thesis research. The proposal is defended by the student in an oral presentation in front of the thesis proposal examining committee by the end of June. (Although it is anticipated that this exam will be completed by June of the second year, it can be delayed until August of the third year if the option representative agrees.) The examining committee comprises four faculty members, at least three of whom should hold full or joint professorial appointments in the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering. One of the members of the committee is appointed as chair. The chair of the thesis examining committee must be a Caltech faculty member other than the student's adviser. The adviser can, but need not be, a member of the examining committee. The members of the thesis proposal examining committee must certify passage of this exam. In the event that there is inadequate evidence of the capacity to do research, the student may be allowed to petition to re-take the oral exam at a later time. However, in cases where the committee deems it unlikely that the student will be able to pass a subsequent attempt, the student may be advised to leave the program. In any event, a student cannot remain in the program beyond August of the third year without having successfully completed the requirements for admission to candidacy, except in extraordinary circumstances and with the approval of the option representative and the dean of gradu - ate studies Thesis Advisory Committee Meetings Once a student has been formally admitted to candidacy, they are to pick a Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC). This committee is often the same as the thesis proposal exam committee, but that need not be the case. The thesis adviser must be a member of the TAC. The TAC typi - cally has four members. At least three must be professorial faculty who hold a full or joint appointment in the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering. It is expected that students who have been admitted to candidacy will meet with the TAC once a year for the remainder of their time at Caltech. Students who fail to meet with their TAC in any one year may be deemed to not be maintaining satisfactory progress toward the Ph.D. degree and will be prevented from registering for the subsequent academic year. Maintaining Satisfactory Progress It is the policy of the biology option that a graduate student who is making satisfactory progress toward a Ph.D. degree can expect to con - tinue as a registered student with full financial support. To be deemed as making satisfactory progress, a student is expected to fulfill the expectations listed below. In the event that satisfactory progress is not being made, a student can petition to receive the M.S. degree, for which they must have successfully completed one full year of graduate study. Requirements for satisfactory progress include: 391 Historical Sketch Completion of the first-year course requirements during the first year. Joining a laboratory in which a student will perform thesis research before the end of the first year in residence. Passing the qualifying examination and completing admission to candidacy before the start of the fourth year in residence. Holding a Thesis Advisory Committee meeting in each subse - quent year of studies, and having the thesis committee verify that satisfactory progress is being made. Serving as a teaching assistant for one quarter of each academic year spent in residence through third year. Completing Ph.D. studies by the end of the sixth year. In the event that the student, option representative, and adviser are in agreement, it is possible to make exceptions to the above guidelines and remain in good standing. Extension of thesis work beyond twenty-four terms requires that the student petition the dean of graduate studies for permission to register. Extensions beyond the seventh year will be allowed only in unusual circumstances. Once a student has passed admission to candidacy, the responsibility for assessing satisfactory progress lies largely with the student's Thesis Advisory Committee. If a majority of the commit - tee deems that a student is not making satisfactory progress, the student is at risk of being removed from the program at any time at the discretion of the option representative. Examination Committee Requirements for the Ph.D. thesis and examination are determined by the Ph.D. examination committee that is appointed by the dean of graduate studies for each degree candidate. This committee is usually the same as the Thesis Advisory Committee, but this need not be the case. The composition of the committee must be approved by the option representative. The committee usually has four members. At least three must be professorial faculty who hold a full or joint appoint - ment in the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering. Thesis and Final Examination The thesis and associated publications are expected to demonstrate that the student has learned how to conceive, plan, and execute experi - mental and/or theoretical work that reveals new biological information. In addition, it must reveal a deep, broad, and rigorous understanding of the area of research to which the thesis is relevant. Two weeks after copies of the thesis are provided to the examining committee, chairman, and option representative, the candidate collects the copies and comments for correction. At this time, the date for the final examination is set at the discretion of the thesis advisor and the division chair. The final oral examination covers principally the work of the thesis, and according to Institute regulations must be held at least two weeks before the degree is conferred. A digital copy of the thesis is required of the graduate for the Institute library, including both PDF and original source files. Both should be deposited into CaltechTHESIS. Special Regulations392 Graduate InformationCaltech-Kaiser Permanente School of Medicine MD/PhD Program There is a dual-degree program between Caltech and the Kaiser Permanente School of Medicine (KPSOM) for the granting of the M.D./ Ph.D. degree. Students receive their medical training at KPSOM, and perform their Ph.D. work with any member of the Caltech faculty. Admission to this dual-degree program is made through the KPSOM M.D./Ph.D. process. The M.D. degree is awarded by KPSOM, and the Ph.D. is awarded by Caltech. The dual-degree program is directed by Dr. Jose M. Barral, M.D., Ph.D. at KPSOM and Professor Paul Sternberg at Caltech. For more informa - tion, see medschool.kp.org/education/curriculum#dual-degrees . Caltech-UCLA Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) A joint program between Caltech and the UCLA Medical School has been established for the granting of the M.D./Ph.D. degree. Students do their preclinical and clinical work at UCLA, and their Ph.D. work with any member of the Caltech faculty, including the biology, chemistry, and engineering and applied science divisions. Admission to this joint program is made through the usual UCLA MSTP process, checking a box indicating interest in the Caltech option. Students will be accepted into the joint program, funds permitting. The M.D. degree would be from UCLA and the Ph.D. would be awarded by Caltech. The current Directors of the UCLA MSTP are Dr. Olujimi Ajijola and Dr. David Dawson, and Caltech Professor Mitch Guttman is the Associate Director.

Admission to this joint program is made through the usual USC pro - cess, checking a box indicating interest in the Caltech option. Students will be accepted into the joint program, funds permitting. The M.D. degree would be from USC and the Ph.D. would be awarded by Caltech. The current Director of the USC M.D./Ph.D. program is Dr. David Hinton. The Director for Caltech is Professor Paul Sternberg. For more information, see keck.usc.edu/md-Ph.D.- program. Bi Subject Minor A student majoring in any non-biology option of the Institute may, with the approval of the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, elect a subject minor in any of the subjects listed above under major subjects of specialization. Requirements for such a minor are deter - mined by the faculty committee designated for each subject. A minor program in biology is also available to students of other divisions. Such a program shall consist of 45 units of upper division course work in the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, with each course 393 Historical Sketchpassed with a grade of C or better. Approval of each program must be obtained from the biology graduate option representative. A student majoring in another division who elects a subject minor in biology may, if desired, arrange to have the minor designated as biology, rather than with the name of the specific minor subject. CHEMICAL ENGINEERING (C hE) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Programs The general objective of the graduate work in chemical engineering is to produce individuals who are exceptionally well trained to apply mathematics, the physical, chemical, and biological sciences, and engi - neering to the understanding of systems involving chemical reactions, transport phenomena, and materials/energy transformations, and to the development of new processes and materials. The program also strives to develop in each student self-reliance, creativity, professional ethics, and an appreciation of the societal impact of chemical engineering and the importance of continuing intellectual growth. ChE Admission It is expected that each applicant for graduate study in chemical engi - neering will have studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and chemical engineering to the extent that these subjects are covered in the required undergraduate courses at Caltech. In case the applicant's training is not equivalent, admission may be granted but the option may prescribe additional work in these subjects before recommending them as a candidate for a degree. ChE Master's Degree Although there is no formal M.S. program in ChE, in the course of their Ph.D. program students may apply for an M.S. degree by submitting an approved thesis and meeting all the other institute requirements for the M.S. program. The thesis must be approved by both the student's adviser and option representative. Course Requirements At least 135 units of coursework must be completed in order to satisfy the Institute requirements. These units must include ChE 151ab, ChE 152, ChE/Ch 165, 18 additional units of advanced courses in chemical engineering, 27 units of science or engineering electives, and 18 units of general electives. With advanced permission from the option repre - sentative, general electives may include courses in the humanities and social sciences. A student must maintain a GPA of 2.0 to qualify for an M.S. degree. Finally, the M.S. requirements include at least 27 units of research, ChE 280, which represents two terms of research under the supervision of a chemical engineering faculty member. Special Regulations394 Graduate InformationResearch Report At least three weeks before the degree is to be conferred, a research report on the work performed under ChE 280 must be submitted to both the student's adviser and the option representative. ChE Degree of Doctor of Philosophy 1. Coursework a. Initial Consultation: Upon arrival at Caltech, the ChE Ph.D. students will meet with the ChE option representative to discuss the pro - gram, adviser selection, and expectations for the first and second terms. During these two terms, students are expected to take a normal load of three courses per term plus 9 units of research (ChE 280) to cover the rotation (see below). The courses during the first term include one each in advanced Kinetics (ChE 152) and Thermodynamics (ChE 165), and a third course in an area of need or an area that lines up with the research interests of the student. The courses during the second term include one each in advanced Transport (ChE 151 a) and Statistical Thermodynamics (ChE 164) and a third course as above. The third course taken during the first and second terms must be at least 9 units and graded. The entire first year of study will also be discussed. b. Course Requirements: During the first year, Ph.D. students are required to take the five core courses: ChE 151ab, ChE 152, ChE 164, ChE 165, plus one additional ChE course from the following list: ChE 112, 115, Ch/ChE 140, 147, 148, 155, ChE/ESE 157, 158, 159, ChE/BE 163, 174. The core courses must be graded and a minimum grade of B- is required in each one. There is also a minimum GPA requirement of 2.5 each term of all courses taken. Failure to meet these grade and GPA requirements places the student in a state of deficiency, which may lead to termina - tion of the program if not corrected promptly. c. Subject Minor or External Coursework: Each student is required to complete either a subject minor or a general program of cours - es outside chemical engineering. The general program of courses consists of at least 54 units. A maximum of 27 units from the following list of doubly-listed courses can be used by graduate students as part of the 54-unit requirement: ESE/ChE 158; ChE/ Ch 140, 147, 171. A course in the ACM 100ab sequence will be credited 9 units instead of the nominal 12 units as listed in the catalog. Courses in the Humanities, Arts, and Linguistics are explicitly excluded from the general program. The requirements for a subject minor in other options may be found in the current Caltech Catalog . The general program of courses must be submitted and approved by the Option Representative after the candidacy exam. All courses chosen must be at the graduate level and should constitute an integrated program of study rather than a randomly chosen collection of courses outside chemical engineering. A grade of C or better is required in any of these courses to remain qualified for the Ph.D. program.395 Historical Sketch2. Research Adviser The choice of a research adviser is perhaps the most important deci - sion a graduate student makes during the first year of graduate study. This decision must be made before the end of the second term of the first year, and so it is reasonable to devote significant thought and effort to this task before then. In the first two weeks of the fall quarter, all faculty will present over - views of their research program during informal evening sessions. All first-year students must attend all of these sessions. Following these presentations, the students are expected to meet individually with at least two faculty members to discuss proposed research projects and the possibility of doing a rotation in that faculty member's group during the first or second terms. All students must formally join a group by the end of the second term. 3. Rotations Rotations serve to acquaint the student with a group's research area and style. Two rotations are required, one each during the first and sec - ond terms. During a rotation, the student must participate in research activities in the chosen group for at least nine hours per week under the tutelage of a faculty or senior group member. At the end of a rota - tion, the student must produce a research report and give a group presentation. Afterwards, a rotation completion form must be signed by the rotation adviser and returned to the ChE option representative. At the same time, the student and the faculty member must determine whether the \"match\" of research interests and personalities is good. In the instance of a positive outcome, the student may remain in the same group for a second rotation. Otherwise, the student should proceed to do a second rotation in another group with the same requirements as above. Certain funding agencies (e.g. NIH) require a second rotation in a different group. In that case, the student will be asked to do so, even if she/he desired to remain in a particular group; the student may return to join the first group after completion of the second rotation. All students must find advisers and formally join a group by the end of the second term. Failure to do so terminates the Ph.D. program at Caltech and the student will be asked to leave. 4. Candidacy Exam All students are required to pass the candidacy examination, ideally before the official start of the second year, or at the latest by October 15 of the second year. This oral exam is administered by a Candidacy Committee and consists of two parts: a. A presentation by the student based on the contents of a research progress report. b. A background questions part broadly related to the research problem presented. Special Regulations396 Graduate InformationThe research progress report must be submitted to the Candidacy Committee members and the ChE option representative by August 31 of the first year in residence. The report should expound on the research pursued by the student and is expected to exhibit originality and a pro - fessional quality of exposition. It should outline the research problem, the proposed approach, the expected contributions in the general problem area, and the progress of the student at the time of writing. It should also provide clear evidence of the student's understanding of the research topic, the underlying science and technology related to that research, and the student's mastering of the relevant techniques and methodology necessary to pursue the proposed research. The Candidacy Committee should consist of no fewer than four vot - ing members of the Caltech faculty, with at least three being chemical engineering faculty. To ensure the impartiality of the committee, the chairperson and at least one more of the committee members must have no direct advisory relationship with the candidate. The choice of the oral exam committee will be made by the student and his/her research adviser and must be approved by the ChE option representative. It is the responsibility of the student to obtain approval from each proposed committee member for the date and time of the oral exam. The list of the recommended committee members must be submitted to the Option Representative at the same time as the research progress report. The second component of the oral exam consists of chemical engineering background questions relating broadly to the student's research topic. The chairperson of the Candidacy Committee shall be responsible for ensuring that the questions are at an appropriate level, consistent with that of undergraduates at Caltech. For example, if the Ph.D. focus is on heterogeneous catalysis, the student must be able to answer questions on basics such as: surface reaction mechanisms, diffusion/reaction in porous media, and multi-component gas-phase transport, etc. Similar considerations apply to Ph.D. projects related to fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, basic biology, physics, chem - istry, etc. The advanced courses taken during the first year should help you prepare well for this part of the exam. Serious gaps in the understanding of classical chemical engineering concepts, approaches, and methodologies applicable to your research may lead to failing the exam even if research progress is deemed adequate. Furthermore, for interdisciplinary projects going beyond classical chemical engineering, the student will be expected to demonstrate good understanding of the fundamentals in other areas directly relevant to their project. The candidacy exam may have three outcomes: Pass, Conditional Pass, or Fail. Passing the candidacy exam admits the student to candi - dacy for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Failing the candidacy exam terminates the student's Ph.D. program at Caltech. When course require - ments are met, the student may be awarded an M.S. degree at the rec - ommendation of the Candidacy Committee. Conditional Pass is a special outcome granted only when the student has clearly passed the back - ground questions component, but the committee deems that more is needed on the research front. In this case, the committee chair will put in writing what is required and the time frame to meet those requirements. Under no circumstances is this time to exceed one term. Meeting the 397 Historical Sketchstipulated requirements must be reflected in a revised candidacy report, which must be submitted to and approved by the Candidacy Committee by the set deadline. It is at the discretion of the committee to request a re-examination. In any case, a Pass or Fail decision must be reached at the latest by December 15 of the second year in residence. This is a hard deadline for both the student and the committee. If there is no communi - cation to the ChE option representative by December 15, a Fail decision will be entered automatically. 5. Thesis Review Committee After the student passes the candidacy exam, the Candidacy Committee becomes the \"de-facto\" Thesis Review Committee, which will be responsible for reviewing the student's progress. The committee must be convened (as a group) during the third year of residency, and every year thereafter to review progress, suggest improvements in research, or resolve any issues that could potentially delay graduation beyond the fifth year of residency. It is the responsibility of the student to organize the annual meetings of the Thesis Review Committee, which may be convened at any time during the year but at least three months before registration for the next academic year is due. Subsequent registration beyond the fourth year is subject to written approval by the Thesis Review Committee and the ChE option representative. In order to expe - dite the review, the student should submit a two- or three-page concise outline of progress and of proposed future research to each member of his/her committee before the annual review meeting. 6. Final Thesis and Oral Defense As a final step in the Ph.D. program, the student is required to submit a satisfactory thesis, present a ChE seminar (open to the general public), and pass a final oral examination. Procedures for Seminar, Exam, and Committee Selection: At least three weeks prior to the exam date, the ChE Graduate Records Secretary must be given the title of the seminar, date, time and loca - tion. Both the seminar and exam should be scheduled on the same day, with the exam immediately following the seminar. The committee members will be determined by the student and their research advis - er, and must be approved by the ChE option representative and the dean of graduate studies. The examining committee must include at least four members, of which at least three are voting members of the Caltech faculty and at least two are ChE faculty; one member of the committee may be from off-campus with prior approval of the ChE option representative. 7. Graduate Teaching Assignment Duties All Ph.D. students are required to perform a minimum of 24 term-hours of GTA duties within the ChE Department during their studies. The GTA duties will normally be assigned after the first year in residence. Most Special Regulations398 Graduate Informationstudents find the teaching assistantship a valuable experience for their future careers. Teaching assistantships outside ChE are permitted but the hours do not count toward the 24-hour TA requirement. Additional Information Additional information about graduate study requirements and proce - dures is provided in the chemical engineering graduate studies guide, distributed annually to first-year chemical engineering graduate stu - dents. CHEMISTRY (C h) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program The Caltech chemistry option offers a program of graduate study leading to the Ph.D. degree, with the goal of preparing students for a lifetime of independent research and scientific leadership in the chem - ical sciences, through careers in academia, industry, or government. Modern chemistry strives to achieve a molecular-level understanding of the natural world and thus forms the basis for much of modern sci - ence, including biology, medicine, materials, nanotechnology, energy and environment. The program of study, while anchored in the tradi - tional areas of organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, chemical biology, biochemistry and biophysics, chemical physics, and theoretical chem - istry, is flexible and highly interdisciplinary. The graduate program in chemistry emphasizes research. This emphasis reflects the Institute's traditional leadership in chemi - cal research and the conviction that has permeated the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering from its founding, that participa - tion in original research is the best way to awaken, develop, and give direction to creativity. The program is designed to encourage students to begin their research early in their first year. Students can elect to do research that crosses the boundaries of traditionally separate areas of chemistry, for in this relatively compact division, they are encouraged to go where their scientific curiosity drives them. A thesis that involves more than one adviser is not uncommon, and interdisciplinary programs with biology, physics, geology, chemical engineering, and environmental sci - ence and engineering science are open and encouraged. An extensive program of seminars will enable students to hear of and discuss notable work in chemical physics, organic chemistry, inor - ganic chemistry and electrochemistry, organometallic chemistry, and biochemistry and molecular biophysics. Graduate students are also encouraged to attend seminars in other divisions. Ch Learning Outcomes Students upon whom are conferred the Ph.D. degree have provided evidence of independent scholarship and scientific creativity through the performance of original research, which is described in their doc - toral thesis and defended orally. Students must also demonstrate an 399 Historical Sketchability to conceive new research directions by preparing and defending a set of written research propositions. Ch Course Program A student is required to complete at least five courses, each being nine units or more, in science or engineering. At least one course must be in a field substantially outside the research area of the student. Courses may be either inside or outside the chemistry option, must be numbered 100 or greater, and must be taken on a letter-grade basis with a grade of B or above. The student should discuss, with his or her adviser, which courses best serve his or her individual needs. The pro - gram of courses must be approved by the research adviser and by the Chemistry Graduate Study Committee. Ch Master's Degree Students are not ordinarily admitted to graduate work leading to an M.S. degree. Under special circumstances, and with prior approval of the Graduate Study Committee, a master's degree can be obtained. All master's programs for the degree in chemistry must include at least 45 units of chemical research and must satisfy the Course Program described above. The remaining electives may be satisfied by advanced work in any area of mathematics, science or engineering, or by chemical research. A satisfactory thesis describing this research, including a one-page digest or summary of the main results obtained, must be submitted to the divisional graduate studies office at least 10 days before the degree is to be conferred. In addition, the fulfillment of the thesis requirement must be signed off by a designated faculty member on the M.S. candidacy form and a final copy of the thesis submitted to the Graduate Office no later than two weeks before the degree is to be conferred. The copies of the thesis should be prepared according to the directions formulated by the dean of graduate studies and should be accompanied by a statement of approval of the thesis, signed by the adviser directing the research and by the chair of the Chemistry Graduate Study Committee. Ch Degree of Doctor of Philosophy Selecting a Research Project Soon after a new graduate student arrives in the laboratories, they attend a series of orientation seminars that introduce students to the active research interests of the faculty. Students then meet with each of five or more faculty whose fields attract them, to discuss in detail potential research problems. They eventually settle upon the outlines of a research problem that interests them and select a specific research adviser (or set of co-advisers). Neither students nor faculty can make a commitment to an adviser-advisee relationship prior to the end of the first month of the fall term. Students typically begin research during their first academic year. Candidacy To be recommended for candidacy for the doctor's degree in chemistry, in addition to demonstrating an understanding and knowledge of the Special Regulations400 Graduate Informationfundamentals of chemistry, a student must give satisfactory evidence of proficiency at a high level in the primary field of interest, as approved by the division. This is accomplished by an oral candidacy examination, which must be held during or before the fifth term of graduate residence (excluding summer terms). The candidacy committee shall consist of the thesis adviser(s) and two additional faculty members; at least two of the three members must be chemistry faculty. The committee should be considered as a resource for the student for the remainder of his or her studies. At the candidacy examination, a student is asked to demon - strate scientific and professional competence and promise by discussing a research report and propositions as described below. The research report should describe progress and accomplishments to date and plans for future research. Two original research propositions, or brief scientific theses, must accompany the report, and at least one must be well removed from the student's field of research. These prop - ositions should reflect his or her breadth of familiarity with the literature, originality, and ability to pose and analyze suitable scientific research problems. The research report and propositions must be in the hands of the examining committee as a bound, hard-copy document one week before the examination. The result of the candidacy examination may be either (a) pass, (b) fail, or (c) conditional. Conditional status is granted when the committee decides that deficiencies in a student's research report, propositions, or overall progress can be remedied in a specific and relatively brief period of time. In order to change conditional to pass status, the stu - dent must correct the indicated deficiencies or in some cases schedule a new examination the following term. The student must be admitted to candidacy at least three terms before the final oral examination. A student cannot continue graduate work in chemistry (nor can financial assistance be continued) past the end of the sixth term of residence without being admitted to candidacy, except by petitioning the division for special permission. This permission, to be requested by a petition submitted to the Graduate Study Committee stating a proposed timeta - ble for correction of deficiencies, must be submitted before registration for each subsequent term (including the summer following the sixth term of residence) until admission to candidacy is achieved. Graduate Teaching Assignment Duties All Ph.D. students are required to perform a minimum of one 9 term- hour GTA within the chemistry option before the completion of the fourth year of study. Most students find the teaching assistantship a valuable experience for their future careers. Language Requirement There is no formal foreign language requirement for the Ph.D. in chem - istry. However, the division believes strongly in the professional impor - tance to chemists of knowledge of foreign languages and encourages their study prior to graduate work or while in graduate school.401 Historical SketchPh.D. Thesis Committee In the third year, the student in consultation with their adviser will form their Ph.D. thesis committee. This committee will comprise at least four faculty members and will generally consist of the original candidacy committee plus an additional member of the faculty; at least three of the members must be from the chemistry option. The student must meet with their committee annually, beginning in the third year. At these informal meetings, the student will update the committee on the status of their research. Typically, a student will provide an updated CV, a short research summary (2-3 pages), and a brief outline of plans for the coming year. Fourth Year Progress Meeting Before the 13th academic term of graduate residence (excluding summer terms), the student will be expected to demonstrate satisfactory progress in the course of thesis research. To this end, an informal meeting with the Ph.D. thesis committee will be held. Typically, a student provides an updated CV, a short research summary (2-3 pages), a thesis outline with %-completed for each chapter, and a timeline for completion of the degree. At the meeting, the student will likely present an oral summary of research completed to date as well as an outline of future research plans. Following the discussion, an appropriate timetable for completion of the degree requirements will be discussed and agreed upon. It is also com - mon to discuss plans for post-Caltech at the meeting. Length of Graduate Residence Any graduate student who anticipates a need to register for a 24th academic term must hold a meeting of his or her thesis committee and present the institute-required petition for permission to register that includes a plan of action for the period of the requested registration and a specific date for the completion of the degree requirements. This petition must be approved by the Thesis Committee, by the chair of the Chemistry Graduate Study Committee and, in cases where financial support is an issue, by the executive officer or division chair, before it is forwarded to the dean of graduate studies. Financial support of grad - uate students who are required to petition to register will not normally be provided through teaching assistantships. Failure to complete the degree requirements by the date specified in the petition would require the entire approval process to be repeated. This process must be repeated for every subsequent year. Thesis and Final Examination The final examination will consist in part of the oral presentation and defense of a brief r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the student's research and in part of the defense of a set of propositions they prepare. Three original research propositions are required. No more than one of these may be a car - ryover from the candidacy examination, and at least one must be well removed from the field of research. Each proposition shall be stated explicitly and the argument presented in writing with adequate documentation. The propositions should display originality, breadth Special Regulations402 Graduate Informationof interest, and soundness of training; a student will be judged on the selection and formulation of the propositions as well as on the defense of them. Formulating a set of propositions should begin early in the course of graduate study. To emphasize the importance of these propositions, there will be a separate examination on the three propositions by the Ph.D. thesis committee. This examination on the propositions is normally taken after the thesis research progress meeting, but not less than 10 weeks in advance of the final doctoral examination. A copy of the propositions, along with suitable abstracts, must be submitted to the examining committee not less than two weeks before the propositions examination. These propositions must be acceptable to the commit - tee before the final doctoral examination can be scheduled. A copy of the thesis must be submitted to each member of the thesis committee not less than two weeks before the final doctoral examination. A copy of the thesis should also be submitted to the Graduate Office for proofreading three weeks prior to the final doc - toral examination. Two final copies (one on Permalife paper) are to be submitted to the Graduate Office. Ch Subject Minor Graduate students in other options taking chemistry as a subject minor will be assigned a faculty adviser in chemistry by the Chemistry Graduate Study Committee. In consultation with this adviser, the stu - dent will work out an integrated program of courses, including at least 45 units of formal course work at the 100 level or above. This program must be approved by the Chemistry Graduate Study Committee, and a grade point average of 3.0 in the approved program will be required. CIVIL ENGINEERING (CE) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program Civil Engineering (CE) research and study are offered through the Department of Mechanical and Civil Engineering (MCE). The degrees of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) and Master of Science (M.S.) are offered. In general, students who intend to work full-time toward the Ph.D. degree as a final degree objective are admitted to the Civil Engineering Graduate Program. The M.S. degree is typically only awarded to stu - dents who pursue the Ph.D. degree in civil engineering at Caltech and who do not already have an M.S. degree in civil engineering. The aim of the graduate program in civil engineering at Caltech is to prepare students for research and professional practice in an era of rapidly advancing interdisciplinary technology. The program combines individual depth of experience and competence in a particular chosen major specialty, with a strong background in the basic and engineering sciences. It strives to develop professional independence, creativity, leadership, and the capacity for continuing professional and intellectual growth.403 Historical SketchCE Preparation for the Graduate Program Entering graduate students are expected to have a thorough back - ground in undergraduate mathematics, physics, and engineering. While a strong undergraduate program in civil engineering should provide a suitable preparation, students who have not specialized in civil engi - neering as undergraduates may also be admitted for graduate study. For example, an outstanding four-year undergraduate program in mathematics and sciences may provide a suitable background as well. The qualifications of each applicant will be considered individually, and, after being enrolled, the student will arrange his or her program in con - sultation with a member of the faculty. CE Master's Degree The degree of Master of Science in civil engineering is only awarded to students who do not already have an M.S. degree in civil engineering. The degree will be awarded upon request by students who have ful - filled the requirements. Only in exceptional cases is there admission to the M.S. program as the final degree objective. A minimum of 138 units of courses numbered 100 or above, which meet the required master's program listed below, must be passed with a grade of at least C for completion of the master's degree in civil engi - neering. All units must be taken for grades, except for courses offered only on a pass/fail basis. The M.S. degree in civil engineering is typical - ly completed within the first two years of residency at Caltech. Each student's program must be approved by the adviser and option representative in mechanical and civil engineering before registering for the course. Required Master's Program a) Graduate civil engineering core (45 units). These units should provide a solid base for the student's engineering interest. The courses should be selected from the Core CE subjects listed under the of the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy Description and Requirements section. b) Mathematics, engineering, and research electives, except seminar courses (63 units). Research can be included up to a maximum of 27 units. c) Free electives (27 units). Any course with a number of 100 or greater may be selected, except that research units and seminar courses can not be included. d) Graduate Engineering Seminar, AM/CE/ME 150 abc (3 units). CE Degree of Doctor of Philosophy CE Degree of Doctor of Philosophy The Ph.D. degree in civil engineer - ing is focused on research. Study and research programs for the Ph.D. degree are individually planned to fit the interests and background of the student. A comprehensive research project resulting in an original contribution to the field, which is documented by a thesis, is required. Institute requirements for the Ph.D. degree are described in the section on degree requirements. A minimum of three academic years in resi - Special Regulations404 Graduate Informationdence as a graduate student are required by the Institute, and two or more additional years are usually needed for preparation of the thesis. Advising and Thesis Supervision An interim adviser is appointed for each student upon admission to a graduate degree in civil engineering. The interim adviser will serve as the primary mentor until the student finds a research adviser. It is the responsibility of the student to find an academic and research adviser within three terms of graduate residence at Caltech. In consul - tation with the adviser, the student must form a Ph.D. Thesis Advisory Committee within four terms of graduate residence at Caltech. This committee shall consist of at least three members of the Caltech pro - fessorial faculty, with at least two members from the faculty in mechan - ical and civil engineering. The committee shall meet as requested by the student. Further, the committee shall meet annually to review prog - ress and to approve the registration of the student beyond the fifth year of graduate residence at Caltech. The adviser and the Thesis Advisory Committee provide the majority of mentoring to the student. In addition, the Option Representative and other members of the faculty are always available to provide advice and mento - ring on any aspect of research, progress toward the Ph.D., future careers, and other aspects of graduate school. Admission to Candidacy To be recommended for candidacy for the Ph.D. degree in civil engi - neering, the student must, in addition to meeting the general Institute requirements, do the following: Obtain the agreement of a professorial faculty member to serve as his or her academic and research adviser before the end of the third term of graduate residence at Caltech. In consultation with the adviser, the student must form a Ph.D. Thesis Advisory Committee before the end of the fourth term. This committee shall consist of at least three members of the Caltech professori - al faculty, with at least two members from the faculty in mechan - ical and civil engineering. Pass both subject and research components of the oral candi - dacy examination before the end of the eighth term of graduate academic residence at Caltech. If the student has chosen a sub - ject minor, an examination on the subject of that program may be included at the request of the discipline offering the subject minor. Complete a minimum of 195 units of courses numbered 101 or above, that fulfill the required Ph.D. program listed below. All units must be taken for grades and passed with a grade of at least a C, except for courses offered only on a pass/fail basis.

Registration Beyond the Sixth Year of Graduate Residence The annual approval of the Ph.D. Thesis Advisory Committee is neces - sary for registration beyond the 24th academic term of graduate resi - dence at Caltech. Thesis and Final Examination The thesis examination will be given after the thesis has been formally completed. This examination will be a defense of the doctoral thesis and a test of the candidate's knowledge in the specialized field of research. The format of the examination can be chosen from the following two options, by the student, in consultation with their research adviser: (i) a public seminar presented by the candidate, with an open question period, followed by a private examination by the Examining Committee or (ii) a private presentation to the Examining Committee followed by the examination, with a public seminar on another date. The Examining Committee shall consist of a minimum of four voting members, three of whom must be Caltech faculty; two members must be from MCE. The Thesis Defense Committee shall be chaired by a committee member who is an MCE Caltech professorial faculty member and not the stu - dent's adviser. CE Subject Minor A student majoring in another branch of engineering or another division of the Institute may, with the approval of the faculty in the Department of Mechanical and Civil Engineering and the faculty in his or her major field, elect civil engineering as a subject minor. The program of courses must differ markedly from the major subject of study or research, and must consist of at least 54 units of advanced courses (101 or above) approved by the faculty in mechanical and civil engineering. Special Regulations406 Graduate InformationCOMPUTATION AND NEURAL SYSTEMS (CNS) CNS Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program An integrated approach to graduate study combining computation and neural systems is organized jointly by the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, the Division of Engineering and Applied Science, and the Division of the Humanities and Social Sciences. This curriculum is designed to promote a broad knowledge of aspects of molecular, cellular, and systems biology, cognitive neuroscience, com - putational biology and computational neuroscience, information and learning theory, emergent or collective systems, and computer science and electrical engineering in conjunction with an appropriate depth of knowledge in the particular field of the thesis research. For more details, see cns.caltech.edu. Admission Ideal applicants will have a Bachelor of Science degree or equivalent with a strong quantitative background and some facility with computer programming. They will have shown an interest in understanding the brain and/or in autonomous intelligent systems. The GRE tests (general and advanced subject) are not required and scores will not be consid - ered for admission. Advisory Committee and TA Requirement An advisory committee of three CNS faculty members is constituted for each student by the CNS admissions committee upon admission to the program. The faculty in whose lab the student is staying first chairs this committee. The advisory committee meets with the student when they arrive, guides and approves first-year course choices, and answers questions and offers advice about the program and the way of life in CNS. The CNS faculty are available to students during the year for formal and/or informal discussions. It is expected that each graduate student will serve as a teaching assistant in one or two CNS courses during his or her residency at Caltech as part of the Ph.D. graduation requirement. CNS Master's Degree Only students who expect to pursue the Ph.D. degree will be admitted to the option. The master's degree may be awarded in exception - al cases. The awarding of this degree requires fulfilling the Institute requirements for a master's degree, satisfying the option breadth requirements (see following section), the completion of a master's thesis, and receiving from a candidacy examination oral committee a recommendation for awarding the degree. Laboratory Rotations Mandatory rotations through research groups (labs) provide a unique opportunity for the student to experience the CNS culture. To broaden the student's knowledge and to provide familiarity with different tech - niques and ways of thinking or doing research, each student should 407 Historical Sketchcarry out three 12-week laboratory rotations (one per term) during the first year, and should engage in research. During each rotation, the stu - dent is expected to take part in the life and routine of the lab by attend - ing lab meetings, participating in research projects and discussions with members of the lab, and meeting monthly with the faculty of that lab to discuss science. Course Requirements Six nine-unit courses are required during the first year: CNS/Bi/Ph/CS/ NB 187, either Bi 9 or equivalent, or NB/Bi/CNS 150, a neurobiology or modeling course, a math course, and two other CNS, Bi, EE, ACM, or Ph courses (for example, a schedule of CNS/Bi/EE/CS/NB 186, CNS/ Bi/Ph/CS/NB 187, NB/Bi/CNS 150, and CS/CNS/EE 156 satisfies this requirement). CNS students are required to take two additional classes: the one-unit survey course CNS 100, and the four-unit course Bi 252. These eight courses must be taken for letter grades. Students are free to take additional classes, and a research adviser may require that a student take a specific, complementary course as a requirement for joining his or her lab. Candidacy Four faculty, including the three faculty in whose labs rotations have been done, should be on the student's candidacy exam committee. At the end of the first year, the student is expected to decide on a research group and begin work there. The first summer is thus expected to be spent entirely on research in that lab. To be recommended for candidacy you are required to pass two tests: the general knowledge exam, and the research and candidacy exam. These exams are supervised by the CNS option representative. The general knowledge exam satisfies the breadth requirement. A list of about 100 questions, grouped by category, is available at www.cns.caltech.edu, providing a clear idea of the scope of knowledge that each student is expected to know well. Students are encouraged to organize working and discussion groups to prepare for this exam; the format and implementation of such a system, however, is left to the students. This is an oral exam with the four faculty (including the heads of the student's three rotation labs and one other chosen for \"breadth,'' of whom one can be from outside Caltech). It should be scheduled by the student (who contacts the committee members) to take place during the last six weeks of the third term of year one. For the exam, the stu - dent must answer questions (from more than one category) taken from the list, which is modified each year. (The exam can be retaken after three months.) The research and candidacy exam satisfies the depth requirement. During year two, the student is expected to produce a piece of work of a quality sufficient to be presented at a professional meeting. (The objec - tive of this description is to offer a way to calibrate the level of expected research achievement and involvement. Professional acceptance of the abstract or paper is not a requirement for passing candidacy.) This work is presented in an oral exam in spring term of year two, before the same Special Regulations408 Graduate Informationexam committee (if possible) that conducted part one of the exam. The exam focuses exclusively on research (accomplished and/or planned). During year two, the student may take other courses, as needed, but is expected to present a high standard (quality, originality) of research at the time of this second part of the candidacy exam. Thesis Advisory Committee Once admitted to candidacy, the student chooses a Thesis Advisory Committee of at least three faculty. This committee serves as a source of advice independent of the Ph.D. adviser throughout the student's tenure. Each year, before the end of June, the student delivers a writ - ten progress report, followed by a meeting with the Thesis Advisory Committee. Thesis Examination Committee This committee should consist of a minimum of four voting members, three of whom must be Caltech faculty. The final oral examination covers principally the works of the thesis, and according to Institute regulations must be held at least three weeks before the degree is to be conferred. CNS Subject Minor Students majoring in other fields may take a subject minor in CNS, pro - vided the program is supervised by a CNS adviser, is approved by the CNS option representative, and consists of 45 units, including NB/Bi/ CNS 150, CNS/Bi/Ph/CS/NB 187, Bi 252, and other CNS cross-listed classes. A subject minor is not required for the Ph.D. degree in CNS. COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (CSE) Aims and Scope of the Minor Computational science and engineering (CSE) may be pursued as a sub - ject minor by graduate students who are pursuing Ph.D. degrees in any option. The CSE minor is intended to supplement one of Caltech's grad - uate degrees and is designed for students who wish to broaden their knowledge of CSE beyond their major field of study. The CSE minor is also intended to recognize graduate students' interest in and dedication to CSE as demonstrated by the successful completion of a program of study in the field. Completion of the CSE minor program of study will be recognized on the Ph.D. diploma by the statement, \"...and by additional studies constituting a minor in Computational Science and Engineering.\" Requirements To receive the CSE minor, graduate students must fulfill the following requirements. 18 units (two terms) from the following list: ACM/EE 106 ab, CMS/ACM/EE 122, ACM 114 117, ACM 157, ACM 158, ACM 210 ab, ACM/IDS 216. 18 units (two terms) from the following list: CS 115, 409 Historical SketchCS 138 abc, CMS/CS 139 abc, CS 143, CS/IDS 150 ab, CMS/CS/CNS/EE/IDS 155, CS/CNS/EE 156 a, CS 179. 9 units (one term) from the list: Ae/AM/CE/ME 214, Ae/AM/ ME 232 ab, Ay 199, Ch 121 ab, GE 263, Ph/CS 219 abc. All courses to be applied toward the CSE minor requirements must be taken on a graded basis, and students must obtain a grade of B or higher in all courses. Courses that are used to satisfy the CSE minor cannot be used to satisfy course requirements in the major options unless absolutely required by the option. Courses taken as part of the CSE minor are counted toward the total number of units required for the completion of the Ph.D. degree. CSE Minor Administration The CSE minor is administered by an oversight committee consisting of three faculty members reporting to the chair of the engineering and applied science division. In consultation with their advisers and, if needed, with the CSE Oversight Committee, students formulate a pro - gram of approved courses individually tailored to each student's back - ground and needs, with the objective that the student achieve a level of competence in specific subjects relevant to CSE. Students must petition the CSE Oversight Committee for approval of their program of study. Upon completion of the program of study, the CSE Oversight Committee will verify that the CSE minor requirements have been ful - filled. COMPUTER SCIENCE (CS) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program Graduate study in computer science within the Computing & Mathematical Sciences department is oriented principally toward Ph.D. research. The Ph.D. program requires a minimum of three academic years of residence; required coursework is generally completed within the first two years. Students must maintain high academic standards during their graduate residence. A student's Ph.D. research must exhibit originality in the formulation, analysis, and solution of a problem that is significant to the field of study. The option representative and executive officers are available to discuss concerns regarding academic progress. CS Master's Degree There is no terminal M.S. degree in Computer Science. In exceptional circumstances (typically when a student leaves the Ph.D. program without completing the degree), the option representative may approve the awarding of a M.S. degree, if the course requirements have been met and the student has passed the preliminary examination (both are described below). CS Degree of Doctor of Philosophy Course requirements Students must complete a minimum of 135 units of courses numbered Special Regulations410 Graduate Information100 or greater, including research units (CS 280). Students should con - sult with their adviser to ensure balance in the selected courses. The coursework must include: CMS 290 is required for all first year CS graduate students during each term (fall/winter/spring). Advanced courses in computer science. Completion of a minimum of 54 units of CS courses numbered 100 or greater in addition to units earned for reading, research, and inde - pendent projects. Up to 24 of the 54 units may be taken from non-CS courses from CMS or ACM, including CMS/ACM/IDS 107, CMS/ACM/EE 122 and CMS 117, or other courses with approval from the option representative. Units outside computer science. Completion of a minimum of 27 units outside computer science. Courses jointly listed with computer science cannot be used to fulfill this requirement. Preliminary examination Toward the end of the first year, all incoming students must take a preliminary examination administered by the faculty. Its purpose is to ensure a solid and broad knowledge in computer science, and in the event of a deficiency, to direct the students to necessary courses and reading. Candidacy To be recommended for candidacy, a student must have completed the required coursework, have passed the preliminary examination, have entered upon a course of research approved by his or her thesis advis - er, and have passed a candidacy oral examination. The candidacy oral examination is administered by a committee that consists of four facul - ty that is approved by the option representative. The chair of the com - mittee must be a Caltech professorial faculty member distinct from the adviser. The examination ascertains the student's breadth and depth of preparation for research in the chosen area. The candidacy examination should be taken within the first three years of graduate study. Advising and Thesis Supervision In order to facilitate close supervision and a highly research-orient - ed environment, each student is admitted directly to an adviser and research group. A course of study is determined in consultation with the adviser. Occasionally students will be admitted into more than one group. Changes in affiliation may occur with the common consent of the student and the new adviser. Students meet regularly with their adviser throughout their time at Caltech, and are encouraged to do the same with other members of the faculty. Thesis and Final Examination A final oral examination will be scheduled and given after the Ph.D. the - sis has been submitted for review to the student's adviser and thesis committee; the latter consists of at least four faculty approved by the 411 Historical Sketchoption representative. The chair of the committee must be a Caltech professorial faculty member distinct from the adviser. The thesis exam - ination is a defense of the thesis research and a test of the candidate's knowledge in his or her specialized fields. Subject Minor in Computer Science A subject minor is not required for the Ph.D. degree in computer sci - ence. However, students majoring in other fields may take a subject minor in computer science, provided the program is supervised by a computer science faculty adviser, is approved by the computer science option representative, and consists of 45 units sufficiently removed from the student's major program of study. COMPUTING AND MATHEMATICAL SCIENCE (CMS) Aims and Scope of Graduate Program Algorithmic thinking is emerging as a fundamental tool for all researchers, not just computer scientists. Algorithmic thinking now drives disciplines ranging from statistics and electrical engineering to biology and physics to economics and the social sciences. Computing and Mathematical Sciences (CMS) is an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program that trains students to apply algorithmic thinking to problems across science and engineering. Our research mission is to build the mathematical and algorithmic foun - dations required to move from data to information to action. Students will study structures and mechanisms that store, process, and communicate information and that make decisions based on this information. These systems may be expressed in silicon and called computers, in lines of code called programs, or in abstract notation called mathematics. They may appear in economics as markets or social networks, as sequences of amino acids in DNA, or in the organic structure of the human brain. CMS Master's Degree Only students who expect to pursue the Ph.D. degree will be admitted to the option. The master's degree may be awarded in exception - al cases. The awarding of this degree requires fulfilling the Institute requirements for a master's degree, satisfying the core course require - ments, and receiving a recommendation for awarding of the degree from the preliminary exam committee. CMS Degree of Doctor of Philosophy Institute requirements for the Ph.D. degree are described in the section on degree requirements. Approximately two years of coursework are required, and two or more years are usually needed for preparation of the dissertation. CMS Admission to Candidacy To be recommended for candidacy for the Ph.D. degree in computing and mathematical sciences the student must, in addition to meeting the general Institute requirements, do the following: Special Regulations412 Graduate InformationCore requirement Each student will take six core CMS classes, three in applied mathematics (ACM) and three in Computer Science (CS). In both fields, at least two of the three classes will be taken the first year to prepare for the preliminary examination, while the remaining classes will be completed by the end of the student's second year. The core CMS classes are CMS/ACM/IDS 107, CMS/ACM/EE 122, CMS 117, CMS/CS/IDS 139, CMS/CS/EE/IDS 144, CMS/CS/CNS/IDS 155. These classes must be taken for a grade. Depth requirement: At least 27 units of courses in one particular subject area will be completed for a grade. The plan for these 27 units must be approved by the CMS option representative. Breadth requirement: At least 27 units of advanced courses in math - ematics, engineering, science, or social science will be completed for a grade. The plan for these 27 units must be approved by the CMS option representative. Preliminary Examination All students must pass a preliminary examination on material from two CMS core classes in applied mathematics and two CMS core classes in computer science. The examination is administered by a committee consisting of at least three faculty selected by the CMS option repre - sentative. The exam will occur during the student's first year. Candidacy Examination All students must pass an oral candidacy examination to ascertain the breadth and depth of preparation for research in the chosen field. The examination will be administered by a committee that consists of at least four faculty, that is approved by the CMS option representative, and that satisfies Institute regulations. In particular, the chair of the candidacy com - mittee must a faculty member distinct from the student's research adviser. The examination will occur during the student's first three years. CMS 290 is required for all CMS first-year graduate students during each term (fall/winter/spring). Advising and Thesis Supervision Upon admission, each student will be assigned a primary adviser in the option. This adviser will be replaced by a research adviser (possibly the same faculty member) once a direction of specialization is determined, and not later than the beginning of the second year. After completion of the candidacy exam, each student will form a thesis committee (possi - bly the same as the candidacy committee) that consists of at least four faculty, that is approved by the CMS option representative, and that satisfies Institute regulations. In particular, the chair of the thesis com - mittee must be a faculty member distinct from the student's research adviser. The thesis committee will meet as needed, but no less than once a year, in order to advise the student. A final oral examination will be scheduled and given after the Ph.D. thesis has been submitted for review to the student's adviser and thesis committee. The thesis examination is a defense of the thesis research and a test of the candidate's knowledge in his or her specialized fields. 413 Historical SketchNormally, the defense will consist of a one-hour public lecture followed by an examination of the thesis by the thesis committee. CONTROL AND DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS (CDS) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program The option in control and dynamical systems (CDS) is open to students with an undergraduate degree in engineering, mathematics, or science. The qualifications of each applicant will be considered individually, and, after being enrolled, the student will arrange his or her program in con - sultation with a member of the faculty. In some cases the student may be required to make up undergraduate deficiencies in engineering science courses. The CDS option, as part of the Computing and Mathematical Sciences department, emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of modern theory of dynamical systems and control. The curriculum is designed to promote a broad knowledge of mathematical and experimental techniques in dynam - ical systems theory and control. In addition to taking courses in the CDS option, students must select a focus area (see below). CDS Master's Degree Students will be admitted to the option who expect to pursue the Ph.D. degree. The master's degree may be awarded in exceptional cases. The awarding of this degree requires fulfilling the Institute requirements for a master's degree, satisfying the focus requirements, and receiving a recommendation for awarding of the degree from the candidacy oral examination committee. CDS Degree of Doctor of Philosophy Institute requirements for the Ph.D. degree are described in the section on degree requirements. Approximately two years of course work are required, and two or more years are usually needed for preparation of the dissertation. Admission to Candidacy To be recommended for candidacy for the Ph.D. degree in control and dynamical systems, the student must, in addition to meeting the general Institute requirements, do the following: Complete the following courses: CDS 131, CDS 232, and CDS 231 or CDS 233. Complete the following CMS/ACM courses: CMS/ACM/IDS 107, CMS/ACM/IDS 113, or CMS 117. Complete an additional 36 units in CDS or other advanced courses in systems theory, dynamical systems, robotics, and/or applied mathematics. Complete the focus requirement, consisting of at least 27 units in a particular area outside of CDS. Courses taken to satisfy the focus must represent a coherent program of advanced study in the chosen area. Possible areas include biological systems, Special Regulations414 Graduate Informationcomputer science, environmental science, fluid dynamics, infor - mation and communications, networking, robotics, and space systems. The program of study must be approved by the stu - dent's counseling committee and the option representative. Preliminary examination. Toward the end of the first year, all incom - ing students must take a preliminary examination administered by the faculty. Its purpose is to ensure a solid and broad knowl - edge in control and dynamical systems, and in the event of a deficiency, to direct the students to necessary courses and reading. Prepare a research progress report. Pass an oral examination on the major topic of the student's research. The oral examination is normally taken no later than the end of the third year of graduate academic residence at the Institute. In addition, CMS 290 is required for all CDS first year graduate stu - dents during each term (fall/winter/spring). Advising and Thesis Supervision Upon admission, each student is assigned an adviser in the option, who will approve the initial course of study by the student. A preliminary exam given during the first year of study will be used to evaluate the student's preparation for continued study. The adviser will be replaced by a research adviser and a candidacy committee when the direction of specialization is determined, not later than the beginning of the second year. The candidacy exam is normally taken during the third year of study. The candidacy committee will be the judge of the completion of the engineering focus requirement, necessary before advancement to candidacy. The student's candidacy committee may be reconstituted as the thesis committee after the candidacy exam has been successfully completed. At the early stages of thesis preparation, the student's thesis committee will meet as needed to advise the student of his or her progress and to deal with any problems that might have arisen. A final oral examination will be given after the thesis has been formal - ly completed. The thesis examination will be a defense of the doctoral thesis and a test of the candidate's knowledge in the specialized field of research. Normally this defense will consist of a one-hour public lecture followed by an examination of the thesis by the thesis committee. CDS Subject Minor A student majoring in another option at the Institute may elect a subject minor in control and dynamical systems. The student must obtain approval from the CDS faculty of a course of study containing at least 54 units of courses that are required for the CDS Ph.D. (see Advancement to Candidacy) or advanced courses with a CDS listing.415 Historical SketchELECTRICAL ENGINEERING (EE) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program Award of the Bachelor of Science degree may be followed by graduate study leading to the Master of Science degree in electrical engineering, and the more advanced degrees of Electrical Engineer or Doctor of Philosophy. Because admission to graduate studies in electrical engi - neering at Caltech is extremely competitive, the Admissions Committee attempts to select those applicants it judges both best qualified and best suited for the graduate program. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) will not be required or considered for admission to the Ph.D. or M.S. degree programs in Electrical Engineering. EE Master's Degree Normally, the master's degree in electrical engineering is completed in one academic year. The principal criteria for evaluating applicants for the MSEE are the excellence of their preparation for the math- and phys - ics-oriented nature of Caltech's graduate courses, and the judgment of the Admissions Committee on their ability to successfully pursue and benefit from the course program. The Institute does not normally admit an applicant to the master's degree in a field in which the applicant already has a master's degree from another U.S. institution. Financial aid is seldom offered to those who intend to complete their graduate work with a master's degree. A joint B.S./M.S. degree is not available in elec - trical engineering. 135 units (100 or above) are required as approved by the electrical engineering graduate student adviser. No more than 30 units of pass/fail grades may be counted toward this requirement. Units toward this are not transferable from other schools. At least 54 units of EE letter-graded courses (courses listed or cross-listed as EE) labeled 100 or above and not counting EE 291 are required. EE 105 abc, Electrical Engineering Seminar, is also required. Students are urged to consider including a humanities course in the remaining free electives. Students who have been admitted to the M.S.-only program must reapply if they are interested in the Ph.D. program. EE Degree of Electrical Engineer The engineer's degree may be awarded in exceptional cases. The awarding of this degree requires fulfilling the Institute requirements for an engineer's degree and receiving a recommendation for its awarding from the candidacy oral examination committee. EE Degree of Doctor of Philosophy As a rule, applicants who wish to undertake research work leading to a degree of Doctor of Philosophy in electrical engineering are admitted initially only for the MSEE. They are, however, evaluated according to additional criteria, the most important of which is the applicant's inter - est in and potential for research in one of the areas described below. The statement of purpose required as part of the application should clearly address this match. Considerable weight is also given to the Special Regulations416 Graduate Informationopinions expressed in the applicant's letters of recommendation. During the Ph.D. applicant's master's degree year, evaluation con - tinues. It is based in part on performance in courses and in part on a one-hour oral presentation scheduled early in the second quarter. As the year progresses, the electrical engineering faculty get to know the student, and the student makes contact with the professor in his or her area of research interest. Upon acceptance into a research group, the student begins research work and defers receiving the master's degree until formal admission into the Ph.D. program. In the event that the Adviser is not an EE faculty member, the student should meet with the EE Option Representative and develop an oversight plan to monitor progress. Before the end of his or her second academic year of graduate study, the student normally takes the Ph.D. qualifying oral examination. This must, however, be done no later than the end of the third academic year. Ph.D. applicants who already hold a master's degree in electrical engineering from another U.S. institution may be admitted directly to the Ph.D. program, but must provide sufficient information to obtain advance acceptance into a research group. Financial aid available to a Ph.D. applicant includes teaching assis - tantships and fellowships. TA duties consist of grading papers or lab instruction but not classroom lecturing. A fellowship may be supple - mented by a teaching assistantship, and either or both include a full tuition scholarship. Tuition scholarships alone are not available. If finan - cial aid is not requested, or if the box on the application form labeled \"willing to come without aid'' is checked, information on the source of funds for each year of intended graduate study must be included. Candidacy To be recommended for candidacy for the doctor's degree, the appli - cant must satisfy the following requirements (and pass the Ph.D. quali - fying oral examination) no later than the end of the third academic year: Complete 18 units of research in his or her field of interest. Obtain approval of a course of study consisting of at least 135 units of advanced courses in electrical engineering or the related subjects approved by the Ph.D. adviser, with at least 54 units of letter-graded EE courses numbered 100 or above (not counting EE 291). Only up to 27 units in research (e.g., EE 291) may be counted in this total. No more than 30 units of pass/fail grades may be counted toward this requirement. The courses taken to satisfy the math requirement below and courses taken to fulfill the Master of Science degree requirement may be included to satisfy this requirement. Units toward this requirement are not transferable from other schools. Pass 27 units of mathematics courses, as approved by the stu - dent's research adviser, with letter grade no lower than C. Pass a qualifying oral examination covering broadly the major field. Students are strongly encouraged to do this before the end of the second year of residency.417 Historical SketchPh.D. Committee The Ph.D. qualifying oral exam and the final defense exam are conduct - ed by committees that are set up by the student and approved by the option representative. Members of these Ph.D. committees also serve as second or backup mentors in cases where such additional advising and problem solving are appropriate. Thesis and Final Examination The candidate is required to take a final oral examination covering the doctoral thesis and its significance in and relation to his or her major field. This final examination will be given no less than two weeks after the doctoral thesis has been presented in final form, and before its approval. This examination must be taken at least four weeks before the commencement at which the degree is to be granted. Advising and Thesis Supervision Periodic meetings between the advising faculty and the graduate student are an integral part of the Ph.D. program. These meetings should be at sufficiently frequent intervals, as determined by the student and adviser. Students are also encouraged to meet with other members of the Ph.D. committee, the option representative, the executive officer, or Caltech's ombudsperson to discuss problems relating to satisfactory progress. EE Subject Minor A student majoring in another option at the Institute may elect a subject minor in electrical engineering. The student must obtain approval from the electrical engineering faculty of a course of study containing at least 45 units (over the 100 level) of advanced courses with an EE list - ing (excluding 291). At least 36 of these should be for letter grades no lower than C. Freshman classes cannot be counted toward this. ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (ESE) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program The ESE graduate program trains doctoral students to solve fundamen - tal problems in environmental science and engineering. The problems cut across traditional disciplinary boundaries and span space scales ranging from global to local. Students are trained to acquire a broad base of knowledge of environmental systems, including Earth's atmo - sphere, oceans, and biosphere. They deepen their knowledge in one or more focus areas, culminating in research leading to a Ph.D. thesis. Reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of research in the ESE pro - gram, the program unites faculty from the divisions of Geological and Planetary Sciences, Engineering and Applied Science, and Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. Admission Applicants for admission to the ESE program should have undergrad - uate preparation in science, engineering, or mathematics. Admission is limited to students intending to pursue the Ph.D. degree. Only students Special Regulations418 Graduate Informationwho intend to work full-time toward the Ph.D. degree are admitted. The application submission deadline is January 1. The admission process follows Institute regulations. The GRE general test and subject tests are not required. Self-reported scores will not be considered. International Students In order to be admitted for graduate study, students from non-En - glish-speaking countries are expected to read, write, and speak English and comprehend the spoken language. Although not required for admission, for applicants whose native language is not English or have not received a degree from a university or college where English is the primary language of instruction, it is important to demonstrate a strong capability in English prior to admission to Caltech. This can be done by self-reporting scores from the Educational Testing Service (TOEFL), Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE Academic), the Cambridge Examinations and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), or other services that provide a certified English-language pro - ficiency examination. The ESE faculty may also arrange an online inter - view while assessing applications. Advising An academic adviser is appointed for each incoming student to assist in designing his or her academic program. The research adviser is cho - sen by mutual agreement of the student and adviser during the second year of graduate study, after passing the Ph.D. qualifying examination. The Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC), consisting of four Caltech fac - ulty members including the research adviser, should be constituted and meet with the student soon after the student passes the qualifying examination; thereafter, it should meet with the student annually to review progress and provide guidance and support. Committee mem - bership may be changed if the student's research interests change. The TAC generally serves to recommend the student's advancement to candidacy; it may also serve as the examining committee for the final thesis defense. ESE Master's Degree Students enrolled in the Ph.D. program may be awarded a master's degree if they have satisfied the basic Institute requirement of 135 units of work in courses numbered 100 or higher. These courses must include those specifically required in the ESE Ph.D. program. ESE Degree of Doctor of Philosophy For the Ph.D. degree, the student must (1) satisfy the course require - ments, (2) pass the qualifying examination, (3) advance to candidacy, and (4) complete a thesis and successfully defend it in a final oral examination. Course Requirements During their first year, students, in consultation with their academic advisers, must design a program of graduate study that includes a min -419 Historical Sketchimum of 135 units of graduate work to be completed before the end of their third year. The course program should take into account the stu - dents' individual backgrounds and focus areas, educate them broadly in fundamental questions and methods of contemporary environmental science and engineering, and prepare them for their research. The course program must include the core courses ESE 101, 102, and 103. Attendance at the weekly research seminars (ESE 104 and 110 abc) is required for first-year students and is expected of all gradu - ate students. All students are expected to have knowledge of methods of applied mathematics and statistics on the level of courses such as Ge 108 and Ge/ESE 118. In cases of unusual preparation, students may petition to substitute a similar but more advanced course for one of the required courses. Additionally, students are required to take 36 units of elective cours - es from two of the three groups below: Environmental Biology: ESE/Bi Ge/ESE 150, ESE/ChE 158. The remaining units of graduate work can be fulfilled by a com - bination of elective courses in ESE or related disciplines, reading or laboratory courses (ESE 100), and research (ESE 106, 300). Of the total required 135 units, no more than 45 units may be in research. No more than 27 research units may be taken during the first year of graduate study. Exceptions may be granted by petition. It is expected that each graduate student will, as part of the Ph.D. graduation requirement, serve as a teaching assistant for one course per year, following completion of the qualifying exam. Ph.D. Qualifying Examination The Ph.D. qualifying examination must be taken during the first term of the student's second year of residency. This examination consists prin - cipally of an oral defense of two research propositions, each advised by a different faculty member. Written abstracts must be submitted for both propositions, and one of them must be described in the form of a research report or proposal. The qualifying exam also covers the mate - rial of the ESE core courses and of the elective courses the student has taken. In preparation for the qualifying examination, students are encour - aged to register for nine units of research (ESE 106) in their second and third terms of residency. Advancement to Candidacy Students are recommended to advance to candidacy following the successful completion of a candidacy exam with their Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC). The exam, consisting of both a written Ph.D. thesis proposal and an oral presentation of this plan is required, and must be approved by all TAC members. Advancement to candidacy, including all required course work, should be completed before the end of spring term in the student's third year of residency. Special Regulations420 Graduate InformationThesis and Final Examination Copies of the completed thesis must be provided to the examining committee two weeks before the final oral examination. The final oral examination focuses on the work of the thesis and, according to Institute regulations, must be held at least two weeks before the degree is conferred. ESE Subject Minor Graduate students majoring in another option at the Institute may elect a subject minor in ESE. The ESE minor is intended to supplement one of Caltech's graduate degrees and is designed for students who wish to broaden and deepen their expertise with knowledge in ESE. To com - plete an ESE subject minor, graduate students must enroll in a program of study approved by the ESE option representative, which is to include at least 36 units over two or more terms of graduate-level ESE classes (ESE 100 and above) and 18 units over two or more terms of research under ESE 106 or ESE 300. At least one of the graduate-level ESE classes must be ESE 101, ESE 102, or ESE 103. GEOLOGICAL AND PLANETARY SCIENCES (GPS) (Geology, Geobiology, Geochemistry, Geophysics, Planetary Science) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program Students in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences study the earth and planets to understand their origin, constitution, and develop - ment, and the effect of the resulting physical and chemical characteris - tics on the history of life, on the environment, and on humanity. Broad training in the fundamental sciences enriched by more specialized course work within the division forms the basis of the educational pro - gram. Students are encouraged to work with complex and often incom - plete data sets, to undertake research in natural settings such as in the field or at sea, and to use the many modern laboratory facilities avail - able within the division. Programs of study and research are pursued in environmental science and engineering, geobiology, geochemistry, geology, geophysics, and planetary science. The curriculum is flexible so that students with diverse degrees in science and engineering may carry out graduate work within the division. Interdisciplinary studies are encouraged and students may carry out academic and research pro - grams within and between different divisions. The objective is to train students for future employment in academic research, government, and industry. Admission and Entrance Procedures Only students who intend to work full-time toward the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree are admitted. The application submission deadline for the GPS Division is January 1. The admission process fol - lows Institute regulations. The GRE general test and subject tests are not required for any of the GPS options. Self-reported scores will not be considered.421 Historical SketchInternational Students In order to be admitted for graduate study, students from non-En - glish-speaking countries are expected to read, write, and speak English and comprehend the spoken language. Although not required for admission, for applicants whose native language is not English or have not received a degree from a university or college where English is the primary language of instruction, it is important to demonstrate a strong capability in English prior to admission to Caltech. This can be done by self-reporting scores from the Educational Testing Service (TOEFL), Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE Academic), the Cambridge Examinations and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), or other services that provide a certified English-language proficiency examination. The GPS faculty may also arrange an online interview while assessing applications. Based on their applications and interests, students enter one of the major subject options of the division and are given an academic advis - er who is a professorial faculty member associated with the option. The six options are environmental science and engineering, geobiology, geochemistry, geology, geophysics, and planetary science. Students may later change options, but must first obtain approval from the new option. Each student must plan to satisfy the requirements for the Ph.D. degree in one option. Entering students in the week preceding the beginning of instruction for the first term meet with their option representatives to discuss their preparation in the basic sciences and select a series of courses that will best prepare them for research in their chosen field while meeting the requirements set forth below. First-year graduate students are encouraged to register for at least nine units of research (Ge 297) in each term of residence. The primary objective is to communicate to the students the excitement of discov - ery based on original investigations and to provide a broad scope of research aims. An important byproduct can be the formulation of prop - ositions for the Ph.D. qualifying oral examination or orientation toward Ph.D. research. Advising and Thesis Supervision The option representative for each incoming student will act as the aca - demic adviser in the first term. An academic adviser will be assigned by the start of second term. This appointed adviser will continue as men - tor with broad responsibility for a student's academic welfare through - out the graduate program. During the second year, after passing the qualifying examination, each student should identify a professor as thesis adviser, who will normally provide a graduate research assistant - ship and the opportunity for continuing research. In consultation with the two faculty advisers, each student then forms a Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC), composed of at least four Caltech professors (chaired by the academic adviser). External scientists closely involved in the student's research may also be appointed. Members of the TAC serve as advisers, counselors, and resources, and its membership may be changed if a student's research interests change. Special Regulations422 Graduate InformationThe TAC meets with the student at least once each year for a prog - ress review, and informally whenever the student needs or requests assistance or guidance. In addition, the faculty members in each option have their own systems for annual evaluations of student progress. A few months before completion of the thesis dissertation, the thesis examining committee will be chosen, usually including the members of the Thesis Advisory Committee. All students are urged to consult with division faculty in the following sequence if they have any problems: thesis and academic advisers, Thesis Advisory Committee, option representative, academic officer, and division chair. If these division personnel cannot resolve a problem, then the student should turn to Institute offices. GPS Master's Degree Students enrolled in the Ph.D. program may be awarded a master's degree when they have satisfied the basic Institute requirement of 135 units. These courses must be part of a plan of study approved by the option representative, numbered 100 or higher, and part of those used to satisfy the Ph.D. requirement in one of the options of the divi - sion. A minimum of 72 units should be taken as courses, rather than research or independent study units. Specifically required are two courses from the list Ge 101, Ge 102, Ge 103, Ge 104, or ESE 101, ESE 102, ESE 103. An application for admission to candidacy for an M.S. degree must be submitted in REGIS according to the academic calendar in the Caltech Catalog (see pages 4-5). GPS Degree of Doctor of Philosophy Division Requirements For a Ph.D. degree, the student must 1) pass the qualifying oral exam - ination, 2) satisfy course requirements of the division and of an option, and 3) complete a thesis and successfully defend it in a final oral exam - ination. Recommendation to the dean of graduate studies for admis - sion to candidacy occurs after the student has satisfied the first two requirements and has been accepted for thesis research by a division faculty member, who then becomes the student's thesis adviser. The qualifying examination consists of oral and written defense of two research propositions, supplemented by a written description of one of them. Students are encouraged to consult with various faculty members concerning their ideas on propositions, but the material submitted must represent the work of the student. There must be a different faculty mem - ber associated with each of the two propositions. The exam is normally taken early in the first term of the second year of residence and is admin - istered by the qualifying examination committee, which has members from the six options of the division. A more detailed outline of the qualifying examination is available on the division website. By the end of the fall term of the second year, students are expect - ed to select a thesis adviser(s) and before the end of the second year, the Thesis Advisory Committee will be selected, as outlined above. The division encourages students to engage in research early in their graduate careers. Students making normal progress will submit papers 423 Historical Sketchto refereed journals that have been approved by a faculty member of the division. The final oral examination for the doctorate by the thesis examining committee will be scheduled no sooner than two weeks fol - lowing submission of the thesis (approved by the thesis adviser) and, in conformity with Institute regulations, it must be scheduled at least two weeks before the degree is to be conferred. Candidates are expected to publish the major results of their the - sis work. The published papers should have a California Institute of Technology address. Published papers may be included in the thesis. By the end of the first academic year (third term): submission by the student of (1) tentative titles of propositions for review by the qualifying examination committee and (2) a list of courses planned to satisfy the Ph.D. requirement, for review by the option. By the end of the second academic year: (1) passage of oral exam; (2) approval by the option of courses planned to satisfy candidacy requirements; (3) submission of a tentative thesis topic and adviser, and Thesis Advisory Committee. By the end of the third academic year: (1) satisfactory completion of course requirements; (2) satisfactory completion of other requirements including selection of thesis topic and adviser, and Thesis Advisory Committee; (3) admission to candidacy. A student who has not been admitted to candidacy by the end of the third year will need permission of the academic officer to register. By the end of the fourth academic year: satisfactory progress toward completion of thesis. After completing the fifth academic year, the student must formally petition to register for each subsequent year. Financial aid will normally not be extended beyond the sixth year. The student's program and progress will be reviewed annually by his or her option and by the Thesis Advisory Committee. In cases where, in the opinion of the faculty in the option, the student is clearly not showing adequate progress, they may recommend to the division chair that the student be denied permission to continue in the Ph.D. program based upon their overall assessment of the student's performance. Basic Division Course Requirement During the first year, every graduate student will take two of the seven basic introductory courses Ge 101-104 and ESE 101-103, in areas in which the student has not had substantial training. These should be completed during the first year. Throughout their graduate careers, students are expected to attend departmental seminars and seminar courses led by visiting scientists. Beginning in the second academic year, students are required to serve as teaching assistants for one quarter per year they are in resi - dence. GPS Requirements of the Major Subject Options Geobiology In addition to the general Institute and basic division requirements, can - didates for the Ph.D. degree in geobiology must successfully complete a minimum of 90 units at the 100 or greater level, including Ge 104; either Special Regulations424 Graduate InformationBi/Ch 110, Bi/CNS/NB 195, or Ge/ESE 118; and two courses from each of the following three subject menus: Geology : Ge 106, 112, 114 ab, 124 ab, Ge 125. Chemistry: Ge/ESE 143, 149, Ge 140 ab, ESE/Ge/Ch 171, 172, ESE/Ch 175, 176. Biology: ESE/Bi 166, 168, Ge/ESE/Bi 178, Bi 117, ESE 103. Other classes may be substituted for these menu requirements with the approval of the option representative. A student with substantial prior experience in geobiology (e.g., an M.S. degree) may use prior course work to substitute up to 45 of these units with the approval of the geobiology option representative. All students must have a basic knowledge of organic chemistry at the level of Ch 41 a. This require - ment may be met by previous course work or through successful completion of this class. Geobiology students must complete one term (6 units) of Ge 109 (Oral Presentation) as an independent study with a faculty member of their choosing, typically the thesis adviser. Geochemistry In addition to general Institute and basic division requirements, candidates for the Ph.D. degree in geochemistry are required to take one term of Ge 109 in the geochemistry option and are required to demonstrate an under - standing of the field through a total of 90 units of course work at the 100 level or higher spread over four of the subdisciplines offered in the option: petrology/mineralogy, atmospheres, biogeochemistry, or advanced chemis - try. All students must have a basic knowledge of chemistry at the level of Ch 21 and mathematics at the level of Ge 108. If appropriate, Ch 21 abc may be included as part of these units, and other courses below the 100 level may be included at the discretion of the option representative. With the approval of the geochemistry option representative, a student with substantial prior experience in some of the subdisciplines may use prior course work to substitute for up to 45 of these units and students entering with a master's degree in science or mathematics may be exempt from up to 45 units. In the oral candidacy exam, the student will be subject to examination in all four of the chosen subdisciplines. Geology The geology option requirements are (1) two of Ge 102, 103, 104, or ESE 101, ESE 102, ESE 103, which also satisfy the basic division require - ment; (2) 36 units of advanced field geology, in the form of three terms of Ge 121 abc taken from three different instructors; (3) 54 additional units in 100- or 200-level science, math or engineering courses in any field at Caltech. Ch 21 abc may be included as part of these units, and other courses below the 100 level may be included at the discretion of the option representative. Courses that cannot be used to satisfy these requirements include research and reading courses, and certain courses constituting basic preparation in the field of geology, such as Ge 106, Ge 112, Ge 114 ab, and Ge 115 ab. A grade of C or better is required for all course work that satisfies these requirements. Knowledge of basic physics, mathematics, and data analysis at the level of Ge 108 and Ge/ ESE 118 is required of all Ph.D. candidates in geology. Students entering 425 Historical Sketchthe geology option with a master's degree in a science or mathematics may be exempt from up to 45 units at the discretion of the option repre - sentative. Geology students are required to give a 30-minute presentation, including 10 minutes of discussion, on their research at the Geoclub Seminar series before admission to candidacy. Geophysics In addition to general Institute requirements, candidates for the Ph.D degree in geophysics must successfully complete the following: (1) two of the following basic introductory courses: Ge 101, 103, 104, or ESE 101-103, and one term of Ge 109 per year from the second year until the last year prior to obtaining the degree; (2) either Ae/Ge/ME 160 ab, APh 105 ab, MS 115, or a subject equivalent; (3) three of Ge 161, Ge 162, Ge 163, or Ge 164; (4) Ge 111 ab; (5) the choice between five addi - tional 100- or 200-level science or mathematics courses or a minor in any field at Caltech (for example, computational science and engineer - ing). It is highly recommended that (1)-(4) be fulfilled in the first year and (5) in the second year. A grade of C or better is required for all course work that satisfies these requirements. Knowledge of basic physics, mathematics, and data analysis at the level of Ge 108 and Ge/ESE 118 is required of all Ph.D. candidates in geophysics. This requirement may be met by previous course work or through successful completion of these classes. Students may substitute another course for a required course if they can demonstrate to an option representative that they have already had the material in the required course. Planetary Science In addition to general Institute and basic division requirements, can - didates for the Ph.D. degree in planetary science must satisfy the fol - lowing course requirements: Ge 101, Ge 102, and courses in planetary formation and dynamics (Ge/Ay 133), planetary atmospheres (Ge/ESE 150), planetary interiors (Ge 131), and planetary surfaces (Ge 151). In addition, students shall successfully complete 45 units of 100-level or higher courses in a coherent field of specialization. This requirement may be satisfied by completion of a subject minor or through a set of courses chosen in consultation with and approved by the adviser and the option representative. All candidates are expected to possess knowledge of physics and mathematics at the level of Ge 108. This requirement may be met by previous coursework or through successful completion of this class. Higher-level mathematics and physics courses are strongly encouraged. All candidates are expected to attend the planetary sciences seminar regularly. Satisfaction of the oral presenta - tion requirement includes at least one 30-minute presentation annually by the student in the planetary sciences seminar, starting in the second year. Typically, students will present on their research work each year. GPS Subject Minor A student may, with the approval of the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, elect a minor in any one of the major subjects listed above. Such a subject minor will include at least 45 units in courses at the Special Regulations426 Graduate Information100 level or higher. Normally, a member of the division faculty affiliated with the minor will participate in the student's oral thesis defense. HISTORY (H) The program for a subject minor in history must be approved by the executive officer for the humanities before the admission to candida - cy. In addition to meeting general Institute requirements, the student must complete satisfactorily, with a grade of C or better, 45 units in advanced courses in history. HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE (HPS) Graduate students in science, mathematics, or engineering may take a minor in history and philosophy of science (HPS). The graduate minor is devoted to the study of the historical evolution and philosophical underpinnings of the physical and biological sciences. Historical work in the minor includes the origins of experimental practice, the social and institutional contexts of science, the origins and applications of quantitative methods, specific developments since antiquity in physics, biology, and chemistry, as well as biographical and comparative stud - ies. Philosophical research deals with issues in causation, explanation, scientific inference, the foundations of probability and decision theory, philosophy of mind and psychology, philosophy of neuroscience, and scientific fraud and misconduct. The minor thus fosters the acquisition of broad knowledge about the scientific enterprise and related foundational problems, as well as more detailed analysis of the progress of and philosophical problems in particular branches of science. It is a valuable supplement to a tech - nical degree since it helps equip students to understand the nature of scientific progress and to grapple with the conceptual basis of science and its wider ramifications. Students who successfully complete the HPS minor will be recognized with official credit for the achievement on their transcripts. Requirements Graduate students who take an HPS minor are expected to complete Hum/H/HPS 10, HPS 102 ab, HPS/Pl 120, at least three units of HPS 103, and 18 units of additional work in HPS, to be completed by taking courses in HPS/H or HPS/Pl numbered 99 or higher. Students need not complete the requirements for the minor within the first two years of graduate study. INFORMATION AND DATA SCIENCE (IDS) IDS Subject Minor A subject minor in Information and Data Science (IDS) may be elected by graduate students who are pursuing PhD degrees in any option. The IDS graduate minor is designed for students who wish to broad -427 Historical Sketchen their expertise and get a solid background in the following areas: Mathematics of Data Science, Machine Learning, Statistical Data Analysis, and Information Theory. To receive the IDS graduate minor, students must satisfy the following requirements: 1. Linear Algebra: ACM/IDS 104 or CMS/ACM/IDS 107 2. Probability: ACM/EE/IDS 116 or CMS 117 3. Statistics: IDS/ACM/CS 157 or ACM 118 4. Machine Learning: CMS/CS/CNS/EE/IDS 155 or CS/CNS/EE 156a 5. One course from the following list: Hum/Pl 45, CMS/ACM/EE 122, Ma/ACM/IDS 140 ab, IDS/Ec/PS 159, 162, CS/EE/IDS 166, EE/CS/IDS 167, CS/IDS 178. Note that all these courses have prerequisites that the student may need to take, depending on the student's background. The prerequi - sites can be satisfied with equivalent courses with approval from the instructor. All courses used for fulfilling the IDS graduate minor requirements must be taken on a graded basis and students must obtain a grade of B or higher on all courses. Courses that are used to satisfy the minor requirements cannot be used to satisfy the requirements in the major options. MATERIALS SCIENCE (MS) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program The graduate program is designed to give students an understanding of general phenomena in synthesis-structure-property relationships in all materials, plus a detailed understanding of phenomena for at least one broad class of materials such as: physical materials science (solid state physics, quantum mechanics); mechanical materials science (micromechanics, continuum mechanics); soft materials (polymer chem - istry/physics, chemical bonding); or oxide materials science (mineralo - gy/mineral physics). After completing the Ph.D. program, students have pursued careers in teaching and research at colleges and universities, in research for government and industry, in the operation and control of manufacturing processes, and in management and development posi - tions in the materials industry. Students may enter the graduate program in materials science with undergraduate preparation in physics, chemistry, engineering, or mate - rials science. Students interested in terminating their graduate study at the master's level are not normally admitted. Students in the Ph.D. Special Regulations428 Graduate Informationprogram are required to complete a set of core courses, pass an oral candidacy examination, complete a thesis describing original research in materials science or a related field, and publicly defend their thesis work. MS Preparation for the Graduate Program Students who have not specialized in materials science as undergrad - uates, as well as those who have, may be admitted for graduate study. As preparation for advanced study and research, entering graduate students are expected to have a thorough background in undergradu - ate mathematics, physics, and engineering. An outstanding four-year undergraduate program in mathematics and sciences is also a suitable background. The qualifications of each applicant will be considered individually, and, after being enrolled, the student will arrange their course of study and research in consultation with members of the fac - ulty and the materials science option representative. MS Master's Degree The degree of Master of Science in materials science is only awarded to students who do not already have an M.S. degree in Materials Science. The degree will be awarded upon request by students who have fulfilled the requirements. Only in exceptional cases is there admission to the M.S. program as the final degree objective. Each student is assigned to a member of the faculty who will serve as the student's adviser. The adviser and option representative for materials science will approve the student's course of study. Study for the degree of Master of Science in materials science will ordinarily require at least three terms of courses. The courses shall be chosen from the list of core courses below, although 27 units of research (MS 200 or equivalent) may be substituted for 27 units of lecture or labo - ratory courses. Completion of 137 units of these courses within two years with no grade less than a C constitutes the academic require - ments for the M.S. degree. Core Courses 1. MS 131, MS 132, MS 133. 2. APh/MS 105abc, or ChE/Ch 165 and ChE/Ch 164 and Ae/ME 118 and ChE/Ch 164 and APh/ MS 105c. 3. Two quarters of courses focused on specific materials, such as APh 114 ab; Ch 120 a; Ch 121 ab; Ge 114, Ge 214, or ME/MS/Ae/AM 224. 4. Two quarters of courses focused on internal interactions in materials, such as Ph 125 ab, Ch 125 ab or Ae/Ge/ME 160ab. 5. 18 units of courses comprising either the third terms of the sequences taken in 3 and 4 above, or other courses appropriate for the student's research interests, such as MS/ME/ MedE 116, MS 121, MS/APh 122, MS 125, MS 141, MS 142, MS/ME 161, MS/APh 162, MS/ME 166, MS/APh 171, Ae/AM/ MS/ME 213, MS/APh 256, ME/MS 260 6. Mathematics at the level expected of research in the student's 429 Historical Sketchfield. This may be satisfied by the courses ACM/IDS 104 and ACM 100ab, or ACM/IDS 101ab, or ACM/EE 141 can substitute for ACM/EE 106b or Ph 129c. Other variations may be possible at discretion of option repre - sentative. 7. MS 110 (2 units) or APh 110 (4 units). MS Degree of Doctor of Philosophy The doctoral program in materials science consists of a series of pre - paratory classes, followed by an oral candidacy exam, a written thesis, and a final oral thesis defense. The goals of this program are to develop excellence in a chosen field of specialization; to develop tools with which to assess problems outside the student's field of specialization; to devel - op sufficient strength in the physical sciences for self-education beyond formal training; and to cultivate the motivation and foresight to become a productive and influential leader. As such, the graduate program in materials science is designed to be a doctoral program and students are only admitted into the doctoral program. There is no separate master's program in materials science. The Ph.D. degree in materials science is focused on research. Study and research programs for the Ph.D. degree are individually planned to fit the interests and background of the student. A comprehensive research project resulting in an original contribution to the field documented by a dissertation is required. Residency A minimum of three academic years in residence as a graduate student are required by the Institute, and two or more additional years are usu - ally needed for preparation of the thesis. Language Requirement There is no language requirement for the Ph.D. degree. Minor No minor is required for the Ph.D. degree. Students are, however, encouraged to take advanced courses appropriate to their particular interests. Advising and Thesis Supervision An interim adviser is appointed for each student upon admission to a graduate degree in materials science (typically the materials science option representative). The interim adviser will serve as the primary mentor until the student finds a research adviser. In the first year (no later than the third term), each student must choose a research adviser who will have primary responsibility for supervising the student's course program and research. The important adviser- advisee relationship requires effort from both parties, and some gen - eral expectations are outlined earlier in this section of the catalog. In consultation with their research adviser, the student should then form a Ph.D. Thesis Advisory Committee. This four-member com - mittee should include: (i) the student's adviser, and (ii) at least three Special Regulations430 Graduate Informationmembers of the Caltech professorial faculty. The research adviser and the Thesis Advisory Committee provide the majority of mentor - ing to the student, offering advice on research, progress toward the Ph.D., future careers, and other aspects of life in graduate school and as a professional scientist. Requirements for Candidacy for the Ph.D. Degree To be recommended for candidacy for the Ph.D. degree in Materials Science, the student must, in addition to meeting the general Institute requirements, do the following: a. Courses. To continue in the graduate program, the student must maintain a B- average for each term. Advancement to candidacy requires the successful completion of the pro - gram listed under \"Core Courses\" above. Alternatively, if the student has taken equivalent courses elsewhere, they may prove competency to the instructor of the equivalent course at the Institute and request a waiver of the required course. With the Core Course requirements 1-7, students must com - plete a minimum of 137 units of courses, numbered 100 or above, before presenting themselves for Ph.D. candidacy. The coursework towards the Ph.D. degree in materials science is typically completed within the first two years of residency at Caltech. All courses must be passed with a grade of at least a C, except for courses taken on a pass/fail basis. Students must complete the degree progress report online. Alternate Subjects or Areas ~ Students entering the program with advanced preparation may choose either to substitute more advanced courses in the topical areas shown or demonstrate competency to the course instructor. ~ Students may petition the materials science option representative to accept alternative subjects or areas, but such petitions must be submitted before the student registers for the courses. b. Oral Candidacy Examination. This examination should be taken no later than the end of the student's second year of residence. The student's research adviser must be on the examining committee, but cannot serve as chair of the com - mittee. The examination is based on the student's course - work, and how it is related to the student's planned research area. The student will be expected to deliver a half-hour oral presentation describing research to-date and will answer questions related to this work. This portion of the examina - tion will be followed by more open-ended questions to test general proficiency in materials science. Students who fail the oral examination on their first attempt will be given addition - al guidelines for further study and an opportunity to retake the examination a second and final time if the committee so 431 Historical Sketchrecommends. Students who fail the oral examination a sec - ond time cannot continue with doctoral studies leading to the Ph.D. Upon recommendation of the examining commit - tee, however, a student may be granted a terminal master's degree. The approval of the materials science option repre - sentative is necessary for registration beyond the third year of graduate residence without successfully completing the candidacy exam. c. Research Competence. The student must have a doctoral research adviser, and must have completed at least 18 units of MS 200. Students who fulfill the requirements above will be recommended for candidacy to the doctoral program and a master's degree (if applicable) in materials science. Ph.D. Thesis Requirements The candidate is to provide a draft copy of the completed thesis to the members of the examining committee (typically the same as the Thesis Advisory Committee) at least two weeks before the final oral examination. The date of the examination and the composition of the examining committee will not be approved by the dean of graduate studies until the thesis is submitted in completed form, i.e., ready for review by the dean, the members of the thesis committee, and the Graduate Office proofreader. Registration is required for the term in which the thesis defense is undertaken, but is not normally allowed beyond the last date of the term. For more information, please see the section entitled \"Information for Graduate Students\" in the Caltech Catalog . Ph.D. Final Examination The candidate is required to take a final oral examination covering the doctoral thesis and its significance in and relation to materials science. It will consist of a public thesis seminar and an associated oral examination on the thesis and related fields. The examining committee must consist of the student's adviser and three members of the Caltech professorial faculty. The chair of the examining com - mittee must be a Caltech professorial faculty member distinct from the adviser. This examination will be held at least two weeks after the doctoral thesis has been presented in its final form, and prior to its approval. Registration beyond the Sixth Year of Graduate Residence The annual approval of the student's Thesis Advisory Committee and option representative is necessary for registration beyond the eigh - teenth academic term of graduate residence at Caltech. MS Subject Minor Graduate students majoring in another option at the Institute may elect a subject minor in materials science. They must obtain approval from the materials science option representative for a course of study containing at least 45 units of advanced courses with a grade of C or Special Regulations432 Graduate Informationhigher. Normally a member of the materials science faculty will partici - pate in the candidacy examination in the student's major department. Students cannot use courses required by their major option in fulfillment of this requirement. Students interested in a minor must receive prior approval from the option representative in materials science, who will review and approve the proposed course of study. It is recommended that this course of study include advanced courses spanning different subfields of materials science. MATHEMATICS (M a) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program The principal aim of the graduate program is to develop the student's ability to do original research in mathematics. Independent and critical thinking is fostered by direct contact with faculty members. (An indication of the current research interests of the faculty begins on page 168.) Faculty advisers help students plan their programs of study leading to a Ph.D. in mathematics. Entering students are advised by the graduate option repre - sentative, who assists them in selecting appropriate courses, depending upon their previous studies. Ma Master's Degree Entering graduate students are admitted directly to the Ph.D. program, since the Institute does not offer a regular program in mathematics leading to the master's degree. A master's degree may be awarded in exception - al circumstances either as a terminal degree or preliminary to the Ph.D. Sufficiently advanced undergraduates may be admitted to graduate standing to pursue a master's degree simultaneously with the bachelor's program. The recipient of a master's degree will be expected to take 135 units in advanced mathematics (numbered 110 and higher). Unless the student has placed out of some of them, these must include Math 110, 120, and 151 (the basic courses in analysis, algebra, and geometry) and at least two terms of discrete mathematics. Reading and/or research courses may only be included in this 135 units if approved by the executive officer for mathematics. The general Institute requirements specify that the recipient of a mas - ter's degree must have taken at least 135 units of graduate work as a graduate student at the Institute, including at least 81 units of advanced graduate work in mathematics. This advanced work is interpreted as work with a course number greater than 109 and may include a master's thesis. Ma Degree of Doctor of Philosophy Course Program The graduate courses are listed in section five. The three core course series\u2014Ma 110 abc in analysis, Ma 120 abc in algebra, and Ma 151 433 Historical Sketchabc in geometry and topology\u2014are required of all graduate students. Students are expected to complete each of the core course series during the first year of study, unless they complete the correspond - ing qualifying exam upon entrance to the program (see section on qualifying exams). In addition, students are required to complete nine quarters of other advanced mathematics courses Ma 111 and above, at least two of which are in discrete mathematics: combinatorics, complexity, and computability, or logic and set theory. Unless these nine course quarters are given pass/fail only, they must be taken for grades. Reading and research do not normally qualify to meet these requirements. Under special circumstances (e.g., finishing the degree in three years), exceptions to these requirements may be considered by the graduate option representative. Beginning no later than the second year, students will be expected to begin independent research work and will be strongly encouraged to participate in seminars. Qualifying Examinations Qualifying examinations in the three core areas\u2014analysis, algebra, and geometry/topology\u2014emphasize mastery of the basic concepts and theorems and the ability to apply them to specific cases. Students are required to take and pass two of the three examinations, and for the third not taken, students must earn a B or better in all three terms of the corresponding course series. The exams are offered at the begin - ning of the Fall term and end of the spring term each academic year, with exceptional offerings made at other times of the year if needed and approved by the graduate option representative. The examinations must be attempted by the end of the spring term during the first year of study, and completed by the end of the first academic year. Entering students are permitted to take one or more qualifying examinations at the beginning of the fall term of their first academic year. If completed successfully, the student may drop the corresponding core course and will be excused from the remainder of the corresponding core require - ment. Special exceptions or extensions to the qualifying examination timeline may be considered by the graduate option representative with support from the primary research adviser. Teaching Requirements Teaching is an integral part of the mathematics graduate education. It is expected that students serve as teaching assistants in each term courses are offered unless alternative arrangements have been made with the option and approved by the executive officer. Summer Study Although there are no courses given in the summer, graduate students are expected to carry out studies and research in their chosen area of mathematics. In the summer after the first year, they will work under the guidance of a faculty member to investigate a possible area for their thesis research. Special Regulations434 Graduate InformationThesis Advising and Tracking Committee It is expected that by the fall quarter of the second year, students will find a member of the faculty who agrees to serve as their thesis advis - er. The formal change of adviser process should be complete by the end of the second academic year. The progress of all continuing students is assessed by the faculty each fall, and students will consult with their advisers about their prog - ress and planning of their studies and research. Students receive help and advice not only from their thesis adviser and other faculty mentors, but also whenever needed from the graduate option representative and the executive officer. (See also the section with guidelines for graduate student advising.) In addition to the primary thesis adviser, each student will have a candidacy committee, Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC), and final defense committee. In most cases, the members of all of these committees are the same, but the student has the right to change the members. The student in consultation with his or her adviser will arrange the formation of the committee, which will have at least four members and meet the requirements listed in the subsection Graduate Policies and Procedure entitled 'Degree of Doctor of Philosophy.' At least two of the committee members should be members of the math - ematics professorial faculty and the chair of the committees must be a professorial faculty who is not the primary research adviser. Admission to Candidacy Before the end of their third year, students are expected to finish the process of applying for admission to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. This formal step requires completion of the qualifying examinations, core courses, and advanced courses, as well as a satisfactory oral presentation to a committee of faculty members. The presentation will describe both the general area of the student's proposed thesis research and the specific problem or problems to be addressed. The candidacy meeting should be complete by the beginning of the fourth year of study. It normally takes place during the spring term of the third year. In some cases, during the summer term of the third year, but scheduling must be done by the end of the spring term. Special exceptions or extensions to the admission to candidacy timeline may be considered by the graduate option representative with support from the primary research adviser. Thesis Advisory Committee Meetings The Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC) will track the student's prog - ress through annual meetings between the candidacy exam and final defense. It is the responsibility of the student to convene the TAC during the fourth and fifth year of study. The fourth-year meeting should take place no later than the end of the winter term of the fourth year. The fifth-year meeting should take place no later than the end of the fall term of the fifth year. Thesis and Final Examination At least two weeks prior to the final thesis defense, candidates for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy must deliver copies of their theses 435 Historical Sketchto their advisers, to the Graduate Office, and to the members of the committee that will conduct the final oral examination on the thesis. The examination must be held at least three weeks before the date on which the degree will be conferred and at least two weeks after the delivery of the copies of the thesis. Ma Subject Minor Students majoring in other fields may take a subject minor in math - ematics. Minor programs must include 54 units of advanced work approved by a representative of the mathematics department, who will ensure that the work represents a concentrated study in one or more of the main fields of mathematics. A special oral examination in the sub - ject minor will be given soon after completion of the minor program. MECHANICAL ENGINEERING (ME) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program Mechanical engineering (ME) research and study are offered through the Department of Mechanical and Civil Engineering (MCE). The degrees of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) and Master of Science (M.S.) are offered. In general, students who intend to work full-time toward the Ph.D. degree as a final degree objective are admitted to the Mechanical Engineering Graduate Program. The M.S. degree is typically only awarded to students who pursue the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engi - neering at Caltech and who do not already have an M.S. degree in mechanical engineering. The aim of the graduate program in mechanical engineering at Caltech is to prepare students for research and professional practice in an era of rapidly advancing interdisciplinary technology. The program combines individual depth of experience and competence in a particu - lar chosen major specialty, with a strong background in the basic and engineering sciences. It strives to develop professional independence, creativity, leadership, and the capacity for continuing professional and intellectual growth. ME Preparation for the Graduate Program Entering graduate students are expected to have a thorough back - ground in undergraduate mathematics, physics, and engineering. While a strong undergraduate program in mechanical engineering should provide a suitable preparation, students who have not specialized in mechanical engineering as undergraduates may also be admitted for graduate study. For example, an outstanding four-year undergraduate program in mathematics and sciences may provide a suitable back - ground as well. The qualifications of each applicant will be considered individually, and, after being enrolled, the student will arrange his or her program in consultation with a member of the faculty. Special Regulations436 Graduate InformationME Master's Degree The degree of Master of Science in mechanical engineering is only awarded to students who do not already have a M.S. degree in mechanical engineering. The degree will be awarded upon request by students who have fulfilled the requirements. Only in exceptional cases is there admission to the M.S. program as the final degree objective. A minimum of 138 units of courses numbered 100 or above, which meet the required master's program listed below, must be passed with a grade of at least C for completion of the master's degree in mechanical engineering. All units must be taken for grades, except for courses offered only on a pass/fail basis. The M.S. degree in mechanical engineering is typically completed within the first two years of residency at Caltech. Each student's program must be approved by the adviser and option representative in mechanical and civil engineering before regis - tering for the course. Required Master's Program a) Graduate mechanical engineering core (54 units). These units should provide a solid base for the student's engineering interest. The courses should be selected from the Core ME subjects listed under the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy Description and Requirements section. b) Mathematics, engineering, and research electives (54 units). Courses may be taken in Ae, AM, ACM, ME, MedE, MS, EE, ESE, APh, CDS, CS, ChE, and CNS, except seminar courses. Students are encouraged to take research units, ME 300, up to a maximum of 27. c) Free electives (27 units). Any course with a number of 100 or greater may be selected, except that research units and semi - nar courses can not be included. d) Graduate Engineering Seminar, AM/CE/ME 150 abc (3 units). ME Degree of Doctor of Philosophy The Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering is focused on research. Study and research programs for the Ph.D. degree are individually planned to fit the interests and background of the student. A com - prehensive research project resulting in an original contribution to the field documented by a dissertation is required. A minimum of three academic years in residence as a graduate student are required by the Institute, and two or more additional years are usually needed for preparation of the thesis. Advising and Thesis Supervision An interim adviser is appointed for each student upon admission to a graduate degree in mechanical engineering. The interim adviser will serve as the primary mentor until the student finds a research adviser. It is the responsibility of the student to find an academic and research adviser within three terms of graduate residence at Caltech. In consul - tation with the adviser, the student must form a Ph.D. Thesis Advisory 437 Historical SketchCommittee within four terms of graduate residence at Caltech. This committee shall consist of at least three members of the Caltech pro - fessorial faculty, with at least two members from the faculty in mechan - ical and civil engineering. The committee shall meet as requested by the student. Further, the committee shall meet annually to review prog - ress and to approve the registration of the student beyond the fifth year of graduate residence at Caltech. The adviser and the Thesis Advisory Committee provide the majority of mentoring to the student. In addition, the option representative and other members of the faculty are always available to provide advice and mentoring on any aspect of research, progress toward the Ph.D., future careers, and other aspects of life in graduate school and as a professional scientist. Admission to Candidacy To be recommended for candidacy for the Ph.D. degree in mechani - cal engineering, the student must, in addition to meeting the general Institute requirements, do the following: Obtain the agreement of a professorial faculty member to serve as his or her academic and research adviser before the end of the third term of graduate residence at Caltech. In consultation with the adviser, the student must form a Ph.D. Thesis Advisory Committee before the end of the fourth term. This committee shall consist of at least three members of the Caltech profes - sorial faculty, with at least two members from the faculty in mechanical and civil engineering. Pass both subject and research components of the oral candidacy examination before the end of the eighth term of graduate aca - demic residence at Caltech. If the student has chosen a subject minor, an examination on the subject of that program may be included at the request of the discipline offering the subject minor. Complete a minimum of 195 units of courses numbered 101 or above, that fulfill the required Ph.D. program listed below. All units must be taken for grades and passed with a grade of at least a C, except for courses offered only on a pass/fail basis. The course work towards the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering is typically completed within the first three years of residency at Caltech. The faculty will evaluate the student's research progress, class performance, adviser's input, and oral candidacy exam results to determine whether a student will be admitted to or be able to maintain candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Required Ph.D. Program a) ME Core Subjects (54 units): Course work in core mechanical engineering subjects selected from the courses below.

Registration Beyond the Sixth Year of Graduate Residence The annual approval of the Ph.D. Thesis Advisory Committee is neces - sary for registration beyond the twenty-fourth academic term of gradu - ate residence at Caltech. Thesis and Final Examination The thesis examination will be given after the thesis has been formally completed. This examination will be a defense of the doctoral thesis and a test of the candidate's knowledge in the specialized field of research. The format of the examination can be chosen from the following two options, by the student, in consultation with their research adviser: (i) a public sem - inar presented by the candidate, with an open question period, followed by a private examination by the Examining Committee or (ii) a private pre - sentation to the Examining Committee followed by the examination, with a public seminar on another date. The Examining Committee shall consist of a minimum of four voting members, three of whom must be Caltech facul - ty; two members must be from MCE. The Thesis Defense Committee shall be chaired by a committee member who is an MCE Caltech professorial faculty member and not the student's adviser.439 Historical SketchME Subject Minor A student majoring in another branch of engineering or another division of the Institute may, with the approval of the faculty in the Department of Mechanical and Civil Engineering and the faculty in his or her major field, elect mechanical engineering as a subject minor. The program of courses must differ markedly from the major subject of study or research, and must consist of at least 54 units of advanced courses (101 or above) approved by the faculty in mechanical and civil engi - neering. MEDICAL ENGINEERING (M edE) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program The Andrew and Peggy Cherng Department of Medical Engineering offers a program of study that leads to the Ph.D. The medical engi - neering option at Caltech is designed for students with an engineering background who are interested in applications of micro-/nanoscale science and technology in medicine, which forms the core of Caltech's multidisciplinary medical engineering. The program's goal is to close the gap between engineering and medicine. Our medical engineering research and education leverage Caltech's strengths in engineering, applied science, and other fundamental fields, to apply emerging tech - nological advances to medicine, and to create innovative diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic systems. Our major tracks of research are: micro/nano medical technologies and devices, medical nanoelectron - ics, biomedical materials and biomechanics, fluidics and bioinspired design, and medical imaging and sensing. MedE Master's Degree Students are not normally admitted to work towards the M.S. degree. However, the M.S. degree may be awarded to a student along the way toward a Ph.D. degree, provided Institute and Option requirements are met. The Option requirements for the MS degree are the same as those for the Ph.D. degree except that the MS degree does not require research units, qualifying exam, candidacy exam, and thesis defense. In general, the degree is not conferred before the end of the first year of residence. MedE Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (a) Admission to Candidacy. To be recommended for candidacy for the Ph.D. program in medical engineering, each student must, in addition to meeting the general Institute requirements of a min - imum of 135 units of graduate work, complete all the following requirements: Complete 27 units of advanced math courses (i.e., 100 level or above) or ACM 100ab, as arranged with his/her adviser.

All required courses must be taken for grades and passed with a grade of at least a C, except for courses offered only on a pass/ fail. Pass an oral qualifying examination, arranged by the option, on three major subjects before the beginning of the second aca - demic year. Any delay of taking the exam must be preapproved by the option representative. Each student should consult his/ her adviser and/or the option representative to choose the three major subjects. The three subjects of the exam should include (1) Engineering math, Note: Students getting a B- or better for all 27 math units will be waived for \"math subject\" exam. (2) The major research topical area, and (3) Another related topical 441 Historical Sketcharea. Students should take at least 27 units of advanced cours - es on each of the three exam subjects. Transferred credits can be counted toward the 27 units. If the student has a subject minor, examination on the minor subject may be included at the request of the discipline offering the minor and with the approval of his/her adviser. Note that the program is designed for the stu - dents to have multidisciplinary background. Pass an oral candidacy examination on the subject of the Ph.D. research before the end of the second academic year of residency. The Ph.D. oral candidacy exam is conducted by a committee of minimum four members that is set up by the student and approved by the option representative. Three members must be Caltech professorial faculty affiliated with Medical Engineering. The fourth member may be a Caltech fac - ulty member or an outside professional of similar standing. The committee must include the adviser, but another member of the committee must be selected as chair. The committee chair must be a Caltech professorial faculty member. This examination will be a test of the candidate's preparation and knowledge to con - duct research in his or her specialized doctoral research area. (b) Thesis and Final Examination. The Ph.D. final thesis defense exam is conducted by a committee that is set up by the student and approved by the option representative. The committee should be made up of minimum of 4 members and at least three of the committee members must be Caltech faculty. The committee must include the adviser, but another member of the committee must be selected as chair. The committee chair must be a Caltech Professorial faculty member. This final examination will be given no less than two weeks after the doctoral thesis has been presented in final form, and before its approval. This examination must be taken at least four weeks before the commencement at which the degree is to be granted. This thesis examination will be a defense of the doctoral thesis and a test of the candidate's knowledge in his or her specialized doctoral research area. MedE Subject Minor A subject minor is not required, but recommended, for the Ph.D. degree in medical engineering. However, credits from the subject minor cannot be double-counted for the core program. Students may choose their original engineering disciplines as their minor subjects. Students are not allowed to choose medical engineering as a subject minor. NEUROBIOLOGY (NB) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program Neurobiology\u2014the study of the nervous system\u2014is a highly integrative science. The modern neurobiologist must be conversant with con - cepts from molecular biology, cell and developmental biology, systems neuroscience, animal behavior, and mathematical modeling. The aim Special Regulations442 Graduate Informationof the graduate program is to expose each student to this breadth of the discipline. To accomplish this, we offer a first-year curriculum with requirements in specified areas, along with a core course that spans many subjects. Students enter neurobiology from many different dis - ciplines, ranging from particle physics to physiology to psychology. Accordingly, each Ph.D. student is paired with a first-year adviser so the course selections can best complement the student's background. In later years, the student's focus is on original research in a chosen specialty. Our goal is that students will graduate with specific research accomplishments and the broad understanding required to chart their subsequent forays in brain science. NB Admission Applicants are expected to have studied college-level mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. They should also have experience in independent research. Coursework in neurobiology and experience in scientific computing are helpful, but not required. Whenever possible, applicants will be interviewed on campus before final admission deci - sions are made. NB Master's Degree The option does not admit students for work toward the master's degree. A terminal M.S. may be awarded in exceptional circumstances. NB Degree of Doctor of Philosophy First-year adviser Each incoming student is paired with an academic adviser during the first year. This mentor will guide the student in course selection and other deci - sions, taking the student's background into account. Where possible, this adviser will not be one of the prospective rotation supervisors. Rotations First-year students carry out three laboratory rotations, each lasting one quarter. At least two of these should be with faculty participating in the option. By June 30 of the first year, students choose a Ph.D. adviser. Formal Classes Students take at least 6 quarter courses (54 units) as follows: 1. Bi/CNS/NB 164, Tools of Neurobiology 2. Bi 252, Responsible Conduct of Research 3. One course in molecular, cellular, developmental neurobiology 4. One course in circuits, systems, behavioral biology 5. One course in mathematical methods (depending on the stu - dent's background) 6. Two electives For a list of courses in subject areas 3-5, see the option website. All courses must be taken for a grade unless only offered pass/fail. 443 Historical SketchTeaching All students are to serve as teaching assistants for at least two terms. Admission to Candidacy To qualify for candidacy, the student must first demonstrate broad competence by passing each of the first-year courses with a grade of B or higher. Failure here can be remedied by successful second-year coursework. By June 30 of the second year, the student must also defend a thesis proposal in an oral exam before a qualifying exam committee of at least three faculty. This exam will also cover general knowledge in the relevant field. With special permission, the oral exam may be retaken once before the end of winter quarter of the third year. Students that do not advance to candidacy by the end of the third year may not continue in the program. Thesis Advisory Committee Once admitted to candidacy, the student chooses a Thesis Advisory Committee of at least three faculty. This committee serves as a source of advice independent of the Ph.D. adviser throughout the student's tenure. Each year, before the end of June, the student delivers a writ - ten progress report, followed by a meeting with the Thesis Advisory Committee. Thesis Examination Committee This committee should consist of a minimum of four voting members, three of whom must be Caltech faculty. The final oral examination covers principally the work of the thesis, and according to Institute reg - ulations must be held at least three weeks before the degree is to be conferred. PHYSICS (P h) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program The physics option offers a program leading to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. This program prepares students for careers in scien - tific research or research combined with teaching, and so its most important part is independent research. Courses are offered that give a broad treatment of both fundamental physics and specialized physics research topics. These are intended both to help a beginning graduate student prepare for research and to broaden an advanced student's knowledge of physics. Caltech research opportunities include elemen - tary particle physics, nuclear physics, cosmic-ray, gamma-ray, and X-ray astronomy, submillimeter astronomy, condensed-matter physics, atomic/molecular/optical physics, quantum information, applied phys - ics, gravitational physics, cosmology, astrophysics, mathematical phys - ics, biophysics, and theoretical physics. A Master of Science degree may be awarded upon completion of a program of courses. Students are not normally admitted to work toward the M.S. in physics unless they are also working toward a Ph.D. Admission Special Regulations444 Graduate InformationThe application submission deadline for physics is December 15. The admission process follows Institute regulations. The GRE tests (general and advanced subject) are not required and scores will not be consid - ered for admission. Ph Master's Degree A Master of Science degree in physics will be awarded, upon request, to physics Ph.D. students who have completed the oral and written candidacy examinations. Alternatively, a master's degree will be award - ed to any Caltech graduate student in good standing upon satisfactory completion of a program approved by the option representative that fulfills the following requirements: Ph 125 abc 27 units (If this course, or its equivalent, was taken as part of an undergraduate program, it may be replaced by 27 units of any quantum-mechanics- based course.) Physics electives 81 units These must be selected from physics courses numbered 100 and above. Other electives 27 units These must be graduate courses from any option at Caltech. Substitutions of other graduate courses in place of the above requirements must be approved by the option representative. In exceptional cases, undergraduate students may receive concur - rent B.S./M.S. degrees if the above requirements are met in addition to the relevant B.S. requirements, upon approval from the Physics Graduate Committee, the graduate admissions committee, and the physics executive officer. Such students must produce a detailed peti - tion demonstrating accomplishments that would warrant normal admis - sion to the physics graduate program. Ph Degree of Doctor of Philosophy In addition to the general Institute requirements for a Ph.D., the partic - ular requirements for a doctorate in physics include admission to can - didacy as described below, writing a thesis that describes the results of independent research, and passing a final oral examination based on this thesis and research. Physics graduate students may exercise the pass/fail option on any and all courses taken. Advising structure and thesis supervision An academic adviser is appointed for each student upon admission to the graduate program in physics. The academic adviser will serve as the primary mentor until the student finds a research adviser. Students 445 Historical Sketchwill meet with their academic adviser to decide on their first-year course schedule, and are encouraged to continue these meetings quarterly until the student finds a research adviser. During the first year of study, stu - dents should consult with their academic adviser, the option representa - tive, the executive officer, and/or individual faculty members to select a tentative research group. Once a research adviser is selected students may either replace the originally appointed academic adviser or maintain both a research adviser and academic adviser. At any time, a student may consult with the option representative concerning such matters as advising. Students should consult with the executive officer to assemble their oral candidacy committee and Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC) by the end of their third year. The TAC is normally constituted from the candidacy examiners, but students may propose variations or chang - es at any time to the option representative. The TAC chair is normally someone other than the research adviser. The TAC chair will typically also serve as the thesis defense chair, but changes may be made in consultation with the executive officer for physics and the option repre - sentative. The candidacy committee will examine the student's knowledge of his or her chosen field and will consider the appropriateness and scope of the proposed thesis research during the oral candidacy exam. This exam represents the formal commitment of both student and adviser to a research program. After the oral candidacy exam, students will hold annual meetings with the TAC. The TAC will review the research progress and provide feedback and guidance towards completion of the degree. The TAC, research, and/or academic advisers provide the majority of mentoring to the student. In addition, the option representative and other members of the faculty are always available to provide advice and mentoring on any aspect of research, progress toward the Ph.D., future careers, and other aspects of life in graduate school. Basic Physics Requirement Physics students must demonstrate proficiency in all areas of basic physics, including classical mechanics (including continuum mechan - ics), electricity and magnetism, quantum mechanics, statistical physics, optics, basic mathematical methods of physics, and the physical origin of everyday phenomena. A solid understanding of these fundamental areas of physics is considered essential and proficiency will be tested by two written candidacy examinations. No specific course work is required for the basic physics require - ment, but some students may benefit from taking several of the basic graduate courses, such as Ph 106, Ph 125, and Ph 127. A syllabus describing the exam contents will be available, and students are encouraged to study independently for the exams, rather than taking a heavy load of basic physics courses. In addition, the class Ph 201 will provide additional problem solving training that matches the basic physics requirement. The written exams are typically offered in July and in October, and the two separate exams may be taken at different times. This Special Regulations446 Graduate Informationflexible scheduling of the written exams allows students to prepare for the exams while simultaneously learning about research areas, either through advanced courses, reading courses, or participation in a research group. The exams can be attempted up to three times and must be successfully completed by the end of the second year of study. Advanced Physics Requirement In addition to demonstrating a proficiency in basic physics, students must also establish a broad understanding of modern physics through study in six graduate courses. The courses must be spread over at least three of the following four areas of advanced physics: 1. Physics of elementary particles and fields Nuclear physics, high-energy physics, string theory 2. Quantum information and matter Atomic/molecular/optical physics, condensed-matte physics, quantum information 3. Physics of the universe Gravitational physics, astrophysics, cosmology 4. Interdisciplinary physics e.g., Biophysics, applied physics, chemical physics, mathematical physics, experimental physics Each area is meant to be covered by the equivalent of a one-term course, and a list of example courses for each of the areas can be found at the physics option website. Other courses may be substituted with per - mission of the physics option representative. Oral Candidacy Exam This exam is primarily a test of the candidate's suitability for research in his or her chosen field. The professor with whom the student plans to do research will be a member of the exam committee, and normally the student will have already begun research (Ph 172) on a definite topic with that professor. The examination will cover the student's research work and its relation to the general field of specialization. Before being allowed to take this exam, a student must have satisfied all the other requirements for admission to candidacy. The oral candidacy exam should be completed by the end of the third year (12 term) of graduate residence. Admission to Candidacy To be recommended for Ph.D. candidacy, a student must pass two terms of Physics Seminar (Ph 242), satisfy the Basic Physics Requirement by passing the written candidacy examinations, satisfy the Advanced Physics requirements, and pass the Oral Candidacy Examination. These require - ments are designed to ensure that students have an adequate preparation in the basic tools of physics, as well as a broad general knowledge of advanced physics. 447 Historical SketchResearch Requirements There are no specific research requirements, but in general a substantial effort is required to master the techniques in a given field and carry out a significant piece of original research. Students are strongly advised to start doing part-time research as soon as possible by taking reading and research units (Ph 171-172) in parallel with formal coursework. Teaching Requirement It is expected that each graduate student will, as part of the Ph.D. graduation requirements, serve as a teaching assistant for at least one term, an experience that most students find provides valuable expe - rience for their future careers. Students are encouraged to fulfill this requirement within the first three years of residency. Thesis and Final Examination A final oral examination will be given not less than two weeks after the thesis has been presented in final form. This examination will cover the thesis topic and its relation to the general body of knowledge of phys - ics. The candidate is responsible for completing the thesis early enough to allow the fulfillment of all division and Institute requirements, with due regard for possible scheduling conflicts. Degree progress timeline The following timeline is required for satisfactory degree progress: 1. Ph 242 should be taken by all students in their first year of grad - uate study. 2. The written candidacy exams should be attempted by the end of a student's first year of graduate residence, and be passed by the end of the second year. 3. The Advanced Physics requirement should be completed by the end of the second year of graduate residence, but may be extended into the third year depending on the availability of spe - cific courses. 4. The oral candidacy exam must be completed by the end of the third year (12th term) of graduate residence. The Minor A minor is not required, but a student may elect to pursue a minor in another option. Language Requirements There are no language requirements for a Ph.D. in physics. Ph Subject Minor Students desiring a subject minor in physics should discuss their pro - posed program with the chair of the Physics Graduate Committee. Forty-five units from physics courses with numbers over 100 must be taken for the subject minor, excluding Ph 129 and any specific courses in physics required for the student's major program. An oral exam may Special Regulations448 Graduate Informationbe required by the Physics Graduate Committee. This exam will include both academic topics and topics on current physics research areas. QUANTUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (QSE) Quantum science and engineering (QSE) may be pursued as a sub - ject minor by graduate students who are pursuing Ph.D. degrees in any option. The QSE minor is intended to supplement one of Caltech's graduate degrees and is designed for students who wish to broaden their knowledge of QSE beyond their major field of study. The QSE minor is also intended to recognize graduate students' interest in and dedication to QSE as demonstrated by the success - ful completion of a program of study in the field. Completion of the QSE minor program of study will be recognized on the Ph.D. diplo - ma by the statement, \"...and by additional studies constituting a minor in Quantum Science and Engineering.\" Requirements To receive the QSE minor, graduate students must fulfill the following requirements: APh/Ph 138ab 18 units (two terms) from Ph/APh 223ab, APh 150 (special topics class when topic is relevant to QSE, in consultation with the oversight committee), Ph177 (relevant QSE topic must be chosen in consultation with oversight committee). Other courses relevant to QSE can be included in consultation with the oversight committee. All courses to be applied toward the QSE minor requirements must be taken on a graded basis unless only offered as pass/fail. Students must obtain a grade of B- or higher in all courses taken on grades and a pass in courses taken as pass/fail. At least 18 units of courses that are used to satisfy the QSE minor cannot be used to satisfy course requirements in the major options unless absolutely required by the option. Courses taken as part of the QSE minor are counted toward the total number of units required for the completion of the Ph.D. degree. QSE Minor Administration The QSE minor is administered by an oversight committee consisting of faculty members reporting to the chair of the engineering and applied science division. In consultation with their advisers and, if needed, with the QSE Oversight Committee, students formulate a program of approved courses individually tailored to each student's background and needs, with the objective that the student achieve a level of competence in spe - cific subjects relevant to QSE. Students must petition the QSE Oversight Committee for approval of their program of study. Upon completion of the program of study, the QSE Oversight Committee will verify that the QSE minor requirements have been fulfilled.449 Historical SketchSOCIAL AND DECISION NEUROSCIENCE (SDN) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program The Caltech Ph.D. program in social and decision neuroscience (SDN) pre - pares students to do research on the neurocomputational basis of deci - sion-making and social interactions. Research in this area requires training in computational modeling, statistical methods, systems neuroscience, neural measuring methods such as fMRI, EEG or single unit recordings, as well as adequate understanding of related methods and results from the social sciences. Students' career paths include faculty jobs in neurosci - ence, psychology or marketing; faculty jobs in economics, political science or finance programs; and industry positions in the technology, data sci - ence, finance, and neurotechnology sectors. SDN Master's Degree Students are not admitted to work towards the master's degree. The master's degree might be awarded to an SDN student under exceptional circumstances. In order to be eligible for a master's degree, students must complete at least 54 units of the courses required for the Ph.D. with a passing grade, as well as a minimum of 81 additional units of graduate work. Admission The program seeks to recruit top students interested in the neurocomputa - tional basis of decision-making and social interactions. Ideal applicants will have very strong quantitative backgrounds, regardless of their undergrad - uate major. Previous exposure to neuroscience, psychology or economics is useful but not required. Detailed information on admission requirements can be found at http://www.hss.caltech.edu/academics/graduate-studies/ social-and-decision-neuroscience-phd-program Course Requirements Students are required to complete 81 units of graduate coursework related to social and decision neuroscience by the end of their second year, with a grade of B or higher in each class.

Lab rotation plans need to be approved by the option representative by the end of the second week of Special Regulations450 Graduate Informationthe fall quarter. Students must sign-up for 18 units of CNS 280 (Research in Computation and Neural Systems) or SS 300 (Research in the Social Science) for each quarter of lab rotations. Students are expected to become full members of a research group by the end of the spring quarter of their first year. The faculty member leading that lab becomes the stu - dent's main adviser. General Knowledge Exam Students are required to take a written General Knowledge Exam in Social and Decision Neuroscience. The exam is offered during Spring quarter of the second year and students must pass it with a grade of at least 80%. A list of topics and references associated with the exam can be obtained from the option representative. Other Requirements Students must satisfy the following additional requirements. 1. They must enroll in Psy 283abc (Graduate Proseminar in Social and Decision Neuroscience) every quarter, from their first to their last quarter in residence. This weekly seminar provides training in academic skills such as writing, presenting, reviewing, and career strategy, as well as breadth of knowledge in Social and Decision Neuroscience. 2. Students must attend four social science seminars in econom - ics, finance or political science every quarter, from their first to their last quarter in residence. 3. Students are also required to complete Bi 252 (Responsible Conduct of Research) during their first year. 4. 4.Students must attend a conference and submit a grant pro - posal during their second year. 5. Starting their second year, students are expected to TA a mini - mum of three quarters total during their graduate career. 6. Starting the third year, students must present a poster or give a talk at a conference every academic year. 7. Students must submit yearly progress reports to the SDN option representative by the last day of classes of the Spring quar - ter, starting on their first year. A template for the report can be obtained from the option representative. These reports will be reviewed by the entire SDN faculty and granted one of three out - comes: approval, conditional approval, or program termination. Students may receive at most one conditional approval of their yearly report during their time in the Ph.D. program. Candidacy Requirement Students must form a thesis committee and defend their thesis proposal to the committee. Students must pass this candidacy exam by the last day of classes of their third year. A thesis committee must have four members subject to the following constraints: at least one should be a neuroscience faculty member, at least one should be a non-neuro social science faculty member, and there should be at most one faculty member from another institution. The main adviser cannot serve as the chair of the 451 Historical Sketchthesis committee. Thesis and Final Examination The candidate is expected to complete and successfully defend their thesis by the last day of classes of the spring quarter of their fifth year. Extensions to an additional sixth year will be considered only at the can - didacy exam stage and, if necessary, for the proposed research plan. The time of the defense should be determined in consultation with the main adviser, the thesis committee and, if necessary, the option representative. Students must submit a written copy of their dissertation to the the-sis committee at least two weeks prior to the thesis defense date. SOCIAL SCIENCE (SS) Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program The Caltech Ph.D. program in social science prepares students for a research career in economics and political science. It is designed to produce scholars who are well grounded in the theoretical perspec - tives, the quantitative techniques, and the experimental methods of economics and political science. SS Master's Degree Students who are enrolled in the Social Science Ph.D. program may earn a M.S. degree after successful completion of 36 units of course work, completed with a grade of B or better in each class, in addition to completing the coursework required for the first year of the Ph.D. program. Admission Detailed information on admission requirements can be found at http:// www.hss.caltech.edu/academics/graduate-studies/social-sciences-phd-pro - gram/admissions . Course Program First year. The first-year curriculum consists of the following three-quar - ter course sequences: Analytical Foundations in Social Science (SS 201abc); Political Theory (SS 202abc); Foundations of Economics (SS 205abc) and Econometrics (SS 222abc). Each class must be completed with a grade of B or better. In addition, students must register for SS/ Psy/CNS 285 each quarter it is offered during the academic year. At the end of the first year, the faculty will review the overall class performance of each first-year student and assess the student's ability for clear self-expression in both oral and written English. A positive assessment of class performance is required for a student to remain in good standing in the program. If class performance is judged unsat - isfactory by the faculty, they may terminate the student from the pro - gram. In case of language deficiencies, the student is required to take and pass a remedial English class, SS 299, during the summer quarter. Before the start of the second year, students are required to take a written preliminary examination, which has four components, each cor - Special Regulations452 Graduate Informationresponding to one of the first-year course sequences (SS 201, SS 202, SS 205, and SS 222). The grades given are Honors, Pass, and Fail. Students must achieve at least a Pass in all four parts. Students who fail the exam may be given the opportunity to retake the exam before the start of the fall term by the faculty. The Social Science faculty will then review the student's performance on the exam(s), and progress, to date. If it is not satisfactory, they may terminate the student from the program by the beginning of the second year. Second year . Second-year courses provide additional training in var - ious subfields of the social sciences. In the fall quarter, all second-year students are required to enroll in SS 224 and at least 27 additional units of advanced social science courses. In the winter quarter, all second-year students are required to enroll in 36 units of advanced social science courses. In the spring quarter, second year students must enroll in at least 27 units of advanced social science courses (three typical courses) and enroll in 9 units of Research in Social Science (SS 300) to work on their sec - ond-year paper, for the units remaining to reach 36 units Appropriate courses in other options, such as mathematics and computer science, can be substituted for advanced social science classes, with the permission of the HSS division's option representa - tive. All classes offered for grades must be completed with a grade of B or better. Students may take independent reading and study cours - es, but during the second year such courses do not count toward the above requirements. Students can tailor their second-year curriculum to their specific research interests but are expected to include at least two second-year course sequences. Such course sequences include Foundations of Political Economy (SS 210abc), Advanced Economic Theory (SS 211abc), Experimental Economics (SS 212abc), Financial Economics (SS 213abc), Topics in Theoretical and Applied Econometrics (SS 223abc), Applied Empirical Methods in the Social Sciences (SS 228abc), Theoretical and Quantitative Dimensions of Historical Development (SS 229abc), American and Comparative Politics (SS 231abc), and Experimental Methods of Political Economy (SS 260). Students may partially fulfill the second-year sequence requirement by taking a sequence of courses in mathematics, such as Ma 108abc, Ma 110abc, Ma/ACM/IDS 140ab, or Ec 181ab. Third year . Beginning in their third year, and in all subsequent years, all students must enroll in the 3-unit graduate student pro-seminar (SS 282abc) every quarter. Every student must make a presentation in this class at least once a year. Students in the third year may also enroll in additional courses, with the approval of their adviser. Third year stu - dents are required to take SS 281 in the fall quarter. In each quarter, third year students should enroll in Research in Social Science (SS 300) for the units remaining to reach 36 units. Fourth and fifth years. Students need to register for 33 units of SS 300 and 3 units of the graduate student pro-seminar (SS 282abc).453 Historical SketchProgress in the program, and advancement to candidacy In addition to the coursework and examinations described above, stu - dents must enroll in at least 36 units every quarter, including summer (SS 300) and complete the following requirements. By May 1 of the second year, each second-year student must sub - mit an outline describing a planned paper to their paper adviser, their second reader, and the option representative. The second-year paper can be co-authored. If the co-author is another graduate student, only one of the students on the joint project can use the paper to fulfill the requirement. The person using the paper for fulfilling the requirement is expected to do most of the actual writing of the paper that is sub-mit - ted. The final paper is due on September 15. If the paper adviser and the second reader both find that a student's second-year paper is satisfactory, the student advances to the third year. If they do not, the social science faculty, as a whole, will review the student's paper. If they decide that the paper is not satisfactory, they may terminate the student from the program. At the end of the second year, the social science faculty will also meet and assess each second-year student's ability for clear self-expression in both oral and written English. In case of language deficiencies, the student is required to take and pass a remedial English class, SS 299, during the summer quarter. Also, start - ing their second year, students are expected to TA a minimum of three quarters total during their graduate career. Third-year students must write a research paper and present it to the faculty at the end of June. The third-year paper cannot be co-au - thored but should be worked on in consultation with and under the direction of the student's primary adviser. The option representative will appoint a second third-year paper reader, who must be a member of the social sciences professorial faculty. The adviser and second reader will monitor progress and advise the student on the third-year paper. The paper and the presentation must demonstrate to the faculty that the student is capable of undertaking original research and presenting it to a scholarly audience. After completion of the third-year paper presentation, the social sci - ence faculty evaluates the student's overall performance and research potential. This review is based primarily upon the third-year paper, but the faculty also verifies that the student has satisfactorily completed all previous requirements. If this evaluation is favorable, the student is admitted to candidacy for the Ph.D. If the faculty evaluation is unfavorable, the student may be terminated from the program. Organization of Thesis Committee By October 1 of the third year, each student selects a primary advis - er. The adviser must be a professorial member of the social science faculty at Caltech. It is possible to change advisers, in consultation with the option representative, if a student's research interests change. Students, in consultation with their adviser, must select two additional thesis committee members after the student has advanced to candi - dacy (normally by the beginning of their fourth year). After a student Special Regulations454 Graduate Informationadvances to candidacy, the division chairperson, in consultation with the option representative, shall select a fourth member of the com - mittee with an eye to representing the diverse interests of the social science faculty. One of the four members of the thesis committee may be emeritus faculty, research faculty, or an external scholar, with the approval of the option representative and the dean of graduate studies. The chair of the thesis committee must be someone other than the pri - mary adviser, who will be appointed by the social science option repre - sentative in consultation with the primary adviser. The thesis committee will also serve as the examination committee at the thesis defense. SS Degree of Doctor of Philosophy By November 1 of their fourth year, students must complete a disser - tation prospectus that outlines the proposed dissertation work and present a tentative schedule detailing when the components of the dissertation are to be completed. The prospectus must clearly identify a project, or dissertation components, that should culminate in a job market paper at the beginning of the student's fifth year (August before the start of the fifth year, in the case of students who seek a position in political science). The prospectus must be submitted to and approved by the thesis committee by November 1, and the status communicated by the principal adviser to the option representative. By May 1 of the fourth year, the student is required to convene a thesis prospectus seminar with their thesis committee. In this semi - nar, the student is to report on the current status of their dissertation research and outline a plan and timeline for completing it. The seminar must be based on the student's planned job market paper, and a draft of this paper must accompany the proposal. The student and the the- sis committee should reach a clear, mutual under-standing as to what additional work needs to be done to complete and to successfully defend their dissertation. After the dissertation is completed, the student, in consultation with their adviser, must schedule an oral thesis examination to defend their dissertation. The student must provide a written copy of their disser - tation to the option representative and all members of the examination committee, and complete the examination notification in Regis, not less than two weeks prior to the thesis examination date. The dissertation is expected to represent publishable, original research.455 Historical Sketch Special Regulations456 CoursesSection Five Courses 457 Courses numbered below 100 are taken primarily by undergraduate students. Those numbered from 100 to 199 are taken by both undergraduates and graduates, and those numbered 200 and above are taken primarily by graduate students. The school year is divided into three terms. The number of units assigned in any term to any subject represents the number of hours spent in class, in laboratory, and estimated to be spent in preparation per week. In the following schedules, figures in parentheses denote hours in class (first figure), hours in laboratory (second figure), and hours of outside preparation (third figure). At the end of the seventh week of each term, a list of courses to be offered the following term is published by the Registrar's Office. On the day of registration (see Academic Calendar), an updated and revised course schedule is published announc - ing the courses, class hours, and room assignments for the term.

Noise and Resonance. 9 units (3-0- 6); second, third terms. Prerequisites: Ph 12 abc, ACM 95/100 ab and Ph 106 abc, equivalent background, or instructor's permission. The presence of noise in experimental systems is often regarded as a nuisance since it diminishes the signal to noise ratio thereby obfuscat - ing weak signals or patterns. From a theoretical perspective, noise is also problematic since its influence cannot be elicited from deterministic equations but requires stochastic-based modeling which incorporates various types of noise and correlation functions. In general, extraction of embedded information requires that a threshold be overcome in order to outweigh concealment by noise. However, even below threshold, it has been demonstrated in numerous systems that external forcing coupled with noise can actually boost very weak signatures beyond threshold by a phenomenon known as stochastic resonance. Although it was originally demonstrated in nonlinear systems, more recent studies have revealed this phenomenon can occur in linear systems subject, for example, to color-based noise. Techniques for optimizing stochastic resonance are now revolutionizing modeling and measurement theory in many fields ranging from nonlinear optics and electrical systems to condensed matter physics, neurophysiology, hydrodynamics, climate research and even finance. This course will be conducted in survey and seminar style and is expected to appeal to theorists and experimen - talists alike.

An advanced course with classes based on active discussion, lectures, and seminar presentations. Development from embryos and development from stem cells are distinct paradigms for understanding and manipulating the emergence of ordered biologi - cal complexity from simplicity. This course focuses on the distinguishing 509 features of stem-cell based systems, ranging from the natural physi - ological stem cells that are responsible for life-long hematopoiesis in vertebrates (hematopoietic stem cells) to the artificial stem cells, ES and iPS cells, that have now been created for experimental manipulation. Key questions will be how the stem cells encode multipotency, how they can enter long-term self-renewal by separating themselves from the developmental clock that controls development of the rest of the or - ganism, and how the self-renewal programs of different stem cell types can be dismantled again to allow differentiation. Does \"stem-ness\" have common elements in different systems? The course will also cover the lineage relationships among diverse differentiated cell types emerging from common stem cells, the role of cytokines and cytokine receptors in shaping differentiation output, apoptosis and lineage-specific prolifera - tion, and how differentiation works at the level of gene regulation and regulatory networks.

Prerequi - site: Students are recommended (but not required) to take BEM 103 to become familiar with some basic concepts in finance. Much of modern financial economics works with models in which agents are fully ratio - nal, in that they maximize expected utility and use Bayes' law to update their beliefs. Behavioral finance is a large and active field that develops and studies models in which some agents are less than fully rational. Such models have two building blocks: limits to arbitrage, which makes 515 it difficult for rational traders to undo the dislocations caused by less rational traders; and psychology, which provides guidance for the kinds of deviations from full rationality we might expect to see. We discuss these two topics and consider a number of applications: asset pricing; individual trading behavior; the origin of bubbles; and financial crises. Instructor: Jin. BEM/Ec/ESE 119.

Far from a literary \"dark age,\" the Middle Ages fostered dramatic experiments in narrative English582 Coursesform, bequeathing to modern literature some of its best-loved genres and texts. We will practice reading in Middle English-the language of Chaucer and his contemporaries-while we concentrate on the following questions: how did these texts circulate among readers? How do they establish their authority? What kinds of historical and cultural currents to they engage? Texts may include the lives of saints, the confessions of sinners, dranma, lyrics, romances, selections from Chaucer's Canter - bury Tales, and Malory's Morte Darthur. Readings will be in Middle and modern English. Not offered 2021-2022. En 104. Imagining the Medieval in the Nineteenth Century. 9 units (3- 0-6); third term. Following the Enlightenment and amidst the Industrial Revolution, the late-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries saw a surging interest in the literature, lives, art, and architecture of the Middle Ages. In this course, we will explore how authors represented, invoked, and often idealized the medieval past-with its knights, peasants, saints, and monsters-as a way to think through the challenges-social, literary, politi - cal, aesthetic-of their own time. We will read several novels, poems, and treatises, including Henry David Thoreau's essay, \"Walking;\" Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court; Alfred Lord Ten - nyson's Idylls of the King; and others. Requirements for the course will include weekly response papers and two essays. Not offered 2021- 2022. En 105. Old English Literature. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. \"Mo\u00f0\u00f0e word fr\u00e6t.\" Want to learn how to read the riddle that begins with these words? This course will introduce students to Old English: the earli - est form of the English language, spoken in England from roughly the years 450 to 1100. In studying the language, we will turn to its diverse and exciting body of literature, including one poem commemorating the brutal defeat by a Viking army and another based on the biblical story of Judith, who tricks the evil king Holofernes into sleeping with her-but not before slicing off his drunken head. We will also read a variety of shorter texts: laws, medical recipes, humorously obscene riddles. Successful completion of the course will give students a richer sense not only of the earliest period of English literature, but also of the English language as it is written and spoken today. No prior experience with Old or Middle English is necessary for this course. Not offered 2021-2022. En 106. Poetry and the Project of Justice. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. This course explores how contemporary poets grapple with the most urgent questions of our moment: identity, equality, environmental crisis, and justice. In this class, students will gain confidence in reading, discussing, and writing about contemporary poems and will encounter recent and more distant traditions of protest poetry. We will ask how po - etic language articulates questions of embodiment, community, law, and memory. The syllabus will focus in particular on writers of color, including queer and indigenous poets, and will include opportunities to attend local poetry readings. Instructor: Jahner. Not offered 2021-2022.583 En 107. Medieval Romance. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. The medi - eval term romanz designated both a language, French, and a genre, romance, dedicated to the adventures of knights and ladies and the villains, monsters, magic, and miles that stood in their way. This course explores key examples from the twelfth through the fifteenth centuries, while also examining evolutions in the form. We will consider how ro - mances figured love and desire as well as negotiated questions of law, territory, and cultural difference. Authors and texts may include Chretien de Troyes, Marie de France, Gawain and the Green Knight, Arthurian legends, outlaw tales, and hagiography. Instructor: Jahner. En/VC 108. Volcanoes. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Long before torrents of lava cascaded down Los Angeles streets in the 1997 film Volcano, volcanic disaster narratives erupted across 19th-century British pages, stages, and screens. This class will examine the enduring fascina - tion with volcanoes in literary and visual culture and the socio-political tensions that disaster narratives expose. Students will analyze Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Tambora's infamous 1815 eruption, James Pain's 1880s pyrotechnic adaptation of Vesuvius's 79AD eruption, and paintings of global sunsets after Krakatoa's 1883 eruption. Additional literary and visual texts may include works by: Felicia Hemans, Isabella Bird, M.P . Shiel, Charles Dickens, Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, and J. M. W. Turner. Instructor: Sullivan. Not offered 2021-2022. En 109. Madness and Reason. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. Madness threatens to dissolve boundaries of the most various kinds: between the human and the inhumane, reality and fantasy, sickness and health. One of the tasks of a literary text is to subdue and contain madness thr ough the construction of rational frameworks. How does a literary text ac - complish this? Which strategies, such as the use of irony and humor, are the most effective? What role do insane characters play in literary texts? And when - if ever - should we consider an excess of reason as a kind of madness in its own right? Selected readings from Shakespeare, Voltaire, Goethe, Hoffmann, B\u00fcchner, Gogol, and Schnitzler, among oth - ers. Instructor: Holland. Not offered 2021-2022. En/VC 110. Sinners, Saints, and Sexuality in Premodern Litera - ture. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This class explores the history of sexual - ity and gender across the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Exploring both literary texts and visual representation, it considers how previous eras and cultures understood embodiment, sexuality, and gender and asks how we, as modern readers and viewers, approach these questions across the distance of centuries. We will read across a wide range of literature, including theology, philosophy, fiction, romance, and spiritual biography, and examine manuscript illustrations and other early visual media. Questions we will take up include the following: how did writers and artists construct the \"naturalness\" or \"unnaturalness\" of particular bodies and bodily acts? How did individuals understand the relationship between their own bodies and those of others? In what ways did writing and art authorize, scrutinize, or otherwise parse the boundaries of the licit and illicit? Finally, how have modern critics framed these questions? English584 CoursesHow do we approach and make use of earlier theories of sex and gen - der? Instructor: Jahner. En 111. Violence and Reconciliation on the Shakespearean Stage. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. Sir Francis Bacon famously described revenge as a \"wild justice,\" and there are vivid examples of such justice in the drama of Shakespeare and his contemporaries: revenge for politi - cal betrayal and tyranny, for sexual infidelities and desires, for religious misbehavior and dogmatism. But what of the experience of reconciliation on the Shakespearean stage? What pathways to concord and peace did these plays offer? This course explores the relationship of violence to the fleeting experience of reconciliation in early modern drama. The plays of Shakespeare, Marlowe, Jonson, Middleton, and Dryden allow us to consider how drama as text and performance engaged and continues to engage playgoers as they watch the religious, social, and political upheaval of their worlds mounted to the stage. Instructor: Koch. Not of - fered 2021-2022. En 112. Nineteenth-Century American Poetry. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. In the 1855 edition of \"Leaves of Grass\", Walt Whitman claimed that \"the United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem.\" We might ask any number of questions in response to Whitman. If the United States are a poem, then who wrote it? What is this poem about? What genre is it? Is anyone reading it? Is it actually any good? Though we might approach Whitman's statement with some apprehension from our historical moment, this course will take seriously American life lived within poetry and the lives poems lived across the country. Together, we will track the development of American poetry as it engages with enslavement, abolition, genocide, war, beauty, nature, racialization, constructions of gender, sexuality, and affect. Ultimately, we will ask what reading nineteenth-century American poetry, or nineteenth-century America as a poem, might mean for our understanding of the country today. Readings will include Wheatley, Emerson, Bryant, Poe, Longfel - low, Oakes Smith, Schoolcraft (Bamewawagezhikaquay), Whitman, Dickinson, Harper, and Dunbar amongst others. Instructor: Hill. En 113. Shakespeare's Career: Comedies and Histories. 9 units (3-0- 6); second term. The first of a two-course sequence on Shakespeare's career as a dramatist and poet. We will read plays from the first half of Shakespeare's career, his comedies and histories. Particular attention will be paid to Shakespeare's use of his sources and to the textual his - tory of the plays. En 113 and En 114 may be taken independently and, usually, are taught in alternate years. Instructor: Pigman. En 114. Shakespeare's Career: Tragedies and Tragicomedies. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. The second of a two-course sequence on Shake - speare's career as a dramatist and poet. We will read works from the second half of Shakespeare's career, his tragedies, tragicomedies, and Sonnets.

En 113 and En 114 may 585 be taken independently and, usually, are taught in alternate years. In - structor: Pigman. Not offered 2021-2022. En/VC 117. Picturing the Universe. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Whether you are a physicist, photographer, or bibliophile, grab a warm jacket. The night sky beckons. In addition to observing and photographing our own starry skies, we will study 19th-century literary, artistic, and scientific responses to new understandings of the universe as dynamic, decentered, and limitless. In Victorian England, picturing the universe in literature and recording celestial light in photographs defied the physio - logical limitations of human observation and fueled larger debates about objective evidence and subjective documentation. Authors studied may include: Anna Laetitia Aikin, Keats, Byron, Tennyson, Hardy, Agnes Clerke, E. E. Barnard, Tracy Smith, and Dava Sobel. Instructor: Sullivan. En 118. Classical Mythology. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Why did the Greeks and Romans remain fascinated with the same stories of gods and demigods for more than a thousand years? On the other hand, how did they adapt those stories to fit new times and places? Starting with the earliest Greek poems and advancing through classical Athens, Hel - lenistic Alexandria, and Augustan Rome, we consider the history of writ - ing poetry as a history of reading the past; the course also serves as an excellent introduction to ancient literary history at large. Readings may include Homer's 2021-2022. En 119. Displacement. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. The literary fascina - tion with people who change places, temporarily or permanently, over a short distance or across the globe, in works dating from our lifetimes and from the recent and the remote past. How readily can such stories be compared, how easy is it to apply traditional categories of literary evaluation, and, in the contemporary world, how have poetry and prose fictions about migration survived alongside other media? 21st-century works will receive considerable attention; other readings may include Virgil, Swift, Flaubert, Mann, Achebe, Nabokov, Didion, Morrison. Instructor: Haugen. En 120. What Women Want: Desire and the Modern American Nov - el. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. The question of what a woman wants animates a central strain of the modern American novel, as do evolving ideas about what women can and cannot have. This course consid - ers female desire-for personal agency and freedom, self- and sexual fulfillment, economic and social opportunity-across a half dozen novels written from about 1880 - 1940, in light of some of the cultural forces that shape and constrain characters' (and real women's) horizons. Authors covered may include Henry James, Edith Wharton, Theodore Not offered 2021-2022. En 121. Literature and Its Readers. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. The course will investigate readers who have made adventurous uses of English586 Coursestheir favorite works of literature, from Greek antiquity through the 20th century. Sometimes those readers count, at least temporarily, as literary critics, as when the philosopher Aristotle made Sophocles' Oedipus the King the central model in his wildly successful essay on the literary form of tragedy. Other readers have been even more experimental, as when Sigmund Freud, studying the same play, made the \"Oedipus complex\" a meeting point for his theory of psychology, his vision of human societ - ies, and his fascination with literary narrative. It will discuss some basic questions about the phenomenon of literary reading. Does a book have a single meaning? Can it be used rightly or wrongly? Instructor: Haugen. Not offered 2021-2022. En 122. Early History of the Novel. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. The re - alistic novel is a surprising, even experimental moment in the history of fiction. How and why did daily life become a legitimate topic for narra - tive in the 18th century? The realistic turn clearly attracted new classes of readers, but did it also make the novel a better vehicle for comment - ing on society at large? Why were the formal conventions of realistic writing so tightly circumscribed? Authors may include Cervantes, Defoe, Richardson, Fielding, Sterne, and Austen. Instructor: 123. The 19th-Century English Novel. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. A survey of the 19th-century novel from Austen through Conrad, with special emphasis upon the Victorians. Major authors may include Aus - ten, Shelley, Dickens, Eliot, Thackeray, Gaskell, Bront\u00eb, Collins, Trollope, 2021-2022. En 124. 20th-Century British Fiction. 9 units (3-0-6); third term.

A selective survey of English writing in the late 18th and early 19th centu - ries. Major authors may include Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Keats, Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley, and Austen. Particular attention will be paid to intellectual and historical contexts and to new understand - ings of the role of literature in society. Instructor: Gilmartin. Not offered 2021-2022. En 126. Gothic Fiction. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. The literature of horror, fantasy, and the supernatural, from the late 18th century to the present day. Particular attention will be paid to gothic's shifting cultural imperative, from its origins as a qualified reaction to Enlightenment rationalism, to the contemporary ghost story as an instrument of social and psychological exploration. Issues will include atmosphere and the gothic sense of space; gothic as a popular pathology; and the gender - ing of gothic narrative. Fiction by Walpole, Shelley, Bront\u00eb, Stoker, Poe, Wilde, Angela Carter, and Toni Morrison. Film versions of the gothic may be included. Instructor: Gilmartin. Not offered 2021-2022.587 En 127. Jane Austen. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. This course will fo - cus on the major novels of Jane Austen: Northanger Abbey, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, and Persuasion. Film and television adaptations will also be considered, and students may have the opportunity to read Austen's unfinished works, as well as related eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British fiction and non- fiction. Instructor: Gilmartin. Not offered 2021-2022. En 128. Modern and Contemporary Irish Literature. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. The development of Irish fiction, poetry, and drama from the early 20th-century Irish literary renaissance, through the impact of modernism, to the Field Day movement and other contemporary devel - opments. Topics may include the impact of political violence and na - tional division upon the literary imagination; the use of folk and fairy-tale traditions; patterns of emigration and literary exile; the challenge of the English language and the relation of Irish writing to British literary tradi - tion; and recent treatments of Irish literature in regional, postcolonial, and global terms. Works by Joyce, Yeats, Synge, Friel, O'Brien, Heaney, Boland, En/VC 129. Literature/Photography/Facticity. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. \"It is the picture of life contrasted with the fact of life, the ideal contrasted with the real, which makes criticism possible,\" insists Frederick Douglass. This course will take an historical approach to the relationship between literature and photography by examining what Douglass refers to as the contrast between \"picture\" and \"fact\" from the advent of photography in the nineteenth century to our present moment. Together, we will think about how each medium creates images, invites different ways of reading or viewing, and makes forms of individual, collective, and political representation possible. We will also examine the ways in which photography and literature shape our understanding of temporality, truth, memory, and history. In addition to our experience of literary and photographic works, theoretical texts on photography will inform the ways of reading and ways of seeing we will develop in this course. Readings may include Boucicault, Douglass, Dunbar, Hartmann, Barthes, Lorde, and 131. Poe's Afterlife. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. This course focuses on Edgar Allan Poe and the considerable influence his works have had on other writers. Authors as diverse as Charles Baudelaire, Jules Verne, Jorge Luis Borges, Vladimir Nabokov, John Barth, and Philip Roth have used Poe's stories as departure points for their own work. We shall begin by reading some of Poe's s classic short stories, including \"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym,\" \"The Purloined Letter,\" and others. We shall then explore how and why Poe's stories have been so important for authors, despite the fact that his reputation as a great American writer, unlike Hawthorne's and Melville's, for example, is a relatively recent phenomenon. Instructor: Weinstein. En 132. After Austen: Nineteenth-Century British Women's Writ - ing. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. The Victorian period introduced a huge array of new possibilities and constraints for women of all classes, English588 Coursesas it witnessed rapid urbanization and industrialization, a changing conception of marriage and motherhood, and a new set of professional restrictions but also opportunities. This class focuses on novels by and about women, as it seeks to take the measure of these transformations and of a larger culture's reaction to them. How did women imagine and re-imagine themselves and what they wanted? How did notions of femi - ninity and masculinity change? How do the imaginings of the Victorians resonate now? Authors studied may Oliphant, Braddon, and Scheiner. Instructor: Gilmore. 134. The Career of Herman Melville. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. The course will analyze Melville's career starting with Typee and ending with Billy Budd. Special attention will be given to Moby-Dick and Pierre. The centrality of Melville's position in American literature will be considered from a variety of perspectives, including aesthetics, representations of race, class, and gender, the role of the audience, and connections with other authors. Instructor: Weinstein. En/VC 135. Dickens's London. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. Charles Dickens and London have perhaps the most famous relationship of any writer and city in English. In this course, we will investigate both the London Dickens knew, and the portrait of the city that he painted, by reading one of Dickens's great mid-career novels alongside a selection of contemporary texts and images and secondary historical sources. We will think about the gap-or overlap- between history and fiction, the idea of the novelist as alternative historian, and the idea of the novel as historical document. Historical topics covered may include: the development of the Victorian police force; plague and public health; Victorian poverty; colonialism and imperialism; Dickens and his illustra - tors; Victorian exhibition and museum culture; and marriage and the cult of domesticity, among others. Students will practice both textual and visual analysis skills. In addition to written work, students should expect to be responsible for making a short research presentation at some point in the term. Instructor: Gilmore. Not offered 2021-2022. En 136. The Fiction of Charles Dickens. 9 units (3-0-6). An overview of the Great Inimitable's fiction, concentrating on four texts representative of different phases of his novel-writing career and their relationship to the changing world of Victorian Britain: Oliver Twist, Dombey and Son, Bleak House, Our Mutual Friend. Not offered 2021-2022. En 137. African American Literature. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. This course analyzes some of the great works of American literature written by African Americans. This body of writing gives rise to two crucial questions: How does African American literature constitute a literary tradition of its own? How is that tradition inextricable from American literary history? From slave narratives to Toni Morrison's Beloved, from the Harlem Renaissance to Alice Walker, from Ralph Ellison to Walter Mosley, African American literature has examined topics as diverse and important as race relations, class identification, and family life. We shall analyze these texts not only in relation to 589 these cultural issues, but also in terms of their aesthetic and formal contributions. Not offered 2021-2022. En 138. Twain and His Contemporaries. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. This course will study the divergent theories of realism that arose in the period after the Civil War and before World War I. Authors covered may include Howells, James, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Twain, Sarah Orne Jewett, Jacob Riis, Stephen Crane, and W. E. B. DuBois. Not offered 2021-2022. En 140. Literature in the Marketplace of Books. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. How did early readers experience the printed page? How did changes in the conditions of book production shape this experience? And what can modern readers learn of these experiences through our own technologies? In this course, we will explore these questions and ask how our understanding of literature changes when books are considered in terms of their physical characteristics and in relation to the broader marketplace of which they were a part. Our inquiry will be organized around important developments in the history of the early printed book: the re-discovery of classical texts by humanists; the mass production of religious books during the Protestant Reformation; the emergence of political pamphlets and newsbooks during the English Civil War; and the rise of new forms of literature like playtexts, ro - mances, and novels. The course will include work with rare materials at the Henry E. Huntington Library as well as an introduction to the digital tools that scholars are developing to analyze books at scale. Instructor: Koch. En 150. Chaos and Literature. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. We tend to think of literary texts as models of a stable poetic order, but modern and postmodern writers conduct increasingly bold experiments to test the contrary. This class explores how writers from the nineteenth century onward draw upon ancient and contemporary concepts of chaos to test out increasingly sophisticated models of disorder though writing. Readings to include Lucretius, Serres, Calvino, Barth, Stoppard, and Kehlmann. Instructor: Holland. Not offered 2021-2022. En 151. Keeping Time. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. The way in which humans perceive and record time has a discernable history, and literary texts offer us one of the best ways to study it, particularly in times of war and natural catastrophe. With a focus on 16th- through 18th-century European literature, we will examine various techniques of literary time-keeping as they relate to topics such as, fame and mortality, as well as the experience of time's slowness and acceleration. Readings will include selections from Baroque emblem books as well as texts by Montaigne, Milton, Pepys, Defoe, and Rousseau. Instructor: Holland. Not offered 2021-2022. En/VC 160 ab. Classical Hollywood Cinema. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This course introduces students to Hollywood films and filmmak - ing during the classical period, from the coming of sound through the English590 Courses'50s. Students will develop the techniques and vocabulary appropri - ate to the distinct formal properties of film. Topics include the rise and collapse of the studio system, technical transformations (sound, color, deep focus), genre (the musical, the melodrama), cultural contexts (the Depression, World War II, the Cold War), audience responses, and the economic history of the film corporations. Terms may be taken independently. Part a covers the period 1927-1940. Part b covers 1941- 1960. Instructor: Jurca. Not offered 2021-2022. En/VC 161. The New Hollywood. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. This course examines the post-classical era of Hollywood filmmaking with a focus on the late 1960s through the 1970s, a period of significant formal and thematic experimentation. We will study American culture and politics as well as film in this era, as we consider the relation between broader social transformations and the development of new narrative conventions and cinematic techniques. We will pay particular attention to the changing film industry and its influence on this body of work. Films covered may include Bonnie and Clyde , The Graduate , The God - father , Taxi Driver , and Jaws . Instructor: Jurca. En 164. Contemporary Black Diasporic Literature and Culture. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. What is a Black diasporic analytic and how might it deepen our understandings of the cultural, environmental, literary, and political implications of globalization and racialization today? The literary and expressive genius of Black people across the global African diaspora has resulted in an extensive tradition of Black diasporic analytic works that have become unique portraits of a variety of Black international experi - ences within and beyond English-speaking nations. While this course focuses on contemporary Black diasporic literature and culture, it will nevertheless foreground the various linguistic, literary, and national histories that inform and shape this body of work. Additionally, students will learn how recent Black diasporic literature and culture have in turn shaped our current understandings of diaspora, family, gender, history, identity, labor, migration, nation, race, sexuality, and more. Overall, this course will intro - duce students to several pivotal Black diasporic literary and cultural works; representative modes of criticism and methodologies in the disciplines of diaspora studies; and the cultural, historical, and social realities of Black lives from the 1980s to today. All readings will be provided in English. In - structor: Murphy. En 165. Black Feminist and Womanist Literature and Thought. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. For centuries, Black feminists, especially queer and trans women, and non-binary and queer folx, writing in Africa, the Caribbean, Europe, the United States, and more, have used literature to reimagine feminisms. In the decades following the second-wave feminist movement, a body of writing coalesced around the terms \"Black femi - nist\" and \"womanist.\" These years are remembered for decolonization and postcolonialism; Anita Hill's testimony; the passing of Title IX; the first Take Back the Night marches; the introduction of terms \"intersectionality\" by Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw and \"third-wave feminism\" by Rebecca Walker; the widespread publishing of works by feminists; the creation of 591 Ethnic Studies and Women's and Gender Studies departments across institutions of higher education; and more. It was a moment in which Black people across identities and national origins wrote a number of works that radically retheorized family, home, gender, love, race, sexuality, work, and more, in ways that challenged cultures of violence in favor of imagin - ing beloved communities. In this course, students will read, discuss, and better understand multiple literary and critical works participating in Black feminisms in order to then theorize new possibilities for Black feminist futures. Instructor: Murphy. En 178. Medieval Subjectivities. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. In the sev - enteenth century, Descartes penned his famous expression \"I think there - fore I am!\" and thus the modern subject was born-or so the simplified story goes. But long before the age of Descartes, the Middle Ages produced an astonishing range of theories and ideas about human selfhood, subjectivity, and interiority. For instance, writing from prison more than one thousand years earlier, Boethius came to realize that what distinguishes a human being from all other creatures is his capacity to \"know himself.\" The mean - ing of this opaque statement and others like it will command our attention throughout this course, as we explore the diverse, distinctive, and often highly sophisticated notions of subjectivity that developed in the literatures of the Middle Ages. We will take up questions of human agency, free will, identity, self-consciousness, confession, and secrecy as we encounter them in some of the most exciting texts written during the period, including among others) Augustine's Confessions, Prudentius's Psychomachia, the Old English poem The Wanderer, the mystical writings of Margery Kempe and Julian of Norwich, and Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde. Not offered 2021-2022. En 179. Constituting Citizenship before the Fourteenth Amendment. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. What can a slave's narrative teach us about citizenship? How did the new nation identify citizens when its Constitution seemed so silent on the matter? And how did one tailor's pamphlet result in one of most massive restrictions of free speech in U.S. history? Our goal over the semester will be to sketch a story of African American literary production from the latter half of the eighteenth century to the Civil War and to tease out, through this literature, developing understandings of citizen - ship in the United States. We will read letters, poems, sermons, songs, constitutions and bylaws, short stories, and texts that simply defy easy categorization. We will also spend several sessions becoming familiar with key newspapers and magazines-Freedom's Journal, Frederick Douglass's Paper, The Anglo-African Magazine, Christian Recorder, and The Crisis-to deepen our understanding of the kinds of things people were reading and writing on a regular basis and the kinds of arguments they were mak - ing. Writers up for discussion may include: Frederick Douglass, James Madison, Harriet Jacobs, Henry David Thoreau, Sojourner Truth, and David Walker. Not offered 2021-2022. En 180. Special Topics in English. 9 units (3-0-6); offered by announce - ment. This is an advanced humanities course on a specialized topic in English. It is usually taught by new or visiting faculty. The course may be English592 Coursesre-taken for credit except as noted in the course announcement. Limited to 15 students. See registrar's announcement for details. Instructors: Staff, visitors. En 181. Hardy: The Wessex Novels. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. This course will examine the body of work that the late Victorian novelist Thomas Hardy published under the general title The Wessex Novels, that is, the sequence of works from Far from the Madding Crowd to Jude the Obscure. The six main novels will be read critically to give a sense of the totality of this great - est British regional novelist's achievement. Not offered 2021-2022. En 182. Literature and the First Amendment. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. \"Freedom of speech,\" writes Benjamin Cardozo in Palko v. Connecticut (1937), \"is the matrix, the indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of freedom.\" We will go inside the matrix, focusing on how it has affected the books we read. This is not a course in constitutional law or political philosophy, but an opportunity to examine how American literary culture has intersected with law and politics. We will investigate the ways in which the meanings of \"freedom,\" what it entails, and who is entitled to it have changed over time. Possible topics include the obscenity trials sur - rounding Allen Ginsberg's Howl and James Joyce's Ulysses, crackdowns on anti-war propagandists, and the legal battle between Hustler publisher Larry Flynt and televangelist and Moral Majority cofounder Jerry Falwell. Not offered 2021-2022. En 183. Victorian Crime Fiction. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. In 19th-century Britain, for the first time in human history, more of a nation's citizens came to live in urban areas than in rural ones. This result of the Industrial Revolu - tion produced many effects, but in the fiction of the period, one of the most striking was an obsession with the problem of crime. Victorian authors filled their novels with murder, prisons, poisonings, prostitution, criminals, and the new figure of the detective; in this class we will look at the social history, publishing developments, and formal dilemmas that underlay such a response. Authors studied may include Dickens, Collins, Braddon, Conan Doyle, Chesterton, and Conrad, among others. Instructor: Gilmore. En 185. Dickens and the Dickensian. 9 units (3-0-6). The adjective \"Dickensian\" makes an almost daily appearance in today's newspapers, magazines, and other media sources. It is used to describe everything from outrageous political scandals, to Bollywood musicals, to multi - plot novels. But what does the word really mean? And what part of Charles Dickens's output does it refer to? This class will consider some of Dickens's most famous works alongside a series of contemporary novels, all critically described in \"Dickensian\" terms. The main concern will be equally with style and form, and 19th-century and present-day circumstances of production (e.g., serialization, mass production, Web publication, etc.). Authors considered (aside from Dickens) may include Richard Price, Zadie Smith, Monica Ali, and Jonathan Franzen. Not of - fered 2021-2022.593 En 186. The Novel of Education. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. This class takes up a set of mostly very funny, mostly 20th century British novels to frame a simple-seeming, yet deceptively complicated set of ques - tions: What does it mean to be educated? Who has access to educa - tion? What does an ideal education consist in? And ultimately: What is a university for? As we think through these questions we will read op/eds and investigative journalism in addition to fiction, and we will consider a variety of university-centered topics (determined by student interest) including issues of gender, class, privilege, race, and genius. Authors read may include Sayers, Larkin, Amis, C.P . Snow, Lodge, and Zadie Smith. Instructor: Gilmore. Not offered 2021-2022. En 190. Chaucer. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This course devotes itself to the writings of the diplomat, courtier, bureaucrat, and poet, Geoffrey Chaucer. Best known for the Canterbury Tales, Chaucer also authored dream visions, lyrics, and philosophical meditations. This course will introduce you to some better-known and lesser-known works in the Chaucerian corpus, while also exploring questions central to the production and circulation of literature in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. What did it mean to \"invent\" a literary work in late medieval England? How did Chaucer imagine himself as a writer and reader? What are the hallmarks of Chaucerian style, and how did Chaucer become the canonical author he is today? We will read Chaucer's works in their original language, Middle English, working slowly enough to give participants time to familiarize themselves with syntax and spelling. No previous experience with the language is necessary. Instructor: Jahner. Not offered 2021-2022. En 191. Masterworks of Contemporary Latin American Fiction. 9 units (3-0-6); third term.

The hapless protagonist of Don Quixote calls into question the boundaries between sanity and madness, truth and falsehood, history and fiction, objectivity and individual experience. What might be modern, perhaps even revolutionary, in Cervantes's dra - matization of the moral and material dilemmas of his time? Conducted in English. Instructor: Wey-Gomez. En/H 197.

What is life? What is special about the human brain? How did the invention of writing enable the transition from human intelligence to artificial intelligence? We will argue that life is an information system that has memory stored in syntax (DNA) that is enriched by an innovation process (mutation and selection) that leads to new species. Also, we will argue that the human brain is an information system that has memory (enabled by natural languages) that 603 is enriched by an innovation process (learning) that leads to new ideas. The emergence of life and the human brain served as the backdrop to the information (r)evolution that we are witnessing today! Instructor: Bruck. FS/Ay 3. Freshman Seminar: Automating Discovering the Universe. 6 units (2-0-4); third term. Powerful new instruments enable astrono - mers to collect huge volumes of data on billions of objects. As a result, astronomy is changing dramatically: by the end of this decade, most astronomers will probably be analysing data collected in large surveys, and only a few will still be visiting observatories to collect their own data. The tool chest of future astronomers will involve facility with \"big data\", developing clever queries, algorithms (some based on machine learning) and statistics, and combining multiple databases. This course will introduce students to some of these tools. After \"recovering\" known objects, students will be unleashed to make their own astronomical discoveries in new data sets.

Were they really the horned- helmeted, bloodthirsty barbarians depicted by modern popular media and by many medieval chronicles? What effect did they have in their roughly two centuries of raiding and colonization on the civilizations of medieval and ultimately modern Europe? Instructor: Brown, W. Not offered 2021-2022. H 123. Ordinary People: Uncovering Everyday Life in the European Past. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. In the historical record, much atten - tion is given to wealthy elites (rulers and lawmakers, aristocrats, wealthy merchants), since they were the ones who left written records of their political and economic activities and their personal affairs. But what about the vast majority of people who lived in the past, most of whom were barely literate and had little opportunity to 'make history'? What can we know about them? This class focuses on the lives of ordinary people, and the sources historians use to learn about them. Special at - tention will be given to women, the poor, and other marginalized groups in societies ranging from England in the west to Russia in the east. In - structor: Dennison. Not offered 2021-2022. H 125. Soviet Russia. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Why was the Rus - sian Revolution of 1917 successful? And how did the Soviet system survive nearly 75 years?

Technology and Environment in America. 9 units (3-0- 6); third term. As climate change has become an increasingly heated topic around the world, Americans across political and professional arenas often invoke technology as both a cause and potential solution. In American culture, an enthusiasm for innovation often overshadows 627 the messier ways that humans interact with our surroundings through the artifacts and technologies that we create. In this course, we will examine the interplay between environment and technology in America, from before the arrival of Europeans on the North American continent through present debates about our changing planet. We will consider the boundaries that different groups have drawn between natural and artificial, and how these definitions have shaped the cultural, political, and material landscape of America. How useful are these boundaries? How might challenging them help us rethink America's history and its future? In this seminar, students will practice using the tools and meth - ods of history to make a clear, persuasive argument. Each student will choose a relevant term project topic in consultation with the instructor. Assignments throughout the term will cumulatively build into an original piece of writing grounded in primary and secondary source research. In class, we will read and discuss texts that explore intersections of tech - nology and the environment in American history, both to learn about the substance of these texts but also to gain insight on how to craft effec - tive, readable historical writing. Students will learn how to use archival materials, practice critically analyzing historical texts, and participate in the discussion, debate, and consensus necessary to build a dynamic understanding of the past. Instructor: Rand. H 131. History of Extinction. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Humans are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction\u2014the first to be caused by human activity. Extinction has been viewed in changing ways over the past 200 years, and this course takes an interdisciplinary approach to learn - ing about the extinction process from a historical as well as a modern perspective. Our focus will be on the extinction of biological entities, but we will also touch on other systems that have disappeared: languages, technologies, habitats, and ways of living. Central to our endeavors will be asking what it means to live in this time of loss: Should we mour n? And if so, how do we mourn for what many or most of us do not see, but only read about? Finally, we will scrutinize what the practical effects of extinction have been, are, and will be. We will also make at least one visit to a natural history museum to view some extinct species behind the scenes. Instructor: Lewis. Not offered 2021-2022. H 132. Humanistic Ecology. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. Humans' conceptions of nature have changed dramatically over time. Ecological systems influence human culture, politics, law, and many other spheres, and in turn, humans influence those systems. This class introduces students to the field of humanistic ecology\u2014a discipline that looks to a number of cultural, political, historical and economic elements to better understand the role of ecology in a larger sphere outside of its scientific structure and uses. Humanistic ecology is designed to provide context for the study of ecology, and in a fundamental way, focuses on the ap - propriate role of humanity in its relationship to nature: what is ethical, or not, what is useful, or not, and a variety of other matters that should be considered when taking a fully three-dimensional view of ecological science. Instructor: Lewis. Not offered 2021-2022. History628 CoursesH 133. Forests and Humans. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Forests - which cover 31 percent of the world's land surface - have played essential roles in enhancing the planet's biodiversity. Forests have also served humans in numerous and often controversial ways, and have also been subjected to dramatic change through human activity. How well have we served forests, as well as being served by them? The class will cover the growth and use of forests from a humanistic and historic perspective, as well as discussions about the role of fire in forests, with a particular emphasis on the unprecedented forest fires in California in the past several years and the global ecological implications. Instructor: Lewis. H 134. Birds, Evolution, Speciation and Society. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. The cultural, scientific, social and political roles of birds make them an excellent lens through which to view humans' interactions with the natural world. This course will cover our changing understandings of birds, starting with hawking and falconry in earlier centuries, through the discov - ery of new species, up through Darwinian understandings of speciation and evolution, and continuing up to present scientific understandings of birds' capabilities and their ties to humankind, as well as to other anchors in the natural world. We will take a strong biographical as well as avian approach to understanding key personalities who furthered our understandings of avian science. Instructor: Lewis. H 135. War, Conquest, and Empires. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. This course will use historical examples of war and conquest and ask why some periods of history were times of warfare and why certain countries developed a comparative advantage in violence. The examples will come from the history of Europe and Asia, from ancient times up until World War I, and the emphasis throughout will be on the interplay between politics, military technology, and social conditions. Instructor: Hoffman. H 136. Caltech in the Archives. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This class will introduce students to the methods of archival work in the humanities and social sciences. Over the course of the quarter students will receive an introduction to factors surrounding the collection, organization, and use of various types of archives as a background to several small-scale projects working in an archival collection of their own choosing. The seminar will center around weekly projects and synthetic analytical essays about the archival process and archival discoveries. Students hoping to combine their course work with an archive-based research paper may sign up for a sepa - rate independent study and conduct research concurrently, with instructor approval. Instructor: Dykstra. H 137. Criminals, Outlaws, and Justice in a Thousand Years of Chi - nese History. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This course explores the shifting boundary between discourses of crime and disobedience over the last millennium or so of Chinese history. It offers fictional, philosophical, po - litical, propagandistic, official, and personal writings on crime and those who commit it as a basis for a wide-ranging series of discussions about when breaking the law is good, when breaking the law is bad, and who 629 gets to decide where the line between a criminal and an outlaw should be drawn. Instructor: Dykstra. Not offered 2021-2022. H 138. The Way. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. This course introduces students to some of the seminal writings on the meaning of life, the essentials of rulership, and the place of the individual in the universe from the history of Chinese thought and philosophy. Students are given selected readings from several schools of thought in Chinese history, with an emphasis on the formative Warring States era (the period of the Hundred Schools of classical Chinese philosophy). Instead of being asked to write expository or argumentative essays, participants in this seminar will be introduced to analyzing and presenting texts using the method of annotation. Exposure to the principles of annotation will pro - vide students with a new approach to analyzing and talking about texts both within a humanistic context and beyond. Instructor: Dykstra. H 139. Translation Theory and Practice (Chinese Historical Sources Seminar). 9 units (3-0-6). For course description, see L 139. Instructor: Dykstra. H/L 142. Perspectives on History through Russian Literature. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. The Russian intelligentsia registered the arrival of modern urban society with a highly articulate sensitivity, perhaps because these changes\u2014industrialization, the breakdown of traditional hierarchies and social bonds, the questioning of traditional beliefs\u2014 came to Russia so suddenly. This gives their writings a paradigmatic quality; the modern dilemmas that still haunt us are made so eloquently explicit in them that they have served as models for succeeding genera - tions of writers and social critics. This course explores these writings (in English translation) against the background of Russian society, focusing especially on particular works of Chekhov, Dostoevsky, Goncharov, Tolstoy, and Turgenev. Instructor: Dennison. Not offered 2021-2022. H 149. Age of Fracture: America Since 1974. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. In this course, we will examine America after Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974, a period that historians have referred to as an age of fracture and social disaggregation. Using fracture as a conceptual framework to investigate American politics and culture in the last quar - ter of the twentieth century, we'll consider how the recent past has in - formed present-day American society. Themes of study will include the culture wars, political polarization, globalization, and the growing wealth gap. In addition, we'll investigate the theoretical and methodological challenges of doing recent history. Instructor: Wiggins. H 152. Where Do We Go from Here? Black America in the Post-Civil Rights Era. 9 units (3-0-6); first term . This course will examine African American politics, culture, and society in the decades following the pas - sage of landmark civil rights legislation in the 1960s. Topics of discus - sion will include deindustrialization and the rise of hip hop cultur e, black feminist and queer thought, debates over welfare and affirmative action, and mass incarceration. Analyzing a variety of political and cultural artifacts as well as cutting-edge secondary literature, we will investigate History630 Coursesvarious moments in recent African American history to gain insight into changing notions of rights, citizenship, equality, and freedom in Ameri - can society. Instructor: Wiggins. H/HPS 153. Inequality and Environment. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This seminar introduces students to the history of environmental inequality, environmental racism, and environmental justice. Human bodies are inescapably enmeshed in our environments: human health and environ - mental health are inseparable. But environmental burdens and benefits are distributed unevenly along lines of race, gender, class, and national - ity. We will examine local, national, and transnational case studies to understand the historical development of environmental inequalities and movements for environmental justice. We will consider different methods for studying environmental injustice and the politics of environmental knowledge. Instructor: LeBlanc. H/HPS 154. Feminist Science Studies. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. This seminar offers an introduction to scholarship on gender and science. Feminist science studies can seem oxymoronic: the objectivity on which science depends appears opposed to the political commit - ments feminism implies. Scholars in feminist science studies, however, argue that feminist theory and methods can in fact improve scientific practice. This course will introduce students to the historical develop - ment of feminist Science & Technology Studies and what this field tells us about the history of women in science, the history of scientific theories of sex/gender, and the future of feminist research. This reading- heavy class will also include discussions of feminist epistemology, feminist research methods, and new directions in feminist STS. Instruc - tor: LeBlanc. H/HPS 155. Mortality Crises and Social Change: Epidemic Disease from 1300 to the Present. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. What do we know about epidemics in the past? What did contemporaries understand about these events? How did societies respond to periodic bouts of epidemic disease? This course examines mortality crises and epidemics from the Black Death in the 14th century to the current coronavirus pandemic, with attention given to the impact of epidemics on societies, the ways in which such outbreaks have been understood over time and the kinds of responses they have elicited. We will draw on studies for a range of societies in order to identify patterns across space and time, and to highlight both continuity and change in the ways societies have dealt with contagious diseases. Instructor: Dennison. H/HPS 156. COVID-19 and Other Pandemics. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. How do we understand the COVID pandemic and the differential responses to it around the globe? What is the best framework for proper understanding? Science, history, politics, culture? Special attention will be given to the state of medical science today and in the past, the under - standing of ethology, transmission, and symptoms; the role of scientists, physicians, and \"quacks\"; the persistence and change in the forms of 631 fear, superstition, and misinformation across time.

This course explores late medieval European understandings of the origins, structure, and workings of the cosmos in the realms of theology, physics, astrono - my, astrology, magic, and medicine. Attention is given to the position of humans as cultural creatures at the intersection of nature and spirit; as well as to the place of Christian Europeans in relation to non-Christians and other categories of outsiders within and beyond Europe. We will examine the knowledge system that anticipated racializing theories in the West. Instructor: Wey-Gomez. H/HPS/VC 186. From Plato to Pluto: Maps, Exploration and Culture from Antiquity to the Present. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. This course covers a broad range of topics in the history of maps and explora - tion from Antiquity to the present. These topics range from the earliest visualizations of earth and space in the Classical world to contemporary techniques in interplanetary navigation. By way of maps, students will explore various ways in which different cultures have conceptualized and navigated earth and space. While maps emulate the world as perceived by the human eye, they, in fact, comprise a set of observations and perceptions of the relationship between bodies in space and time. Thus, students will study maps, and the exploration they enable, as windows to the cultures that have produced them, not only as scientific and technical artifacts to measure and navigate our world. Instructors: Ceva, Wey-Gomez. Not offered 2021-2022. H/L 191. Perspectives on History through German Literature. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. Industrialization, economic growth, and democracy 633 came to Germany much later than to England and France, and the forms they took in Germany were filtered through the specific institutional character of Central Europe. German-speaking writers and intellectuals saw these trends from the perspective of indigenous intellectual tradi - tions, and the resulting collisions of values and priorities largely shaped European and American social, political, and literary debates for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This course explores these writ - ings (in English translation) against the historical background of Central European society, focusing on particular works of Goethe, Hoffmann, Heine, Nietzsche, Kafka, Rilke, and Mann. Instructor: Dennison. Not offered 2021-2022. H 192. The Crusades. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. This course will introduce students to the series of religiously motivated European inva - sions of the Middle and Near East that began at the end of the eleventh century and that led to the creation of Latin Christian principalities in Palestine. Though the crusading movement came to embroil much of Europe itself, the course will focus strictly on the military expeditions to what the Crusaders called the Holy Land, and the history of the Crusad - er states up to the point of their destruction at the end of the thirteenth century. The course will be guided by the following questions: how did medieval Christianity justify wars of aggression against foreign peoples and religions? What motivated western Europeans to leave their homes and march into a hostile environment, where they often faced impover - ishment if not death and where maintaining a Christian presence was a constant struggle? How did they manage to erect stable political enti - ties in alien territory that lasted as long as they did, and how did they have to adapt their own culture to do so? Finally, how did the native peoples of the regions the Crusaders invaded and conquered\u2014Muslim but also Christian and Jewish \u2014 perceive the Crusaders? How did the Crusaders' presence affect life in a region whose populations had their own ancient histories and patterns of life? Instructor: Brown. Not offered 2021-2022. En/H 193.

This course will critically examine the emerging science of happiness and positive psychology, its philosophical assumptions, methodology, and its role in framing social policy and practice. Topics to be addressed include: the relation between happiness as subjective well-being or life satisfaction and philosophical visions of the good life; the relation between happiness and virtue; the causes of happiness and the role of life experience; happiness and economic notions of human welfar e, attempts to measure happiness, and the prospect for an economics of happiness; happiness as a brain state and whether brain science can illuminate the nature of happiness; mental illness and psychiatry in light of positive psychology. Instructor: Quartz. HPS/Pl 138. Human Nature and Society. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This course will investigate how assumptions about human nature shape political philosophy, social institutions, and social policy. The course will begin with a historical perspective, examining the work of such political philosophers as Plato, Locke, Rousseau, and Marx, along with such psychologists as Freud and Skinner. Against this historical perspective, it will then turn to examine contemporary views on human nature from cognitive neuroscience and evolutionary psychology and explore their potential implications for political philosophy and social policy. Among topics to be discussed will be the nature of human sociality and coop - eration; economic systems and assumptions regarding production and consumption; and propaganda, marketing, and manipulation. Instructor: Quartz. Not offered 2021-2022. HPS/Pl 139. Human Nature, Welfare, & Sustainability. 9 units (3-0- 6); first term. Policy makers since at least the time of Jeremy Bentham have argued that welfare maximization ought to be the goal of social policy. When this includes perfectionist notions of realizing one's capacities, economic prosperity, prosocial norms, and democratization have all coincided as key drivers of human development. Although the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development envisions worldwide inclusive and sustainable economic growth, there is substantial debate regarding the extent to which sustainability and economic growth are compatible. This course will critically examine the links between human welfare, economic growth, and material culture to better understand why economic growth and welfare have been taken to be intertwined - and the extent to which they could be decoupled. Our starting point will be the Brundtland report, its conception of welfare based on human needs, and subsequent articulations of needs-based theories of human welfare, including evolutionary and biological accounts that include 637 social comparison processes such as esteem, status, and recognition. This will provide us with a theoretical framework for investigating the role of material culture in satisfying these needs and whether they may be satisfied by less resource-intense routes.

Visible and invisible technologies dominate the present, deeply impacting our personal, social and political lives. This advanced class focuses on technology's role at the intersection of science, politics and culture, primarily in Western Europe and the United States. We will examine the histories of selected technologies (rocketry, computing, robotics); the circulation of knowledge and the creation of networks (transportation, communication, energy, surveillance); real and imagined infrastructural mega-projects (Suez Canal, Atlantropa, Channel tunnel, Transrapid, Iridium); and the role of experts and technocratic elites. As the class combines the discussion of competing methodologies with the reading of field-defining classics, students will get to know a thriving area of historical research with particular relevance to future scientists and engineers. Instructor: Geppert. HPS/H 158. From World to Earth: Spaceflight and the Making of a Planet. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. Are we living in a 'Second Space Age'?

Historical Perspectives on the Relations between Sci - ence and Religion. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. The course devel - ops a framework for understanding the changing relations between science and religion in Western culture since antiquity. Focus will be on the ways in which the conceptual, personal, and social boundar - ies between the two domains have been reshaped over the centuries. Questions to be addressed include the extent to which a particular reli - gious doctrine was more or less amenable to scientific work in a given period, how scientific activity carved an autonomous domain, and the roles played by scientific activity in the overall process of seculariza - tion. Instructor: Feingold. HPS/H 167. Experimenting with History/Historic Experiment. 9 units (3-0-6). third term. Prerequisites: Ph 1 abc, and Ph 2 abc (may be taken concurrently). This course uses a combination of lectures with hands-on laboratory work to bring out the methods, techniques, and knowledge that were involved in building and conducting historical experiments. We will connect our laboratory work with the debates and claims made by the original discoverers, asking such questions as how experimental facts have been connected to theories, how anomalies arise and are handled, and what sorts of conditions make historically for good data. Typical experiments might include investigations of refraction, laws of electric force, interference of polarized light, electro - magnetic induction, or resonating circuits and electric waves. We will 639 reconstruct instrumentation and experimental apparatus based on a close reading of original sources. Instructor: Buchwald. HPS/H 168.

Not offered 2021-2022. HPS/H 172. History of Mathematics: A Global View with Close- ups. 9 units (3-0-6); offered by announcement. The course will provide students with a brief yet adequate survey of the history of mathemat - ics, characterizing the main developments and placing these in their chronological, cultural, and scientific contexts. A more detailed study of a few themes, such as Archimedes' approach to infinite processes, the changing meanings of \"analysis\" in mathematics, Descartes' ana - lytic geometry, and the axiomatization of geometry c. 1900; students' input in the choice of these themes will be welcomed. Not offered 2021-2022. HPS/H 173. Carving Nature's Joints: Histories of Nature's Order. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. In Plato's Phaedrus, Socrates famously described the virtues of two ways of looking at the world. The first en - tailed \"seeing together things that are scattered about everywhere and collecting them into one kind,\" while the second was the skill \"to cut up each kind according to its species along its natural joints, and to try not to splinter any part, as a bad butcher might do.\" In a similar sentiment, Darwin wrote in 1857, \"It is good to have hair-splitters and lumpers.\" History and Philosophy of Science640 CoursesHow have scientists and laypeople perceived similarities and differences in the living world? How have they divided nature into distinct kinds and individuals? How have they distinguished between parts and wholes? Where have they positioned human beings within nature's order? What were the consequences of finding different kinds of order in nature? This course explores these and related questions historically. We will consider different approaches to making sense of nature, and how a multitude of perspectives have been brought to bear on this ordering project. Topics covered include taxonomy and classification, race science and scientific racism, gender and sex differences, disease categories and immune selfhood, and symbioses and biogeochemical cycles. Instructor: Kollmer. in Global Perspec - tive. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. Humans excel at using other organisms, including other humans, as means to ends. From the beginnings of agriculture, our species has cultivated crops, livestock, and microbial fermenters as living technologies of production. In modern industrial economies, human uses of life have undergone radical changes, as have the values humans assigned different forms of life. Agriculture underwent rationalization and intensification, increasing yields many times over. Scaled-up fermentation techniques served to preserve food, manufacture drugs, and process wastes. In vitro fertilization and somatic cell nuclear transfer permitted dramatic interventions in sexual reproduc - tion. This course will explore these and other histories of biotechnology across different temporal, geographic, and cultural contexts, paying special attention to the ambivalent relationships that arose between user and used in such instrumentalizations of life. Instructor: Kollmer. HPS/H 175. Matter, Motion, and Force: Physical Astronomy from Ptolemy to Newton. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. The course will ex - amine how elements of knowledge that evolved against significantly dif - ferent cultural and religious backgrounds motivated the great scientific revolution of the 17th century. Not offered 2021-2022. HPS/H 176. The Occult Origins of Modern Science: Alchemy, Astrology, and Magic. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Modern science is often described as a rational, empirical, and objective search for truth about nature. But how, when, and why did science come to acquire these qualities? Many scholars look to the exciting developments and discoveries of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in Europe-the so-called \"Scientific Revolution\"-as the defining period for the emer - gence of modern science. If \"modern\" science is defined in these terms, then \"premodern\" science must have looked more like pseudo-science, superstition, or myth. However, that is far from the truth. In this course, we'll work to uncover the role that the occult sciences, including alchemy, astrology, and magic, played in the formation of modern science. Our studies of the occult sciences will force us to think more deeply about what distinguishes modern science from the occult sciences, and to question why their role in the development of modern science has also been obscured. Instructor: Gaida.641 HPS/H 180. Forbidden Knowledge. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Why does the notion of freedom of knowledge and teaching in science and engineering matter? What kinds of restrictions have been placed on scientists and engineers, their publications and institutions? Who restrained scientific and engineering knowledge of what sorts; for what reasons; and how successfully? These questions will be addressed by exploring the strategies developed by the U.S. research community to protect the international circulation of knowledge after World War II, when scientific freedom and the export of technical data had to be balanced with the needs of national security. Case studies will include the atomic bomb, the semiconductor industry in the 1970s and space technologies, notably rockets/missiles, in the 1990s. The threat to U.S. economics and military security posed by the Soviet Union in the Cold War, and by China today, has transformed the practice of research in university and in industry alike building new walls around the production and circulation of knowledge to affirm national sovereignty that is, all the while, being undermined by the global circulation of trained scientists and engineers.

The Classical and Medieval Worlds. 9 units (3-0-6); sec - ond, third terms. This course will survey the evolution of Mediterranean and European civilization from antiquity through the end of the Middle Ages. It will emphasize the reading and discussion of primary sources, especially but not exclusively literary works, against the backdr op of the broad historical narrative of the periods. The readings will pres - ent students with the essential characteristics of various ancient and medieval societies and give students access to those societies' cultural assumptions and perceptions of change. Instructor: Brown. Not offered 2021-2022. Hum/H 2. Freedom Dreams: African American Visions of Liberation Since Emancipation. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Over the course of their history in the United States, African Americans have advanced various visions of liberation and strategies for attaining it. This course will exam - ine how African Americans have conceptualized and sought to realize their freedom dreams since the end of chattel slavery. We will focus, in particular, on visions of freedom considered radical or utopian, both in their contemporary moment and in our present. Investigating how African Americans have imagined freer lives beyond their own localities, Humanities642 Coursesbeyond U.S. borders, and even beyond Earth, our topics of discussion in the course may include emigration movements, black communism, pan-Africanism, black feminism, cults, Afrofuturism, hip hop culture, and abolitionism. Instructor: Wiggins. Hum/H 3. The United States in the Twentieth Century. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Designed to introduce students to the academic study of history, this course examines key issues and events that shaped the political, social, and cultural history of the United States in the Twentieth Century. Through a wide variety of historical sources\u2014including primary documents, fiction, and music\u2014students will explore issues such as popular culture, immigration and labor, the civil rights movement, politi - cal realignment, and American intervention abroad. Instructor: Wiggins. Not offered 2021-2022. Hum/H 4. Political, Social, and Intellectual Change in Early Modern Europe. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. This course will examine the major changes that transformed western civilization between 1300 and 1800- -the early modern period. It will also introduce students to real works of history. Reading will therefore include not just classic writings by contemporaries, but works by professional historians. The focus will be on big political questions posed by the history of early modern Europe, questions that remain of interest: In a violent world, what role should morality play in politics? What do we want out of government at a time when states are weak-one that is strong enough to secure our lives and our property in the midst of ubiquitous violence or one that will pursue a common democratic purpose? If we value security above all else, what will protect us against a state dictatorship? And what provokes revolutions-ideas, material interests, or strategic political behavior? In - structor: Hoffman. Hum/H 5. The History of the Chinese Empire. 9 units (3-0-6); first, second terms. This class will explore several facets of how the concept of empire and its historical formation in China was defined, portrayed, and developed over time. It offers students a chance to reflect on the interaction of event, record, and remembrance as these components combine in the creation and contestation of history. This course will particularly emphasize how the making, writing, and remembering of history responds to the advent of different regimes of legitimacy in order to give students a new perspective on the relationship between action, authorship, and interpretation in history. Instructor: Dykstra. Hum/H 6. Civilization, Science, and Archaeology: The Develop - ment of Science from Babylon through the Renaissance. 9 units (3-0-6); second, third terms. Connections in antiquity between astrology and astronomy, early theories of light, Islamic science, new concepts of knowledge during the European Middle Ages and Renaissance, the early laboratory, the development of linear perspective, the origins of the Copernican and Keplerian systems of astronomy, and the science of Galileo. Instructor: Buchwald.643 Hum/H 7. Civilization, Science, and Archaeology: The Nature of Religious Belief in Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Israel. 9 units (3-0-6); second, third terms. The civilizations of Egypt and Mesopota - mia gave rise to complex forms of religious practices connected to the social order, moral behavior, and the afterlife. The course examines the origins of concepts of moral death and of sin as a violation of cosmic order in antiquity, the nature of polytheism, and the manner in which monotheism arose out of it. In addition to historical analyses the course includes readings by anthropologists who have studied cult structures as well as contemporary theories by evolutionary psychologists. Instruc - tor: Buchwald. Not offered 2021-2022. Hum/H 8. Civilization, Science, and Archaeology: Before Greece: The Origins of Civilization in Mesopotamia. 9 units (3-0-6); second, third terms. This course will introduce students to the early development of civilization in Mesopotamia and Egypt from 4000 B.C.E. through 1000 B.C.E. Origins of agriculture and writing, the evolution of the city, and the structures of the Mesopotamian economy and social order will be discussed. Comparison with contemporary developments in Egypt dur - ing the Old and Middle Kingdoms may include a reading of Gilgamesh from 3000 B.C.E. and of the Egyptian Tale of Sinuhe. The course con - cludes with a discussion of life during the late Bronze Age. Focus will be on life as it was lived and experienced by many groups in pre-classical antiquity rather than on kings and dynasties. Instructor: Buchwald. Not offered 2021-2022. Hum/H 9. Europe Transformed. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. Will intro - duce students to major aspects of the politics and culture of modernity that have profoundly transformed Western society and consciousness from the French Revolution to the contemporary era. A variety of histori - cal, literary, and artistic works will be used to illuminate major social, intellectual, and cultural movements. The focus will be on significant and wide-ranging historical change (e.g., the industrial revolution, im - perialism, socialism, fascism); on cultural innovation (e.g., modernism, impressionism, cubism); and on the work of significant thinkers. Instruc - tor: Kormos-Buchwald. Not offered 2021-2022. Hum/H 10. Medieval Europe: The Problem of Violence. 9 units (3-0- 6); first, second terms. This course will explore how people understood violence in Europe between ca. 500 and ca. 1400 AD. It will focus on the various norms that governed the use of violence in a period when the right of free people to carry and use weapons was considered self-evident. Working through primary sources, students will explore the relationship between violence and vengeance, the law, central authority and public order, religion, emotions, public ritual, and economics. As they go along students will consider whether violence can coexist with or even promote stable, ordered societies, or whether it by definition creates disorder. Instructor: Brown. Humanities644 CoursesHum/H 11. Love and Death: Using Demography to Study the History of Europe from 1700. 9 units (3-0-6); first, third terms. Demographic events\u2014births, marriages, deaths\u2014have always been highly responsive to changes in the local environment. Decisions about when to marry, how many children to have, or what kind of household to live in have al - ways been closely correlated to decisions people take in other areas of their lives and, as a result, can tell us a great deal about the economic, social, and cultural worlds people inhabit. This course examines differ - ences in demographic trends in Europe across space and time, from 1700 to the present, as well as existing explanations for these differenc - es, including political economic factors, social and cultural norms, biol - ogy and disease environments. Some topics include: the demographic effects of war, industrialization, and urbanization; changes related to the emergence of reliable contraceptive technologies; changes related to the expansion of economic opportunities for women; the effects of government policies on demographic decisions. Instructor: Dennison. Hum/H 12. Social Theory. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This course intro - duces students to both canonical and non-canonical theories of society. From the formative debates over the role of the state in human affairs in early modern Europe to radical interpretations of social good in the twentieth century, students will be exposed to competing theories of so - ciety and their implications in the political, the economic, the emotional, and the scientific realms. By the end of the quarter, students will be able to link contemporary notions of individuality, agency, rationality, morality, and ethics to divergent discourses in the history of social theory. Instruc - tor: Dykstra. Not offered 2021-2022. Hum/H 13. Brave New Worlds: Race, Human Rights and the Age of Discovery. 9 units (3-0-6); first, second terms. This course traces the origins of modern racism and, perhaps surprisingly, of human rights advocacy itself, to a seminal moment in global history sometimes called the Age of Discovery. At this time, two small European kingdoms, Spain and Portugal, first conducted trade and conquest in Atlantic Africa, the Americas, and the Indian and Pacific Oceans, forging the world's first truly global empires. We study the legacy of racism and humanitarianism in eye-witness accounts, maps, images and other materials attesting to Spain's seminal encounters with the Americas. Instructor: Wey-Gomez. Hum/H/HPS 14. Race, Science, and Medicine in U.S. History. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This course will explore how natural philosophers and scientists have defined, used, and sometimes challenged ideas about race from the eighteenth century to today. Using a range of primary and secondary sources, we will examine how scientific ideas about race developed in concert with European imperial expansion and slavery; how these ideas were employed in legal cases, medical practice, and eugenics policies; and how activists and scholars have challenged rac - ist practices and ideas. Finally, we will turn to the recent resurgence of racial thinking in biology and medicine in the light of the history of race and science. Instructor: LeBlanc.645 Hum/H/HPS 15. Waste in the World. 9 units (3-0-6); second, third terms. The things that human beings make and throw away rarely stay where we put them. Just as humans have shaped the biological and physical world, the biological and physical world shapes human actions. In this course, we will examine how these interacting forces propel environmental and cultural change around the world. We will explore these concepts through the lens of waste -- how different groups at different points in history define waste, where the things we discard go and what they become as they move through space and time. We will consider how conflicting perceptions of utility and waste in different cul - tural and historical contexts have factored into shifting ideas about race, class, gender, wilderness, technology, consumption, and sovereignty. In rethinking waste, we will explore the multiple meanings of \"nature,\" assess the roots of sustainability, and evaluate past events in light of current ideas about environmental justice. While this course prioritizes reading and discussion, we will also engage with the world around us through visual analysis. Pasadena and Los Angeles will be among our most important resources, allowing us to ground global ideas in a local context. Instructor: Rand. Hum/H/HPS 16. Visualizing the Heavens: Images and Instruments of Early Modern Astronomy. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. In Europe during the period from 1450-1650, there were several radical \"revisions\" of the universe. Nicolaus Copernicus proposed a sun-centered, rather than earth-centered, cosmos. Galileo Galilei turned his telescope towards the heavens and observed the Moon, Sun, and moons of Jupiter, and the voyages of discovery led to an expansion of the known world. At the same time, the innovation of the printing press played a crucial role in disseminating information and in allowing for astronomical printed im - ages, including celestial atlases and maps, to reach a broad audience. Paintings of the heavens during this period are also a rich source of shifting astronomical ideas. In this course, we'll trace the role that im - ages and instruments of astronomy played in both producing and reflect - ing these dramatic \"revisions\" of the universe. We'll study astronomical models, eclipse diagrams, almanacs, and printed instruments, alongside astrolabes, telescopes, and celestial globes, to uncover how images and instruments literally produced a new \"vision\" of a sun-centered universe for the early modern world. Instructor: Gaida . Hum/H/HPS 17. Making Life Legible: Materials and Methods in the History of Modern Biology. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This course is an introductory exploration of the stuff of modern biology - the practices and objects that biologists have used to produce knowledge of living nature in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The course will look at how familiar concepts (e.g. the cell, evolution, the gene) were shaped by scientific workers' adoption of different methods and materials. This approach will allow us to situate biological inquiries within wider political and cultural contexts, while also drawing our attention to the way instru - ments mediated perceptions in the recording of observations and the execution of experiments. We will trace continuities and changes in the kinds of questions that naturalists and biologists posed, survey spaces Humanities646 Coursesin which they pursued their work, and become acquainted with a variety of humans, nonhuman organisms, chemicals, and machines assembled in these spaces. These exercises will familiarize us with diverse forms of labor in and beyond laboratories that have contributed to how humans understood the living world. Instructor: Kollmer. Not offered 2021-2022. Hum/H/HPS 18. Introduction to the History of Science. 9 units (3-0- 6); second, third terms. Major topics include the following: What are the origins of modern Western science, when did it emerge as distinct from philosophy and other cultural and intellectual productions, and what are its distinguishing features? When and how did observation, experiment, quantification, and precision enter the practice of science? What were some of the major turning points in the history of science? What is the changing role of science and technology? Using primary and secondary sources, students will take up significant topics in the history of science, from ancient Greek science to the 20th-century revolution in physics, biology, and technology. Hum/H/HPS 10 may be taken for credit toward the additional 36-unit HSS requirement by HPS majors and minors who have already fulfilled their freshman humanities requirement and counts as a history course in satisfying the freshman humanities breadth re - quirement. Instructor: Feingold. Hum/H 19. Righting the Wrongs of History. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. In recent years, growing numbers of people committed to equity and social justice have discussed various ways of addressing historical injustices whose harms are still experienced in the present. Some have proposed monetary restitution and other restorative strategies that ac - count for resources, opportunities, and lives lost. Others have advocated more symbolic reparative approaches that seek to heal the psychic wounds of injustice. This course will examine efforts to right the wrongs of history, with particular attention given to the decades-long movement for reparations for African Americans and recent efforts to address dif - ficult histories at Caltech. Investigating initiatives that have been realized and others that have been only imagined, in this course we will seek to understand both the possibilities and impossibilities of repairing historical harms. Instructor: Wiggins. Hum/En 20. Ancient Epic. 9 units (3-0-6); first, second terms. For over 2,000 years, epic poetry was the foremost genre of literature. This most prestigious kind of poetry was also unusually competitive and self- referential. Apollonius of Rhodes imitates and alludes to Homer, imitates and revises Homer and Apollonius, Ovid and Lucan criticize Virgil's political agenda, and Milton transforms the entire epic tradition. We will consider the differing conceptions of heroism in epics such as Homer's Pigman. Hum/En 21. Monsters and Marvels. 9 units (3-0-6); first, third terms. Marvels flourish at the boundaries of literary invention, religious belief, and scientific inquiry, challenging assumptions about natural 647 processes and expected outcomes. From Grendel, the monstrous foe of Beowulf, to Satan, Milton's charismatic antihero, this seminar examines the uses of the marvelous in a variety of texts and genres, including Shakespearian drama, medieval romance, and early travel-writing. Readings may include Beowulf, Marie de France, Chaucer, John Man - deville, Shakespeare, Milton. Instructor: Jahner. Hum/En 22. Inequality. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. Throughout the history of Europe, America, and beyond, poets and philosophers have asked hard questions about unequal relationships, whether between kings and subjects, gods and humans, men and women, rich and poor, or machines and people. Our authors take no single point of view; our goal is to analyze sophisticated and often surprising arguments and to enter new cultural worlds. Readings may include Ovid, Milton, Sei Sho - nagon, Machiavelli, Rousseau, and Alexievich. Instructor: Haugen. Hum/En 23. Literature and Medicine. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. The relationship between patients and doctors, the ill and the well, involves a constant exchange of stories. In this course we will look more closely at the relationship between medicine and narrative through a selection of fiction, essays and poems that investigate the interplay between doubt and diagnosis, the idea of the case study, the problem of medical responsibility, and the language of pain and illness. Authors covered may include Sontag, Mantel, Conan Doyle, Freud, Woolf, Dickinson, Ishiguro and Shelley. Instructor: Gilmore. Hum/En 24. The Scientific Imagination in English Literature. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. This course considers three periods of major scientific development\u2014the Renaissance, the nineteenth century, and the modern period\u2014 to explore the influence new ideas, discoveries, and theories had on the imagination of English writers. We will look at the early modern interplay between magic and science, Romantic and Victorian debates about evolution, and the twentieth-century advent of modern physics as we confront consistent tropes like the mad scientist, the scientist-hero, and the problem of uncertainty. Authors covered may include Shakespeare, Marlowe, Bacon, Shelley, Darwin, Conan Doyle, Stevenson, Auden, McEwan, and Stoppard. Instructor: Gilmore. Hum/En 25. The Human Animal. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. Euro- pean literature has long been a testing ground for radical new ideas which have come to shape our basic understanding of what it means to be a thinking, speaking and perhaps even autonomous human being. The question of what - if anything - makes us different from animals was debated from numerous points of view: including talking dogs, phi - losophizing women, bestial men, humanlike beasts, and other creatures that defied the conventions of the time. This course explores some of the key literary texts that shaped this debate and pays careful attention to their cultural environments. Selected readings from Cervantes, La Fontaine, Swift, Rousseau, Buffon, Aikin, and Humanities648 CoursesHum/En 26. What Is Imagination? 9 units (3-0-6); third term. Albert Ein - stein once said that imagination is everything, and even more important than knowledge. This course invites you to think about - and use - your imagination as we explore how the act of imagining has been viewed over time in the service of memory and creativity, in both the arts and the sciences. Readings will focus on the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and will include Hume, Moritz, Kant, Novalis, offered 2021-2022. Hum/En 27. Literature and the Problem of Belief. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. \"On a huge hill, / Cragged and steep, Truth stands, and he that will / Reach her, about must and about must go.\" In this verse, John Donne captures the difficult and circling pursuit of truth, the mixed experience of belief: it is at once a knowing and an unknowing. By tracing this pursuit through the writings of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, we can explore how writers discovered belief and grappled with doubt, what inspiration they claimed and how they reckoned with failures of vision as they moved through a world increasingly filled with claims and contra - dictions of the spirit. In our own pursuit of the experience of belief, we shall read the prose and poetry of Margery Kempe, Montaigne, Herbert, Hutchinson, Milton, Defoe, Instructor: Koch. Not offered 2021-2022. 28. Kings and Popish Plots: Literature in Revolu - tionary England. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. On January 30, 1649, the king of England, Charles I, was executed in front of his royal palace following nearly a decade of civil war. The killing of the king was the most traumatic of a series of political crises in England, from the divorce of Henry VIII to the Glorious Revolution, from fabricated 'popish' plots to conflicts over succession, from wars of religion to the emergence of political parties. In this course, we will study England's response to these moments of political trauma, asking questions and developing tools that might also equip us as we seek to understand and respond to similar crises in our own age. How did the death of a king change political structures and ideas about revolution, freedom, and toleration? What role did acts of public mourning and forgiveness play in healing the nation? How were these traumatic events imagined, remembered, and appropriated in literary texts, diaries, sermons, paintings, and monuments? As we study this age of revolution, we will read some of the most important works of English literature by writers such as Shake - speare and Spenser, Milton and Marvell, Hutchinson and Behn. Instruc - tor: Koch. Hum/En 29. Dream Narratives. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. Dream narratives reveal as much about cultural beliefs and superstitions as they do about techniques of narration and interpretation. This course investigates key developments in the literature on dreams and dream interpretations with examples drawn from the Renaissance through the beginning of the nineteenth century. Selected readings from Boccaccio, Descartes, Calder\u00f3n, Shakespeare, and Diderot, among others. Instruc - tor: Holland. Not offered 2021-2022.649 Hum/En 30. Reading Animals. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. In this course we will look closely at representations of nonhuman animals in literature from the nineteenth century to the present as opportunities to revisit definitions of, and the boundaries created and blurred between, the \"human\" and the \"animal.\" Readings may include Darwin, Wells, Kafka, Herriman, Moore, Coetzee, Kelly, Myles, and Emezi. Instructor: Hill. Hum/En 31. Introduction to Black Literature and Culture in the United States. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. As both a celebration and remembrance of Black expressive thought, this course will serve as an introduction to Black literature and culture across several US geograph - ic regions from the standpoint of a variety of intersectional identities and experiences. This course centers on how the artistic, cultural, and literary lives of Black people have shaped US economic, political, and social history since the eighteenth century. In addition to literary texts, this course will introduce students to several examples of cultural ex - pression that have also become beloved touchstones in Black cultural history. Because literary works and works of cultural expression by Black people have long informed the possibilities of American artistic expression and critical thought even before the US became a nation, they provide possible blueprints for how US national life might unfold in the future. Students will learn to apply several existing contexts and methodologies for the study of Black literature and culture, propose directions for future study, and explore their own unique possibilities for deepening their relationships to this body of work. Instructor: Murphy. Hum/En 33. Modern Metamorphoses. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. Narratives of metamorphosis have traditionally used their dramatic sub - ject matter\u2014a radical change of form\u2014as a vehicle for social criticism. This course explores the ways in which twentieth-century writers experi - ment with the concept of metamorphosis to take on the most pressing political and social issues of their day, including slavery, women's rights, and critiques of capitalist excess. Readings to include Kafka, Gar nett, Orwell, Tawada, and Erpenbeck. Instructor: Holland. Not offered Hum/En 34. Literature and Deception. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. In this course, we will be considering lying and other types of deception from the point of view of literature and philosophy, with two main goals in mind: 1) to compare cultural practices of deception at various times in European history and 2) to think in general terms about the ability of a literary text to convey truth and falsehood. Can a fictional text be \"true\" in any meaningful sense, such as a political one? Or, as many people have thought over time, is it more accurate to think about literature as a beautiful lie? Readings will include the legend of Till Eulenspiegel as well as texts by Machiavelli, Shakespeare, Diderot, and those relating to the Ossian controversy. Instructor: Holland. Hum/En 36. American Literature and Culture. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. Studies of American aesthetics, genres, and ideas from the birth of the nation to the present. Students will be introduced to the tech - Humanities650 Coursesniques of formal analysis. We will consider what constitutes evidence in relation to texts and how to develop a persuasive interpretation. Topics may include Nature's Nation, slavery and its aftermath, individualism and the marketplace, the \"New Woman,\" and the relation between word and image. Instructor: Weinstein. Hum/Pl 39. Ancient Greek Philosophy. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. An- cient Greek philosophy is not only the root of philosophy but of science in general. One of the most influential texts of this time is Plato' s Repub - lic, in which Plato gives his views on almost all aspects of philosophical inquiry from metaphysics to political philosophy. The Republic is still one of the best introductions to ancient philosophy, and it is surprisingly ac - cessible, also because it is written as a dialogue. We will be reading this text in detail and apply Plato's thought to current problems in philoso - phy. Instructor: Hubert. Hum/Pl 40. Right and Wrong. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. This course addresses questions such as: Where do our moral ideas come from? What justifies them? How should they guide our conduct, as individu - als and as a society? What kind of person should one aspire to be? Topics the course may deal with include meta-ethical issues (e.g., What makes an action right or wrong? When is one morally responsible for one's actions? How should society be organized?) and normative questions (e.g., Is eating meat morally acceptable? What should we tolerate and why? What are society's obligations toward the poor?). In addition, the psychological and neural substrates of moral judgment and decision making may be explored. The course draws on a variety of sources, including selections from the great works of moral and political philosophy (e.g., Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics, Hobbes's Leviathan, Kant's Groundings for a Metaphysics of Morals, and Rawls's A Theory of Justice), contemporary discussions of particular moral issues, and the science of moral thought. Instructor: Quartz. Hum/Pl 41. Knowledge and Reality. 9 units (3-0-6); first, second terms. The theme of this course is the scope and limitations of rational belief and knowledge. Students will examine the nature of reality, the nature of the self, the nature of knowledge, and how we learn about the natural world. Students will be introduced to these issues through selec - tions from some of the world's greatest philosophical works, including Descartes's Meditations, Pascal's Pens\u00e9es, Hume's Enquiry Concern - ing Human Understanding, Berkeley's Principles of Human Knowledge, and Kant's Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics. A variety of more contemporary readings will also be assigned. Instructors: Eberhardt, Hitchcock. Hum/Pl 43. Meaning in Life. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. Experienc - ing one's life as meaningful is important for most people. Yet, what is it for a life to be meaningful? This course explores philosophical inquiries into meaning in life, examining such questions as, how does meaning in life relate to moral, epistemic, aesthetic, and hedonic final values in life? What does meaning in life imply regarding the metaphysics of value? 651 What is the relation between meaning and welfare, achievement, and goal-directedness? What sort of activities, from work to leisure, can be sources of meaning in life? Drawing principally on recent work in analytic philosophy, the course will also examine whether scientific ap - proaches, principally neuroscience and psychology, can illuminate the nature of meaning in life and will examine recent nihilistic challenges to meaning in life. Instructor: Quartz. Not offered 2021-2022. Hum/Pl 44. Philosophy Through Science Fiction. 9 units (3-0-6); third term. This course will provide a broad introduction to philosophy using examples from science fiction to make abstract philosophical problems vivid. Topics may include: time travel and the reality of the past and future; teleportation and what makes someone the same person over time; fictional tales of extended deception and Cartesian skepticism; futuristic utopias and the question of what make a life good; the moral status of aliens and animals; intelligent robots and the relation between mind and body; parallel universes and the philosophical foundations of quantum physics. Instructor: Sebens. Hum/Pl 45. Ethics & AI. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. How do we reconcile the possibilities of modern machine learning with ethical and moral demands of fairness, accountability and transparency? This course will take a case study-based approach to the challenges at the interface of algorithms and human values. By exploring existing debates on algorithmic bias, explainable AI and data ownership, students will be exposed to the relevance of ethical systems of thought to modern social questions. Instructor: Pham. Hum/Pl 46. Thinking about Climate Change. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. This course will critically examine the non-technological dimen - sions of climate change and how broadening our discussions to incor - porate these dimensions may help us effectively communicate about climate change. First, we will examine climate change as an ethical problem concerned with global distributive justice, intergenerational jus - tice, and the anthropocentric values of sustainability vs. challenges from deep ecology. We will then examine how people think about climate change and how the ways we frame climate change affects people's reactions to it, including both motivating and demotivating them to act. We will then examine how these dimensions may be incorporated into a broader understanding of climate change and how this may be used to develop strategies for effectively communicating about climate change. Instructor: Quartz. Not offered 2021-2022. Hum/VC 48. Ways of Seeing. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. \"The knowledge of photography is just as important as that of the alphabet,\" wrote artist L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy in 1928. \"The illiterate of the future,\" he warned, \"will be the person ignorant of the use of the camera as well as the pen.\" Almost a century later, this pronouncement rings as true as ever in a world so profoundly shaped not just by photography but also films, advertisements, and video games, cartoons and comics, molecular graphics and visual models. In this course we will explore how visual Humanities652 Coursesculture shapes our lives and daily experiences, and we will learn to find wonder in its rich details. In doing so, we will develop the visual literacy that Moholy-Nagy envisioned: essential skills in reading, analyzing, dis - cussing, and writing about visual materials and their circulation through the physical and virtual networks that structure our world. Instructor: Jacobson. Hum/VC 49. Consuming Victorian Media. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Proliferating communication and entertainment media technolo - gies in 19th-century England vexed the imagined boundaries between humans and machines while catalyzing social anxieties about aesthet - ics, attention, and distraction. We will explore both \"old\" (novels, paint - ings, sculptures) and \"new\" forms of 19th-century media (telegraphs, magic lanterns, and photography) as we analyze overly stimulating Gothic print media in Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey, Wordsworth's contempt for popular entertainments in The Prelude, and the inversion of imperial consumption in Bram Stoker's Dracula, a novel mediated through characters' telegrams, diary entries, and phonographic record - ings. Authors studied also may include: Dickens, Christina Rossetti, Doyle, Kipling, and Vernon Lee. Instructor: Sullivan. Hum/VC 50. Introduction to Film. 9 units (3-0-6); first, third terms. This course examines the historical development of film as a popular art and entertainment medium from the 1880s to the present, with a focus on the American and European contexts. Students will learn how to watch a film \u2014 they will learn how to pay attention to significant visual details and to understand the ways that films construct meaning from a language of im - ages \u2014 and will develop the skills to write fluently about what they see. The course covers some of the most influential genres and movements from the earliest actuality films, through the French New Wave, to the Disney/Marvel Universe. Films covered may include short films from the Edison Studio and Charlie Chaplin, M, The Seven Samurai , The Battle of Algiers and Iconoclasm. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. How does something - an image, a person, a thing, an idea - become iconic? Drawing from the worlds of art and film, advertising and PR, science and technology, politics and propaganda, this course explores what makes certain people, places, and things \"icons.\" To do so, we will first deploy a range of methods for closely analyzing images as signs and symbols, in - cluding the practice art historians term \"iconology.\" We will then examine histories of how objects have circulated through culture - from news - papers and magazines to postcards, jpegs, and memes - and thereby become ubiquitous features of everyday experience. Finally, we will consider iconoclasm, the destruction of icons, and the beliefs and logics behind powerful interdictions against visual representation. Students will leave the course with a stronger understanding of image power as well as foundational tools of visual and media literacy. Instructor: Jacobson. Hum/VC 52. The Legacy of the Mexican School in Black and Latino Artistic Imaginaries. 9 units (3-0-6); first term. Artists in the United 653 States greatly admired the Mexican muralists and printmakers of the 20th century. Respected as much for their cultural politics as their artworks, the Mexican School attracted generations of Black and Latino artists who visited, studied and worked in Mexico. In the legends and practices of the Mexican School, American artists found models for generating self-defined cultural and artistic practices unavailable to them in the United States. This international exchange ultimately generated a transnational aesthetic tradition of resistance to Euro-American coloniza - tion. This course begins with an introduction to the major debates of Mexican printmaking and muralism; follows Mexican and U.S. artists as they travel between the respective countries throughout the first half of the 20th century; and concludes with the legacy of the Mexican School on contemporary Black and Latinx public art practices.

Prerequisite: NB/Bi/CNS 150 or instructor's permis - sion. Emotions are at the forefront of most human endeavors. Emotions aid us in decision-making (gut feelings), help us remember, torment us, yet have ultimately helped us to survive. Over the past few decades, we have begun to characterize the neural systems that extend from primi - tive affective response such as fight or flight to the complex emotions experienced by humans including guilt, envy, empathy and social pain. This course will begin with an in-depth examination of the neuro - biological systems that underlie negative and positive emotions and move onto weekly discussions, based on assigned journal articles that highlight both rudimentary and complex emotions. The final weeks will be devoted to exploring how the neurobiological systems are disrupted in affective disorders including anxiety, aggression and psychopathy. In addition to these discussions and readings, each student will be required to write a review paper or produce a short movie on a topic related to one of the emotions discussed in these seminars and its underlying neural mechanisms.

This course examines surveillance, one of the defining features of twenty-first-century life, with wide-ranging implications (from intelligence gathering and biometrics to social media and contemporary art), and a key point of intersection between modern technology and visual culture. Though it applies more broadly, the concept of \"surveillance,\" from the Latin vigilare (\"to watch\") and the French surveiller (\"to watch over\"), originated in practices of looking and observation that still define many of its most significant practices today. Building on these etymological roots, we will treat sur - veillance as, first and foremost, a visual practice and survey the longer history of surveillance (and counter-surveillance) techniques as well as the theories that have emerged to describe its social effects, moral and ethical stakes, and changing legal status. Instructor: Jacobson. En/VC 135. Dickens's London. 9 units (3-0-6). Four course description, see English. VC 150. Art Museum Futures. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. The late 1960s saw the beginning of a movement in which several generations of artists investigated and deconstructed the customs and institutions of art. Institutional critique, as it would come to be known, challenged the prom - ises and putative neutrality of public art museums. Following several decades of criticism the question remains unanswered: can the public art museum become a democratic institution? This course explores the on - going debates around race, ethnicity, objectivity, subjectivity and cultural authority in contemporary museology. We will begin with the Enlighten - ment origins of the European art museum and its deployment within the United States; we will consider the artistic interventions that exposed its biases and eurocentrism, as well as the emergence of culturally-specific arts institutions and contemporary efforts at decolonization. Relying on decolonial and ethnic studies scholars, we will develop a critical frame - work for understanding the historical pathways that led to the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the upcoming Latino Smithsonian Museum. We will conclude with a deep dive into a radical museum model: Noah Purifoy's \"Outdoor Desert Art Museum Representa - tions. 9 units (3-0-6). For course description, see Languages. VC 159. Los Angeles As Artwork. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. This survey introduces students to the history of Los Angeles' creative practices. Covering a broad range of environments and visual cultures, Visual Culture734 Courseswe will begin in the period before European colonization and conclude in contemporary Los Angeles. Reading the city as artwork will introduce students to an expanded field of creativity and analysis beyond the art object. To do so, we will consider enacted environments, expressive ob - jects, urban landscapes, maps, monuments, murals and photographs. The class will give special attention to how colonialism continues to haunt and form the city, as well as explore the role creative practices have played in resisting the European colonization of space, time and being. We will cover topics including civil rights, hybridization, moder - nity, public space, and the outstanding role race has played in shaping the city. Students will learn to analyze evidence within its historical and cultural context, as well as write about how space and personal experi - ence inform both artistic production and analysis.

What makes an old building, artifact, or custom \"historic\"? Which historic things are worth preserving? This course explores the aesthetic, political, social, and environmental dimensions of heritage culture. Moving from local conser - vation efforts to comparative frameworks of national and global heritage, we will examine the management of built and natural environments as it pertains to questions of narrative, values, standards of beauty, and jus - tice. From Caltech's own campus to the Watts Towers and the National Park Service, to UNESCO and the architectural legacies of the Atlantic slave trade, our class will grapple with the theories, practices, and debates of heritage conservation as they determine what gets preserved and which stories get told. Readings/viewings will be supplemented with field trips to heritage sites in Pasadena and Los Angeles. Instructors: Hori, Jurca. VC 175. The Art of Science. 9 units (3-0-6); second term. This course examines the frequent and significant encounters between what chemist/ novelist C.P. Snow famously dubbed the \"two cultures\"-the sciences and the humanities-with an emphasis on forms and practices of visual culture that blur the boundaries between science, technology, and art. What role, we will ask, have visual culture and visuality played in the construc - tion of scientific knowledge? Taking a broad historical and geographical approach, we will explore topics including representations of science and technology in the arts and popular culture; the use of photography, illus - tration, and visualization in the sciences; histories of visuality and visual devices; and the everyday visual practices of scientific inquiry.
