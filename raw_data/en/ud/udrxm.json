This highlighted the vast gap in the demand and supply of products promising spiritual healing through aromatherapy. It prompted her to set up her own firm, [Vedic Collections Private Limited](/topic/vedic-collections-private-limited), in October 2009, and Tathaastu was born. In January 2011, it was rebranded 'Tatha' as it was easier to pronounce by her international clientele. The firm started with an office at Saket, 2-4 employees and a seed capital of Rs 40 lakh, which was funded by her family. Nothing in her life had prepared Kanoria for the retail world and she had to battle several hurdles, from marketing the concept to Indian buyers to procurement of glass bottles and non-performing employees.

The company broke even in 2010-11, raking in Rs 2 crore, even as her employee count has increased to 20, including the staff at her stores and spas.

About a month ago, the company expanded its product repertoire to include a range of organic lounge clothes with ayurvedic herbs woven into the fabric's yarn, spiritual music CDs and organic teas.
