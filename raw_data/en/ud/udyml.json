This quick reference is intended to aid your day-to-day emergency room orientation process with your preceptor. This book will help guide you throughthe most common illnesses seen in the emergency depart-ment. This book does not cover basic anatomy and physiol-ogy, advanced cardiovascular life support, pediatric advanced life support, or the trauma nurse core course. The informationin this book is compiled from basic emergency room knowl-edge and the sources used are believed to be reliable. Thereare several points to take into consideration in referencing thisbook. First, all listed interventions that go beyond the Scopeof Nursing Practice should be followed as ordered by theEmergency Room (ER) Provider. Secondly, the term Providerin this book could be a physician (MD or DO), a nurse prac-titioner (NP), or a physician assistant (PA), who is qualiedto provide such ER patient care. In most cases, interventionsthat go beyond the usual Scope of Nursing Practice have beenintroduced using \" Anticipate an order to:\" followed by a listof possible Provider orders. As always, it is the responsibility ixof the nurse to check any noted medication dosages or treat- ments to ensure that all are current, recommended, and ac-cepted practice. After reading this book, you will become thejack of all illnesses, master of none. So, put on your runningshoes, keep a stash of chocolates, and when all else fails, prac-tice unreasonable happiness. One thing is for sure; just whenyou think you have seen it all, your next patient will come in. Each chapter includes a brief introduction; an outline of materials, equipment, and drugs with which you shouldbecome familiar; a list of diagnoses that includes defini-tions, causes, signs and symptoms, and interventions; and afeature entitled \"Fast facts in a nutshell\" that provides quicksummaries of important points or questions and answers foryour review. The end of the book includes appendices, in-cluding a list of abbreviations, Common Lab Values, and fre-quently used ER medications, that should become second na-ture to all emergency room personnel. There are two ways to use this book. Y ou can review the book cover to cover, or you can use the skills check-off sheetsin Appendix E and review the appropriate chapters. Jennifer R. Buettner, RN, CENx PREFACEAcknowledgments I could not do what I do without the support of my family, but the base of my emergency nursing foundation was builtby my rst preceptor, Linda Whitt, RN. Thank you for sharingyour wealth of knowledge and setting a prime example of atruly caring and compassionate nurse. I can't forget my secondpreceptor, Walter McCracken, RN, whose pearls of wisdomcan be found in no book. I would also like to thank all my co - workers, who have inspired and molded me into the nurse Iam today. I would like to acknowledge the work of the following in- dividuals for reviewing the manuscript RN, NP-C. Last, but not least, I would like to thank the nurse and friend who inspired me to write this book, Nichole Luns ford, RN. Above all, my faith has sustained me through all my en-deavors; I would like to thank God for all of His gifts andblessings. xiThis page intentionally left blank FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSEThis page intentionally left blank Chapter 1 Tips on Surviving ER Nursing INTRODUCTION Even if you love working in the emergency room, it can be tough at times. The emergency room is particularly stress-ful because you care for a broad spectrum of patients in afast-paced, critical environment. So, not only do you needto be extremely knowledgeable, you also need to be organ-ized, calm, and fast on your feet. Everyone knows that thenurses are the very heart of the emergency room. Y our pa-tients rely on you. But to take care of others, you rst need to take care of yourself physically, mentally, and spiritually. This chapter includes a checklist of stress symptoms and alist of simple methods for coping with those pressures. During this part of your orientation, you will learn: 1.How to recognize the symptoms of stress on the job. 2.Basic techniques you can use on the job to alleviate that stress. 1SYMPTOMS OF STRESS It is true that ER nurses are sometimes referred to as \"adren- aline junkies.\" However, one can not function on adrenalinealone. Severe stress and anxiety on the job is harmful to youand your patients. So learn to recognize the signs and symp-toms: severe muscle tension, fatigue, irritability, flight or ghtresponse, tachycardia, tachypnea, weakness, sweating, feel-ing helpless, angry, tearful, urinary urgency, diarrhea, drymouth, insomnia, difculty in problem solving, feeling over-whelmed, and decreased appetite. Fast facts in a nutshell To take care of others, you first need to take care ofyourself. TECHNIQUES FOR RELIEVING STRESS 1. Take a moment, close your eyes and take some deep cleansing breaths. Breathe in through your nose as youcount to ve. Then exhale slowly through your mouth asyou count to ve, and that's it. Breathing exercises in-crease oxygen to your brain and are a fast, simple way torelieve stress anytime, anywhere. 2. Stay hydrated. Keep a water bottle with you at work. Stay- ing hydrated is an easy way to stay healthy.2 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSE3. Focus on the positives. When you have a complaint, spend your energy nding a solution rather than complaining. Y ou need all the energy you can get, so use it to resolvestressful problems. 4. Leave your work at work, and your home life at home. Di- vide and conquer your stressors. 5. Listen to upbeat energizing music on the way to work so that the melody will repeat itself in your head all day.\"Whistle while you work.\" Singing or humming is a goodway to relieve stress. 6. Keep a stash of darkchocolates: they are actually a source of energy and antioxidants. Dark chocolate not only boostsyour immune system, it seems to make people happy. Itworks well on any grumpy coworkers too, so don't forgetto share. 7. Introduce yourself to patients when you enter a room. Keeping the patient informed of who you are and whatyou are going to be doing relieves their stress. 8. Wear a well-made and comfortable pair of shoes. Eight to 12 hours of painful swollen feet will only add to yourstress. 9. Recognize that it is perfectly normal to feel anxious dur- ing a code (e.g., cardiac/pulmonary arrest). Only timeand training will help you cope with the anxiety felt whenperforming advanced cardiovascular life supportive treat-ments. 10. Do not think or act as if you know it all. Medicine is con- stantly changing. No matter how much emergency roomexperience you have, you can still learn something newevery day.TIPS ON SURVIVING ER NURSING 311. Keep the following in your pocket every day: trauma shears, hemostats, tape, pen, calculator (with list of emer- gency room intravenous drips and doses taped to back)and this book. Being prepared will reduce stress andanxiety. 12. Invest in a good pair of support hose and do leg exercises. Most nurses develop varicose veins. It is hard to takegood care of your patients when your legs ache and havepoor circulation. 13. Ask or look up any medications about which you are unsure. There are numerous medication routes and dosesto memorize. Looking them up or asking will help youlearn them and keep your patients safe and free of med-ication errors. 14. Keep your uniforms clean, to save you the hassle from having to buy new scrubs frequently. Wash out betadineor benzoic stains on your scrubs with rubbing alcohol.Pour hydrogen peroxide on any blood spots on youruniform, and let foam for a minute. Then wash with soapand water. 15. Have a sense of humor even if it seems unreasonable. You won't survive without one. Laughter is often the bestmedicine. 17. Avoid gossip. If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. We are all on the same team. We needto build each other up, not tear each other down. 18. Increase your emergency room knowledge. Join the Emer- gency Nurses Association, sign up for emergency room-related courses, and study from a CEN review book. In-creasing your knowledge base is key for better patientcare.4 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSE19. Maintain liability insurance on yourself. It is inexpensive and almost everyone that works in the emergency room, at some point, gets sued. Liability insurance is a simpleway to protect yourself. 20. Document, Document, Document! How was the patient when he/she came in? Stable? Pink? Warm? Dry? Anydistress? Chart on your nonurgent patient at least everyhour; on a critical patient, every 5 to 10 minutes. Chartwhen you assumed care of the patient. Document howthey were when they left the emergency room (e.g., am-bulatory, stable, no acute distress) and reassess ABCs. Fast facts in a nutshell Maintain liability insurance on yourself. Document, Document, Document! Fast facts in a nutshell: summary Emergency nursing is not for everyone. It can be indescrib-ably hard at times. But if you practice these simple stress-relieving techniques you will be able to survive whatever theemergency room throws at you. If you can make it throughthe tough times, you'll survive long enough to nd out justhow rewarding emergency room nursing can be. After all,that is why you chose this profession.TIPS ON SURVIVING ER NURSING 5This page intentionally left blank 7Chapter 2 Acid-Base Imbalances INTRODUCTION The body requires a delicate balance of acids and bases to maintain natural homeostasis. Many life-threatening illnesses affect the acid-base balance. Therefore, recognizingany acid-base imbalance is crucial to saving someone's life.As a nurse in the emergency room, you will come across acid-base imbalances daily. Many new and experienced nursesnd acid-base balance difcult to understand. After review-ing this chapter and learning the three simple steps pro-vided, you will find it much easier to remember how to interpret test results. Understanding the pathophysiology and reviewing many laboratory results are key to betterunderstanding acid-base imbalances. During this part of your orientation, locate and become familiar with: 1.Arterial blood gas procedures and results. 2.Diabetic ketoacidosis insulin, sodium bicarbonate, potassium, and dextrose. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Acid-base balance is controlled by two organ systems. Respiratory System Y ou breathe in oxygen (O2) and breathe out carbon dioxide (CO2). In the bloodstream CO2mixes with H2O (water) to make (H2CO3) carbonic acid. Renal System H2CO3dissociates into a base (HCO3-) and an acid (H+) that are excreted by the kidneys. Recognizing an Imbalance An easy way to remember if your patient has a respiratory or metabolic imbalance shown in Table 2.1 is this simplemnemonic.*Mnemonic for pH/bicarbonate directions in acidosis versusalkalosis, remember ROME * *Respiratory is Opposite, Metabolic is Equal*8 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSEACID-BASE IMBALANCES 9 TABLE 2.1 Determining Acid-Base Imbalances Respiratory 35-45, Normal HCO3-= 22-26 The arrows in Table 2.1 for respiratory pH and PaCO2are in opposite directions from each other, and the arrows for meta- bolic pH and bicarbonate are equal or in the same direction. Fast facts in a nutshell 1. Acid-base balance is controlled by the respiratory and renal systems. DIAGNOSES Every acid-base imbalance is described using three words,such as: Uncompensated Respiratory Acidosis. To determinewhich imbalance your patient has, follow these three simplesteps. Table 2.1 provides a visual guide of these steps.1. Look at the pH. If it is normal (7.35-7.45) it is compen- sated. If it is out of range it is uncompensated. 2. A pH below 7.35 is acidosis. A pH above 7.45 is al - kalosis. 3. Look at PaCO2and HCO3-. Abnormal PaCO2= respira- tory. Abnormal HCO3-= metabolic. If both are abnormal it is both respiratory and metabolic. Respiratory Acidosis In respiratory acidosis, pH is less than 7.35 because of in- adequate ventilations. Poor ventilation causes one to retainCO 2. Poor ventilations also lead to poor oxygenation. That means oxygen cannot get in, and CO2cannot get out. CO2 builds up, mixes with H2O, resulting in carbonic acid (H2CO3). Bicarbonate (HCO3-) is normal. This patient is at risk for hypoxia. 1.Causes: upper airway obstruction; mechanical ventilation; pulse oxygen;monitor cardiac rhythm; and obtain an intravenous access.10 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSEFast facts in a nutshell Question: What supplies are needed to intubate a patient? Answer: High flow oxygen, suction, ambu bag, size tube, 10-ml syringe of air, appro-priate blades working handle, CO 2de- tector, tape or endotracheal tube securing device, placement. _______________________________ _________________________________________________ __________________ Respiratory Alkalosis In respiratory alkalosis, pH is greater than 7.45. When a person hyperventilates, he/she blows off all of his/her CO2. There is no CO2left to mix with H2O to make carbonic acid salicylate adult third trimester pregnancy; and fever. 2.Signs and hyper - ventilation. 3.Interventions: encourage slow deep breathing; correct un- der lying condition; provide fluids intravenously; and rect hyperventilation without treatment: put oxygen nonrebreather mask over the patient's face and leave turned off. (Itworks like than 7.35 due to a decrease in (bicarbonate) HCO3-or increase in H+ion. PaCO2is starvation; shock sepsis; and loss of bicarbonate in severe diarrhea. 2.Signs and symptoms: altered mental er's); treatment may include FOR THE ER NURSEate, intravenous dextrose and intravenous regular insulin (to put potassium back in cells); assist ventilations; moni-tor cardiac rhythm; and perform basic metabolic panel. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) Diabetic keoacidosis is a state of metabolic acidosis that is theresult of elevated blood sugar (greater than 300). When theblood sugar is this high, the body does not have sufcient in-sulin to break down sugar for energy. To compensate, the bodybreaks down fat, thereby releasing toxic ketone acids. 1.Causes: uncontrolled blood sugar in diabetes mellitus. 2.Signs and symptoms: dry, flushed skin; serum glucose consciousness; and coma. 3.Interventions: obtain and monitor blood sugar every hour; monitor acetone level; check arterial blood gases; performbasic metabolic panel and urinalysis; normal saline bolus; medicate fornausea give insulin (rst, 5 to 10 unitsof regular intravenous push, and then 0.1 units per kilogram per hour by intravenous fusion on a pump).Once the patient's blood sugar is below 250, change fromintravenous to subcutaneous insulin per the provider's or-der. Then also (D 5 1/2NS)ACID-BASE IMBALANCES 13at a rate of 150 to 200 ml per hour per the provider's or- der. Prepare for possible intensive care unit admission. Once you replace fluids be prepared for urinary fre- quency. Provide urinals, Foley cath, or bedpans. 7.45 due to el- evated HCO3-or decreased H+. PaCO2is normal. 1.Causes: loss of stomach acid associated with vomiting; in- gesting too many alkali substances (antacids, suctioning, administer normalsaline intravenously, perform basic metabolic panel(BMP), provide potassium supplements for hypokalemia,monitor cardiac performance and respirations.14 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSEACID-BASE IMBALANCES 15 Fast facts in a nutshell Question: Before your patient has an arterial blood gas drawn, what test should be performed? Answer: Allen's Test. Question: A 29-year-old diabetic female arrives who has dried skin, is flushed, is hot, and has Kussmaul's respi-rations. What is the underlying illness?Answer: Diabetic ketoacidosis\u2014check her blood sugar. Question: Y our patient is diagnosed with ketoacidosis. What should initial management include?Answer: Administering regular insulin intravenously or subcutaneously, followed by an insulin intravenous drip. Question: How often should you check blood sugars on a patient receiving an insulin intravenous drip?Answer: Every hour.

Learn the steps provided in this chap-ter so you will be able to accurately interpret test results.17Chapter 3 Cardiovascular Emergencies INTRODUCTION In the emergency room, cardiovascular diseases are an everyday life-threatening occurrence. However, with proper assessment and fast treatment, cardiac diseases are resolved every day in emergency rooms across the coun- try. After studying this chapter, you will have a basic un- derstanding of cardiovascular assessments and treatments.This chapter does not replace electrocardiogram courses orthe advanced cardiovascular life support certication re-quired to work in the emergency room. Many nurses nd keeping an advanced cardiovascular life support hand-book for study is very helpful. During this part of your orientation, locate and become familiar with: 1.Electrocardiograms and supplies. 2.Advanced cardiovascular life support and electrocardio- gram courses available to you.3.Cardiac monitors, debrillators, and pacers. and norepinephrine. DIAGNOSES Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) In congestive heart failure, the heart fails to pump blood ef- fectively. As a result, blood backs up. It can back up to the body(right-sided congestive heart failure) or the lungs (left-sidedcongestive heart failure). 1.Causes: Other illnesses can, over time, lead to congestive heart failure. These include hypertension; arrhythmias; di- asordered (e.g., morphine, and nitroglycerin)18 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSECARDIOVASCULAR EMERGENCIES 19 Provide Foley catheter, bedside commode, or bedpan for frequent urination after furosemide. Fast facts in a nutshell Question: Which patient position is best to hear S3 (ventricular the result of a clogged coro- nary artery supplying blood to the heart muscle. The patient'shistory often reveals hypertension, coronary artery disease,high cholesterol, and smoking (see Figure 3.1). 1.Causes: blood clots; coronary arterial spasm from shortness of breath; and chest pain (described often asFigure 3.1 CARDIOVASCULAR EMERGENCIES 21 pressure, squeezing, tightness, or vague) that may radiate to the left shoulder or jaw. 3.Interventions: MOVE*!! (Monitor, Oxygen, Venous access, and EKG); anticipate orders to: administer medications MONA (morphine, oxygen, nitro SL, and ASA), obtain car- diac enzymes, arrange for chest X-ray, prepare for possiblecardiac cath lab admission or thrombolytic or anticoagu-lant (heparin) therapy, and reassess/monitor chest pain. Fast facts in a nutshell Question: What factors absolutely contraindicate the use of thrombolytics?Answer: Active bleeding, recent surgery, or recent trauma. Question: What test should be done prior to or thrombolytics?Answer: Hemoccult Answer: Protamine sulfate. Question: A patient allergic to shellsh might also be al- pulse to the affected extremity. 3.Interventions: maintain extremity in dependent position; assess pulses __________________ Endocarditis Endocarditis is an infection to the inner lining of the heart and/or the heart valves. 1.Causes: Endocarditis occurs when a person with faulty heart valves contracts a common bacterial infection. For exam- ple, a bacterial infection in their skin can travel throughthe blood and attach to the faulty heart valve, resulting inendocarditis. 2.Signs and symptoms: chills; fever; splinter beds; chest pain; and systolic murmur.22 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSE3.Interventions: administer antibiotics intravenously; obtain blood cultures and a complete count. Notes:_________________________ ____________________ _______________________________ _________________________________________________ __________________ Aortic Injuries the ascending aorta, aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, or abdominal aorta.The injuries can result in aneurysm, tear, or rupture. There isnever enough time to repair a ruptured aorta. Without im-mediate surgery the patient can bleed to death rapidly. So itis critical for the nurse to identify an aortic injury early. 1.Causes: A history of aortic injuries may reveal hyperten - sion; coronary artery disease; congestive heart failure; or a recent chest/abdominal trauma. 2.Signs and symptoms (may vary depending on location): hy- potension; loss of consciousness; hypertension in upperextremities; stronger pulse in arms than legs; tearing chestpain that radiates to the back; tearing abdominal pain;chest wall ecchymosis; and paraplegia. 3.Interventions: get patient on a stretcher; obtain vital signs; check blood pressure in all extremities; notify provider of patient signs and symptoms immediately; prepare forimmediate surgery; start two large-bore intravenous lines;CARDIOVASCULAR EMERGENCIES 2324 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSE monitor cardiac performance; provide oxygen; perform elec- trocardiogram; and measure pulse oxygen. Fast facts in a nutshell Question: Which type of trauma most commonly causes a descending thoracic aortic laceration?Answer: Symptomatic Bradycardia Symptomatic bradycardia is a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute resulting in inadequate blood circulation. The patientis symptomatic, displaying signs of poor cardiac perfusion (seeFigure 3.2). 1.Causes: The cause is not always known but underlying conditions such as coronary artery disease; heart disease; second or third degree heart blocks; hypertension; thyroiddisease; and lung disease can contribute to bradycardia. 2.Signs and symptoms: heart rate lower than 60; patient looks and feels unwell (e.g., altered loss of consciousness, chestpain, diaphoretic, pale).3.Interventions: assess ABCs; provide moni- tor cardiac performance; anticipate orders to: intravenouslypush 0.5 to 1.0 mg of atropine at 3 to 5 minute intervals,establish transcutaneous pacing, administer medications(dopamine or epinephrine), __________________ Supraventricular T achycardia (SVT) In supraventricular tachycardia, the heart rate is regular but it beats at more than 150 beats per minute. Supraventriculartachycardia can be divided into symptomatic/unstable (patientCARDIOVASCULAR EMERGENCIES 25 Figure 3.2 Figure 3.3 looks unwell) or asymptomatic/stable (patient looks ne). See Figure 3.3. 1.Causes: The cause is not always known. However, some habits and conditions can contribute to it, such as stress; caffeine; smoking; cocaine use; - tive pulmonary disease; and pneumonia. Some medica-tions for asthma, cold medications, and digoxin can alsocontribute anxiety; and pulse rate greater than 150. 3.Interventions:A.If patient is symptomatic and unstable: anticipate order to: prepare for immediate synchronized cardioversion(100 j, 200 j, 300 j, 360 j, or biphasic equivalent). B.If patient is asymptomatic and stable: anticipate orders attempt maneuvers, monitor cardiac per-formance, open large-bore intravenous line, provideoxygen, check vital signs, measure pulse oxygen, per-form electrocardiogram, administer adenosine rapidlyby intravenous push, beta blockers/calcium channelblockers/digoxin or amiodarone. Give patient a coffee straw and ask them to blow through it to assist vagal maneuvers. Notes:_________________________ ____________________ Ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia are both irregular rapid rhythms in which there is no pulse.See Figure 3.4 and Table 3.1. 1.Causes: Poor cardiac perfusion due to assess ABCs; open airway; assist breathing through bag valve mask or endotracheal tube; begin chestcompressions while applying cardiac monitor/debrillationCARDIOVASCULAR EMERGENCIES 29 TABLE 3.1 Pulseless Ventricular T achycardia or Ventricular Fibrillation Treatment 1) Shock j Biphasic or 360 j Monophasic CPR 30/2 \u00d7 5 cycles or 2 min Epinephrine 1 mg or Vasopressin 40 u IV/IO during CPR 2) Shock at 200 j Biphasic or 360 j Monophasic CPR 30/2 or 360 j Monophasic CPR 30/2 \u00d7 5 cycles 2 1-2 g IV/IO for Torsades de Pointes30 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSE pads; and DEFIBRILLATE! Just remember, shock then car- diopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and EVeryone Stay CALM CPR, Amio- darone or Lidocaine, and Magnesium. Fast facts in a nutshell Question: If none of the above interventions work, what are some other causes of ventricular brillation?Answer: hypothermia, Question: Y ou see ventricular brillation on the monitor, but your patient is asymptomatic, sitting up, and talk-ing to you. What is your rst intervention?Answer: Check for a pulse. Y ou can't believe everything you see on a monitor; it could be artifact. Question: What is the maximum number of times one can safely debrillate a patient?Answer: There is no limit. Question: Why do we debrillate? Answer: To temporarily produce asystole. This may sound incorrect, but debrillation actually depolarizes the heart,allowing the natural pacemakers of the heart to in. Question: Do precordal thumps work? Answer: Precordal thumps sometimes work and sometimes do not work. If you witness a true pulseless ventricular tachy-CARDIOVASCULAR EMERGENCIES 31 cardia/ventricular brillation, it only takes a second to ad- minister precordal thumps while yelling for help. Pulseless electrical activity occurs when a rhythm shows on the monitor, but the patient does not have a pulse. Again, youcan't always believe what you see on the monitor. 1.Causes: can be attributed to the 5 Hs or 5 Ts. Hypovolemia, Hypoxia, Hydrogen ion Thrombosis, and Trauma 2.Signs and symptoms: Y our patient has no pulse, but there is a rhythm on the monitor. Remember that just because there is electrical activity in the heart doesn't mean theheart is actually pumping. 3.Interventions: Check ABCs; perform cardiopulmonary re- suscitation; per order, insert an intravenous line, moni-tor oxygen, administer medications (e.g., epinephrine andatropine).32 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSE Fast facts in a nutshell Question: What is the effect of Nipride (nitroprusside) administered intravenously? Answer: It reduces afterload and increases cardiac output. It decreases myocardial oxygen demand without affectingthe heart rate. Question: What type of electrocardiogram changes might you see in a patient with a potassium level of 7.8?Answer: bradycardia, peaked T waves, and widened QRS complex. Question: What equation denes cardiac output? Answer: heart rate \u00d7stroke Question: What the digoxin toxi- city?Answer: blurred vision, halos, and of lidocaine should be adminis- tered to patients with renal failure, liver failure or pa-tients who are elderly?Answer: Give half doses of lidocaine in patients with renal failure, liver failure, or who are elderly.Question: What is the antidote for Notes:_________________________ thromboplastin time (PTT). Warfarin (Coumadin) affects prothrombin time (PT). Fast facts in a nutshell: summary Although cardiovascular diseases threaten lives every day,they can often be resolved with quick treatment. An emer-gency room nurse needs to understand the basics of cardio-vascular assessments and treatments and be certified inadvanced cardiovascular life support.CARDIOVASCULAR EMERGENCIES 33This page intentionally left blank Chapter 4 Disaster Response Emergencies INTRODUCTION Working in the emergency department automatically makes you a rst responder during a local disaster. Therefore, it isvital to know your role, communicate effectively, and locateequipment quickly. Disasters can be divided into two cate-gories: natural and man-made. This chapter opens with thedenitions, categories, and interventions for disasters. Manynurses may nd remembering disaster instructions difcultbecause, quite simply, they are rarely used. Never fear. Justlearn these three helpful mnemonics to remember what todo: Disaster, MASS, and IDME. Then, the chapter guides you through some of the most common radiological, chem-ical, and biological exposures. Again, you may nd it chal-lenging to remember information that is used so infrequently,so just keep this book and the CDC Web site handy. Thosetwo sources will provide all the information you need. Tofully understand the material and ease your anxiety, be sureto practice an actual disaster drill in your facility duringyour orientation. 3536 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSE During this part of your orientation, locate and become familiar with: 1.Y our facility's disaster plans. 2.Y our facility equipment. 4.Fire alarms and extinguishers. 5.Oxygen shut-off valves. 6.Evacuation plans and routes. 7.Contacts/whom to notify if a disaster occurs. 8.Where to sign up to participate in a disaster drill. 9.Disaster communication routes. 10.Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). TYPES OF DISASTERS A disaster is an event in which needs exceed resources. The types are indicated in Table 4.1. INTERVENTIONS To remember the proper interventions to follow in a disaster,remember the mnemonic, DISASTER, MASS, and IDME. Detect: What is the reason for the disaster. Are there masscasualties? Do our needs exceed our resources? Incident Command: People trained to manage, coordinate,and organize the disaster operation. Do we need them and,if so, where?TABLE 4.1 Types of Disasters Natural Man-Made Hurricane Explosion Earthquake Fire Landslide Firearms Ice storm/blizzard Stampede Fire Structural collapse Wildre Hazardous material Flood Power out Tidal wave Blocked communications Tornado T ransportation event Asteroid collision Airway (Plane)Avalanche Railway (T rain) Volcanic eruption Waterway (Boat) Roadway (Car) Weapons of mass destruction BiologicalC h e m i c a l NuclearDISASTER RESPONSE EMERGENCIES 37 Safe and Secure Scene: Is it safe? Always protect yourself and team members first, then the public, patients, andenvironment. Use personal protective equipment, such asgown, gloves, and masks. Assess Hazards: What are other potential hazards (for ex-ample, downed power lines, blood, smoke, leaking gas line,bad weather)?Support: What people and supplies are needed? Do we need HAZMAT team, re and rescue team, law enforcement, vehicles, water? Triage and T reatment: Do we need triage? How much treat- ment is required? Follow your facilities disaster triage plan.If your facility does not have one, you can locate one on-line through FEMA. MASS Move: Can the victims move? If so, they are less urgent. If they cannot, they are more urgent. Assess the victims who can't walk or move, as they are moreurgent and need assistance. Sort victims using IDME or your current emergency de- partment acuity scale. 1.Immediate, Emergent, or Red acuity. They have an alter- ation in ABCs or threat to loss of life or limb. 2.Delayed, Urgent, or Yellow acuity. These victims need medical attention, but they are not at risk of rapidlydeteriorating. 3.Minimal, Nonurgent, or Green. These victims have sta-ble vital signs and minor wounds. 4.Expectant or Blue. These victims have little or no chance of survival with current resources. Send: immediate victims to hospitals/OR/ICU rst.Evacuate: Can the victims be transported to a safe location and, if so, how?Recovery: What are some recovery issues?38 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSEFast facts in a nutshell To remember the proper interventions to follow in a dis- aster, remember the mnemonic, DISASTER, MASS, and IDME.

So, it is critical that you be prepared and know the plan of action for your facility. Become familiar with all availabledisaster equipment. Although this chapter should give you agood working knowledge of common forms of disasters andwhat to do, participating in disaster drills is an essential pieceof the puzzle. Be sure to routinely refresh your disaster nurs-ing skills.52 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSEChapter 5 Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) Emergencies INTRODUCTION Ear, nose, and throat emergencies are daily occurrences in the emergency room. Most of the time, they are not life-threatening. From foreign objects to trauma or infection, this chapter will take you through the most common ear,nose, and throat emergencies you will face. For each emer-gency, you will learn causes, manifestations, and inter-ventions. During this part of your orientation, you should locate and become familiar with: 1.Alligator ear curettes. 535.Head lamp. 6.Nasal packing supplies. DIAGNOSES Foreign Objects Y ou name it; it can be found in an ear or a nostril. Commonly occurs with curious young children and toddlers, but occa-sionally with adult patients. Hopefully, the object will be detected before infection occurs. Getting it out of the uncoop- erative 3-year-old patient is the real trick! 1.Causes: Foreign object in the ear, such as nuts, bolts, raisins, peas, beads, bugs, and cotton. 2.Signs and symptoms: visible foreign or swelling; redness; foul odor; and foreign body sensation. 3.InterventionsA. Remove the foreign body with suction, irrigation, alli- gator forceps, or ear curette. Provide ear antibiotics ornasal decongestants as ordered. Instruct the patientnot to put anything smaller than an elbow in his or herears or nose! B. Sometimes nasal foreign bodies can be dislodged sim- ply by closing off the unaffected nostril and asking thepatient to blow forcefully out of the affected nostril. C. If unable to remove foreign body, provider may refer pa- tient to ear, nose, and throat specialist.54 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSEEAR, NOSE , AND THROAT (ENT) EMERGENCIES 55 Fast facts in a nutshell There are many ways to flush an ear, but this seems to work the best for wax removal. 1. First, gather lukewarm water with a splash of per- oxide mixed in a small basin and a 20-ml syringe with plastic needle-less short tip. Y ou can also cut off theend of an intravenous catheter. 2. Lay the patient on his/her side with affected ear up. Fill the ear canal with warm water and peroxide so-lution and let soak for 10 minutes. Then sit patientup with basin under ear to catch fluids. Now that thewax is softened, irrigate ear canal using syringe andrest of water solution. If a brown scaly pebble comesout, this is a bacterial or fungal infection of the outer ear.1.Causes: Outer ear infections commonly occur because of frequent swimming or foreign objects in the ear. Bacteria or fungus enter with the water or the foreign object, therebycausing an infection. 2.Signs and symptoms: outer eardrop solution/antibiotics as ordered; provide ear wick; and use warm compresses. In-struct the patient not to swim until the infection is re-solved (7-10 days). Fast facts in a nutshell When examining the ear in an adult, pull upand back, in a child under three years of age, pull the ear down and back. Avulsed teeth should be placed in cold milk, ice water, or replaced in conscious patient's mouth within 30minutes. Notes:_________________________ ____________________ NURSEAcute Otitis Media Acute otitis media is a middle ear bacterial or viral infection. It is more common in children because of their short, narroweustachian tubes. An infant or toddler with otitis media mayappear irritable, be crying, pulling at ears, and have a poor ap-petite, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. 1.Causes: Middle ear infections usually start as a sinus infection. 2.Signs & symptoms: recent upper respiratory infection; ear- ache; impaired hearing; red or dull gray bulging tympanic membrane; and fever. 3.Interventions: administer and evaluate effectiveness of anti- pyretics, antibiotics, and pain medication such as Notes:_________________________ ____________________ _______________________________ _________________________________________________ __________________ Ruptured Tympanic Membrane This is a tear or rupture of the tympanic membrane (ear drum). 1.Causes: Tears may be the result of infection or trauma from a foreign object (Q-tip, bobby pin) or other forces (e.g., explosions, skull fractures, burns). 2.Signs and symptoms: ear pain; discharge; impaired hearing; vertigo; nausea, and fever.EAR, NOSE , AND THROAT (ENT) EMERGENCIES 573.Interventions: With most small perforations, the eardrum grows back on its own, similar to the way a ngernail grows back.

Don't be afraid to take an otoscope and assess yourpatient's ears, nose, or throat. Most providers appreciate agood assessment, especially one that is well documented be-fore and after treatment.65Chapter 6 Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances INTRODUCTION As you already may know, a fluid and electrolyte balance is essential to maintaining homeostasis within the body. If not treated, interruptions to this balance can be fatal.Therefore, it is vital for the emergency room nurse to recog-nize the the most common manifestations of fluid and elec-trolyte imbalances and how to correct them quickly. During this part of your orientation, locate and become familiar with: 1.Doppler machine for pedal pulses. 2.Peritoneal centesis tray and fluid containers. 3.Medications: furosemide, potassium by mouth, calcium phosphorus,magnesium. DIAGNOSES Edema Edema occurs when plasma fluid shifts into the interstitial space. There are four different types of edema based on loca-tion and injury. Pulmonary edema: fluid shifts to the lungs. 1.Causes: left-sided congestive heart failure; chest crackle breath sounds. 3.Interventions: anticipate orders to: arrange for chest X-ray, provide oxygen, and give diuretics (furosemide). Ascites: fluid shifts to the abdomen. 1.Causes: liver problems or abdominal trauma. 2.Signs and symptoms: abdominal swelling/edema. The pa- tient may also have pedal edema. 3.Interventions: anticipate patient will receive a peritoneo- centesis and other measures to correct underlying liver problems.66 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSEPedal edema: fluid shifts to the lower extremities. 1.Causes: right-sided heart failure; lower extrem- ity trauma; sodium and symptoms: and give diuretic as ordered (furosemide); assess pedal pulses; and document stage of edema. Severe burns: fluid shifts to burned areas causing localized edema.1.Causes: The body's natural response to a severe burn in- jury is swelling and fluid shift. 2.Signs and symptoms: localized edema to area of burn. 3.Interventions: volume replacement. Patient is cellular dehydration.

The process of frequent voiding, however, results in excessive loss of body fluids.74 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSEFLUID AND ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCES 75 2.Signs and symptoms: Imagine a shriveled dried-up raisin, as this is your HHNC patient. Look for warm and in urine. patients need about 9 liters of intra- venous fluids. Anticipate orders to: start with normalsaline normal saline (D5 1/2NS) once blood sugar is less than 300; administer regular insulinat 5 to 10 units intravenous push, followed by a drip of0.05 units/kg/hr until blood sugar is less than 300, moni-tor cardiac rhythm, perform electrocardiogram, checkblood sugar every hour, pre pare a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and urinalysis, replace potassium,and prepare for intensive care unit admission. Fast facts in a nutshell Note the symptom and blood sugar differences betweenhyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic coma and dia-betic ketoacidosis. Hyperglycemic nonketotic coma means that blood sugar is very high (600 to 1000s). Patient is severely dehydrated, and there are noketones in the urine. Diabetic ketoacidosis blood sugar is moderately high (300 to 600). The patient may be mildly dehydrated,and ketones are present in the urine.76 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSE Notes:_________________________ ____________________ _______________________________ _________________________________________________ __________________ Fast facts in a nutshell: summary Fluids and electrolytes play a key role in health and home- ostasis. It is critical that emergency room nurses understandthis delicate balance, as a slight disturbance in this amazingbalance can be fatal. Make sure you learn the different labvalues, for you will need them every day in evaluating a widevariety of illnesses.77Chapter 7 Gastrointestinal Emergencies INTRODUCTION The gastrointestinal system is made up of several organs, in- cluding the stomach, liver, pancreas, gallbladder, and intes-tines. Gastrointestinal emergencies can be a very messy every-day emergency room occurrence. Ruptured bowels, vomiting,diarrhea, constipation, enemas, you name it; you will see alltypes of gastro intestinal problems in the emergency room.Catching the projectile vomit in the basin is the real trick! Af-ter reviewing this chapter, you will be able to differentiate thetypes of gastrointestinal emergencies, their causes, manifes-tations, and treatments. For each patient, prepare a full gastro intestinal assessment and document it thoroughly. During this part of your orientation, locate and become familiar with: 1.Suction equipment. 2.Gastric lavage equipment and nasogastric tubes. 3.Hemoccult FOR THE ER NURSE 4.Enemas. 5.Basins, and incontinence pads or NEVER UNDERESTIMATE ABDOMINAL PAIN I once had a female patient come in by ambulance complain-ing of abdominal pain for 5 minutes. I thought it was a littlesilly to call an ambulance after just 5 minutes of pain. She washollering, wailing, and carrying on so much that I could barelyget a history. She was seen, assessed by a doctor, and X-rayedin about 15 minutes. Then she said her chest hurt. It turnedout she not only had a ruptured bowel, but she also was hav-ing an acute myocardial infarction at the same time! Boy, werewe shocked! So, although a patient may appear to be just verydramatic, never underestimate abdominal pain. Fast facts in a nutshell A patient who has vomited 20 times in the last 8 hours is at risk for metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia. After ingesting bleach, the patient has corrosive in- jury to the esophagus. Initial assessment and treat-ment should include airway management. Causes of ascites include constrictive pericarditis, cirrhosis, and peritonitis.GASTROINTESTINAL EMERGENCIES 79 The abdomen is assessed in which order? Inspection, Auscultation, Percussion, and Palpation (look, lis- ten, and feel). Sepsis is the most common problem associated with colon trauma. Notes:_________________________ ____________________ _______________________________ _________________________________________________ __________________ DIAGNOSES Gastritis Gastritis is an inflammation of the stomach lining that can be an acute or chronic condition. Chronic gastritis can lead toulcers orders to: administer fluids intra- venously, arrange for abdominal X-ray, provide blood if se- vere blood loss, prepare a complete blood count and basicmetabolic panel, and administer medications (e.g., ant-acids, gastrointestinal cocktail, histamine receptor antago-nists, and antiemetics).80 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSE Fast facts in a nutshell A gastrointestinal cocktail is made up of Maalox and belladonna (adding 10 milliliters of viscous lidocaine makes it a super gastrointestinal cocktail). Fast facts in a nutshell Question: A 36-year-old male patient complains of burning epigastric pain 1 to 2 hours after eating for 1 to2 weeks. What is your diagnosis?Answer: peptic ulcer disease. Gastroenteritis Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the stomach or small in-testine. It is often the diagnosis when the patient says, \"I thinkI have cause gastroenteritis are Nor- walk virus and Rotavirus. 2.Signs and symptoms: cramps; fever; dehydration; and hypo - volemia in the very young or very old.3.Interventions: anticipate orders to: provide fluids intra- venously, prepare a basic metabolic panel and complete blood count, administer medications (antibiotics, antipar-asitic agents), and provide patient education on a clear liq-uid and BRAT (bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast) diet. Discharge teaching should include avoiding meat and dairy products, spicy foods, alcohol, greasy foods, andacidic foods. Infants should not stop formula feeding for more than 24 hours. Recovering from nausea and vomiting is a gradual pro - cess. The patient should have nothing by mouth for anhour or so after vomiting. Then clear liquids should beintroduced in small increments (ice chips) for 24 hours,after which the patient can advance to full liquids. Thenext step is BRAT diet. Finally, the advanced diet as tol-erated. Follow this process gradually or you'll (GERD) Gastroesophageal reflux disease is commonly called acid re- flux. It occurs when excess stomach acid travels up the esoph-agus, resulting in esophagitis.GASTROINTESTINAL EMERGENCIES 811.Causes: The malfunction of the esophageal sphincter and hiatal hernia are the major causes. Contributing factors are cigarette smoking; lying down after meals; and consumingalcohol, large meals, spicy or acidic food, and caffeine. 2.Signs and symptoms: upper midsternal burning pain and indigestion. 3.Interventions: anticipate orders for: antacids and gastroin- testinal cocktail. Educate the patient to avoid fatty or friedfoods, chocolate, alcohol, and overeating. The patientshould not lie down for three hours after eating. Notes:_________________________ ____________________ _______________________________ _________________________________________________ __________________ Intestinal Obstruction This is the inability to move gastrointestinal contents through intestines. The two types of obstructions: large bowel andsmall bowel. As the nurse, you will prefer to treat the patientwith the large bowel obstruction, because nothing is comingout of either end. On the other hand, the patient with smallbowel obstruction will be vomiting and having diarrhea. Y ouwill need plenty of bedpans and NURSE2.Signs and symptoms: fever; abdominal distention; nausea and vomiting; rapid onset of abdominal pain; dehydration; weight loss or weight gain (due to fluid retention); high-pitched or absent bowel sounds; and constipation or re-cent diarrhea. 3.Interventions: anticipate orders to: arrange for abdominal CT scan or X-rays, monitor orthostatic vital signs, give nothingby mouth, administer fluids intravenously, use nasogastrictube for gastric decompression, and administer antibioticmedications. Fast facts in a nutshell Tips for nasogastric tube insertion:1. Be nice when inserting a tube down a patient's belly; use lidocaine jellyto lubricate the tip. 2. Oral anesthetic spray to the throat.3. Check placement initially by auscultating stomach, conrming that the patient is able to speak, and check-ing gastric content. 4. To help the tube curve down the nasopharynx, curl the tip of the nasogastric tube around the appendix. If it rup- tures, it could lead to peritonitis, sepsis, and then septic shock! 1.Causes: stomach virus or food particles trapped in the ap- pendix. 2.Signs and symptoms: constant dull right lower quadrant; pain (McBurney's Point; see Figure 7.1); rebound tenderness; nausea, vomiting and diarrhea/constipation;low-grade fever (usually after rst 24 hours); and manifes-tations of peritonitis (fever, guarding, abdominal pain anddistention, hypoactive bowel sounds, and diffuse rigidity).84 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSE Figure 7.1 3.Interventions: anticipate orders to: give patient nothing by mouth (NPO), administer fluids intravenously, prepare a complete blood count, arrange for an abdominal CTscan, give antibiotics, and prepare for surgery. A patient sent to surgery should be wearing only a gown. No body jewelry in unusual places, no hearing aids, no dentures, no hairpins, result of an increase in pancreatic enzymes. Whether it is caused by overproduction or obstruction, the enzymeserode or eat away the pancreatic tissues. Pancreatitis can spreadto the liver, diaphragm, lungs, and other organs. It is basicallythe pancreas in toxicity. Contributing factors include smoking; stress; and crash dieting or binge e ating. 2.Signs and symptoms: midepigastric abdominal pain radiat- ing back; diminished bowel sounds; nausea andvomiting; abdominal distention; fever weight frothy foul-smellingstools; dark altered blood sugar.GASTROINTESTINAL EMERGENCIES 853.Interventions: anticipate fluids in- travenously, monitor serum amylase, serum lipase, and blood glucose level, use nasogastric tube for decompres-sion, administer nothing by mouth, give medications(antacids, anticholinergics, histamine receptor agonists,insulin, analgesics/narcotics), prevent and treat infections,prepare for possible surgery, and instruct patient on diet(low-fat diet, no caffeine, and no alcohol). Normal serum amylase level? 25 to 125 U/L The patient who is actively vomiting cannot drink water before seeing the emergency room provider in case the patient ends up going to surgery.

Most of the time they are minorproblems that can be treated with medications. However, genitourinary problems, such as testicular torsion, canresult in loss of life or limb if untreated. This chapter will guide you through the genital and urinary problems com-monly faced in the emergency room. After reviewing thischapter, you will understand the causes, manifestations, andinterventions for common genitourinary emergencies. During this part of your orientation, locate and become familiar with: 1.Different types of Foley and straight catheters. 2.Bladder irrigation systems.DIAGNOSES Urinary Tract Infection This is a bacterial infection of the bladder and urethra. 1.Causes: Because of their anatomy, UTIs are more common in women than in men. Other contributing factors are hold- ing your urine, not drinking enough water, intercourse,and pH imbalances. 2.Signs and symptoms: painful urination (dysuria), hematuria, urgency, cloudy urine, foul-smelling urine, fever,and abdominal pain. 3.Interventions: obtain clean catch urine or catheter urine if vaginal bleeding is present, administer antibiotic as ordered,encourage fluids like cranberry juice and water, discour-age caffeinated drinks, discourage bubble baths, encour-age sitz baths, teach to wipe from front to back after toi-leting, and teach sexually active females to void andcleanse perineal area after intercourse. If administeringphenazopyridine, teach that it will turn the urine orangeand permanently stain underwear. Notes:_________________________ ____________________ _______________________________ _________________________________________________ __________________92 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSEPyelonephritis This is a bacterial infection of the kidney or renal pelvis. 1.Causes: pyelonephritis usually starts as a urinary tract in- fection in the urethra or bladder that travels all the way up to the kidneys. 2.Signs and symptoms: flank pain, painful urination (dysuria), hematuria, frequency, urgency, cloudy urine, foul-smellingurine, fever, chills, and nausea and vomiting. Chronic pyelonephritis (renal failure): urine output less than 30 ml/hr (oliguria), elevated blood urea nitrogenand creatinine, hypertension, rapid weight gain, andaltered loss of consciousness. Urinalysis will reveal elevated white blood cell counts, elevated red blood cell counts, and bacteria. 3.Interventions: obtain clean catch urine or catheter urine if vaginal bleeding is present, intravenous fluids, and anti-biotic/antipyretics/antiemetics as ordered, encourage flu-ids like cranberry juice and water, discourage caffeinateddrinks, discourage bubble baths, encourage sitz baths andbed rest, teach females to wipe from front to back after toi-leting, and teach sexually active females to void andcleanse perineal area before and EMERGENCIES 93Renal Calculi stones of various sizes along the urinary tract that are commonly known as kidney stones. This pain is equalto that experienced during childbirth! 1.Causes: kidney stones are usually made of calcium or uric acid salt deposits, possibly resulting from urine that is too alkaline or too acidic. 2.Signs and symptoms: SEVERE flank pain NV , hematuria, oliguria, pallor, diaphoresis, low-grade fever, and guarding. 3.Interventions: anticipate orders to: obtain clean catch or catheter urine if vaginal bleeding is present, start intravenousline, administer analgesics (intravenous Toradol) and evalu-ate for effectiveness, instruct strain all urine, and preparefor CT scan of abdomen/pelvis without contrast. Don't for-get to send patient home transmitted diseases or urinary tract in- fections.94 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSE2.Signs and symptoms: penile discharge, bacteria in urinaly- sis, gradual scrotum pain, fever, epididymis swelling, and chills. 3.Interventions: anticipate orders for: ice pack to the scrotum, Gonorrhea and Chlamydia (G & C) culture, anti biotics, and instruct to abstain from sexual intercourse until fol-low-up repeat negative culture. Fast facts in a nutshell When preparing ceftriaxone (Rocephin) intramuscularinjection (IM), 1% lidocaine when a testis spontaneously twists one or more times on the cord, leading to possible ischemia. The mostcommon age group is 12 to 18 years old. 1.Causes: It is not always known, but it can be attributed to an anatomic abnormality known as the bell clapper defor- mity. This deformity allows the cords to twist more easily.GENITOURINARY EMERGENCIES 952.Signs and symptoms: acute severe testicular pain radiating to groin or abdomen, nausea and vomiting, and elevated/ swollen/tender testes. 3.Interventions: anticipate orders packs, testicular ultrasound; preparefor manual reduction of lasting longer than 4 to 6 hours. 1.Common causes: spinal cord injury, leukemia, sickle cell disease, psychotropic drugs, multiple sclerosis, prolonged sexual stimulation, penile tumor, urethral tumor, anticoag-ulant therapy, and impotence treatments. 2.Signs and symptoms: prolonged painful penile erection for more than 4 to 6 hours. 3.Treatments: anticipate treatment of underlying causes by provider that may include: observation of patient, ice packs,penile or or surgery.96 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSEFast facts in a nutshell Question: How do you treat a 19-year-old male who ar- rives at the emergency room stating that his penis is stuck in his pants zipper?Answer: Cut it off. Not the penis, the zipper! Control bleeding and provide ice packs. Fast facts in a nutshell: summary Although most genitourinary emergencies can be treated withmedications, some can be life-threatening. Y ou should nowunderstand some of the most frequent problems that bring pa-tients to the emergency room and how to treat them promptlyand effectively.GENITOURINARY EMERGENCIES 97This page intentionally left blank 99Chapter 9 Geriatric Emergencies INTRODUCTION As the baby boomer generation ages, we can anticipate an even higher volume of ER patients. The normal physiolog- ical changes of the aging process leave patients morevulnerable to illness, injuries, and complications. Several important body systems also slow down. Many geriatric pa-tients have decreased renal function, decreased circulation,thinner skin, weaker bones, decreased hearing, decreasedgastric motility, and visual impairments. It is always im-portant to take these age-related changes into considerationwhen caring for older patients. As you review this chapter,you will learn some of the most common geriatric emergen-cies and how to handle them. During this part of your orientation, locate and become familiar with: 1.Assistive walking devices (e.g., canes, walkers). 2.Adult Protective Services and Social Services.100 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSE 3.Facility policy for reporting elder abuse. 4.Denture containers. 5.Fall risk assessments and precautions. DIAGNOSES Fast facts in a nutshell Normal physiological changes leave older patients more vulnerable to illness, injuries, and complications. Geriatric patients may have decreased renal function, decreased circulation, thinner skin, weaker bones, decreased hearing, decreased gastric motility, andvisual impairments. Elder Abuse Elder abuse can take several different forms, including physi-cal, sexual, nancial, and psychological; it can also includeneglect. Abuse is physical harm, pain, or mental anguish;neglect is the failure to provide services or goods needed toprevent physical harm and mental anguish. Elder abuse is aninternational problem that can be difcult to detect. Femalesare more commonly abused than males. Y ou must report all suspected abuse!1.Causes: Not always known. Elder abuse can occur in any socioeconomic group. Lack of resources and stressed or burned-out caregivers can contribute to the problem. 2.Signs and symptoms: Conflicting stories describing how an injury occurred; patient not given an opportunity to speak;time lapse between injury and presentation to the emer-gency room; disinterested caregiver; history of similar in-juries; hand 3.Interventions: treat injuries and illness; accurately document and photograph injuries or neglect per policy; ascertainif report needs to be filed; notify social services as soonas possible; obtain supportive services through communityreferrals; consider hospitalization to assure patient safety;and refer to Adult Protective Services. Notes:_________________________ ____________________ _______________________________ _________________________________________________ __________________ Falls Many geriatric injuries or illnesses are associated with falls. Complications often include soft tissue injuries, hip fractures,Colles' fracture (wrist), subdural hematoma, and hot waterburns from falls in the bathtub. First, assess the reason for theGERIATRIC EMERGENCIES 101fall. Were there any symptoms prior to the fall (e.g., dizziness, chest pain, loss of consciousness)? What was the activity dur-ing fall? the location? Are there any witnesses? Any history offalls or alcohol intake? Finally, assess if the patient fell atground level. If not, how many feet did the patient fall? 1.Causes: can be attributed to impaired vision, gait, and balance. 2.Signs and symptoms: depends on the fall and injuries. 3.Interventions: nothing by mouth; consider cervical injury and immobilization (rest, ice, splint, and elevate injury); clean and apply sterile dressing to wounds; assess pain;administer pain medications as of consciousness with a spontaneous recovery. 1.Causes: Identifying the cause may prove to be more valu- able than treating the sustained injuries. Assess patient's activity just before the syncopal event.102 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSEa. Temporary, abrupt decrease in cardiac output due to aortic stenosis, mitral valve disease, cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmias, and sick sinus syndrome. b. Volume depletion due to hemorrhage/anemia, diuresis, dehydration, and third-space fluid shift. c. Hypersensitive carotid sinus due to neck turning, con- strictive collars, and drugs (digitalis, propranolol hydro-chloride, alpha-methyldopa). d. Vasovagal response with hypotension due cough, defecation, or urination. e. Hypoglycemia previous history. 3.Interventions: anticipate orders to: obtain serum glucose or complete basic metabolic panel, administer 2 liters ofoxygen through nasal cannula, check pulse oxygen, per-form electrocardiogram, and check orthostatic vital signs. If due to hypoglycemia, treat intravenously with D 50 (1 amp) or give oral or intramuscular injection of glu-cose. Then feed patient once he or she is alert and ori-ented to person, place and time. Notes:_________________________ ____________________ _______________________________ _________________________________________________ __________________GERIATRIC EMERGENCIES 103Dehydration Dehydration is a lack of required serum fluid levels. Elderly patients are more prone to dehyration because of normal phys-iological changes. 1.Causes: altered sense of thirst; decrease in total body fluid; decreased kidney function; and decreased effectiveness of antidiuretic hormone, which helps conserve water. 2.Signs and symptoms: confusion; orders to: administer fluids intra- venously or by mouth, assess mental s tatus, check ortho- static vital signs, and measure intake and output. Notes:_________________________ ____________________ _______________________________ _________________________________________________ __________________ Dementia Dementia is age-related chronic mental impairment that may be the normal mental status for your patient.

Age-related physiological changes in elderly patients will affecttheir condition and can lead to complications. Be sure to as-sess and document these patients carefully. Obtain historiesfrom them and their caregivers, when available. Caring forelderly patients can be a blessing. Often they are more ap-preciative than younger patients.108 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSE109Chapter 10 Infectious Disease Emergencies INTRODUCTION Infectious diseases are common emergencies that must not be taken lightly. Usually, it is the triage nurse who is rstexposed to the unknown case of tuberculosis (TB) or menin-gitis. Most infectious disease patients don't know what iswrong with them when they come to the emergency room.Y our facility should have a triage screening to alert the stafffor infectious disease risks. If the triage screening is posi-tive, you must follow your facilities protocol; this usuallyrequires some sort of mask and isolation. The best advice Ican give you is assess your patients carefully and wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands ! Most ER nurses frequently catch more colds and flus in their rstyear, so be careful. This chapter will educate you on the dif-ferent types of infectious diseases and how to handle them.Fast facts in a nutshell Always practice Universal/Standard Precautions During this part of your orientation, locate and become familiar with: 1.Wound cultures. 2.Lumbar puncture supplies, specimens, and procedures. 3.Contact, respiratory, and reverse isolation policies. 4.Personal protective equipment. 5.Incision and drainage supplies. 6.T riage screening for infectious diseases. 7.Policy for reporting disease to infection control personnel. DIAGNOSES Meningitis Meningitis is a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection of the meninges, which are membrane coverings of the brain. 1.Causes: It usually starts as a sinus infection that spreads to the meninges. 2.Signs and symptoms: \"the worst headache of my life\"; stiff neck (nuchal rigidity); and high fever. Infants may be febrile; irritable; crying; have bulging fontanels; and have a poorappetite.110 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSEa. Kernig's sign is indicative of meningitis (low back/ posterior thigh pain with hip flexion and gradual knee extension). 3.Interventions: place patient on droplet or airborne pre- cautions during triage until test results return negative.Anticipate following orders: acetaminophen/ibuprofen forfever, monitor vital signs, prepare a complete blood countand blood culture, and prepare for lumbar puncture. Bacterial meningitis reveals an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count greater than 1000 cells per mm 3and low glucose in the cerebral spinal fluid. It is more serious andrequires antibiotics like rifampin. Teach the patient thatrifampin is an antibiotic that turns urine and tears orange. Viral meningitis reveals mildly elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 100-1000 cells per mm 3or greater and normal glucose in the cerebral spinal fluid. It may requireantiviral medication, but usually resolves on its own. Fast facts in a nutshell Providers will tell you positioning is key for obtaining agood lumbar puncture. For better positioning during asitting lumbar puncture, place a step stool under the pa-tient's feet. It brings the knees closer to the chest.

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) isa chronic, life-threatening condition caused by HIV . In theemergency room, we are to treat the acute complication ofAIDS. 1.Causes: Contamination by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) through blood or body fluid exchange. 2.Signs and symptoms: early manifestations are similar to cold and flu symptoms. Later symptoms include weight loss; Abnormally low CD4 lymphocyte count may be present. Common opportunistic infections include opportunistic in- fections, maintain appropriate isolation depending oncomplications, monitor vital signs, administer acetamino-phen for fever, prepare a complete blood count, performHIV testing (ELISA and western blot tests) if unknowncase, request chest X-ray (CXR), culture wounds, and ob-tain intravenous access.112 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSEINFECTIOUS DISEASE EMERGENCIES 113 Fast facts in a nutshell We do not perform routine HIV testing in the emergency room because we can not provide follow-up care. Y ourlocal Health Department can provide routine HIV testing. Hepatitis Hepatitis is an inflammation or infection of the liver. 1.Causes: alcohol abuse; overdose of medications; and pres- ence of hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus. 2.Signs and symptoms: ascites; jaundice; elevated liver en- zymes; right upper quadrant abdominal pain; and nauseaand vomiting. The patient often looks like Big Bird\u2014yel-low all over with a big round belly. 3.Interventions: anticipate orders to: medicate for pain, nau- sea, and vomiting, complete a basic metabolic panel, per-form a liver function test and coagulation studies, checkfor abnormal bleeding, and educate the patient to stop anyalcohol consumption or use of Tylenol. Notes:_________________________ ____________________ _______________________________ _________________________________________________ __________________Cellulitis/Abscess/MRSA Abscesses are pockets of skin infection that look like giant pimples from the size of a marble to a golf ball or larger. Dia-betic patients are at higher risk for cellulitis and poor healing. 1.Causes: Most abscesses are caused from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Others may come from other types of bacteria, clogged hair follicles, or cloggedpores. 2.Signs and symptoms: pain; red streaks; pus; and/or fever. 3.Interventions: anticipate orders to: prepare patient for pos- sible incision and drainage of abscess; if appropriate, packthe wound, bandage the wound, administer antibiotics andwarm compresses. *Educate the patient on how to preventthe spread of MRSA (wash hands and bleach everything).MRSA lives dormant under nger nails and in nostrils. Thisis why your mom said not to pick your nose! Providers mayprescribe antibiotic ointment to with a fever or a possible infection.114 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSE1.Causes: These are usually patients receiving chemotherapy. For them, a low-grade fever, say 99.9\u00b0, is of concern be- cause their immune systems are too weak to handle it. 2.Signs and symptoms: fever and possibly cold- or flu-like symptoms. 3.Interventions: reverse isolation with neutropenic precau- tions. During triage or in waiting room, provide patientwith a mask for his or her own protection until placed inisolation room. Monitor vital signs; anticipate orders to:administer acetaminophen or ibuprofen (for fever) and anti-biotics, prepare a complete blood count, obtain an intra-venous access, and prepare for possible admission.

Thisis partly because the triage nurses are the front line when itcomes to exposure to infectious diseases. Therefore, it is cru-cial to thoroughly screen all patients that come throughtriage for infectious diseases. If an infectious disease is sus-pected, proper isolation must be implemented. Make sureyou become familiar with your facility's isolation protocolsand equipment and know how to use it. This informationmay seem a bit scary at rst, but look around you. There areemergency room nurses who have been doing this fordecades! The key is good hand washing, universal precau-tions, triage screening, and proper isolation.Chapter 11 Mental Health Emergencies INTRODUCTION I have to admit, mental health emergencies are not every- one's favorite topic. Just in the last 10 years, the way we deal with mental health emergencies has changed dra-matically. For instance, nurses used to automatically put suicidal patients in seclusion \"for their own protection\" andused restraints more freely. Most mentally healthy peoplewould go crazy under such conditions. We can all empathize;everyone experiences anxiety, stress, anger, and depressionin their lives, but some people become suicidal, violent, orpsychotic. Mental health patients may be difcult to treatat times, particularly when they engage in disruptive be-havior. At times security, seclusion, and restraints may benecessary for short periods of time. Y our priority must al- ways be to maintain safety for yourself, your staff mem-bers, your patient, and other patients. However, you will nd that most mental health patients respond better if youlisten, respect their personal space, and educate them on allprocedures clearly and early on. 121During this part of your orientation, locate and become familiar with: 1. Y our state's and facility's seclusion and restraint policies. 2.Restrain-and-seclusion forms. 3.Legal suicidal intent documents. 4.T ransfer policies to mental health facilities. 5.Local mental health counselors and facilities. 6.Y our facility's security and its codes. 7.Drugs: lorazepam (Ativan) and haloperidol (Haldol). DIAGNOSES Anxiety Anxiety is a vague feeling of apprehension, tension, and un- easiness that can be divided into four levels: mild, moderate,severe, and panic. 1.Causes: Usually some sort of stressor, but it varies with the individual and his or her circumstances. 2.Signs and symptoms by level a.Mild: minimal muscle tension; normal vital signs; con- stricted normal pupils; random controlled thoughts;and appearance of calm. b.Moderate: normal to slightly elevated vital signs; tension; excited behavior; alertness; optimum decreased appetite. d.Panic: faint feeling from sympathetic nervous system release; of coordination; pressure or lump in throat; help-lessness; may become angry/combative/withdrawn,tearful; and shortness of breath. 3.Interventions: maintain calm and private environment; re- duce stimulation; stay with the patient or have a supportperson stay; use simple repetitive communication; en-courage _______________________________ _________________________________________________ __________________ Posttraumatic Stress Disorder The disorder is a reaction to overwhelmingly traumatic events. 1.Causes: a traumatic or overwhelming event. 2.Signs and symptoms: signs of anxiety or stress; recurring dreams or flashbacks; explosive anger; increased substance abuse; and feelings of guilt. 3.Interventions: assess suicidal/homicidal ideations; assess anxiety levels; provide therapeutic listening; avoid judg-MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCIES 123ment; and provide referrals ____________________ _______________________________ _________________________________________________ __________________ Depression Depresssion is a state of sadness that affects one mentally and physically. Short periods of depression following a spe-cic event, such as divorce or death, are natural and resolvein time. However, clinical depression related to chemical orhormonal imbalances may require medication and therapyfor a lifetime. 1.Causes: Vary by individual and circumstances. May be the natural result of a specic event, such as divorce or death. If, however, it is the result of hormonal or chemical imbal-ances, the condition may require prolonged treatment. 2.Signs and symptoms: sad mood; lack of interest in or pleas- ure from activities; insomnia or hypersomnia; fatigue; feel-ing of guilt or worthlessness; inability to think or concen-trate; inability to make decisions; and suicidal interest and concern; and provide choices.Antidepressants are rarely administered in the emergencyroom, they are not usually effective for the rst week or two.124 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSEFast facts in a nutshell T ricyclics = amitriptyline (Elavil) imipramine crisis Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) + foods that ferment (yogurt, cheeses, sour cream) = hyper-tensive crisis Fast facts in a nutshell Question: Why don't we discharge patients with anti- depressant prescriptions?Answer: These patients need psychiatric follow-up and probably will not go if they are able to receive medicationsin the emergency department.

Y ou may nd that men-tal health emergencies can be tough, sad, and rewarding.Chapter 12 Neurological Emergencies INTRODUCTION The neurological system is a critical piece of the human puzzle. It is fascinating and fragile. There are many differ-ent forms of neurological emergencies. In the emergencyroom, you may see anything from head trauma with grand mal seizures to Bell's palsy. It is important to get a good history and neurological assessment on these patients. Thischapter will help you learn the major neurological emer-gencies and how to handle them. During this part of your orientation, become familiar with and locate: 1.Stroke protocol for your facility. 2.Neurological assessment tools 131PLAN FOR THE WORST, HOPE FOR THE BEST I will never forget a patient who took me by surprise. He came in unconscious and postictal from a witnessed seizure withno history and no family. We were treating him for a routineseizure when he suddenly became hypertensive with multi-ple seizures, and we learned of his history of uncontrolledhypertension. He was having a massive hemorrhagic stroke\u2014and not just a routine seizure! He needed a head CT scansuperstat. DIAGNOSES Stroke (Cerebrovascular Accident) A stroke is is an interruption of cerebral circulation, also known as a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The three types ofstrokes are listed below, along with their causes, manifesta-tions, occurs while sleeping. Symp- toms, which vary depending on location, magnitude, andduration, include arm drift; pupil changes; paralysis; FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSE3.Interventions: follow hospital stroke protocol (usually 2-3 hour window from onset of symptoms to treatment); maintain patent airway; watch cardiac and blood pressuremonitor; administer oxygen; order CT scan of the head;give antihypertensive medications if systolic blood pres-sure is greater than 220 and diastolic blood pressure isgreater than 120 (don't lower blood pressure fast!); per-form coagulation studies, electrocardiogram, and he-parin, warfarin aspirin), activatoror TPA, urokinase, and streptokinase). Hemorrhagic1.Causes: rupture of cerebral blood vessel. 2.Signs and symptoms: often occur upon waking or shortly thereafter. Symptoms, which vary depending on location,magnitude, and duration, include arm drift; pupil changes;paralysis; facial andseizure. 3.Interventions: follow hospital stroke protocol (usually 2-3 hour window from onset of symptoms to treatment);maintain patent airway; watch cardiac and blood pressuremonitor; administer oxygen; anticipate order CT scanof the head, antihypertensive medications if systolic bloodpressure is greater than 220 and diastolic blood pressureis greater than 120 (don't lower blood pressure too fast!),NEUROLOGICAL EMERGENCIES 133perform coagulation studies, electrocardiogram, and fre- quent neurological assessments. Consider surgical inter-vention. Prepare for operating room admission with neu-rosurgeon or transfer as ordered. Transient Ischemic Attack: A ministroke, also known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA), is a temporary interruptionof cerebral blood flow that resolves on its own. 1.Causes: temporary interruption of blood supply from a clot, spasm, or cerebral bleeding. 2.Signs and symptoms: Symptoms, which vary depending on location, magnitude, and duration, persist less than24 hours without permanent neurological deficit. Theyinclude arm drift; pupil paralysis; seizure. 3.Interventions: follow hospital stroke protocol (usually 2-3 hour window from onset of symptoms to treatment);maintain patent airway; watch cardiac and blood pressuremonitor; administer oxygen; anticipate order CT scanof the head, antihypertensive medications if systolic bloodpressure is greater than 220 and diastolic blood pressure isgreater than 120 (don't lower BP too fast!), coagulationstudies, electrocardiogram, and frequent neurological as-sessments, and prepare for admission.134 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSEFast facts in a nutshell Question: What do you give for warfarin (Coumadin) overdose? Answer: Vitamin K. overdose? Answer: Protamine sulfate. Question: Patient states \"it is the worst headache of his life,\" and he has nausea and vomiting; photosensitivity;hypertension; bradycardia; and What is themost likely diagnosis?Answer: Ruptured cerebral aneurysm. Question: What are the guidelines for administering nitroprusside for hypertension?Answer: Protect from light; use provided covering. Average dose is 3 to 10 mcg/kg/min. Notes:_________________________ ____________________ _______________________________ _________________________________________________ __________________ Seizures A seizure is interruption of electrical brain activity, fol- lowed by postictal state. Many different types are listed below,but the treatment is always the same.NEUROLOGICAL EMERGENCIES 1351.Causes: Aside from febrile seizures, the cause is not always known. Underlying conditions include brain tumor, cere- bral infarct, head trauma, medication overdose, and alco-hol abuse. 2.Signs and symptoms:. Each type of seizure, with specic signs and symptoms, is listed below.a.Generalized absence seizure (petit mal): characterized by staring or eyelid fluttering for 5 to 10 seconds. b.Tonic clonic (grand and amnesia. c.Partial (focal): affect only part of the brain. Symptoms vary according to location of the seizure. It is usually ac-companied by an aura. Focal seizures may be the resultof underlying problems (e.g., trauma, tumor, or infarct). d.Focal motor: starts with focal jerking that may persist or may spread to the entire body (grand mal). e.Febrile: common in infants and young children with high fever. f.Status epilepticus: the seizure that never ends and is therefore an emergency! The patient keeps having oneseizure after another so it looks like one long seizure.The patient with status epilepticus will have increasedtemperature, blood pressure, and pulse. The patient isat risk for hypoxic brain damage. g.Pseudoseizures: when the patient is faking a seizure. Yes, this does actually happen! Patient movements may bepurposeful, but the patient is not postictal after a fakeseizure. This type of seizure is usually preceded by emo-tional upset, generally lasts longer than a true seizure,and the patient shows stable vital signs.136 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSENEUROLOGICAL EMERGENCIES 137 Arm Test: hold the patient's arm above his or her face, and let go. A truly unconscious patient will hit his or her face with the arm. The pseudoseizure patient willavoid hitting the face. Wave ammonia in front of the patient. If it is a pseu- doseizure, the patient will suddenly be alert andoriented to person, place, and time. 3.Interventions: protect the patient from harm but do not re- strain; protect airway; place in recovery position afterward;administer oxygen; anticipate order to: obtain an intra-venous access, give (lorazepam, diazepam,and anticonvulsants), and reorient to reality after postictalstate. Fast facts in a nutshell Question: How fast do you give phenytoin (Dilantin)? Answer: No faster than 50 mg/min using an in-line lter to avoid cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. In addition,phenytoin (Dilantin) commonly causes phlebitis. If it infil-trates, it causes tissue necrosis! Question: Does seizures? Answer: intravenous solution can be mixed with Dilantin?Answer: Saline only (think Seizure, think Saline). Any other solution causes drug to crystallize.138 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSE Question: What can be mixed with diazepam (Valium) administered int ravenously? Answer: Absolutely nothing, not even of cranial nerve VII (facial). It usually resolves in several weeks to months. 1.Causes: Unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a virus or immunodeciency disorder. 2.Signs and symptoms: facial paralysis; headache; facial swell ing; numbness; inability to close one eye; facial droop; and drooling. 3.Interventions: give medications (steroids, analgesics, arti- cial tears) as ordered and reassure the patient that he orshe is not having a stroke. Notes:_________________________ 1.Causes: Thought to be caused by a myoneural junction defect. 2.Signs and symptoms: voluntary muscle weakness, especially of the face. Symptoms may improve with rest.

Fast facts in a nutshell: summary Y ou now have a basic knowledge of neurological emergen-cies. Y ou should be able to differentiate the various types andknow how to treat them. Documenting a patient's completehistory and neurological assessments is absolutely vital. Befamiliar with your facility's neurological assessment tools,such as the Glasgow Coma Scale. Never underestimate yourpatient's symptoms. Sometimes a simple headache is theresult of cerebral aneurysms or brain masses. Therefore con-cise assessments and rapid testing is key.142 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSEChapter 13 OB/GYN Emergencies INTRODUCTION Obstetrical and gynecological emergencies occur regularly in the emergency room. As a nurse, you must be familiarand comfortable with the various types of OB/GYN emer-gencies. This chapter will guide you through the manycommon types of obstetrical and gynecological challengesyou will face in the emergency room. When caring for thesepatients, be sure to always respect your patient's privacyby closing doors and curtains and providing blankets forcovering up. Patients may be uncomfortable talking aboutobstetrical or gynecological matters. It is also true thatsome women are not well educated about their bodies.Some actually do deliver full-term babies in the emergencyroom without knowing they were pregnant. Thus, the nurse must be sure to document a full and accuratetriage and secondary assessment to find the source ofthe patient's complaint. Y ou may have to ask a lot of questions to get the necessary patient history. 143During this part of your orientation, locate and become familiar with: 1.Precipitous delivery tray. 2.Pelvic examination equipment 4.Doppler for fetal heart tones. DIAGNOSES Endometriosis Endometriosis is a painful menstrual cycle that occurs because endometrial tissue fragments are found outside the uterus. 1.Causes: the abnormal tissue fragments react to hormones and slough during menstruation, thereby causing pelvic pain. 2.Signs and symptoms: pelvic pain with menstruation; dy- suria; irregular menstrual cycles; and abnormal uterinebleeding. 3.Interventions: as ordered, administer analgesic medication and evaluate effectiveness; bed rest; set up and assist inpelvic specialist.

Manual pressure can be applied to the baby's head by gently push-ing up with the nger to relieve pressure on for emergency C-section. Notes:_________________________ ____________________ _______________________________ _________________________________________________ __________________ Trauma During Pregnancy This trauma is the result of an injury that occurred during pregnancy. 1.Causes: vary individually. Shift in weight and unsteady gait do contribute to falls and injuries during pregnancy. 2.Signs and symptoms: vary depending on the injury. May in- clude vaginal bleeding and ruptured membranes. 3.Interventions: assess uterine contractions and fetal heart tones (normal is 120-160 beat/min); place the patient in left lateral recumbent position; anticipate orders to: obtainlarge-bore intravenous access, administer isotonic intra-venous fluids, determine presence of any amniotic fluidswith pH strip, inspect vaginal opening for crowning, checkfor any fetal movement, palpate and determine fundalheight, arrange for pelvic or transvaginal ultrasound andOB/GYN EMERGENCIES 155CT scan, perform coagulation studies, prepare a complete blood count, type and screen blood, arrange for pelvic ex-amination, access breath sounds for pulmonary edema,prepare for blood transfusion, and prepare for emergencyC-section. NO vasopressors due to fetal compromise. Fast facts in a nutshell If a pregnant patient is on backboard, tilt the client to her left side to move the uterus off the inferior venacava (IVC). Consider early blood transfusion. Large quantities of isotonic fluids do not improve fetal hypoxia. A pregnant trauma patient can lose up to 30% of blood volume before becoming hypotensive. Notes:_________________________ ____________________ _______________________________ _________________________________________________ __________________ Emergency Delivery It is rare, but sometimes babies are delivered in the emergency room. Most times, we feel ill prepared. Sometimes patientsdon't know they are pregnant or are in denial. Just remember,156 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSEwomen have been delivering babies naturally without hospi- tals and nurses since the beginning of time. 1. Causes: There are only three reasons to deliver a baby in the emergency room. (1) The patient in active labor did not know she was pregnant. (2) The patient is miscarrying andis less than 20 weeks pregnant. (3) The active labor patientaccidentally comes to the emergency room instead of thebirthing center and delivers prior to being transferred tothe birthing center. 2.Signs and symptoms: bloody; amniotic a baby's head; and an uncontrollable desireto push (patient may ask to use the bathroom). 3.Interventions: position the patient on her left side; admin- ister oxygen; and visually check for crowning. If signs ofimminent delivery are present, be prepared to \"catch\" thebaby; obtain intravenous access as ordered; monitor fetalheart tones and contractions; and prepare for rapid vaginal examination unless vaginal bleeding is present.Vaginal bleeding due to placenta previa may cause LIFE- THREATENING HEMORRHAGE.a. Infant resuscitation: So you have caught the baby. Now what? Call for help if you don't have any. 1. Prevent heat loss by drying the baby and wrapping him or her in warm blankets/towels; use warming light;and placing directly against mother's body and coverboth. 2. Suctioning: bulb suction mouth then nose. If you don't have bulb suction, use wall suction with oralYanker adapter. 3. Provide oxygen.OB/GYN EMERGENCIES 1574.Stimulate: If the drying and the suction don't work, rub the infant's back or flick/slap soles of feet. If still not breathing, use bag valve mask to assistventilations. 5. The APGAR Score is used to determine fetal status. Use Table 13.3 to determine the baby's score. Y ouwant the baby to score a perfect 10.

Answer: Right upper quadrant because it gets pushed up later in pregnancy. Question: What does gravida mean? What does para mean?Answer: the number of pregnancies. Para means the number of live births. Fast facts in a nutshell: summary Y ou should now have a more defining knowledge base ofobstetrical and gynecological emergencies. Be sure to locateand be familiar with all your obstetrical and gynecologicalequipment. Nothing is worse than running around trying tond supplies during an emergency. Be sure to practice as-sisting with a couple of pelvic examinations during yourorientation. At rst, you may feel like you need a few extrahands to assist with the examinations. Obtain a good his-tory! This means asking questions, such as when did it start,does anything make the pain worse, how many pads did yougo through today? Always be professional and respect yourpatient's privacy.This page intentionally left blank 161Chapter 14 Ocular Emergencies INTRODUCTION Y ou will come across a variety of eye emergencies working in the emergency room. Some are as simple as pink eye,while others require emergency ophthalmic surgery. As a nurse, you must be able to differentiate between non - urgent and emergent eye complaints. This chapter will guide you through the various types of eye emergencies andteach you the manifestations and interventions for each. Besure to practice with the eye supplies available at your facility during your orientation. Familiarization with yoursupplies will enable you to obtain a thorough eye assessmenton your patients. The providers you work with will be ex-pecting a visual acuity on all eye complaints. Document carefully and keep your eyes open; you never know what you'll see next in the emergency room.162 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSE During this part of your orientation, locate and become familiar with: 1.Wood's lamp, slit lamp, Tono-Pen or 5.Morgan lens and eye irrigation supplies. 6.Gentamicin ophthalmic ointment.

Y ou need to be famil-iar with many difference pieces of orthopedic equipment.In addition to using the equipment, the emergency roomnurse is also responsible for teaching the patient how to usethe orthopedic equipment. For cast of Ortho-Glass typesplinting, I recommend training from the manufacturer'srepresentative. Most manufacturers will send someone to your facility to demonstrate their products and allowemployees to practice applying the splints. Most emer- gency room technicians are qualied to apply splints foryou, but the nurse must ensure the work was done prop-erly. This chapter will provide a brief overview of the dif-ferent orthopedic and wound care emergency situationsyou may come across in the emergency room, and how tohandle them. 171During this part of your orientation, locate and become familiar with: 1.Ace wraps, splinting, and 4.Tube gauze. 6.Suture supplies dressing supplies. 7.Medications to know: lidocaine DIAGNOSES Strains A strain is a pull or tear to a tendon or muscle. 1.Causes: injury resulting in a pull or tear to a of motion. 3.Interventions: (PRICE) Protect (splint, cast, sling), Rest, Ice, Compression (ace wrap), E levate; X-ray; instruct patient on use of crutches for light to no weight bearing; and arrange orthopedic follow-up.

If a major burn, prepare for ad-mission to burn center. Figure 15.1 shows the rules of nines for burn victims. This is afast way to determine a patient's percentage of burned surfaces.180 FAST FACTS FOR THE a nutshell: summary Y ou now have a better understanding of orthopedic and wound care emergencies, their symptoms, and treatments.Be sure to familiarize yourself with the orthopedic and woundcare supplies at your local facility. Thoroughly documentyour assessments, being sure to include distal pulses, capil-lary rells, deformities, symmetry, if bleeding is controlled,and when and how the injury occurred. Use personal pro-tective equipment, especially with arterial bleeds. Arterialbleeds have been known to squirt across the room. In casethis happens and your clothes get soiled, it is also a good ideato keep an extra pair of scrubs in your locker.ORTHOPEDIC AND WOUND CARE EMERGENCIES 181This page intentionally left blank 183Chapter 16 Pediatric Emergencies INTRODUCTION Children can be some of the most delightful and yet scari- est patients you'll ever meet. Why scary? For 2 reasons.First, children can't always tell you what is wrong. So you must assess them well and listen to parents; they generallyknow when something is wrong with their babies. Second,children may look okay when they are actually in distressbecause they are good at compensating. When they can nolonger compensate, they deteriorate rapidly. This is calledthe plateau effect. This doesn't leave the emergency roomstaff with much time to resuscitate them. Therefore, youmust treat them aggressively at the early signs of distress,which include tachycardia and increased respirations. Hy-potension is a late sign, which is followed by rapid deterio-ration. Y ou will learn about this extensively during your pe-diatric advanced life support (PALS) course. Pediatricemergency nursing really is a specialty of its own, but this chapter will provide you with some of the basic pediatricemergency nursing tools you will need.During this part of your orientation, locate and become familiar with: 1.Braslow tape and cart/bag. 2.Where to take a pediatric advanced life support class. 3.Kilogram/pound conversion. 4.Pediatric Tylenol and Motrin doses. 5.Pediatric vital signs. 6.Papoose board. 7.Intra-osseous needle, also known as I.O. needle, output placement and use. 8.Review hospital policy for consent to treat minors. 9.Stickers, popsicles, coloring crayons, and toys, as these aregreat for passing time and bribing. Fast facts in a nutshell When children deteriorate, they generally deterioratemore rapidly than adults. Table 16.1 lists all of the pediatric vital signs according to age group. Y ou will need to know these by heart, so it is a goodidea to familiarize yourself with these vital signs during yourorientation. Basically, the younger the child, the lower theblood pressure and higher the heart and respirations will be.184 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSEFast facts in a nutshell Obtain blood pressure on children 4 years of age and older. Don't use the word \"blood\" pressure, as it scaresthem. Tell them you're going to give their arm a hug withan arm-hugging machine or check their arm muscles. Fever In children, a fever is dened as a rectal temp of 100.4\u00b0 orhigher. Infants younger than 3 months of age with fever are athigh risk for having a serious bacterial infection, such as sep-sis or meningitis. A febrile child without an obvious source offever requires an extensive evaluation and possible admission.PEDIATRIC EMERGENCIES 185 TABLE 16.1 Pediatric Vital Signs Systolic Blood Age Pressure Heart Rate Respirations Infant infections. temperature mg/kg) by mouth or suppository, administer in-travenous fluids for dehydration, and monitor temperature. Fast facts in a nutshell Sepsis work-up in infants younger than 3 months of age includes labs, chest X-ray; and lumbar puncture.Remember when positioning patient for a lumbarpuncture, there should be no chin to chest, as thismight occlude the airway. Instead, curve shoulders(not the head) forward. Fluids after a lumbar puncture may prevent headache in a young child. Children's ibuprofen (Motrin) is not given to children younger than 6 months of age. A 4-year-old with gastroenteritis who is discharged from the emergency department should be encouragedto drink small sips of clear liquids as much as he cantolerate to make up fluid swelling and inflammation of the epiglot- tis that can lead to a life-threatening airway obstruction.

Fast facts in a nutshell: summary Pediatric emergency nursing is its own specialty. For the gen-eral emergency nurse, the basic information in this chapterwill see you through most problems. Be sure to always takeaccount of differences between children and adults. Pediatricpatients have different vital signs, deteriorate more rapidlythan adults, become dehydrated more easily, and can runhigher fevers. All pediatric patient medication doses are basedon weight in kilograms. Remember that children can not al- ways tell you what is wrong. Therefore, it is up to the nurseto obtain an accurate history and detailed physical assess-ment. If you're ever unsure of something, ask a coworker andgo nd the answer. The pediatric patient is not just a pa-tient; he or she is someone's child! Sometimes, the toughestchallenge is defusing the hysterical parent's anger or anxi-ety. Parents don't always realize they are hindering or delay-ing care when they panic. If the situation cannot be defused,don't waste time. Have another coworker or manager han-dle the parent, leaving you to care for the child. Y ou now havethe knowledge base to diagnose and handle pediatric emer-gencies. Be careful, these little patients know how to pull onyour heart strings.PEDIATRIC EMERGENCIES 197This page intentionally left blank 199Chapter 17 Respiratory Emergencies INTRODUCTION Of all emergencies, respiratory problems must be treated rst. Without a patent airway and breathing, your pa- tient will die\u2014and nothing else matters. Therefore, as an emergency nurse, you must be able to recognize and rapidlyrespond to any respiratory emergency. This chapter willtake you through the most common respiratory conditionsseen in the emergency room. After reviewing it, you will beable to recognize the various types of respiratory emergen-cies and know how to intervene. During this part of your orientation, locate and become familiar with: 1.Ambu-bags, nasal cannulas, nonrebreather masks, (Xopenex).

Be sure to thoroughly document respi-ratory assessments, which should include rate, depth, breathsounds, symmetry, skin color, use of accessory muscles, iflabored or unlabored, and ability to speak in full sentences.It is imperative that you are competent in recognizing andtreating all respiratory emergencies. To make you morecomfortable with respiratory problems, be sure to familiar-ize yourself with all your facility's respiratory supplies andequipment. Knowing where your supplies are and how to usethem will make your job easier. If you have a lot of questions,a respiratory therapist can be a good resource. Never forget:in any emergency treat the airway rst, then breathing, andthen circulation.208 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSEChapter 18 Shock and Multisystem Trauma Emergencies INTRODUCTION Patients in shock or with multisystem trauma are consid- ered critical, so a knowledge of these emergencies is vital for the emergency room nurse. The window of opportunityto save these patients' lives is small. In this chapter, you willlearn the various forms of shock and how to intervene. Y ouwill also gain a better understanding of multiple types oftrauma and how to manage them. Be sure to learn yourfacility's trauma protocols and be familiar with any traumaor shock supplies. It is also highly recommended that yousign up for and take the trauma nurse core course. It is avaluable certification to have and will help increase yourknowledge in this area. 209During this part of your orientation, become familiar with and locate: 1.Rapid infusers, blood warmers, blood tubing, and supply box. DIAGNOSES Hemorrhagic/Hypovolemic Shock This is a loss of too much blood volume. Hypovolemic shock is the most common form of shock in a trauma patient. 1.Causes: lack blood volume because of laceration of a major blood vessel; gastrointestinal bleeding; hypotension; pulse pressure; tachycardia; and altered level of consciousness. 3.Interventions: treat airway, then breathing, and then circu- lation (ABCs); monitor vital signs, cardiac performance,and oxygen levels; anticipate orders to: obtain two large-bore intravenous accesses, administer IV crystalloid fluidinfusion of 20 to 40 ml/kg, prepare transfusion of whole orpacked red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma or platelets,and apply direct pressure to profusely bleeding lacerations.210 FAST FACTS FOR THE ER NURSESHOCK AND MULTISYSTEM TRAUMA EMERGENCIES 211 Fast facts in a nutshell Question: In a pediatric patient what are some late signs hypovolemic shock?

Shock and trauma emergencies are al-ways critical situations. Y ou should be able to differentiateamong the various types of shock and trauma and know howto respond. Finding time to chart during a critical emer-gency is difcult. Most of the time, you need another nurseto help. All emergency room nurses have to be team players.Even still, you may have to jot your notes on a scratch pieceof paper and document later. To ease any anxiety, take somedeep and cleansing breaths, get help, and learn as much asyou can about shock and trauma.SHOCK AND MULTISYSTEM TRAUMA EMERGENCIES 229This page intentionally left blank 231Chapter 19 Substance Abuse and Toxicologic Emergencies INTRODUCTION Substance abuse and toxicologic conditions, which are seen regularly in the emergency room, can be fatal. Because somany types of substance abuse and poisonous materials ex-ist, remembering them all is difcult. However, never fear.This chapter will provide a simple and easy-to-use sub-stance abuse and toxicology table. Even with access to thistable, you must still always consult with poison control af-ter the patient is triaged. Poison control will give you vitalindividualized suggestions based on the patient's weight,circumstances, amount of drug intake, and the time framein which the drug was taken. Document and communicatethe suggestions provided by poison control with the emer-gency room provider to obtain any necessary immediate orders.During this part of your orientation, locate and become familiar with: 1.Local poison control number. 2.Drugs to flumazenil (Romazicon), acetylcysteine(Mucomyst), and banana our local poisonous snakes and appropriate antivenominformation. 4.Nasogastric tubes and gastric lavage equipment. Fast facts in a nutshell Call poison control for EVERY overdose. T reatment of most overdose patients generally begins with the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and MOVE (Monitor, Oxygen, Venous access, and E lectro- cardiogram). Table 19.1 is a great quick reference tool to assist you withsubstance abuse and toxicology cases. In it, you will nd analphabetical list of each substance or drug class, with the cor-responding symptoms and interventions. Examples of drugsand substances are provided under each class.
