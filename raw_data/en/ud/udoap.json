On the other hand CAM practices exist in Israel. However these activities are definitely not at the same level as in some CAM clinics in Germany or in Mexico.\" Here we focus on four questions: 1. What is being done for cancer in Israel, in an alternative or complementary way, that is not being done elsewhere? 2. What have been some of the most promising findings or discoveries? 3. How does the Israeli medical establishment's attitude towards CAM differ from that in other countries, particularly in the US? 4. If the situation in Israel is unique, why is that so? To investigate these questions I visited Israel for two weeks in July 2010. A non-profit organization that provides information on evidence-based cancer therapies supported this fact-finding mission. I visited a total of 15 hospitals, clinics and laboratories in Tel Aviv, Haifa and Jerusalem, as well in some smaller localities. I came away deeply impressed by the degree CAM's integration into the medical system in Israel. Historical Context Israel is a land steeped in history and therefore it is necessary to put the use of CAM (particularly for cancer) into its historical context. The territory that is now Israel was for a millennium or so the ancestral homeland of the Jewish people. In 70 CE, after decades of political and military contention, the Romans destroyed the Second Temple in Jerusalem. Eventually the Emperor Hadrian (c. 135 CE) barred all Jews from Jerusalem and most of the Roman colony of Judea. Thus began 2,000 years of wandering in the so-called Diaspora. During this time the Jews settled in diverse parts of the world. In Europe, they settled first in Spain and in Germany and later in the Russian-dominated parts of Eastern Europe. A long period of anti-Semitic discrimination and persecution culminated in the Nazi-led Holocaust, the murder of six million Jews in concentration camps and by other means. In 1948 came the creation of the state of Israel, and the tumultuous political developments and conflicts that have followed. Despite many wars and terrorist attacks, and the burden of a huge military budget, the country has thrived. Israel is the only country in the Middle East to approximate a Western degree of affluence. According to the World Bank, its gross national income is now over USD $200 billion. (It was less than $27 billion in 1980.) The per capita income in 2009 was $26,175, which is greater than Slovenia, Portugal or South Korea. Israel is the only country in the world with a majority Jewish population: 5,726,000 out of a total 1 population of 7,587,000 (or 75.5 percent).2 During their long period of exile, the Jewish people were generally scorned, persecuted and barred from most areas of gainful employment. It is not my purpose of course to explore the history, much less the causes, of this widespread anti-Semitism. But, for various reasons, one area in which Jews were generally allowed to earn a living and excel was in medicine. Even in the Middle Ages, Jewish physicians were highly regarded by those who were otherwise vehemently anti-Semitic. In fact, some members of the nobility insisted on being treated by Jewish physicians even when Christian doctors were available. In modern times, despite frequently being barred from admission to medical school, Jews managed to maintain their reputation for excellence in medicine (as well as many other fields of scholarship). One way of estimating the extent of their accomplishments is by looking at the winners of the Nobel Prize. This provides one objective measure of different peoples' achievements vis-\u00e0-vis the world in general. Thus, between 1901 and 2009, there were 829 Nobel laureates. Jews (i.e., individuals defined by having at least one Jewish parent) received 180 of these prizes, or 21.7 percent of the total awarded. In physiology and medicine, Jews have won 27 percent of the total. Jewish achievement in academia is all the more remarkable when one considers that the Jewish community totals 13.2 million, or just two-tenths of one percent (0.00218) of the world population. The trend continues, since two of the 2010 Nobel laureates are also of Jewish ancestry (Peter Diamond and Andr\u00e9 Geim). There is nothing unique about the Nobel Prizes, either. Jews have also won 32 percent of Japan's Kyoto Prizes in advanced technology, 40 percent of the Wolf Prizes for medicine, 33 percent of the Lasker Awards, and 38 percent of the U.S. National Medals for Science.3 Science in Israel Israel is a young country, which only began building many of its world-class research establishments since gaining independence in 1948. So far nine Israelis have won Nobel Prizes. In 2009, Ada Yonath, an Israeli-born and educated scientist, won the prize for chemistry, the first Israeli woman to have done so. Which brings us to the question of complementary and alternative medicine in Israel, particularly in regard to the treatment of cancer. Although a young country, Israel's accomplishments in CAM are formidable and reflect the historical accomplishments of the Jewish people. CAM requires not just excellent in medicine in general but also an innovative spirit towards dramatically new and different treatment ideas. Israel is a very innovative place, which has been called \"the start-up nation,\" because of the many new companies spawned by its universities and medical schools. In complementary medicine, 4 Israelis are also known for inventing or testing numerous innovative products. We might mention three of the following: 1. The homeopathic preparation Traumeel, which was first subjected to a randomized controlled trial (RCT) by Menachem Oberbaum, MD, et al. of Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem. This positive study was published in the scientific journal of the American Cancer Society, Cancer.5 2. The advanced photosensitizer Tookad (which means \"the warmth of light\" in Hebrew), which was developed at the Weizmann Institute by Profs. Avram Scherz and Yoram Salomon. 3. Punisyn, a mixture of aqueous and lipid pomegranate extracts, which has demonstrated activity against both breast and prostate cancer, developed by the \"medical punicologist\" Ephraim 6 7 Lansky (www.rimonest.com) Israeli participation in CAM is marked by a high level of both innovation and scholarship. Israel scientists are not only inventive but are quick to grasp the importance of new developments and find ways to put them into practice. Some Considerations on CAM in Israel Israel is the size of the state of New Jersey and one can drive from Qirat Shmona in the north to Eilat in the south in six hours. This smallness is combined with an astonishing degree of diversity in the population. One of the great surprises of visiting Israel is the incredible diversity of the population, which confounds preconceived ideas of \"Jewishness.\" Virtually all the nations and languages of the world are represented there, and sometimes all seem to be speaking at once. While I was in Israel I met not just Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews (some of whose ancestors had been in the Holy Land since the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492), but also Jews from North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia and South Africa, France, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, Iran, China, and of course many parts of the former Soviet Union. I also met Israeli Arabs and Bedouins, Christians, and Druse, as well as \"guest workers\" from Thailand and the Philippines. Israel is a microcosm of humanity. Superficially at least, medicine in Israel is practiced much as in the US. Israel's four medical schools and 8 various postgraduate programs mainly utilize American textbooks and journals. A high percentage of Israeli medical school graduates participate in fellowship programs in the US and many Americans come to Israel for education or training. According to my host, Moshe Frenkel, MD, American influence has been formalized in various ways. Three of the four Israeli medical schools have collaborative agreements with US medical schools. These attract US students to obtain their MD degree in Israel and then return to the US for postgraduate training and practice. Similarly, almost every Israeli doctor I met in Israel trained in the US...usually at top institutions such as Memorial Sloan-Kettering, M.D. Anderson, Roswell Park, Brown University, the University of Maryland, etc. I also met Israeli doctors who were American or Canadian in origin but had emigrated to Israel, often for religious reasons. Historical Roots of CAM in Israel There are interesting points of similarity between modern-day CAM treatments and ancient medical and religious practices of the Jewish people. For instance, the Torah (i.e., the first five books of the Hebrew Bible) enjoins Jewish men to put on 'tefillin' each day. This is a prayer ritual during which two small leather boxes, attached to leather straps, are placed on the biceps of the weaker arm and on a particular location on the head. The biceps strap is wound on the arm in a carefully prescribed fashion while the head strap is tied in a knot, which is then placed at the base of the skull. The overall purpose of tefillin is to raise spiritual awareness. It is astonishing to learn that the tefillin and wraps actually \"form a potent acupuncture point formula focused on the Governing vessel (Du Mai) and aimed at elevating the spirit and clearing the mind.\" In a 9 fascinating article on this topic, the New York acupuncturist Steven Schram, PhD, states: - \"If someone handed an acupuncturist the above point formula and asked what was being treated, there is little doubt that mental...issues would be a strong part of the pattern. What is surprising is that such a point formula would be found in a non-Chinese procedure that has been continuously practiced for many thousands of years. It may be that the originators of the tefillin ritual had some inkling of its special effects, even though they may have lacked the depth and specific knowledge we have today.\"10 There are points of similarity between ancient food and herbal prescriptions and rational hygienic practices. The Biblical injunctions against consuming scavengers (Leviticus 11:31) or utilizing bowls or vessels in which animals have died (Leviticus 11:31-32) have been seen as a way of preventing animal borne diseases. (According to WebMD, there are at least 39 serious diseases people catch directly from animals. ) 11 The Bible similarly enjoins inspection of the lungs of slaughtered animals, a practice that would help prevent the spread of tuberculosis. The ban on consuming unconscious animals would further prevent the consumption of sick animals. And the prohibition against pigs (Leviticus 11:3-8) -\"of their flesh ye shall not eat\" (KJV) -would have similarly prevented the transmission of the roundworm, Trichinella spiralis, and other parasites. The ancient Hebrews were also familiar with the cultivation of herbs for various purposes, including healing. In 1 Kings 21:2 King Ahab proposed planting a \"garden of herbs\" (KJV). In particular, the herb hyssop (Hyssopus spp.) is often referred to as an herb of purification, because it is a purgative cathartic herb. (\"Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean,\" Psalms 51:7) It is also said to expel phlegm from the respiratory tract. Figure 2 Hyssop Frankincense (Boswellia spp.), ketoret in Hebrew, was not strictly speaking a medicinal herb, but was an ingredient in incense that was offered up twice daily in the ancient Temple. According to the Gospel of St. Matthew, one of the three Magi who visited the infant Jesus in the manger brought a gift of frankincense. Frankincense is now being explored as a treatment for colon , bladder, prostate and brain cancer, as 12 13 14 well as for cerebral metastases. So, in a sense, the use of \"CAM\" in Israel has ancient roots. 15 Popularity of CAM In Israel, as in the US and Europe, CAM has become very popular with the general patient population. Estimates of CAM use range from 32.4 percent among cancer patients in Haifa, 36 percent of patients 16 seen in primary care clinics and 50 percent among patients with chronic diseases. CAM use appears to 17 18 be increasing rapidly. In fact, Prof. Amir Schmueli of Hebrew University Medical School found that CAM use in Israel doubled between 1993 and 2007.19 In a study conducted in 2003 at Meyer Children's Hospital in Haifa, it was found that CAM was used by 61 percent of patients, with an average of three different treatments per patient. Usage was higher among those who had previously used CAM (85 percent), had a higher educational status (79 percent), and came from secular families (71 percent). Patients with a higher socioeconomic status tended to use chemical biological remedies as well as homeopathy, where those with a lower status mainly used traditional Arab treatments. Significantly, a beneficial effect was reported by 69 percent of CAM users, which is a high rate of satisfaction. Most pediatric cancer patients, regardless of ethnic origin, used CAM without informing their physicians. Although I have not seen this quantified, many Israeli doctors reported to me 20 a concomitant hostility on the part of Israeli patients towards conventional medicine. In 2005-2006, Dr. Eran Ben-Arye et al. conducted a survey of CAM usage in northern Israel in 2005-2006. The respondents were 58 percent Arab, 41.6 percent Jewish. Women were more likely to use CAM. He reported: \"Arab women reported less CAM use than Jewish women but were more interested in experiencing CAM, had a higher degree of confidence in CAM efficacy and safety, and more frequently supported the integration of CAM practitioners in primary care clinics.\"21 CAM and Family Medicine Family medicine doctors often practice CAM in Israel. Israel is considered to be a world leader in this sort of primary care. This contrasts sharply with the situation in the United States. From 1979 to 2007, family medicine declined by 40 percent as a residency choice in the US. By contrast, in Israel family medicine continues to be seen as a field that offers job flexibility, good work hours, and clear societal benefit.\"22 The number of medical students entering family medicine remained stable from 1980 to 1995 and, according to my informants, remains a highly desirable career path. One reason for this is that the gap between the salaries of family physicians and medical specialists is not nearly as great in Israel as it is in the US.23 CAM And Conventional Medicine Israel is one of the few countries that provides a wide array of CAM choice as part of its universal health coverage. This development is the official policy of both the public and private sectors. According to Moshe Frenkel, MD, \"The extent of CAM services provided to the general public is quite extensive, if not the most extensive CAM public system in the western world.\" I will note in passing that this 24 development contradicts the often-stated contention that socialized medicine necessarily spells the decline, if not the death, of non-conventional treatments.25 The US and Israel share another demographic characteristic, says Dr. Frenkel, who, before returning to Israel, was chief of the CAM department (\"A Place of Wellness\") at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, TX: both countries contain a large number of immigrants from diverse countries and cultures around the world. This multi-ethnicity, he claims, is one of the reasons that CAM is so popular in both countries. Figure 3 Moshe Frenkel Another important consideration is that, historically, health care in Israel is based on the principle of 'socialized' health care. I repeatedly found a suspicion of medical treatments that benefited the doctors who provided them. (Sometimes this hostility was mingled with concerns over quality or other factors.) According to Frenkel, however, there is an increasing number of health services that provided on a fee for-service basis (such as that of Dr. Joseph Brenner or Dr. Shimon Slavin, below). The cost of some of these may be covered by additional health insurance policies. But, in Israel, health care services on the whole are provided by four major health maintenance organizations (HMOs) that provide for the health care needs of the general population under a National Health Insurance Law passed in January 1995. This law assures that every citizen receive the basic necessary health care. This system provides extensive medical coverage through a large network comprising over a dozen hospitals, as well as many clinics and mother-and-child care centers. The quality of this medical care can be gauged by a life expectancy at birth of 82.8 for women and 78.5 for men or a total of 80.7. This is the eighth highest in the world; the US by comparison is 38th! The infant mortality rate of 4.7 per 1000 live births is lower than in the UK, the US, 26 Belgium, etc.27 In addition, the use of CAM is expanding (unlike in Germany, say, where government support has been shrinking for the past decade, and some CAM-oriented clinics have been forced to close their doors.) Due to public demand and as part of the competition to attract patients, says Frenkel, \"all the HMOs made a strategic decision in the mid-1990s to sponsor to some extent CAM outpatient clinics.\" These services are partially covered by optional supplementary insurance policies as well as self-pay. By the year 2000, 45% of the population had purchased the supplementary insurance, which covers CAM and some additional services not covered by the National Health Insurance Law. As a result, a 2015 survey found that 57% of respondents reported their intention of using CAM in the following year. [[1]](#ftnt1) In 1998, it was estimated that there were ~10,000 students in Israel who were participating in a variety of CAM training programs with ~100,000 graduates from CAM schools. According to the Ministry of Education, in 2001 there were over 100 CAM schools providing training in the various branches of CAM, with courses ranging from a few months to four years. If one extrapolates this to the general population, then 1 in every 60 persons in Israel has had some training in CAM use. This is an extraordinary level of involvement with CAM, probably greater than any other country in the world. The actual number of people making their living from CAM is of course much smaller, as a country of 7.3 million can hardly support ~100,000 alternative practitioners. However, there are about 5,500 actively practicing CAM in Israel at any one time. In addition, there is nearly one practitioner actively practicing per 1,000 population. These practitioners generally operate in private clinics on a fee-for-service basis. They may also operate in CAM outpatient clinics sponsored by the HMOs as well as at some public hospitals. As mentioned, all of the HMOs as well as some of the public hospitals have expanded their services and number of CAM clinics. Consequently, in the past few years it has been estimated that there are close to 100 regional CAM outpatient clinics covering the whole state of Israel with an average of about one CAM clinic to every 60,000 people. One cannot understand CAM use in Israel without understanding something about the basic structure of health care. In January 1995, a national health insurance law went into effect. This created a compulsory health care system that was based around four non-ben natan, Merav & Perelman, Maayan & Ben-Naftali, Gal. (2015). Factors Related to the Intention of Israelis to Use Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Journal of Holistic Nursing. 34. 10.1177/0898010115619088. governmental, non-profit service providers (i.e., HMOs). Clalit Health Services The largest of these is Clalit Health Service (CHS). Clalit is listed as the 172nd best hospital system in the 28 world, according to webometrics.info. According to the health system's own web site, every Clalit member pays in proportion to his or her income, and each is thereby entitled to the same quality and range of medical services. Clalit dates from 1911, when 150 immigrants pooled their resources to form a mutual aid health society. With the founding of the state of Israel in 1948 Clalit greatly expanded, especially in new immigrant neighborhoods. Clalit now covers health services for more than half of the Israeli population (3.8 million people from every ethnic and demographic group). Clalit has 14 hospitals and 1,200 primary and specialized clinics. It is the only health fund with a countrywide network of state-of the-art pharmacies, dental clinics, laboratories, diagnostic imaging and specialist centers. It also provides the largest CAM public service in Israel. Clalit has a particularly strong involvement with CAM. It operates 40 CAM clinic around the whole country, with 400 CAM practitioners providing over 1,000,000 treatments per year. Maccabi Health Services, the second largest HMO, has a similar system, which provides an additional 500,000 treatments per year. Public support for CAM is not limited to the civilian sector but is also characteristic of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, which sends military veterans to a large CAM clinic that is affiliated with the Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer. The broad public's interest in CAM has also affected academia. The interest in 29 CAM among health care providers is also quite high. As a result, there are a relatively large number of publications on this topic in the medical literature. Frenkel reports that there were 100 abstracts of scientific articles in PubMed written by Israeli authors between 1994-2004. This compared to 700 for the US, 200 for the UK, 120 for Canada and 85 for Germany. If we search using country names plus four representative search terms, acupuncture, herbalism, homeopathy and reflexology, we can get a more exact picture of the relative strengths of CAM research: Table 1 Research on Select CAM Topics in Five Countries |Israel||US||UK||Canada||Germany| |Acupuncture||88||1,061||283||192||365| |Herbalism||213||939||166||215||183| |Homeopathy||42||225||313||39||317| |Reflexology||65||691||186||183||213| Source: PubMed, September 2010 If we consider that the US population is 42 times greater than Israel's we get some idea of the extent of research on this topic. When it comes to homeopathy, for instance, the US would have to produce 1,764 papers (not 225) in order to match Israel's output. Put another way, Israel is outperforming the US in this topic by a factor of 8:1. These sort of facts and numbers, says Frenkel, \"make Israel an interesting place to study CAM integration in the conventional setting.\" He himself recently returned from a three-year stint at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston to practice CAM in Israel. \"Since the conventional medical system is closely related to the US in terms of medical education and clinical care,\" he adds, \" it would be quite appealing to study the lessons learned in these practices with their extensive experience compared to the limited integration that is currently happening in the US health care system.\" On a site visit, traveling with the financial support of the Reliable Cancer Treatments foundation, I found exactly this sort of open-minded attitude that I hoped for. In the course of this visit I saw 15 hospitals, clinics and laboratories. The types of facilities that I visited included: 1. CAM in the University/Private Practice Setting 2. CAM within an HMO Network 3. CAM in a Major Hospital 4. CAM in stand-alone private practices 5. CAM research and development facilities Jacob Shoham And Ka'MaH On a very hot day in July I met Jacob Shoham, MD, at his office at Bar Ilan University in Ramat Gan, outside Tel Aviv, Israel's largest and fastest growing university. The University is unusual in many respects, one of which is that it has a religious orientation. At its Web site it states: The university regards the sacred principles of Judaism as the manifestation of the Jewish people's uniqueness....\" At the same time, it proclaims its promotion of \"tolerance and coexistence between religious and secular, and Arab and Jewish students.\" At the same time, the university is a magnet for the orthodox Jewish community and the Israeli Arab population. Indeed, I was surprised to see a considerable number of Arab students, male and female, on campus. (At most of the CAM facilities I visited Jewish doctors went out of their way to affirm their commitment to both treat Arab patients and collaborate with Arab physicians, although their were frank about the difficulties involved in implementing such cooperation.) Shoham has been active in the cancer field for over 40 years. He is a well-known figure in American oncology, where he serves as the international editor of Integrative Cancer Therapies. Shoham reminded me that we met in 2000 in a very unlikely setting: a clinic in Tijuana that specializes in administering and teaching Max Gerson's dietary approach to cancer. Shoham was studiously taking notes and I hardly registered his presence. In retrospect, I think it is remarkable that such a distinguished physician/scientist would take the time and trouble to visit an obscure cancer clinic in Tijuana. Very few have, and I think this incident speaks volumes about the man and his character. Shoham has outstanding credentials: he earned his medical degree from Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School and his doctorate at the famed Weizmann Institute in Rehovot in 1970, working with Leo Sachs, MD, winner of both the Wolf Prize for medicine and the Israel Prize. Hebrew University and Weizmann are two of the top academic 30 centers in Israel (equivalent to Harvard and M.I.T. in the United States). In an earlier phase of his career, Shoham conducted numerous studies on interferon, mostly with Michel Revel's group there. Figure 4 Jacob Shoham Shoham is board certified in internal medicine in both Israel and the U.S. and is also a board certified oncologist/hematologist in the U.S. He has also completed studies in Nutritional Medicine, Medical Ecology, Clinical Immunology, Chinese and Western Herbal Medicine, Psycho-oncology, medical hypnosis and Mind-Body Medicine. His research focus is in cancer and immunology. In the past he served as a senior physician at the Sheba Medical Center and Vice-President of R&D at Interpharm, a pioneering Israeli pharmaceutical company. He was a member of the Israeli National Committee for Biomedical Research Policy. He is currently developing the conceptual and practical foundations of Health-Promoting Medicine in addition to his clinical work in his private clinic, emphasizing recruitment of inner healing forces, and his research at Bar-Ilan University on cancer therapies. Shoham is also Chairman of the \"KaMaH\" Association's Executive Committee and serves as the Center's Medical and Scientific Director. In the U.S., he studied at the Cold Spring Harbor laboratory and in the 1970s was a fellow at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, NY, one of the most venerable cancer centers in the US. But somewhere along the line he became disillusioned with this exclusive focus on conventional medicine. \"We were bringing people to the door of death,\" he told me. \"People died of the treatment.\" He decided that he couldn't do this anymore. When he returned to Israel he went to work as a senior physician at the Chaim Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer. This functions as Israel's national medical center in many fields. In 1985, Shoham lost 31 his first wife to ovarian cancer, which was discovered when it was already in stage IV. This needless to say gave him a new perspective on cancer and what patients endure. He says that his main mission is to understand cancer better. The medical status quo won't yield big solutions, he says. He sees the struggle as one of complex systems vs. the prevailing reductionism in most of science. Although he currently serves as an emeritus professor at The Mina & Everard Goodman Faculty of Life Sciences, most of his energy are presently tied up in promoting the formation KaMaH, a project of the 32 Israel Center for Health Promoting Therapies. KaMaH aim is to enable individuals suffering from severe health problems to recover and heal, by using Health-Promoting Therapies. The organization's motto is taken of Moses Maimonides (1135-1202 CE): \"In let me always see the human being.\" Shoham interprets this to mean the following: 1. Let me approach the patient with respect, empathy, compassion, and hope. 2. Let me see his enormous capacity to take responsibility, to heal himself, to transform and to grow. 3. Let me see the patient as a unique whole. Although Shoham is the driving force, the idea of KaMaH has attracted very prominent physicians, therapists and scientists in Israel. He projects that the clinic will be in the hills surrounding Jerusalem. He wants international patients to come there for (a) health promotion, (b) combating of disease and (c) to provide motivation to patients to live longer and healthier lives. One of Shoham's mentors is Lawrence LeShan, who is famous for his promotion of mind-body medicine in cancer. This KaMaH project seems most worthy of support. Shoham is one of the Israeli doctors involved in the clinic trial of GcMAF (see below). The idea behind this treatment makes sense to him. He believes that this follows in the footsteps of William B. Coley. The idea is to change the macrophage from being a tumor promoter in cancer to a tumor killer. It is a carrier molecule for vitamin D. A substance called nagalase inactivates GcMAF. Tumor cells produce nagalase. Nagalase thus protects tumor cells from immune attack by macrophages. According to Jacob Shoham, \"all the curves with GC-MAF look too good to be true.\" Dr. Yamamoto, the inventor of the treatment, has neer seen a failure. But where is the data? The developers of GcMAF have gotten permission for a phase II study but are waiting for the Ministry of Health approval. Shoham told me he will be involved in both the design and follow-up studies. The fact that KaMaH is non-profit is very important in the Israeli context. It removes the suspicion that the motive behind such a venture is selfish or exploitative. KaMaH is not a hospital. It is an outpatient clinic that provides medical treatments that systematically integrate non-medical means of promoting healing and recovery. Joseph Brenner, MD, Tel Aviv Joseph Brenner, MD, is arguably the best-known CAM practitioner in Israel. He has had a high profile controversy with the leaders of the medical board in Israel and as a consequence became a well known figure in the news. Despite this, he is a board-certified oncologist at an Israeli hospital, but also maintains a private CAM clinic in Tel Aviv. Born in Israel, he studied medicine at the University of Siena, Italy, for three years. In 1971, he received his medical degree from Tel-Aviv University in Israel. Figure 5 Joseph Brenner For the following five years Dr. Brenner completed a Residency Fellowship in Internal Medicine and Oncology at Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer. The following year he received a fellowship in radiation oncology at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. He followed this with a fellowship in medical oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), New York, New York. After returning to Israel in 1982, he held the post of head of medical oncology until 2000 at the Wolfson Medical Center in Holon (south of Tel Aviv). Despite (or because of) this long involvement with conventional oncology, Dr. Brenner has maintained a deep interest in CAM approaches to cancer. As a result, he has sought out training in such diverse fields as acupuncture, homeopathy, Reiki, applied kinesiology, dark field and oxidative test microscopy, German electro-acupuncture testing (EAV), nutrition and more. Brenner is the founder director of the New Hope clinic, an outpatient center for biologic and metabolic non-toxic medicine in oncology, in Tel-Aviv. At this Center, he implements the new techniques developedin Europe and the United States, such as superficial, regional, and whole body hyperthermia. He is more or less synonymous with the use of hyperthermia in Israel. In the past, Brenner has been closely associated with the late Prof. Luigi Di Bella, MD, of Modena, Italy, who treated more than 10,000 cancer patients with a unique method combining the drug somatostatin with high melatonin. He has also collaborated closely with Friedrich Douwes, MD, of the St. Georg Hospital in Bad Aibling, Germany. Brenner recently installed the Oncothermia 3000, the most advanced hyperthermia (also called oncothermia) equipment available, manufactured by Andras Szasz, PhD of Budapest. He typically combines this with insulin potentiation therapy (IPT) and hyperthermia (which he believes to be a good combination) as well as high-dose vitamin C infusions. He has started to use GC-MAF. He uses galvanotherapy externally, putting electrodes above and below the tumor. Brenner is well known for his battle with the Israeli Medical Association. He initiated a libel suit against the four top medical doctors in the IMA. He says he had no choice but to do this because his reputation would have been ruined if he had failed to respond to their insults and provocations. After seven years of litigation the cause was essentially fought to a draw. He has a kind of split personality. In the mornings he is a regular oncologist. In the afternoon he runs his personal clinic. The clinic, he says, is busy enough. After 15 years of giving hyperthermia he feels confident in the methodology and says he gets very nice results. As an oncologist, he knows very well what constitutes a result. For instance, he has recently seen a patient who had a CA 19-9 marker go down from 50,000 to under 1,000. He also had a patient whose bilirubin went from 7 to 0.8. Whole body hyperthermia costs $3-4,000 per session, and local-regional hyperthermia is $400 per treatment. An IV infusion of vitamin C is $400-500. Brenner says the costs of treatment at his clinic are similar to those in Europe. That may be true for some clinics (such as St. Georg.) But at the I.W.I.T. in Vienna a long duration hyperthermia treatment is less than half that, i.e., $1,292 and $231 for a local regional hyperthermia treatment. An IV vitamin C infusion there is $109.) I raise this question of costs because most of the criticism I heard of Brenner on this trip had to do with the allegedly high cost of his treatment, which contrasts with most Israeli medicine which is covered by the insurance plans.) Brenner gives whole body hyperthermia weekly for three weeks, and then the patient takes two months off. He says that he does not generally like whole body hyperthermia. He considers it risky because if there are brain metastases you can kill the patient. He claims to have seen that happen in Europe. He also can't treat patients with high blood pressure, heart or lung conditions. He doesn't sedate the patients and he goes to 40.5\u00ba C (104.9\u00ba F) not to 41.5\u00ba C (106.7\u00ba F), where there is a need to sedate the patients. He keeps an anaesthesiologist present when he does WBH. He claims to be able to shrink or stabilize the tumor in 50-60 percent of cases using these more natural methods. He tests markers after one month of treatment and CT scans after two months. Hadassah Hospital, Ein Kedem (Jerusalem) One of the big surprises of my visit was Hadassah Hospital in Ein Kedem, a Western suburb of Jerusalem. First, for clarification, there are two Hadassah Hospital. The original one is located on Mt. Scopus, overlooking the northeast of Jerusalem, which was built in the 1930s by the Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, one of the largest Jewish organizations in the world, with some 300,000 members. In 1948, the road to Mt. Scopus was blockaded by the Jordanian army. In 1960-1961, Hadassah built another hospital in Ein Karem, an 800 bed tertiary care facility to the southwest of the city. This is where the medical school is located and also where I visited the complementary medicine team. Mt. Scopus was eventually recaptured by the Israelis in the Six Day War and now primarily serves the Arab population of East Jerusalem. Hadassah Hospital is ranked #1 in Israel and #158 in the world, according to the webometrics.info Web site. It is ranked the leading medical center in the entire Middle East (its closest competitor is the Hadad 33 Medical Corporation in Doha, Qatar.) To put this in perspective, this world ranking puts it ahead of L'Institut Curie in Paris, Shriner's Hospital for Children in the US, and Dana-Farber Cancer Center in Boston. Hadassah offers state-of-the-art treatment, with excellent physicians and advanced medical and surgical staff and equipment. It participates in many clinical trials and has a strong relationship to US medicine. (It is actually a hybrid Israeli- American institution and is a member of the American Hospital Association.34 One also meets many American and Canadian physicians there.) In 1990, Hadassah became the first hospital in Israel to open a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) clinic. This was two years before the founding of the Office of Alternative Medicine at the US National Institutes of Health, now the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. There was a certain irony to this, as Hadassah has a reputation as Israel's most high tech hospital. This clinic offers both traditional and complementary medicine, with a unique way of approaching patients' needs and providing optimal treatment that draws on both traditions. This was the brainchild of Martine Toledano, M.D. - Director of Integrative Medicine of Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem and head of research discipline and Director of Acupuncture studies Hebrew University, Jerusalem. The CAM clinic operates entirely within the framework of the Medical Center. This allows for a close contact between staff and patients, and also allows access to the advanced laboratory and imaging facilities of the hospital. At present, more than 1,000 patients use the clinic's services monthly, a third of whom are new patients. I also met with Ruth Radiano, RN, and colleagues in the Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cancer Immunotherapy. They have developed a program of improving symptom management by the use of reflexology in bone marrow transplant patients. Her colleagues are Reuven Or, M. Lafair and Martine Toledano. Toledano is the heart and soul of the CAM program at Hadassah (and the pioneer of integrative medicine in Israel as a whole). She has a charismatic personality, and combines a profound knowledge and enthusiasm for CAM with a realistic recognition of its strengths and weaknesses. \"What's important is recognizing your limits,\" says Toledano. \"Sometimes, conventional therapy is the best way. A choking child needs an Emergency Room, for example. A cancer patient needs chemotherapy.\" Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) must receive pretransplant conditioning. This involved high doses of combined chemoradiotherapy. After the transplant, the side effects of this treatment can be further increased by neutropenia-associated infections, gastrointestinal mucositis and Graft vs Host Disease (GVHD). In addition to the physician symptoms, patients understandably suffer various negative emotional responses such as stress, anxiety and far. The staff decided to use reflexology (a special kind of foot massage) in order to try and relieve these symptoms. The medical and nursing teams hold a conference to decide on integrating reflexology into the conventional treatment plan. Patients then receive individualized reflexology sessions twice per week from licensed professionals. Reflexology has been shown to improve the patients' quality of life but diminishing the side effects of chemotherapy, including nausea, vomiting, pain, anxiety and insomnia. It affects the whole cycle of Activities of Daily Living. In addition to the usual MRI scans, organ transplantation and chemotherapy, the complementary department uses a baker's dozen of other treatments: 1. Acupuncture 2. Alexander method 3. Aromatherapy 4. Auricular therapy 5. Biofeedback 6. Craniosacral therapy 7. Homeopathy 8. Mesotherapy 9. Naturopathy 10. Osteopathy 11. Phytotherapy 12. Reflexology 13. Tai-chi - \"At a first consultation, we give a patient a full conventional medical examination,\" Toledano has said. - \"We take a medical history, and review the X-rays, CT-scans or biochemical test results \u2014 and possibly request additional tests. But we also do a less conventional study: we may look at length at the foot, or the iris, or examine the energy in the ear.\"35 In fact, oncology was the first entry point for CAM at Hadassah. \"Most of our patients look for other options at some point during their long and difficult treatment,\" said Prof. Tamar Peretz, head of Hadassah's Sharett Institute of Oncology. \"Some seek help in fighting their illness or in coping with therapy; others want alternatives to conventional treatment. Not only are these patients entitled to every viable treatment option, but homeopathy and reflexology are known to markedly diminish side effects of chemotherapy in many patients.\" Needless to say, such statements would be highly unusual coming 36 from a leading academic oncologist in the US. - \"Today, about half of all oncology patients come to our clinic for help in offsetting side-effects of treatment,\" says Toledano. \"And they do it knowing they have the full support of their oncologists.\" Originally started in 1989, the Complementary Medicine Unit was a kind of 'stepchild' of the medical center. Its mandate was to use \"all treatments and therapies not included under conventional medicine.\" Then, in 2008 (?), because of the excellent relations between the CAM doctors and the regular staff, it was invited into the main hospital. The service quickly took off, and was soon handling 1,000 cases per month. These included difficult problems that had eluded conventional doctors for years: a woman with crippling fear and anxiety following mastectomy, for instance. \"People with problems like these will understandably do or pay almost anything for hope or relief,\" says Toledano. \"If conventional medicine hasn't helped them, many will look to comprehensive medicine.\" She points out that in Israel, as in the US, patients frequently hide their CAM usage from their conventional doctors, because of fear of censure, rejection or denial of services. But this can result in dangerous or even disastrous drug interactions. There is also the problem of charlatanism, which has bedeviled the field of complementary medicine from its inception. But administering CAM within Hadassah itself, and adhering to the ethical and scientific standards of a modern medical center, these problems all but disappear. Recently, the Unit was given permission to open and run clinics in every field for which there was reliable evidence-based research that complementary medicine is effective. During the course of my visit, Dr. Toledano took me to the various clinics that are currently offering CAM to their patients. This included not just adult and pediatric oncology but gynecology, neurology, orthopedics and the pain clinic. \"The list of disciplines is growing all the time.\" Figure 6 Avraham Abehsera, MD \"Complementary medicine is based on a different physics, chemistry and biology, and on a different patient/therapist relationship from conventional medicine,\" says Avraham Abehsera, MD, a senior physician in Hadassah's Complementary Medicine Unit. \"That means the protocols used in conventional medical research are unsuitable - and makes it hard to convince the skeptics.\" Conventional medicine tends to treat all patients with similar diagnoses the same. But in complementary medicine, Toledano says, the treatment tends to vary with the individual patient. It is a customized medicine. \"If a woman comes to me with an intractable headache that responds neither to Voltaren (diclofenac) nor to pain-blocks, I have several choices,\" she says. \"If this patient sits and weeps and tells me she can no longer bear her headache because she's already burdened by problems at work or at home, I may recommend biofeedback. If her headaches began after a car accident or strenuous exercise, I'll recommend a mechanical response, such as osteopathy. If she has painful menstruation in addition to her aching head, I'll think in terms of a polysystemic problem, and start her on acupuncture.\" The Unit is plagued by some of the same problems as CAM units in other countries\u2014a lack of money for documenting and researching promising results. \"We've totally cleared patients of psoriasis lesions,\" says Toledano. \"We've reduced back pain so radically that patients no longer require surgery. Several dozen women with unexplained infertility have become pregnant following acupuncture in our Unit. These are exciting results and we'd like to investigate them in full.\" Nonetheless, the Unit continues to grow. \"It's clear from both the demand for complementary medicine and its successes that some additional form of treatment is needed,\" Toledano says. \"Complementary medicine techniques add therapeutic tools to the doctor's arsenal, often giving patients very great benefit at very low risk. Today, most doctors recognize there are many ways to help a patient, and understand that complementary medicine approaches are among those ways. My dream,\" she adds, \"is to see a new approach to patient care - known, perhaps, as integrative medicine - which embraces both conventional and non-conventional therapies. Gil Bar-Sela (Haifa) I visited Gil Bar-Sela, MD, an integrative oncologist at the RAMBAM Health Care Campus in Haifa. Bar Sela is a graduate of the Ben Gurion University Faculty of Medicine in Beer Sheva, who obtained his oncology training at Rambam Medical Center in Haifa. In addition, he has trained in complementary medicine at two of the outstanding CAM centers in Europe: the Anthroposophical center in Dornach, Switzerland and at the Witten Herdecke University, the only accredited private university in Germany. Figure 7 Gil Bar-Sela During 2006 Bar-Sela worked in research at the Radiation Oncology Branch of the National Cancer Institute - NCI, Bethesda, Maryland. He is currently a Senior Physician in the Oncology Department and leads the supportive care services in the division. Gil's main research and clinical interests are the basic research of the epigenome and the clinical field of integrative medicine in oncology treatment.37 Bar-Sela provides what he calls supportive oncology services to his patients. He has a nurse who covers the booking of patients in the outpatient department. As a regular oncologist he did not have a lot of time for patients. Now that he is doing complementary medicine he has more time, between 40 minutes and 1 hour for each patient. He always sees each patient with a nurse. If he is seeing someone who is not his oncology patient he tries not to contradict the recommendations of the other oncologist. The first thing to determine is what the symptoms are. He also wants to know if the patient is using any non-conventional treatments. He usually starts with Anthroposophical medicine. They are using Iscador (mistletoe) in the hospital with IRB (Helsinki) permission. In his private clinic he has seen some decline in patients' tumor markers using mistletoe. The Rambam Hospital in Bat Galim, Haifa, was founded in 1938 and is the largest medical center in northern Israel. Rambam serves as a referral medical center, which treats 75,000 in patients each year. An additional 500,000 are treated as outpatients. The Technion's medical school is located next to the hospital. At Rambam, Israeli patients are treated free of charge. This is considered normal in Israel. The patients are not allowed by law to pay for a treatment on the same day (?). If it's free, however, they can give CAM treatment on the same day during their regular treatment. Bar-Sela comments that in Israel CAM is closely integrated into the various cancer centers. This allows patients to get both conventional and complementary safely, a major consideration. The situation in Israel, he says, is unique because there is more freedom for the doctors and less regulations than in the US; nonetheless, the various unconventional treatments are given at the big centers and not in small clinics (as often happens in the US). A great deal of research is done in Israel. \"Personally, the research I am doing now with mistletoe in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) failed to recruit a sufficient number of patients in Germany because of the requirement that it be randomized. In addition, the ongoing studies here using wheatgrass juices in conjunction with chemotherapy, curcumin (a turmeric extract) with the standard drug gemcitabine, mistletoe extracts in ascites, and so forth, are all unique.\" Bar-Sela consults for patients from abroad, mainly from East Europe, the US and South Africa. He mainly tries to help them via email and by giving them directions for medications and referrals to physicians working in their respective countries. In the next five years, Bar-Sela said, there will be a floor for CAM at Rambam in the new oncology building. The problem is that the hospital administration must first build an emergency 500-bed underground hospital under the proposed new hospital building. I was told that this was a result of a rocket attack on downtown Haifa in 2006. Although Haifa seemed peaceful enough, the prospect of rockets or worse coming from the northern border is ever present. Eran Ben-Arye (Haifa) Another Haifa researcher of note with whom I met was Eran Ben-Arye, MD. Ben-Arye is an expert in complementary therapies and on the general topic of physician-patient relations and of the attitude of health personnel towards CAM. Since 2001, he has been the author of 37 PubMed-listed articles on complementary medicine. Many of these are co authored with Moshe Frenkel (who lives in a nearby town and has close links to Haifa.) Figure 8 Eran Ben-Arye He led the first course in Israel in integrative medicine for oncologists in 2002. He has dual training in complementary medicine and family medicine. Ben-Arye has had an exceptional education in CAM. He did a fellowship with Brian Berman, MD, at the University of Maryland's CAM department. Ben-Arye taught the course on CAM for fourth year medical students. He has studied homeopathy and Ayurvedic medicine. He did studies on herbal medicine at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. He studied the so-called French school of homeopathy, using low dilutions. He finds homeopathy to be a very practical type of treatment to use with his patients. He also studied Anthroposophical medicine in Arlesheim. Ben-Arye is also associated with the Harduf kibbutz, which is located in the Lower Galilee, not far from Haifa. This kibbutz, which pioneered organic food in Israel, was established in 1982 by followers of Rudolf Steiner. The name Harduf means \"oleander\" (ironic, considering that oleander is used in some countries as a cancer medicine called Anvirzel). The Kibbutz members live according to Steiner's anthroposophy philosophy. Harduf has several well-known health centers: Beit Elisha, for the rehabilitation of adults with special needs; Tuvia, for young people who have been removed from their homes and need a foster family; and Hiram, which helps young people who are suffering from emotional problems.38 In his clinic in Haifa, Dr. Ben-Arye uses an interesting combination of herbal medicine, Chinese medicine (including acupuncture), homeopathy, folk and traditional remedies, dietary/nutritional therapy (including nutritional supplements), chiropractic, movement/manual healing therapies (including massage, reflexology, yoga, and Alexander and Feldenkrais techniques), mind-body techniques (including meditation, guided imagery, and relaxation), energy and healing therapies, and other naturopathic therapies (ibid.). In 2002, Ben-Arye was first author of one of the few randomized controlled trials on the use of wheat grass juice, for distal ulcerative colitis. Twenty-one patients completed this study, and full information was available on 19 of them. Treatment with wheat grass juice was associated with significant reductions in overall disease activity as well as severity of rectal bleeding. There were no serious side effects associated with this treatment. The healing effect was ascribed to its antioxidant potential.39 He sees complementary medicine as a way to improve medicine as a whole ,to change things at their roots. All the CAM treatments done in Ben-Arye's program is free of charge. This is especially important for reassuring people in Israel, who are suspicious of fee-for-service medicine. This is labor intensive work. There is a one-hour intake process to evaluate their needs. Patients are then enrolled in a clinical trial. Most patients come to 10 to 20 CAM sessions. The treatment is always tailored to the patient. Shimon Slavin and the ICTC Shimon Slavin, MD, is one of the most accomplished cancer doctors in Israel, especially among those who are associated with the use of integrative oncology. Slavin is the author of 300+ PubMed-listed articles on cancer. A graduate of Hadassah Hebrew University School of Medicine in Jerusalem in 1967, he is board certified in internal medicine (1970-1975) and took advanced training in clinical immunology at Stanford University, Palo Alto, California and Seattle's Bone Marrow Transplant Center at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington. Upon returning to Israel in 1978, he opened the first bone marrow transplantation (BMT) unit. This was officially recognized as Israel's first National BMT Center, of which he was the first and long-term chairman In 1980 he also established the first center for stem cell transplantation in Israel. Slavin has attracted patients and as well as medical disciples from around the world. Two years ago, he left his post at Hadassah (although he retains an academic appointment at the Hebrew University School of Medicine) to establish a private clinic in Tel Aviv. This clinic is called the International Center for Cell Therapy & Cancer (ICTC). Although some Web sites state that his center is located \"at the Tel Aviv Medical Center,\" I discovered that this is a misnomer. 40 ICTC is physically located adjacent to the Sourasky Medical Center. But it has no affiliation with that hospital. It is a private fee-for-service clinic. Figure 9 Shimon Slavin Slavin believes that the immune system is capable of killing cancer, but only when the tumor has been reduced (via the usual ablative means) to a state he calls \"minimal residual disease.\" This means that any metastases are in a small and probably non-detectable state. At that point, the immune system can be activated to wipe out these small but potentially dangerous nests of malignancy. One way of doing this is to administer a drug that unblocks the immune system's attack on cancer. Slavin believes that this can be done with a substance in the aspirin family. It has been shown that people who use aspirin or similar nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents regularly have a diminished chance of developing cancers of various kinds. He has co-authored papers on the use of the NSAID indomethacin (Indocid, Indocin, etc.) in inducing immunity in mice. This drug is frequently used to diminish the symptoms of arthritis. \"Tumor-free immune mice that were given indomethacin for more than 300 days remained healthy with normal white blood cell counts and normal spleen size.\"41,42,43 Indomethacin has potential as an adjuvant anticancer agent. Here is what the National Cancer Institute has to say about this drug: \"A synthetic nonsteroidal indole derivative with anti-inflammatory anti-inflammatory formation by heterocyclic aromatic amines. This agent also may inhibit the expression of multidrug-resistant protein type 1, resulting in increased efficacies of some antineoplastic agents in treating multi-drug resistant tumors. In addition, indomethacin activates phosphatases that inhibit the migration and proliferation of cancer cells and downregulates survivin, which may result in tumor cell apoptosis.\" In the US, indomethacin is only available by prescription. One attractive fact about this drug is that it is inexpensive. At the Israeli drug exporting Website, www.israelpharm.com, 30 x 25 mg capsules of Indocid sell for $10 (plus s&h), or 33\u00a2 per capsule. The normal dose for treating arthritis is 2 or 3 x 25 mg capsules per day (~$1 per day). The maximum dose is 200 mg per day. Even at this high dose, the cost of the drug is just $2 per day. Thus, for a drug with promising anticancer activity this is a \"bargain.\" Another treatment that Dr. Slavin sometimes recommends is a natural cytokine named interleukin-2 (IL-2). In a recombinant form, this is a standard immunotherapy for kidney cancer and melanoma. It has been used experimentally to treat a variety of other cancer types. Dr. Slavin finds it useful in conjunction with cell therapy (q.v.) to improve the outcome of leukemia patients. Dr. Slavin employs a combination of BMT or stem cell transplantation and IL-2. He can pretreat lymphocytes (particularly T cells and natural killer cells) with IL-2 in order to give them an enhanced ability to attack and destroy remaining tumor cells. Slavin likes to pose hypothetical situations in order to explain his treatment approach. For instance, he points out that normally a tumor transplanted from a cancer patient into a healthy stranger will not \"take.\" Within a few days the normal immune system would energetically attack these stranger's tumor cells and wipe them out. This is similar to how a transplanted organ is typically rejected by the host when there is a poor \"match\" between donor and host. Slavin's original idea was to use lymphocytes (immune cells) that are taken from the blood of a healthy person, activate them in the laboratory, and then administer them to the cancer patient. Since these lymphocytes are able to destroy foreign tumors in their own body, why can they not also kill a tumor in another person's body? These cells are called \"activated donor lymphocytes.\" Slavin finds that this is a very effective way to wipe out a relatively small number of malignant cells often remaining in the body of a person who has been treated for cancer. Why not use this against large tumors? The reason is that the \"activated donor lymphocytes\" would have to remain for weeks and months in the body of the patient in order to do this. But the obvious difficulty is that the patient's immune system senses the presence of these donor cells, identifies them as foreign, and kills them before they have a chance to destroy the tumor. Slavin's way around this logistical problem in \"donor lymphocyte infusion\" (DLI) is to make the patient tolerant of the donor cells, for a long enough time that the cells can destroy the tumor cells. This is accomplished with a rather elaborate procedure. First, the bulk of the cancer has to be eliminated (through surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, etc.) Second, the patient's bone marrow is destroyed and then replaced by newly grafted blood stem cells from the donor. In this way, the patient becomes tolerant of the donor's lymphocytes. At this point, the patient is ready for a transfusion of activated lymphocytes from the donor. These are the cells designed to finish off the last cancer cell. Slavin says that this kind of treatment has been used successfully in thousands of patients. He points with pride to one of the first cases, a two-and-a-half year old toddler with leukemia who had gone through many forms of conventional treatment. This included radiation given at four times the lethal dose and treatment with some of the most poisonous drugs known to man. He survived the treatment, but unfortunately the cancer returned with visible tumor masses on his forehead and next to his trachea, threatening to close his airway. As a last desperate measure, once per week for six weeks the little boy was given an injection of blood from his sister. Amazingly, the tumor masses disappeared and the young boy was completely cured! He is in fact still alive and well, more than 20 years after the fact. Since that time many patients (most of them with leukemias or lymphomas) have been treated in a similar fashion, sometimes using short-lived donor lymphocytes or else more long-lived donor lymphocytes after tolerance has been induced by a stem-cell transplantation. In the above mentioned case, tolerance of the foreign blood was made possible because the boy underwent BMT, and so his immune system became tolerant of his sister's blood. Her blood then did the work of killing off his cancer, a fine example of sisterly love! Today, because of improvements in technology, DLI can be performed without performing a BMT or finding an immunological match. In fact, Slavin says, mismatched donor lymphocytes are actually preferred because the greater the mismatch, the strong the anticancer effect of the donor lymphocytes. The cells that are most desirable are the donor's \"natural killer\" (or NK) cells. This is because T-cells (a broader category of white blood cells) would attack all of the patient's cells, including normal ones, in a potentially disastrous process called graft vs. host disease (GVHD), NK cells do not cause this problem, even if they are fully mismatched. Therefore, Slavin says one can separate out the harmful effects of GVHD from the beneficial type of graft-vs-tumor effects by first separating the NK cells from the T-cells and only then injecting the former into the body. The selection of NK cells is effected using antibodies that are bound to metal beads that specifically bind only to NK cells. These are then removed through the use of a special magnetic device called a CliniMACS\u00ae Cell Separation System (from Miltenyi Biotech). Alternately, they can remove the T-cells by using antibodies against the latter. As a medical school professor Prof. Slavin is hardly hostile to chemotherapy. However, he recognizes that oftentimes patients die not of their tumors per se but from the complications of the high doses of cytotoxic drugs used to kill those tumors. He has therefore developed a protocol that is intended to use lymphocytes from intentionally mismatched donors to eliminate any residual cancer cells that have escaped from the conventional treatments at an early stage of the disease. This can reduce the amount of drugs that a patient must take, minimize the risk of developing resistance to drugs, and also treat them while their immune systems are still intact. It is a promising method for patients with minimal residual disease. Slavin recognizes the limits of DLI, however. It seems to be effective for some patients, he says, particularly in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and some other hematological tumors. But it may not be effective against rapidly developing or relapsing malignancies and also against bulky disease. In addition to these original methods, Slavin is also employing a number of other innovative treatments. For instance, he creates a vaccine against cancer using the patient's only surgically removed cells, modifying them slightly, and then reintroducing them into the body. Alternately, he can use cancer cells of the same histological type, but from a different patient, to use as a vaccine to induce an immune response against the patient's own cancer cells. He also uses antibodies to target cancer cells. They are first bound to the surface of natural killer (NK) cells and then hone in on specific markers on the surface of the cancer cell. This brings the NK cell into close proximity to the cancer cell, leading to the elimination of the malignant cell. Lately, Slavin has been experimenting with an antibody that can deliver both NK cells and T-cells to the site of the tumor. He is also working with an antibody that binds to a T-cell and a human melanoma cell. This is being mass-produced in transgenic cows that have been cloned by a German scientist, Gottfried Brem, an expert on genetically modified animals. All of the antibodies removed from that cow's blood will be capable of destroying human melanoma cells. In addition, this ability will be passed along to their offspring, thus ensuring an almost limitless supply of what Slavin calls \"anticancer smart bombs.\" Slavin is also working with Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) Vaccine as a potential treatment for cancer. This virus, which is deadly in poultry, is apathogenic in humans. These sometimes attack cancer selectively, which results in their replication inside the cancer and ends in the death of the affected cell. At the same time, this process releases new viruses in the vicinity of the tumor. These viruses pass the blood brain barrier and have been observed to cause remissions even in glioblastoma multiforme. While these observations are well-known, it has proven difficult to produce a pharmaceutical grade NDV and to get rigorous clinical trials in motion. (Attempts continue to be made in this direction at Slavin's former institution, Hadassah Hospital.) Although immunotherapy has made great strides around the world, as a general rule it is only used when every other conventional treatment has failed. \"This is too late for a cure to be expected,\" says Slavin. \"One can only anticipate more successful treatments if they were administered at an early stage of the disease against minimal tumor burden.\" He says that prospective randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to prove the value of such procedures. Efranat and GC-MAF Technically speaking, GcMAF is not an Israeli treatment. This treatment was developed in Philadelphia and Japan. I write about it here because, step-by-step, it has evolved into something of an Israeli treatment because of the involvement of Israeli entrepreneurs, scientists and patients. GcMAF is a naturally occurring substance. Nobuto Yamamoto, PhD, of Philadelphia, proposed it as a cancer treatment. It is based on the observation that intratumoral injections of Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) can result in the regression of local, as well as metastasized, tumors. This suggests the development of specific immunity against tumors. However, the inflammation of normal tissue does not result in any significant effect on tumors. Yamamoto has concluded that \"high activated macrophages are tumoricidal\" and that inflammation in cancerous tissue can cure the disease. (See resemblance to Rigdon Lentz here). Highly activated macrophages, he says, have the potential to kill and eradicate cancer cells. The activation of macrophages requires a serum vitamin D binding protein (known as Gc protein) as well as the participation of B and T lymphocytes. By a series of steps, Yamamoto has derived a compound (b galactosidase) from inflammation-primed B cells that yields a macrophage pro-activating factor. This in turn is converted by T cells to yield the macrophage activating factor (MAF). Gc protein is thus a precursor for the principal MAF. But this MAF precursor activity is lost or reduced because cancer patients' serum Gc protein is destroyed (deglycosylated) by a substance called \"serum a-N acetylgalactosaminidase\" or Nagalase, for short. This is secreted from cancerous cells. According to Yamamoto, serum Nagalase is proportional to tumor burden. (One problem is that all of the work done on this topic has been done by Yamamoto and his colleagues.) A lack of macrophage activation, he says, leads to immune suppression. Patients with advanced cancer have sera that contains a lot of Nagalase activity and a corresponding loss of MAF precursor activity. This helps explain why patients with advanced cancer also have severe immune suppression (which can lead to death by overwhelming infections, such as pneumonia). However, the theory (if not the clinical results) behind GC-MAF has been questioned by other competent researchers. As stated, Yamamoto's theory is that vitamin D binding protein (DBP) is deglycosylated in cancer patients, which eliminates GcMAF. However, in 2009 Douglas S Rehder, et al of Arizona State University, Tempe, showed that \"there was no significant depletion of DBP trisaccharide glycosylation in the 56 cancer patients examined relative to healthy controls.\" Thus, if GCMAF truly works clinically, as 44 suggested in Yamamoto's previous papers, it is probably not through the mechanisms suggested in his papers. As Rehder et al summarize: The precursor for GcMAF \"circulates in abundant quantities (comparable to that observed in healthy individuals) in the blood of breast, colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer patients, making it unlikely that it is a depleted GcMAF precursor in cancer patients. Alternative hypotheses regarding the molecular and/or structural origins of GcMAF must be considered to explain the relative inability of cancer patient serum to activate macrophages.\"45 Conclusions My visit to Israeli complementary and alternative (CAM) doctors and clinics in the summer of 2010 was full of surprises. The greatest of these was the degree to which I observed CAM to be integrated into conventional health care. This was most evident at Israel's largest and most prestigious health organizations: Hadassah Hospital and the Clalit system (Israel's largest HMO). At Hadassah this was largely due to the two decades of work by Martine Toledano, MD, at Hadassah, where step by step CAM has entered the former bastions of conventional medicine (surgery, pediatric oncology, internal medicine, etc.) and earned the trust of medical colleagues in these disciplines. It was astonishing to see such CAM modalities as homeopathy, reflexology, acupuncture, and medical marijuana being embraced as part of standard medicine. More to the point, I found a genuine openness to CAM among the various department heads with whom I met. One of them even said that she saw CAM as not just interesting in its own right, but as the future of medicine. One can find such sentiments expressed by CAM practitioners in the US, but I am unaware of any leaders of conventional medicine who has expressed this view. In this sense, Israel is a very forward-looking country, pragmatically in favor of whatever works. It truly earns its sobriquet of the \"start-up nation.\" Another surprising development is the degree to which CAM has found a home in the four major HMOs, particularly Clalit. There is a widespread perception in the US that managed care is antithetical to complementary medicine. In Israel, however, the HMOs are competing among themselves as to who can provide the most comprehensive CAM services. This has led to an enormous expansion of CAM services that are available to the average patient. Finally, Israel is also seeing the rise of some very interesting fee-for-service options. Most noteworthy are the private Tel Aviv clinics of Joseph Brenner and of Shimon Slavin. The cost of these are prohibitive for many Israelis (and the idea of fee-for-service treatment is repugnant to many others). But these facilities might grow in number and importance, especially if they can attract a growing number of international patients in the future. The KaMaH clinic, or a consortium of Haifa CAM doctors, might bridge the gap by providing innovative cancer treatments, with an international appeal, under the aegis of a non-profit foundation.
