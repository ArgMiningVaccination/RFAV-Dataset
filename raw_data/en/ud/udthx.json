In the first year (Part A) of the course, students will be taught theoretical knowledge and practical skills in contemporary biotechnology-related topics, and the processes involved in obtaining research funding and translating biomedical products from lab to life. In the second year (Part B) of the course, students who have 70% and above average in their first-year studies will have the opportunity to undertake either a 3-month or 6-month industry placement in pharmaceutical, medical device, life science and/ or regulatory organisation. Students will also have the option to undertake a research project, where they will work closely with experts in a specialised area of research to advance knowledge of human diseases, and explore therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of these conditions. In addition, Part B offers a range of coursework electives in interdisciplinary field of pioneering developments in biotechnology research and enterprise. Outcomes These course outcomes are aligned with the [Australian Qualifications Framework level 9 and Monash Graduate Attributes](http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/handbooks/alignmentofoutcomes.html)Australian Qualifications Framework level 9 and Monash Graduate Attributes ( [http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/handbooks/alignmentofoutcomes.html](http://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/handbooks/alignmentofoutcomes.html)). Upon successful completion of this this course, it is expected that you will be able to: - demonstrate mastery in theoretical knowledge in major contemporary fields of biotechnology and its applications - differentiate between the processes involved in the development, regulation, commercialisation and marketing of biotechnological products - identify the ethical issues relating to research and the research question in the field of biotechnology and where, appropriate, apply ethical principles to the conduct of research within this field - initiate new or innovative research informed approaches to resolving practical challenges within the field of medical biotechnology - demonstrate proficiency in laboratory based technologies and techniques fundamental to biotechnological research - critically appraise and interpret the implications of data arising from these technologies and techniques - plan, justify and implement research in the field of medical biotechnology - apply effective and strategic problem-solving, organisational and teamwork skills to the field of biotechnology - effectively implement and evaluate technological advancements in biotechnology within workplace settings. Structure The course is structured in two parts: Part A. Core Biotechnology studies and Part B. Application studies. All students complete Part A. Depending upon prior qualifications, you may receive credit for Part B. Note: If you are eligible for credit for prior studies you may elect not to receive the credit. Part A. Core biotechnology studies These studies present theoretical knowledge in key areas of biotechnology and its applications. You will gain a critical understanding of the designs and methods used in undertaking medical research, and the opportinities and challenges involved in the commercialisation of biotechnology. Part B. Application studies In these studies, you will focus on the application of advanced biotechnology practice. You will consolidate your skills, and knowledge and demonstrate your mastery through either a research project and/ or an industry placement program. Requirements The course comprises 96 points structured into two parts: Part A. Core Biotechnology (48 points) and Part B: Application Studies (48 points). If you are admitted at: - entry level 1 you complete 96 points, comprising Parts A and B. - entry level 2 you complete 48 points, comprising Part A.
