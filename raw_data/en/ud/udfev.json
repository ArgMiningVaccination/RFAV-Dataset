Whether your intention is to begin a career in herbalism or simply to support the health and well-being of yourself and those around you, there is one common thread that unites all plant healers: a deep desire to better understand nature and connect with the natural world. In our modern context, many of us initially feel called to herbal medicine through a personal health crisis, a deepening curiosity of the plants around us as we interact with nature via gardening or outdoor activities, or as a form of activism to keep alive the traditions and collective knowledge of our ancestors. As this inspiration develops, you may find yourself wondering where to begin. Here is a simple guide to help you as you step forth into the world of plant medicine. What is Herbalism? From a technical perspective, herbalism is the art and science of applying herbs for promoting health. It is often referred to as, and encompasses concepts of, Herbology, Herbal Medicine, Phytomedicine, Phytotherapy, and Phytopharmacology, among other names. It has persisted as the world's primary form of medicine since the beginning of time, with a written history more than 5,000 years old. From a more holistic perspective, herbalism is truly about the human-plant connection. It's an ever-evolving relationship to not only understand the \"medicinal value\" in herbs but to understand them in the greater context of the natural world and the interrelation of plants and human activity. It is in this journey of discovery that your love for the plants will lead you down your own unique path. What is an Herbalist? Generally speaking, herbalists are people who dedicate their lives to working with medicinal plants. This understanding of the medicinal aspects of plants may lead them to become traditional healers, clinical herbalists, scientists, naturopaths, holistic medical doctors, researchers, writers, herbal pharmacists, botanists, ethnobotanists, herbal medicine makers, wild crafters, herb growers, or midwives, to name a few. You might even find an herbalist in your family tree educated through passed down herbal traditions. How to \"Become\" an Herbalist? Plant medicine has been practiced throughout the world since the dawn of human-plant interaction; from wherever you hail, you will find a lineage of plant healers. In some cases, the path to becoming an herbalist rests in self-study and application of inherited traditions. In others, a more formalized herbal education program through an outside institution may be more appropriate. The first step in your herbal journey is determining whether you'd prefer to learn through self-study, apprenticeship or through formalized coursework on its own or as part of a larger accredited-degree program. You may also want to give some thought to herbal traditions or lineages you are interested in learning more about. Here in North America, some of the most prevalent and accessible traditional herbal studies programs are Western Herbalism, Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine.
