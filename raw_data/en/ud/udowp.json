Syringomyelia (SM)(Sear-In-Go-My-Eel-Ya) SM, is a chronic disorder of the spinal cord, which consists of the formation of a syrinx (a pocket of cerebral-spinal fluid), sometimes referred to as a cyst or lesion inside the spinal cord cavity. This cavity enlarges over time and causes more damage and deterioration to the nerve centers of the spinal cord because of the pressure from the fluid. As it widens, it compresses and injures nerve fibers that carry information from the brain to the extremities. SM is sometimes progressively degenerative and typically has a slow onset, however, symptoms can rapidly progress due to strain or trauma to the spine, such as a car accident or heavy lifting. It can easily yield very painful neurological symptoms of varying intensities at varying times. This damage results in pain, weakness, muscle stiffness, and numbness in the back, shoulders, arms, or legs. People with syringomyelia experience different combinations of symptoms. Symptoms may include: Is there treatment? - Headaches - loss of muscle mass - loss of ability to use arms, legs and back - numbness or decreased feeling in arms, legs and back - pain in neck, shoulders, upper arms, and back - muscle spasms in back, legs and arms - RLS - Restless Leg Syndrome - weakness or decreased muscle strength in legs and arms - Uncoordinated movement - inability to feel extremes of hot or cold - Back stiffness - Loss of bladder To date, drugs have no curative value, except pain medication to help alleviate pain. Radiation is used rarely, as it also has no curative value, unless a tumor is present. Most surgeons recommend surgery if symptoms are interfering with a person's quality of life. A syrinx cannot be removed from the spinal cord since it is embedded. There are several types of surgery depending on what type of syrinx is present. The first type involves placing a shunt, a small tube, inside the syrinx in an attempt to drain it. The statistics show that some people may have temporary relief, some have no relief and some have worse pain. Another problem with this surgery is that it is short-lived, often repeated and not even suitable for some people. The decision to use a shunt requires extensive discussions between the surgeon and patient as it carries the risks of injury to the spinal cord, blockage, infections, and/or hemorrhage. Surgeons usually consider shunts a last resort. Many people actually have tumors on injury sites. If a tumor is causing syringomelia, then the recommended treatment is tumor removal. When the tumor is removed, this almost always eliminates the syrinx. Some people have trauma-related syringomyelia, where surgery is performed at the initial injury site. This type of surgery is performed outside the spinal cord. Surgeons expand the area around the spinal cord and remove scar tissue. In some cases, surgeons may pierce the syrinx to drain it. My holistic approach to treatment Quantum Reflex Analysis (QRA) Testing QRA is a testing program that shows the location of your body's deficiencies based on medically accepted acupuncture meridian points. These points represent different organs. When these organs show a deficiency, we use strong and organic supplements the body needs for healing. Some theories with syringomyelia state the body is in a deep state of infection. We can test directly on the syrinx to find those infections. Your QRA practitioner will ask you to bring in a very small amount of your first-morning urine (before eating, drinking or exercise), so we can check your pH. We will also go over diet and give you a booklet filled with important health information to bring your body back to a healthy state. Medi-Body Pack Detox System A key factor overlooked in literally every disease is hidden, deep-seated toxicity in the ground substance of the body (i.e. the external meridians and connective tissue) which prevents normal nerve and chi (energy flow). These embedded toxins can mean years of delayed healing - or none at all. Detoxifying is one of the most important parts to healing. If you have had surgeries, piercing, injections, tattoos, burns, sprains, burns, falls, whiplash, radiation, surgically added metal objects, or dental work of all kinds, Premier Medi-Body Packs will safely detox those areas of trauma. Premier Medi-Body Packs promote cleansing and bio-energetic flow. They contain quantum-state \"mud\" comprised of unheated volcanic clay, peat magma, Indian shilajit, which initiates a deep intrinsic cleansing effect. When applied externally, these packs draw out deeply embedded toxins from operation sites, injury sites, the colon, interference sites, the organs, sinus areas and more. It quickly eliminates buildup of hidden toxins, helps increase circulation, boosts the immune system, eases muscle tension/pain, and rejuvenates cells.

My name Lisa and I have syringomyelia. Like many others, I have had it for quite some time, but I was recently diagnosed on February 8, 2013. I had an MRI the week before and expected to hear that I had a herniated disk. I was shocked to hear that I had syringomyelia, a lesion that only 41,000 other people in the United States have been diagnosed with.The size of my syrinx is 1.6 inches by \u00bd inch wide. I suffered for the last three years with severe back pain. Syringomyelia brings a new meaning to pain; only those afflicted understand. Most of the pain is constant; meaning you go to bed and wake up with it. Most days, my pain was a ten. Nothing seemed to help and many things irritated it. I used to lay on tennis balls three times a day just to try to get some relief. Natural approach to recovery I am the owner of a holistic health center and I have chosen a natural approach to Syringomyelia. My diet consists of mostly fresh fruits and vegetables, a quart of homemade green juice every day, raw nuts and raw bars. Twice a week, I add wild-caught salmon and wild-caught cod for a good source of protein. No alcohol, no cigarettes, no fast foods, and no processed foods. If you are serious about healing, then you HAVE to give up the toxins. Using my QRA skills to heal I have trained under a company called Premier Research Labs and became a Quantum Reflex Analysis (QRA) practitioner in 2009. Once I became ill, I took a deep look at my lifetime of trauma; car accidents, surgeries, and extreme stress-related experiences. I used a detox form and charted all of the accidents, scars from surgeries and vaccination sites from my entire lifetime. I have learned that my syringomyelia is a very deep infection. I decided I needed to pull out all the infection from all the toxic places in my body, including my teeth. If you have a mouth full of mercury or root canals, you will need to see a holistic dentist that can safely remove the toxicity. Our bodies are an incredible healing machine and with a little help boosting the immune system, they can heal from almost anything. Dental problems are more complicated. Unfortunately, once an infection lodges inside the gums it is there to stay until safely removed. Below you will find a toxic DNA report of one of my root canal removals. You will notice there were 15 infections present; five of my infections are a serious risk. "}
