Relieving tiredness For the summer, I am away from Dholanji, attending a Bon meditation retreat. I am very grateful for all of the support given to the essential oils project at Menri Monastery. Monks and staff at the monastery put in long hours and many come to me for tiredness. I would like to share with you the essential oils treatment that I use: To relieve tiredness / asthenia: balsam fir (5 drops) peppermint (8 drops) pine (pinus sylvestris) (10 drops) spruce (15 drops) add to 7 ml grapeseed oil. Apply this blend topically on the lower back each morning for 7 days or more. Those who have used it find it very helpful.

In the last three months, the essential oils healer has treated 25 patients. They included monks, nuns and visitors to the monastery. He made 35 visits to see the patients and there were 23 visits where the patients came to see him. The healer writes: \"The symptoms were mainly due to cold or flu (rhinitis, runny or stuffed nose, headache, cough, sore throat, fever, mouth sores) but less so than previous years. Some patients also had symptoms of back pain, back ache, sciatica, knee or leg pain, bone pain, burns, cuts, small wounds, skin boils, indigestion or food poisoning, and a few had congested chest (due to stress), asthenia, lack of energy, numbness in legs, restlessness and anxiety, giardia intestinal parasite.\" \"Remedies I provided ranged from essential oil blends (home-made and ready-made: to inhale, to ingest, for massage), to homeopathy (single or multi ingredients), to vitamins (single or multi), aspirin and paracetamol, and to general advice on diet and living habits.\" One of the essential oil blends that he uses is the following: To relieve indigestion: basil (2 drops) lemon (1 drop) peppermint (1 drop) total: 4 drops, on a small piece of biscuit that you place under your tongue and ingest slowly. Take 3 times per day (before meals), for one to two days.
