With recent reports of cats and dogs being able to contract infectious viruses such as coronavirus, respiratory health and immune-boosting formulas that can help protect our fluffy loved ones have been all the rage lately. Tailor made for specific health needs, the new ProVet pet supplement line so far comprises eight products and is split between those meant for cats and those for dogs \u2014 although, some products that can be used by both species. Developed by Wai Yuen Tong, ProVet has naturally incorporated traditional Chinese ingredients like shiitake extract, longan fruits and premium Chinese herbal ingredients such as lingzhi mushrooms and cordyceps fungi in their supplements.
