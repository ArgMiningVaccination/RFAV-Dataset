It is at the same time a very common and complex issue. While the causes can be genetic and environmental, research has demonstrated that ovarian cysts' development can be \"related to other endocrine and metabolic abnormalities, such as obesity, hirsutism, acne, diabetes, insulin resistance, and glucose impairment\" (Zeng et al., 2022). Western medical treatment options are costly and often cause significant side effects, and many patients turn to alternative treatment options. Homeopathy for Ovarian Cyst Homeopathic treatment of ovarian cysts has shown a lot of promise (Chakma & Sarangi, 2019), but classical homeopathy is individualized, and its effectiveness may vary from person to person, rather than depending on the disorder as it is defined by modern western medicine (Fisher, 2012). Acupuncture for Ovarian Cyst Acupuncture has also demonstrated effectiveness in reduction of ovarian cysts' size and proliferation (Chen et al., 2021), but a modern acupuncture modality electroacupuncture has shown even more promise, \"resulting in relief of symptoms, as well as a decrease in the size of follicular cysts\" (L\u00f3pez, Ortiz, Castro, & Lara, 2022). Acupuncture, apparently, can even treat infertility caused by ovarian cysts (Wang, Xia, Li, Sun, & Fang, 2022). Herbal Medicine for Ovarian Cyst Herbal medicine can also be effective in treatment of ovarian cysts (Choudhary et al., 2019). All these natural remedies for ovarian cyst treatment come from individualized, holistic traditions, and their efficacy can differ from person to person, rather than a diagnosis. From the western scientific standpoint, because of the complexity of the mechanisms that cause ovarian cyst, many various methods can effectively disrupt its progress.
