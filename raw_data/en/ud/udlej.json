{"title": "Gastrointestinal Complications of COVID-19 Vaccines", "author": "Kunal Ajmera; Rashika Bansal; Heather Wilkinson; Lokesh Goyal", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Much of the control over the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been achieved by mass vaccination against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent that causes COVID-19. The COVID-19 mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccines are relatively newly approved and have been widely used in the US since they first became available. However, with passing time, data regarding adverse events associated with the mRNA vaccines have become clearer. Vaccines are safe in general, and the benefits outweigh the risks of adverse events. In this case report, we present the first documented case report of post-vaccination acute diverticulitis and colon micro-perforation following Moderna booster dose (Moderna Inc, Cambridge, USA) in a young adult. Vaccine recipients should be educated on vaccine-associated gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. We also recommend that vaccine recipients with pre-existing GI disorders should be carefully monitored for the worsening of pre-existing conditions post-COVID-19 vaccination.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2022-04-12", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
