Once I found out about the [Think Dirty app](http://www.thinkdirtyapp.com/), I scanned all of my beauty and personal care products to see how dirty or clean they were. Any guesses on the results? Natural Beauty Products, Made in USA You can use the app to look up what chemicals are in your products, and the side effects that they cause. I ended up throwing away over 90 percent of my products, and I had to replace them with natural beauty product alternatives. I was more interested in finding products with clean ingredients than basing my decisions on the number rating from the app. Some products could have a low (good) rating but still have hidden dirty ingredients. The app isn't perfect, but it's a great place to start if you're looking to use non-toxic beauty products. You can also check the [Environmental Working Group](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/) (EWG) to see how products rank. Why You Need Natural Beauty Products You Can Trust Our skin is our body's largest organ, and whatever we put on our skin is entering our bloodstream.
