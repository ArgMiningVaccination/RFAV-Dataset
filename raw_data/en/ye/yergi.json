It has a long history as a powerful healing tool. Literally translated homeopathy means \"same suffering\" and uses the premise of \"like cures like\" to match an individual to a remedy. The homeopathic doctor takes a very detailed history to get a full picture of the patient's symptoms (suffering) then selects the single homeopathic remedy to balance the total symptom picture. Traditional homeopaths like Dr. Bohlmann will always use one remedy at a time as Dr. Hahnemann did because this is the only way to know what the medicine is actually doing for the patient. The remedies are created using nano-particles of natural substances and delivered to the patient using a sugar pellet. Although homeopathy isn't the only healing modality used at Advantage Integrative Health, we welcome patients who wish to explore homeopathy as part of their healing journey. "}
