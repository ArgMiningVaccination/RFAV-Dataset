There is no evidence that this is true or that homeopathy can treat or cure any medical condition. This comes from the [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/homeopathy) Homeopathy is a specific form of alternative medicine. It draws on the idea that taking a very small amount of a substance that would cause symptoms in a healthy person can treat someone with a disease. Its principles counter what scientists know about the human body. Homeopathy is different from holistic medicine. Holistic medicine involves taking a person's whole self into account. A holistic approach to NHL might involve treatments to target the cancer itself, alongside support for someone's [mental health](/articles/154543) and [nutrition](/articles/160774). This article explores whether homeopathy can help with NHL, its risks, and other complementary therapies that people may wish to consider. Homeopathy is a type of alternative medicine, which originated in Germany in the [late 1700s](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-drug-class/homeopathic-products) The second principle is the \"law of infinitesimals.\" This means that the more diluted a substance becomes, the more potent it is. Proponents of homeopathy [believe that](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/homeopathy) the practice works by initiating or activating the body's natural immune or healing process. However, the [NICCH](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/homeopathy) Homeopathic remedies can contain many substances, from relatively harmless plants to poisonous substances or animals. Despite the large number of clinical trials investigating the potential of homeopathic remedies, there is [no conclusive evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7253376/) [placebo](/articles/306437) for any condition. NHL [refers to](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/non-hodgkin-lymphoma/about/what-is-non-hodgkin-lymphoma.html) Treatment typically involves killing the cancerous cells with [chemotherapy](/articles/158401) or radiation. Sometimes, it may also involve monoclonal antibody therapy, which helps the immune system kill cancer cells itself. Homeopathy is unlikely to have the same effect as these treatments due to how diluted the remedies are. There are case studies that appear positive. In one German case study from [2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7365555/) The researchers say that, when they removed the affected lymph node and looked at it under a microscope, there was no evidence of a [tumor](/articles/249141). However, this does not necessarily mean homeopathy cured the cancer. Spontaneous remission of NHL is possible, although it is rare. Case studies from [2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214541915000176) and [2017](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/crihem/2017/2676254/) record instances where NHL patients got better without treatment. Additionally, the study does not prove that the hemlock was responsible for the improvement, and it only focuses on one individual. Only larger-scale trials can provide evidence a treatment works reliably and is safe. It is unclear if homeopathy can truly relieve NHL symptoms. Currently, it seems likely that people who report feeling better after using homeopathic remedies are experiencing the placebo effect. However, the placebo effect can still be beneficial. It may appear to reduce symptoms or make it easier for people to cope with them. Some may find homeopathy helps them feel more in control of what is happening to them, which may also help with the psychological impact of the disease. According to [Cancer Research UK](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/homeopathy), some small studies have explored whether homeopathy can help relieve side effects associated with cancer treatment. None have provided enough evidence to be conclusive. Homeopathy carries some risks. Although they intend to contain extremely diluted concentrations of active ingredients, some homeopathic products may contain much higher levels of active ingredients that can cause harm. These include: - toxic plants, such as nightshade - heavy metals, such as arsenic - substances that can interact with medications Furthermore, the [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-drug-class/homeopathic-products) Homeopathic products may not contain what they say they do. The FDA has previously issued statements about brands recalling their products due to contamination by bacteria and the possible presence of unlisted [antibiotics](/articles/10278). There is also a significant risk in avoiding standard medical treatments in favor of homeopathic products. This approach risks the cancer progressing. [No complementary therapy](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/tips/things-you-need-to-know-about-cancer-and-complementary-health-approaches) Complementary health approaches the NICCH and [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/treatment-types/complementary-and-integrative-medicine/complementary-and-alternative-methods-and-cancer/which-methods-are-likely-safe.html) Homeopathy is an alternative therapy that is controversial in the scientific community. There is no evidence that it can treat any medical condition, including NHL. However, it may help some people feel more in control of their treatment. Through the placebo effect, it may also impact their symptoms or treatment side effects. It is vital for people to discuss homeopathic remedies with a doctor before taking them, as some contain ingredients that may interact with medications. It is also essential for people not to rely on homeopathy alone to treat cancer. "}
