Format: The course provides an introduction to the field of CAM and integrative health -care, including a wide range of alternative modalities, in lecture -and-discussion format, presented by an active practitioner of the therapy and/or a person knowledgeable in the field, with patient presentations, demonstrations a nd audience participation where applicable. Presentations cover diagnostic methods, treatment, evidence of efficacy and safety for various conditions, training of practitioners, the practitioner -patient relationship, patient satisfaction, role of preventi on, and potential for interactions with conventional healthcare. Topical readings supplement lectures and demonstrations.
